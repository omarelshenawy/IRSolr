				"after": "The castle comprises three circular towersâthe Keep, the Kitchen Tower and the Well Towerâalong with the Hall Block, the Gatehouse and a shell wall; the buildings almost entirely encase the original motte in stone.[76] The older parts of the castle are constructed from crudely laid red sandstone rubble and grey limestone, the 19th-century additions in more precisely cut red Pennant sandstone.[33][77] A ditch is cut out of the rock in front of the Gatehouse and leads to an eastern approach road.[78] The castle is surrounded by woodland and the 19th-century vineyards below it have been converted into a golf course.[46] In 1850, George Clark recorded an \"outer court\" of which nothing remains; this may, in fact, have been the traces of the earlier lime kiln operations around the site.[79]",
