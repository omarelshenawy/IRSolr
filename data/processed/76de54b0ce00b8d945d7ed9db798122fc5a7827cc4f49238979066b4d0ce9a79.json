				"previous": "The University of Bremen, founded in 1971, is one of 11 institutions classed as an \"Elite university\" in Germany, and teaches approximately 23,500 people from 126 countries.",
				"after": "Bremen lies on both sides of the River Weser, about 60 kilometres upstream of its estuary on the North Sea and its transition to the Outer Weser by Bremerhaven. Opposite Bremen's Altstadt is the point where the \"Middle Weser\" becomes the \"Lower Weser\" and, from the area of Bremen's port, the river has been made navigable to ocean-going vessels. The region on the left bank of the Lower Weser, through which the Ochtum flows, is the Weser Marshes, the landscape on its right bank is part of the Elbe-Weser Triangle. The Lesum, and its tributaries, the WÃ¼mme and Hamme, the SchÃ¶nebecker Aue and Blumenthaler Aue, are the downstream tributaries of the Weser.",
