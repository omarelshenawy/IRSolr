				"previous": "The 2005 census reported that the \"non-ethnic population\", consisting of whites and mestizos (those of mixed white European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population. About 49% of Colombia's population is Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 37% is of European ancestry (predominantly Spanish, and a part of Italian, French, and German) and of Middle Eastern ancestry. 10.6% is of African ancestry. Indigenous Amerindians comprise 3.4% of the population. 0.01% of the population are Roma.[2]",
				"after": "Many of the Indigenous peoples experienced a reduction in population during the Spanish rule [199] and many others were absorbed into the mestizo population, but the remainder currently represents over eighty distinct cultures. Reserves (resguardos) established for indigenous peoples occupy 30,571,640 hectares (305,716.4Â km2) (27% of the country's total) and are inhabited by more than 800,000 people.[200] Some of the largest indigenous groups are the Wayuu,[198] the Paez, the Pastos, the EmberÃ¡ and the ZenÃº.[201] The departments of La Guajira, Cauca, NariÃ±o, CÃ³rdoba and Sucre have the largest indigenous populations.[1]",
