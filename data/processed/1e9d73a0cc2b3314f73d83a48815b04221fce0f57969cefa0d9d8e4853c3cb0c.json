Steven Runciman, greatest of 20th century crusade historians, would write in 1954: \"There was never a greater crime against humanity than the Fourth Crusade.\"[56] The destruction by sack or subsequent neglect of the city's secular architecture in particular has left us with an imperfect understanding of Byzantine art.",
