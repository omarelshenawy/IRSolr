The Han Chinese appointee was required to do the substantive work and the Manchu to ensure Han loyalty to Qing rule.[74] The distinction between Han Chinese and Manchus extended to their court costumes. During the Qianlong Emperor's reign, for example, members of his family were distinguished by garments with a small circular emblem on the back, whereas Han officials wore clothing with a square emblem.",
