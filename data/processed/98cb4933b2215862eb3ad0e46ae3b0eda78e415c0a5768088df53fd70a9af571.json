				"The state's capital is Sacramento.",
				"California is organized into three branches of government â the executive branch consisting of the Governor and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate; and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts. The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification. Before the passage of California Proposition 14 (2010), California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote. After June 8, 2010 when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the U.S. President and county central committee offices,[167] all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party.[168] At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.[168] If at a special primary election, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held.[168]"
