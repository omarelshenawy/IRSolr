				"previous": "In the 1990s, Australia began forming a need for an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft. In 1996, Australia issued a request for proposal (RFP) for the aircraft for the RAAF under Project Wedgetail.[2] In 2000, Australia awarded Boeing Integrated Defense Systems a contract to supply four AEW&C aircraft with options for three additional aircraft.[citation needed]",
				"after": "The 737 AEW&C is based on Boeing Business Jet 1; a 737-700IGW airframe variant of the Boeing 737 Next Generation, roughly similar to the 737-700ER. The aircraft uses the Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar. The L-band (1 to 2Â GHz) electronically scanned AEW and surveillance radar is located on a dorsal fin on top of the fuselage, dubbed the \"top hat\", and is designed for minimal aerodynamic effect. The radar is capable of simultaneous air and sea search, fighter control and area search, with a maximum range of over 600Â km (look-up mode). When operating in look-down mode against fighter-sized target, the maximum range is in excess of 370Â km. When used against maritime targets, the maximum range is over 240Â km for frigate-sized targets. MESA is capable of simultaneously tracking 180 targets and conducting 24 intercepts. In addition, the radar antenna array is also doubled as an ELINT array, with a maximum range of over 850Â km at 9,000 meter altitude.[3] The 10.8Â m long by 3.4Â m high antenna assembly incorporates 7.3Â m long by 2.7Â m high Side-Emitting Electronic Manifold array, with the top hat supporting array providing 120Â° coverage on port and starboard side, while the top hat array itself provides 60Â° fore and aft, thus providing a complete 360Â° coverage. The radar's beam can be set for a 2Â° to 8Â° width, while scan duration can be set from 3Â s to 40Â s. Radar signal processing equipment and central computer are installed directly below the antenna array.[4]",
