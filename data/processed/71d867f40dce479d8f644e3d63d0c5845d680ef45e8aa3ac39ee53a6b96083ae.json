				"after": "The airline was established on 25 March 1994, and started operations in April that year with flights from Kyiv to Athens, Larnaca, Tel Aviv, Odesa and Thessaloniki in co-operation with Air Ukraine. October the same year, the carrier started dry-leasing some Boeing 737-200s in connection with the addition of Moscow into the route network.[5] In 1995, new scheduled flights from Kyiv to Almaty, Ashgabad, and Riga were launched, laying the foundations for it to become a transit airline. In 1996, Yekaterinburg, Kharkiv, Lviv, and Simferopol were added to the airline's network. Also in 1996, the airline became a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).[6] By 1997 Aerosvit Airlines became a member of IATA Clearing House and purchased its first Boeing 737-200 aircraft. By 1999 Aerosvit had acquired a third Boeing 737-200 aircraft and scheduled flights to Budapest, Sofia and Istanbul were launched.",
