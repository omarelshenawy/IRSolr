				"A high specific thrust engine has a high jet velocity by definition, as the following approximate equation for net thrust implies:[1]",
				"The next generation of Supersonic transport (SST) may require some form of VCE. SST engines require a high Specific Thrust (net thrust/airflow) at supersonic cruise to keep the cross-sectional area of the powerplant to a minimum, so as to reduce aircraft drag. Unfortunately, this implies a high jet velocity not only at supersonic cruise, but at take-off, which makes the aircraft noisy."
