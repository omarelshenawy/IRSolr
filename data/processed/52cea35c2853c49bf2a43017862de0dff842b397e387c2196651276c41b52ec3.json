				"previous": "The specific epithet marginata is derived from the Latin word for \"margin\" or \"edge\",[11] while autumnalis means \"of the autumn\".[12] Common names of the species include the \"marginate Pholiota\" (resulting from its synonymy with Pholiota marginata),[13] \"funeral bell\",[14] \"deadly skullcap\", and \"deadly Galerina\". G.Â autumnalis was known as the \"fall Galerina\" or the \"autumnal Galerina\", while G.Â venenata was the \"deadly lawn Galerina\".[15][16]",
				"after": "The cap reaches 1.7 to 4Â cm (0.67 to 1.57Â in) in diameter. It starts convex, sometimes broadly conical, and has edges (margins) that are curved in against the gills. As the cap grows and expands, it becomes broadly convex and then flattened, sometimes developing a central elevation, or umbo, which may project prominently from the cap surface.[13]",
