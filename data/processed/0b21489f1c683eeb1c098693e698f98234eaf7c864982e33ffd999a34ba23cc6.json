Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American among them, discovered the role of pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals. CÃ©sar Milstein did extensive research in antibodies. Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in metabolizing carbohydrates. Argentine research has led to the treatment of heart diseases and several forms of cancer. Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first artificial heart successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. RenÃ© Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world's first ever coronary bypass surgery.",
