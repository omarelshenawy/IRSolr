				"after": "Education in Gibraltar generally follows the English model, operating within a three tier system. Schools in Gibraltar use the Key Stage modular approach to teach the National Curriculum. Gibraltar has 15 state schools, a private school and a college of further education. As there are no facilities in Gibraltar for full-time higher education (although a university has been proposed), all Gibraltarian students study elsewhere at degree level or its equivalent and also for certain non-degree courses.[71] A university for the territory is currently under planning. The Government of Gibraltar operates a scholarship/grant system to provide funding for students studying in the United Kingdom. All Gibraltarian students used to follow the UK student loans procedure, applying for a loan from the Student Loans Company which was then reimbursed in full by the Government of Gibraltar. In August 2010, this system was replaced by the direct payment by the government of grants and tuition fees. The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians continue their studies at university level.",
