However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the UK, Japan, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling. They also appear in some public transport applications, such as Google's General Transit Feed Specification file format and some ticketing systems (e.g. in Copenhagen). This usage prevents a time period reported without dates from appearing to end before its beginning, e.g. 21:00â01:00.",
