				"previous": "In October 2012, the Council of Ministers issued a \"Common policy for external relations\"[12] that noted \"that it is not Government policy to seek independence from the United Kingdom, but rather to ensure that Jersey is prepared if it were in the best interests of Islanders to do so\". On the basis of the established principles the Council of Ministers decided to \"ensure that Jersey is prepared for external change that may affect the Islandâs formal relationship with the United Kingdom and/or European Union\".",
				"after": "Jersey is an island measuring 118.2 square kilometres[4] (66,436 vergÃ©e[4] Â / 44.87Â sqÂ mi), including reclaimed land and intertidal zone.
