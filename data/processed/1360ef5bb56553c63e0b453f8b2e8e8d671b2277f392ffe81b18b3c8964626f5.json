				"previous": "In 2007 JetBlue was also facing reliability problems with its Embraer 190 fleet. For a couple months JetBlue contracted ExpressJet to operate four Embraer 145 regional jets on behalf of JetBlue. While this was going on two E-190 aircraft at a time were sent to an Embraer maintenance facility in Nashville, TN.[15] ExpressJet operated routes between Boston Logan and Buffalo, NY and Washington Dulles and between New York JFK and Columbus, OH and Richmond, VA.[16]",
				"after": "On May 10, 2007, David Barger was appointed as CEO, who also retained the position of President. Neeleman, who was named non-executive Chairman of the Board, said \"This is a natural evolution of our leadership structure as JetBlue continues to grow. As Chairman of the Board of Directors, I will focus on developing JetBlue's long-term vision and strategy and how we can continue to be a preferred product in a commodity business.\"[17]",
