				"after": "The spore print is whitish. The spores are roughly spherical, translucent (hyaline), and typically measure 7.5â10.0 by 7.5â9.0Â Âµm.[33] The spore surface is reticulateâcovered with ridges that form a complete network. The ridges are up to 0.8Â Âµm high and have conspicuous projections up to 1.2Â Âµm high. The spore-bearing cells of the hymenium, the basidia, are club-shaped, hyaline, four-spored, and have dimensions of 40â62 by 7.2â10.4Â Âµm.[34] Interspersed among the basidia are sterile cells called cystidia. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the side of a gill) are roughly spindle- to club-shaped, and measure 48â145 by 5â13Â Âµm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of a gill) may be spindle-, club-, or awl-shaped (subulate), or intermediate in between these forms, and measure 27â60 by 5â7Â Âµm.[2] Additionally, there are cystidia present on both the surface of the cap and the stem.[30] If a drop of ferric sulphate (used as a chemical test in mushroom identification) is applied to the mushroom flesh, it will immediately stain dark bluish-green.[33]",
