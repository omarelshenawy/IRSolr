				"previous": "The ring-tailed lemur is a relatively large lemur. Its average weight is 2.2 kilograms (4.9Â lb).[19] Its headâbody length ranges between 39 and 46Â cm (15 and 18Â in), its tail length is 56 and 63Â cm (22 and 25Â in), and its total length is 95 and 110Â cm (37 and 43Â in).[3][19] Other measurements include a hind foot length of 102 and 113Â mm (4.0 and 4.4Â in), ear length of 40 and 48Â mm (1.6 and 1.9Â in), and cranium length of 78 and 88Â mm (3.1 and 3.5Â in).[3]",
				"after": "The species has a slender frame and narrow face, fox-like muzzle.[3] The ring-tailed lemur's trademarkâa long, bushy tailâis ringed in alternating black and white transverse stripes, numbering 12 or 13Â white rings and 13 or 14Â black rings, and always ending in a black tip.[3][23] The total number of rings nearly matches the approximate number of caudal vertebrae (~25).[24] Its tail is longer than its body[23] and is not prehensile. Instead, it is only used for balance, communication, and group cohesion.[19]",
