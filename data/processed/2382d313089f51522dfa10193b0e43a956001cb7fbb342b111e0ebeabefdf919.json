				"previous": "In 1952, the University of California became an entity separate from the Berkeley campus. Each campus was given relative autonomy and its own Chancellor. Then-president Sproul assumed presidency of the entire University of California system, and Clark Kerr became the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley.[27]",
				"after": "Berkeley gained a reputation for student activism in the 1960s with the Free Speech Movement in 1964,[33] and opposition to the Vietnam War. In the highly publicized People's Park protest in 1969, students and the school conflicted over use of a plot of land; the National Guard was called in and violence erupted.[33][34] Modern students at Berkeley are less politically active, with a greater percentage of moderates and conservatives.[35][36] Democrats outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of 9:1.[37]",
