				"previous": "During his sanity hearing, things look bleak for Deeds, especially since he initially refuses to defend himself. Cedar even gets Deeds' Mandrake Falls tenantsâeccentric elderly sisters Jane and Amy Faulkner (Margaret Seddon and Margaret McWade)âto testify that Deeds is \"pixilated,\" meaning odd like a pixie. That charge falls apart when the two spinsters, when questioned as to who else is pixilated, reply, \"Why everyone, but us.\" After Babe convinces Deeds that she truly loves him, he systematically punches holes in Cedar's caseâbefore actually punching Cedar in the faceâand the judge declares him to be \"the sanest man who ever walked into this courtroom.\"[4]",
