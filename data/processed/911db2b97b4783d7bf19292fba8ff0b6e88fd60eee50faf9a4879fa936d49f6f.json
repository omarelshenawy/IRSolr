Interstate Highways are numbered in a gridâeven-numbered routes are eastâwest routes (the lowest numbers are along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico), and odd-numbered routes are northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean). US Highways are also numbered in a gridâeven numbered for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). For this reason, mainline (two-digit) Interstate Highways in Maryland all have numbers between 81 and 97 for north-south routes and between 68 and 70 for east-west routes. In addition, mainline US Highways all have numbers between 1 and 29 for north-south routes and between 40 and 50 for east-west routes. Three-digit Interstate and U.S. Highways, also known as \"child routes,\" are branches off their main one- or two-digit \"parents\". The Interstate and US Highways are generally maintained by the SHA, with some toll roads maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MdTA) and some roads maintained by municipalities, including most roads in the city of Baltimore. InterstateÂ 95 (I-95) and U.S. RouteÂ 40 (USÂ 40) are the longest examples in the state.",
