				"previous": "The Nimbus engines were produced in two main variants, the Mark 103/503 and the Mark 105/502. The Mark 103/503 is generally similar to the Mark 105/502 except that the former has a double-caliper disc brake incorporated in the output drive shaft to provide adequate braking of the helicopter's rotor in the high winds encountered over the deck of a fast moving ship, whereas the 105/502 has a single caliper unit.",
