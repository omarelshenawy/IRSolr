				"after": "Belize has a small, mostly privatised enterprise economy that is based primarily on export of petroleum and crude oil, agriculture, agro-based industry, and merchandising, with tourism and construction recently assuming greater importance.[49] It has yet to be seen if this will bring significant economic expansion. As of 2007, oil production was 3,000Â bbl/d (480Â m3/d) and as of 2006 oil exports were 1,960Â bbl/d (312Â m3/d). The country is also a producer of industrial minerals.[57] In agriculture, sugar, like in colonial times, remains the chief crop, accounting for nearly half of exports, while the banana industry is the populations's largest employer.[49]",
