				"after": "In 1951 restrictions for German air travellers were lifted and civil air traffic started to grow again. In 1952 Frankfurt Airport handled more than 400.000 passengers; a year later it was more than half a million. About 100 to 120 planes took off from and landed in Frankfurt daily. In 1955, Lufthansa finally recommenced their flights to and from Frankfurt and in the same year the Federal Republic of Germany gained its air sovereignty back from the Allies. In 1957 the northern runway was extended, first to 3,000Â m (9,843Â ft) and then to 3,900Â m (12,795Â ft), to make it compatible with jet aircraft.",
