				"previous": "Logan International Airport has 103 gate positions total[37] divided among four terminals, A, B, C, and E. All terminals are connected by pre-security shuttle buses, as well as between Terminals A, B and E via moving walkways pre-security.[38] Moving walkways also connect the terminals to a central parking garage designed for consolidated service between all 4 terminals and the garage itself.[39] Massport ultimately plans to connect all terminals and gates post-security allowing for seamless connections between flights.[40] The concession program at the airport is developed, leased and managed by AirMall USA (formerly BAA USA) in Terminals B and E and Westfield Concession Management Inc. in Terminals A and C.",
				"after": "Terminal A, which replaced a 1970s-era building designed by Minoru Yamasaki once occupied by the now-defunct Eastern Airlines,[41] opened to passengers on March 16, 2005. The terminal, designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum,[42] is divided into a main terminal (housing gates A1âA12) and a satellite building (housing gates A13âA22). The main terminal and the satellite building are connected through an underground walkway.[43] Terminal A was originally intended to be entirely occupied by Delta, however, Delta returned 11 of the gates to Massport for financial reasons. Terminal A features a Delta airline lounge (Delta Sky Club) on the third floor of the satellite building.[44]",
