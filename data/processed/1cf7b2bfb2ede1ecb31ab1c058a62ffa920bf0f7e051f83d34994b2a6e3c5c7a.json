				"previous": "The Guthrie Theater, the area's largest theater company, occupies a three-stage complex overlooking the Mississippi, designed by French architect Jean Nouvel.[82] The company was founded in 1963 as a prototype alternative to Broadway, and it produces a wide variety of shows throughout the year.[89] Minneapolis purchased and renovated the Orpheum, State, and Pantages Theatres vaudeville and film houses on Hennepin Avenue, which is now used for concerts and plays.[90] A fourth renovated theater, the former Shubert, joined with the Hennepin Center for the Arts to become the Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts, home to more than one dozen performing arts groups.[91][92] The city is home to Minnesota Fringe Festival, the largest nonjuried performing arts festival in the U.S.[93]",
