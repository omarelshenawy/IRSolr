				"The authalic (Greek for same area) latitude, Î¾, gives an area-preserving transformation to a sphere.",
				"defines a projection from the ellipsoid to the sphere such that all meridians have true length and uniform scale. The sphere may then be projected to the plane with an equirectangular projection to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale. An example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the Equidistant conic projection. (Snyder, Section 16).[10] The rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the Transverse Mercator projection."
