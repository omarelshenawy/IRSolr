				"after": "In the spring of 1912, in search of a change from his unrewarding clerical job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket.[34] He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, he would be able to finance his winter studies of music and literature.[35] His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional,[n 3] and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright.[37][38] Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: \"Because of Alington I call myselfÂ ... an old Salopian\".[39] Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea.[40] In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.[41]",
