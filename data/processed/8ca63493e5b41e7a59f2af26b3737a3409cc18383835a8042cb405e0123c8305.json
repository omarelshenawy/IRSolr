				"previous": "A population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520â1535 period was obtained by counting the households in Ottoman tithe registers, and multiplying this number by 5.[134] For unclear reasons, the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century.[135] An estimate of 7,230,660 for the first census held in 1831 is considered a serious undercount, as this census was meant only to register possible conscripts.[134]",
				"after": "Censuses of Ottoman territories only began in the early 19th century. Figures from 1831 onwards are available as official census results, but the censuses did not cover the whole population. For example, the 1831 census only counted men and did not cover the whole empire.[57][134] For earlier periods estimates of size and distribution of the population are based on observed demographic patterns.[136]",
