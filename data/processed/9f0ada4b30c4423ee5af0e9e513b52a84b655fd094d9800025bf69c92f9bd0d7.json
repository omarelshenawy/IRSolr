				"after": "Gobrecht's death in July 1844 left the United States Bureau of the Mint (generally, \"Mint\") without a chief engraver. Among those who hoped for appointment were Philadelphia banknote engraver Charles Welsh, and Allen Leonard, who had modeled the Mint's medal for former president John Quincy Adams. Through the influence of Senator Calhoun, however, Longacre secured the appointment. According to coin historian Don Taxay, Longacre did not attempt to gain the support of Mint Director Robert M. Patterson in seeking the appointment from President John Tyler, and \"if Patterson resented the slight, however, he was more annoyed by Leonard's importunities.\"[9]",
