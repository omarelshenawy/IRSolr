				"after": "The Lockheed HC-130 is an extended-range, search and rescue (SAR) and combat search and rescue (CSAR) version of the C-130 Hercules transport. The HC-130H and HC-130J versions are operated by the United States Coast Guard in a SAR and maritime reconnaissance role. The HC-130P Combat King and HC-130J Combat King II models are operated by the United States Air Force for long-range SAR and CSAR. The USAF variants also execute on scene CSAR command and control, airdrop pararescue forces and equipment, and are also capable of providing aerial refueling to appropriately equipped helicopters in flight. In this latter role, they are primarily used to extend the range and endurance of combat search and rescue helicopters.",
