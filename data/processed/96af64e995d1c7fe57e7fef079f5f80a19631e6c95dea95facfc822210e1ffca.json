				"previous": "In the year 960 the Song military had 378,000 enlisted soldiers.[208] Around the turn of the 11th century its size had grown to 900,000 soldiers, increasing to 1,000,000 by the year 1022, and well over 1,250,000 by 1041.[130][208][209] The overall expenses of upholding a military of this size consumed three-quarters of the state's entire annual revenue.[209] To lessen the expense, in 1069 the Chancellor Wang Anshi created the institution of local militias as supporting units.[130] In 1073, Wang Anshi created a new bureau of the central government called the Directorate of Weapons, which supervised the manufacture of armaments and ensured quality control.[210]",
