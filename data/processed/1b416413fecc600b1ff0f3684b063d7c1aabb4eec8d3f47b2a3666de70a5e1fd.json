Plebe knowledge is a lengthy collection of traditions, songs, poems, anecdotes, and facts about the academy, the army, the Old Corps, and the rivalry with Navy that all plebes must memorize during cadet basic training.[174][175][176] During plebe year, plebes may be asked, and are expected to answer, any inquiry about plebe knowledge asked by upper class cadets. Other knowledge is historical in nature, including information as found in Bugle Notes.[177] However, some knowledge changes daily, such as \"the days\" (a running list of the number of days until important academy events),[178] the menu in the mess hall for the day, or the lead stories in The New York Times.[177]",
