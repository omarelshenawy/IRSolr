				"after": "At the end of the 19th century, the owners of large estates, called latifundia, held most of the power in a land-based oligarchy. The landowners' power was unsuccessfully challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors.[10] In 1868, popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. In 1873, Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived First Spanish Republic was proclaimed.[11][12] After the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874,[13] Carlists and Anarchists emerged in opposition to the monarchy.[14][15] Alejandro Lerroux, Spanish politician and leader of the Radical Republican Party, helped bring republicanism to the fore in Catalonia, where poverty was particularly acute.[16] Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909.[17]",
