				"previous": "One of the best-known sauropods, Diplodocus was a very large long-necked quadrupedal animal, with a long, whip-like tail. Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hind limbs, resulting in a largely horizontal posture. The long-necked, long-tailed animal with four sturdy legs has been mechanically compared with a suspension bridge.[6] In fact, Diplodocus is the longest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton.[6] The partial remains of D. hallorum have increased the estimated length, though not as much as previously thought; when first described in 1991, discoverer David Gillette calculated it may have been up to 52Â m (170Â ft) long,[7] making it the longest known dinosaur (excluding those known from exceedingly poor remains, such as Amphicoelias). Some weight estimates ranged as high as 113 tons (125 US short tons). The estimated length was later revised downward to 33 metres (108Â ft)[8] based on findings that show that Gillette had originally misplaced vertebrae 12â19 as vertebrae 20â27. The nearly complete Diplodocus skeleton at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on which estimates of Seismosaurus are based, also was found to have had its 13th tail vertebra come from another dinosaur, throwing size estimates for Seismosaurus further off. While dinosaurs such as Supersaurus were probably longer, fossil remains of these animals are only fragmentary.[9] Modern mass estimates for Diplodocus (exclusive of D. hallorum) have tended to be in the 10 to 16Â tonne (11â17.6Â ton) range: 10Â tonnes (11Â tons);[10] 11.5 tonnes (12.7 tons);[11] 12.7Â tonnes (14Â tons);[12] and 16Â tonnes (17.6Â tons).[13]",
				"after": "Diplodocus had an extremely long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae,[14] which is almost double the number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). There has been speculation as to whether it may have had a defensive[15] or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function.[16] The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.[17]",
