Most routes are completely owned and maintained by the state; however, parts of some routes are maintained by local governments, such as a county or a city. Other routes, such as New York State RouteÂ 148 in Niagara County, are completely locally owned and maintained. The shield used for state routes is a simplified version of the Seal of New York. Roads that are maintained by the state but not assigned a state route designation carry a reference route designation, which is usually posted only on small, green reference markers alongside the highway.",
