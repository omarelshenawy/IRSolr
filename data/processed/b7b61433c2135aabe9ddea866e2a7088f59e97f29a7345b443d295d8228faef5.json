				"after": "Honouring tradition, upon the creation of the Bundeswehr in 1956, the mountain infantry returned as a distinctive arm of the West German army. Until 2001, they were organized as the 1. Gebirgsdivision, but this division was disbanded in a general reform. The successor unit is GebirgsjÃ¤gerbrigade 23 which has its headquarters in Bad Reichenhall. The battalions of these mountain infantry are deployed in southern Bavaria as this is the only high mountain area in Germany touching the Northern Alps. Since 2008 the unit is officially called \"GebirgsjÃ¤gerbrigade 23 Bayern (Bavaria)\" as a commendation of the close relationship between the state and the GebirgsjÃ¤ger.",
