				"previous": "In May 1831, upon his arrival in Mexican Texas, a part of northern Mexico at the time, Travis purchased land from Stephen F. Austin, who appointed him consul from the United States.[18] He set up a law practice in Anahuac and helped start a militia to oppose Mexican rule.[19] He subsequently became a pivotal figure in the Anahuac Disturbances and was imprisoned for his involvement.[18][20]",
				"after": "Travis was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of the Legion of Cavalry; and, he became the chief recruiting officer for a new regular Texan army.[18] Governor Henry Smith ordered Travis to raise a company of professional soldiers to reinforce the Texans who were then under the command of James C. Neill at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio.[21] Travis considered disobeying his orders, writing to Smith: \"I am willing, nay anxious, to go to the defense of Bexar, but sir, I am unwilling to risk my reputation ... by going off into the enemy's country with such little means, so few men, and with them so badly equipped.\"[22] James Bowie arrived at the Alamo with 30 men on January 19, 1836.[21] On February 3, Travis arrived in San Antonio with eighteen regulars as reinforcements. A compromise was reached between Bowie and Travis for command of the Alamo, with Bowie in command of the volunteers and Travis in command of the regulars.[20] When Bowie's health began to fail, it became irrelevant; and, Travis then became the official commander of the Alamo garrison.[21] On March 6, 1836, following a thirteen-day siege, Santa Anna ordered the assault on the Alamo during the predawn hours. Travis died fighting to the end; and, his remains were burned along with all the other Alamo defenders.[21]",
