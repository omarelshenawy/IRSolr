				"previous": "The source of the Nile is sometimes considered to be Lake Victoria, but the lake has feeder rivers of considerable size. The Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera and hence the most distant source of the Nile itself.[15] It is either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi,[16] or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.[17] The two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda-Tanzania border.",
				"after": "In 2010, an exploration party[18] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[19] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758Â km (4,199Â mi)",
