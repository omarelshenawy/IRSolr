				"after": "Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin oxide layer produced by anodising.[75] In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian â¬25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin,[76] and the 2006 Austrian â¬25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin.[77] The Austrian mint produced for Latvia a similar series of coins starting in 2004,[78] with one following in 2007.[79] In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mint started production of a $5 sterling silver and niobium coin named Hunter's Moon[80] in which the niobium was selectively oxidized, thus creating unique finishes where no two coins are exactly alike.",
