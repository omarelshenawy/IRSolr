				"Having LaTeX-based formulae in-line has the following drawbacks:",
				"If you find an article which indents lines with spaces in order to achieve some formula layout effect, you should convert the formula to LaTeX markup."
			],
			"after": [
				"HTML-generating formatting, as described below, is adequate for most simple in-line formulae and better for text-only browsers.",
				"Older versions of the MediaWiki software supported displaying simple LaTeX formulae as HTML rather than as an image. Although this is no longer an option, some formulae have formatting in them intended to force them to display as an image, such as an invisible quarter space (\\,) added at the end of the formula, or \\displaystyle at the beginning. Such formatting can be removed if a formula is edited and need not be added to new formulae."
