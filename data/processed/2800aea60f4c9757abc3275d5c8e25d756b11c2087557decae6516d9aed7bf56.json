				"previous": "Science fiction enthusiasts have noted the implications time dilation has on forward time travel, technically making it possible.[6]The Hafele and Keating experiment involved flying planes around the world with atomic clocks on board. Upon the trips completion the clocks were compared to a static, ground based atomic clock. It was found that 273+/-7 nanoseconds had been gained on the planes' clocks.[7] The current human time travel record is about 20 milliseconds for the cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev.[8]",
				"after": "Time dilation can be inferred from the observed fact of the constancy of the speed of light in all reference frames.[9][10][11][12]",
