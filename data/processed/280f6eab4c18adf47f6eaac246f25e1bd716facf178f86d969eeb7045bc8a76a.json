				"after": "India comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, and part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[112] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[112] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.[112] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[112] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[113] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[114] Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert.[115]",
