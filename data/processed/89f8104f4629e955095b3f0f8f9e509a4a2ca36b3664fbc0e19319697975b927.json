				"previous": "The extraction of peat from the Moors is known to have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained.[122] The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1â3Â feet (0.3â0.8Â m) over 100Â years.[123] Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.[6][124]",
