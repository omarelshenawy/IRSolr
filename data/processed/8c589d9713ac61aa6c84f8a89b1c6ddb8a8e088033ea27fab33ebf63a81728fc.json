				"previous": "A basis formed this way is called a canonical basis for the geometric algebra, and any other orthogonal basis for V will produce another canonical basis. Each canonical basis consists of 2n elements. Every multivector of the geometric algebra can be expressed as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements. If the canonical basis elements are {Bi | iâS} with S being an index set, then the geometric product of any two multivectors is",
			"after": [
				"A multivector may be decomposed with the grade-projection operator , which outputs the grade-r portion of A. As a result:",
				"As an example, the geometric product of two vectors since and and for i other than 0 and 2."
