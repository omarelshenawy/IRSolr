				"previous": "The MichelsonâMorley experiment was designed to detect second order effects of the \"aether wind\" â the motion of the aether relative to the earth. Michelson designed an instrument called the Michelson interferometer to accomplish this. The apparatus was more than accurate enough to detect the expected effects, but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881,[12] and again in 1887.[13] Although the failure to detect an aether wind was a disappointment, the results were accepted by the scientific community.[11] In an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm, Fitzgerald and Lorentz independently created an ad hoc hypothesis in which the length of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether.[14] This was the origin of FitzGeraldâLorentz contraction, and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis. The interpretation of the null result of the MichelsonâMorley experiment is that the round-trip travel time for light is isotropic (independent of direction), but the result alone is not enough to discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special relativity.[15][16]",
				"after": "While the MichelsonâMorley experiment showed that the velocity of light is isotropic, it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed (if at all) in different inertial frames. The KennedyâThorndike experiment was designed to do that, and was first performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike.[17] They obtained a null result, and concluded that \"there is no effect ... unless the velocity of the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its orbit\".[16][18] That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide an acceptable explanation, so from the null result of their experiment it was concluded that the round-trip time for light is the same in all inertial reference frames.[15][16]",
