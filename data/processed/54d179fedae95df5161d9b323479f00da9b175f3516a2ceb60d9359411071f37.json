				"after": "The 1972â73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific mobilised several groups, including some trade unions.[20] In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll.[21] In 1974 and 1975 this concern came to focus on uranium mining in Australia and several Friends of the Earth groups were formed.[20] The Australian Conservation Foundation also began voicing concern about uranium mining and supporting the activities of the grass-roots organisations. Concern about the environmental effects of uranium mining was a significant factor and poor management of waste at an early uranium mine, Rum Jungle, led it to become a significant pollution problem in the 1970s.[20] The Australian anti-nuclear movement also acquired initial impetus from notable individuals who publicly voiced nuclear concerns, such as nuclear scientists Richard Temple and Rob Robotham, and poets Dorothy Green and Judith Wright.[20]",
