				"previous": "Zapiekanki first appeared in the streets of Polish towns in the 1970s. Under Edward Gierek's Polish United Workers' Party leadership, Poland's Communist authorities allowed a degree of private enterprise in the catering industry. This move led to quick proliferation of small family-owned foodservice establishments, known in Polish as maÅa gastronomia, or \"small gastronomy\". Their spread continued during the food shortages of the following decade. They usually took the form of stands or travel trailers serving zapiekanki along with simple dishes of Polish cuisine, such as kieÅbasa sausage, boiled ham hock or tripe soup, and American fast food staples, like hot dogs, hamburgers and French fries.[5][6] The American journalist Anne Applebaum, who first came to Poland in 1988, described the zapiekanka of that time as \"a pizzalike substance\" and \"a poor relative of its distant Italian cousin\", \"a mushy white sandwich roll\" with \"a few overcooked mushrooms\" beneath \"melted cheese and a squeeze of ketchup\", which she ate nonetheless because little else was available.[7]",
				"after": "Demand for zapiekanki fell with the reintroduction of market economy in the 1990s, but remained on the menus of some of those \"small gastronomy\" establishments that survived the competition with large fast food chains. Some zapiekanka stands even attained cult following, such as those located in Plac Nowy (New Square) in the Kazimierz district of KrakÃ³w. Once a Jewish neighborhood, Kazimierz declined into desolation following the Holocaust, but experienced a revival after Steven Spielberg shot his 1993 film, Schindler's List, on location there.[8]:133 The district became a tourist attraction and then, a nightlife hub. The round brick building constructed in 1900 in the middle of the square, which used to house a kosher butcher's shop, now serves as an outdoor food court operating into the wee hours, with numerous stalls serving all kinds of zapiekanki to partygoers made hungry by a night of revelry.[8]:17,76",
