				"previous": "and is read \"the integral from a to b of f-of-x with respect to x.\" The Leibniz notation dx is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width Îx becomes the infinitesimally small dx. In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation",
				"after": "is to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an output. The terminating differential, dx, is not a number, and is not being multiplied by f(x), although, serving as a reminder of the Îx limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations of the integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which the function is integrated and serves as a closing bracket for the integration operator.",
