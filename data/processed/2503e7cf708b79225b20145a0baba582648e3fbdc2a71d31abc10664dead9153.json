				"after": "Liverpool's history means that there are a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.[137] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire.[138] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed[139] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[140] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster[141] and more Georgian houses than the city of Bath.[142] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.[143] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.[144]",
