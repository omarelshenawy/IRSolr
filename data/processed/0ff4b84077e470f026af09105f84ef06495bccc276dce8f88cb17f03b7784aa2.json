				"after": "The Arctic (/ËÉrktÉªk/ or /ËÉrtÉªk/) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of the Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. The Arctic region consists of a vast ocean with a seasonally varying ice cover, surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as north of the Arctic Circle (66Â° 33'N), the approximate limit of the midnight sun and the polar night. Alternatively, it can be defined as the region where the average temperature for the warmest month (July) is below 10Â Â°C (50Â Â°F); the northernmost tree line roughly follows the isotherm at the boundary of this region.[1][2]",
