				"previous": "Each day was based on a different theme: Day 1 was preliminary, day 2 was campaigning, day 3 was observation, day 4 for woodcraft, day 5 was chivalry, day 6 was saving a life, day 7 was patriotism, and day 8 was the conclusion.[3][11] The participants left by ferry on the 9th day, 9 August 1907.[12] The camp cost Â£55 two shillings, and eight pence; after the boys' fees, and donations totaling Â£16, this left a deficit of just over Â£24. The deficit was cleared by Saxon Noble, whose two sons Marc and Humphrey had attended.[3][6] Baden-Powell considered the camp successful.[12]",
				"after": "Following the successful camp, Baden-Powell went on an extensive speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Pearsons, to promote his forthcoming Scouting for Boys, which officially began the Scout movement.[9] It initially appeared as six fortnightly installments, beginning in January 1908, and later appeared in book form. Scouting began to spread throughout Great Britain and Ireland, then through the countries of the British Empire, and soon to the rest of the world.[10][11] A reunion of the original campers was held in 1928 at the Chief Scout's home at Pax Hill in Hampshire.[6]",
