				"after": "When Catholics were expected to abstain from eating meat during Lent, a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo des herbes (literally \"gumbo of the herbs\" and shortened to gumbo z'herbes), was often served. This variety combined a large number of greensÂ â typically including turnips, mustard greens, and spinach.[10] The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid. Preparation for this variety of gumbo was time-consuming, and as Lenten restrictions have relaxed, the dish has become less popular.[10] It is very rarely served in restaurants.[11] In modern times, ham or crabmeat is occasionally added to this type of gumbo.",
