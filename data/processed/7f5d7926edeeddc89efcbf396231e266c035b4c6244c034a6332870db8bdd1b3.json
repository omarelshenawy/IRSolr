				"previous": "In the early 15th century, Mary held a central position in Christian iconography and was often portrayed as the one in whom the \"Word was made flesh\", a direct result of the work of the divine light.[31] During the medieval period, light acted as a visual symbol for both the immaculate conception and Christ's birth; it was believed that he was made manifest by God's light passing through Mary's body, just as light shines through a window pane.[32]",
				"after": "The divine represented by light is a motif in keeping with the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light)[17] and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God.[12] In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light.[15] The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which PÃ¤cht views as achieved mainly through colour.[33]",
