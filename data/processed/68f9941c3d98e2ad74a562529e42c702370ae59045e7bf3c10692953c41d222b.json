				"after": "First collected on 4 September 1966, southeast of Walkaway, Banksia scabrella was described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus Banksia. He gave it the epithet scabrella, a diminutive of the Latin adjective scaber \"rough\", referring to the leaves. George placed B.Â scabrella in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked, and the resurrected series Abietinae, which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. He initially thought its closest relative to be Banksia leptophylla, which is found in the same region,[1] and later felt it to be B. lanata, which has similarly coloured inflorescences but longer smooth leaves.[3] It was one of several new species previously regarded as a form of Banksia sphaerocarpa.[4]",
