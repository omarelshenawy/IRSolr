				"after": "The house is set in around 70 acres (28Â ha) of parkland,[57] only a part of the estate originally attached to the house, which was, at one time, about 2,000 acres (810Â ha) in extent.[37] The park was used for hunting, and the grounds were home to cattle, deer and horses,[41] until the 17th century, when it was used as agricultural land. Two water courses run through the park: the Ladybrook, which, a little beyond the Park, becomes the Micker Brook, before flowing into the River Mersey, and a stream known as the Carr Brook. In the 1880s, Charles Nevill remodelled the grounds in the Romantic Victorian taste, altering the course of the Ladybrook, adding considerably to the trees in the park [1] and creating artificial ponds [1] The ponds were stocked with trout (though they are no longer fished),.[41][79] In 1888, a new drive was made through the park, a few yards further to the south of the house than the previous drive,[42] and below the East Front of the house Nevill set out terraces.[43]",
