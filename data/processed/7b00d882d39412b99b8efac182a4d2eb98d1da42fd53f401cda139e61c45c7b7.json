				"previous": "More than 400 native plant species live in the park. There are three life zones in the park based on elevation:[14] The lowest areas of the park are dominated by dwarf forests of pinyon pine and juniper with manzanita, serviceberry, and antelope bitterbrush in between. aspen, cottonwood, water birch, and willow grow along streams. Ponderosa pine forests cover the mid-elevations with blue spruce and Douglas fir in water-rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas fir and White Fir, along with Aspen and Engelmann spruce, make up the forests on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. The harshest areas have Limber Pine and ancient Great Basin Bristlecone Pine, some more than 1,600Â years old, holding on.[13]",
				"after": "The forests and meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the habitat to support diverse animal life, from birds and small mammals to foxes and occasional bobcats, cougars, and black bears.[13] Mule deer are the most common large mammals in the park.[13] Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.[13]",
