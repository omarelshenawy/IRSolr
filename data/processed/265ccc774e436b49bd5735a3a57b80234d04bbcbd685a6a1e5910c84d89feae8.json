The LHD is capable of launching multiple helicopters at one time while maintaining an amphibious capability of 1,000 troops and their supporting vehicles (tanks, armoured personnel carriers etc.).[19] The Australian Defence Minister has publically raised the possibility of procuring F-35B STOVL aircraft for the carrier, stating that it \"has been on the table since day one.
