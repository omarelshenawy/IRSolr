				"previous": "Another early point of contention (although not explicitly related to the nature of the memorial) concerned the possibility of incorporating a \"Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\" into the memorialâan approach that was championed by the St. Kilda RSL, who revealed plans to bury a soldier from either Gallipoli or France on ANZAC day, 25 April 1922.[21] This proposal received considerable debate, and was countered by the argument that the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey represented all of the dead of the British Empire. Monash was on the side of those against such a burial, as while he could see a place for an Unknown Soldier in a national memorial, he did not feel that it would be suitable at the Victorian Shrine.[22] The Stone of Remembrance was later placed in the position where an Unknown Soldier might have been laid.[23] An Australian Unknown Soldier was eventually interred at the Australian War Memorial by Prime Minister Paul Keating on 11 November 1993.[24]",
