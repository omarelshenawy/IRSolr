The generally low-lying terrain of the central areas on the western side of the municipality slopes upward to the south and east and especially to the north,[2] where it reaches 1,120 metres (3,675Â ft) at Cising Mountain, the highest (inactive) volcano in Taiwan in Yangmingshan National Park. The northern districts of Shilin and Beitou extend north of the Keelung River and are bordered by Yangmingshan National Park. The Taipei city limits cover an area ranked sixteenth of twenty-five among all counties and cities in Taiwan.",
