				"previous": "Death totals remain debated. British historian Antony Beevor wrote in his history of the Civil War that Franco's ensuing \"white terror\" resulted in the deaths of 200,000 people and that the \"red terror\" killed 38,000.[219] Julius Ruiz contends that, \"Although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone, with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain\".[220]",
				"after": "In 2008 a Spanish judge, Baltasar GarzÃ³n, opened an investigation into the executions and disappearances of 114,266 people between 17 July 1936 and December 1951. (GarzÃ³n has since been indicted for violating a 1977 amnesty law through his actions.) Among the executions investigated was that of the poet and dramatist Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca.[3] Mention of his death was forbidden during Franco's regime.[221]",
