				"previous": "Although modest about his own abilities and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was fully aware of the talents he possessed as a player;[179] there is some evidence that he sought to influence his legacy.[180] During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews,[180] assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.[181]",
				"after": "The most significant of these legacy projects was the Bradman Museum, opened in 1989 at the Bradman Oval in Bowral.[182] This organisation was reformed in 1993 as a non-profit charitable Trust, called the Bradman Foundation.[183] In 2010, it was expanded and rebranded as the International Cricket Hall of Fame.",
