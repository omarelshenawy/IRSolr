				"previous": "The A330 MRTT has been ordered by Australia, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Australia was the launch customer for the A330 MRTT.",
				"after": "The refuelling aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is equipped with both an Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS) and two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods. The aircraft are powered by two General Electric CF6-80E engines.[7] Australia was initially to procure four aircraft with an option to obtain a fifth. It has since decided to procure the fifth aircraft to allow for two simultaneous deployments of two aircraft, with the fifth for contingency coverage. Australia's A330 MRTT aircraft will be operated by No. 33 Squadron RAAF based at RAAF Base Amberley.[8] Australia has designated the aircraft KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport.[9]",
