				"previous": "In 1849 Manaus had 5,000 inhabitants, expanding in the next half-century to 70,000. During World War II, the region again enjoyed prosperity. Money began to circulate in Manaus, BelÃ©m, and other cities and towns nearby, and the regional economy gained strength.",
				"after": "For many workers, it was a one-way journey. About 30,000 rubber workers died in the Amazon, after having exhausted their energies extracting the \"white gold.\" They died of malaria, yellow fever, and hepatitis,[5] They also suffered attacks by animals such as panthers, serpents, and scorpions. The Brazilian government did not fulfill its promise to return the \"rubber soldiers\" to their homes at the end of the war as heroes and with housing comparable to that of the military veterans.[6] It is estimated that only about 6,000 workers managed to return to their homes, at their own expense. In the 21st century, the decreasing number of survivors have challenged the government for recognition and compensation for themselves and their families for their contributions to the war effort.[6]",
