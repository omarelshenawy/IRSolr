Steakley writes that what mattered in Germany was criminal intent or character, rather than criminal acts, and the \"gesundes Volksempfinden\" (\"healthy sensibility of the people\") became the leading normative legal principle.[404] In 1936, Himmler created the Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion.[405] Homosexuality was declared contrary to \"wholesome popular sentiment,\"[315] and homosexuals were consequently regarded as \"defilers of German blood.\" The Gestapo raided gay bars, tracked individuals using the address books of those they arrested, used the subscription lists of gay magazines to find others, and encouraged people to report suspected homosexual behavior and to scrutinize the behavior of their neighbors.[315][404]",
