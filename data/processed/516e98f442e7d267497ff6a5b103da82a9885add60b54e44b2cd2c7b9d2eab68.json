				"after": "The first named fossil specimen which can be attributed to Tyrannosaurus rex consists of two partial vertebrae (one of which has been lost) found by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892. Cope believed that they belonged to an \"agathaumid\" (ceratopsid) dinosaur, and named them Manospondylus gigas, meaning \"giant porous vertebra\" in reference to the numerous openings for blood vessels he found in the bone.[159] The M. gigas remains were later identified as those of a theropod rather than a ceratopsid, and H.F. Osborn recognized the similarity between M. gigas and Tyrannosaurus rex as early as 1917. However, owing to the fragmentary nature of the Manospondylus vertebrae, Osborn did not synonymize the two genera.[67]",
