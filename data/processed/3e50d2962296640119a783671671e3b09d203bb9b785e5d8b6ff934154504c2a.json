				"previous": "Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.[110] Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.",
				"after": "Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing 0 Â°C (32 Â°F) at inland weather stations, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, 2003, 2006 and 2013. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2009/10. Temperatures fell as low as â17.2Â Â°C (1Â Â°F) in County Mayo on 20 December[111] and up to a metre (3Â ft) of snow in mountainous areas.",
