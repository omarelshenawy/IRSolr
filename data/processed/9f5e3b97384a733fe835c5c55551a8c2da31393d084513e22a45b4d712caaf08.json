A. Zwierzynski had been arrested earlier. They were brought to Moscow for interrogation in the Lubyanka.[175][176][177] After several months of brutal interrogation and torture,[178] they were presented with the forged accusations of \"collaboration with Nazi Germany\" and \"planning a military alliance with Nazi Germany\".[179][180] Many resistance fighters, captured by the Germans and sent to POW camps in Germany, were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and remained in the West. Among those were the leaders of the uprising Tadeusz BÃ³r-Komorowski and Antoni ChruÅciel.[citation needed]",
