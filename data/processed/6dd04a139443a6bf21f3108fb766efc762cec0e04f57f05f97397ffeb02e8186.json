				"previous": "A classic, extensively studied nonlinear problem is the dynamics of a pendulum under influence of gravity. Using Lagrangian mechanics, it may be shown[4] that the motion of a pendulum can be described by the dimensionless nonlinear equation",
				"after": "where gravity points \"downwards\" and is the angle the pendulum forms with its rest position, as shown in the figure at right. One approach to \"solving\" this equation is to use as an integrating factor, which would eventually yield",
