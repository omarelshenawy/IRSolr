				"The earliest surviving recipient of the award is Arthur Morris (1949), which he became in April 2010 with the death of Alec Bedser (1947). The longest that a recipient has lived after receiving the award is 77 years by Harry Calder (1918), who died in 1995. Calder, however, uniquely for a recipient, played no first-class cricket. Among first-class players, the longest lived after receipt of the award is 74 years by Wilfred Rhodes (1899). Two women have been chosen: Claire Taylor (2009) and Charlotte Edwards (2014)."
