The spines, which may be up to 50Â mm (2Â in) long, are modified hairs,[22] mostly made of keratin.[23] Insulation is provided by fur between the spines, which ranges in colour from honey to a dark reddish-brown and even black; the underside and short tail are also covered in fur.[22] Colouration of the fur and spines varies with geographic location. The echidna's fur may be infested with what is said to be the world's largest flea, Bradiopsylla echidnae, which is about 4Â mm (0.16Â in) long.[22]",
