				"after": "The third group of foreigners to arrive in Hawaii were from China. Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789. In 1820, the first American missionaries arrived to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways.[100] As of 2015[update], a large proportion of Hawaii's population have Asian ancestryâespecially Filipino, Japanese and Chinese. Many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugar plantations in the md-to-late 19th century. The first 153 Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii on June 19, 1868. They were not \"legally\" approved by the Japanese government because the contract was between a broker and the Tokugawa shogunateâby then replaced by the Meiji Restoration. The first Japanese government-approved immigrants arrived on February 9, 1885, after KalÄkaua's petition to Emperor Meiji when KalÄkaua visited Japan in 1881.[101][102]",
