				"after": "The Han dynasty inherited the ban liang coin type from the Qin. In the beginning of the Han, Emperor Gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private minting of coins. This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow Grand Empress Dowager LÃ¼ Zhi (d. 180 BC), who abolished private minting.[198] In 182 BC, LÃ¼ Zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins. This caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6Â g (0.09Â oz) in weight.[198]",
