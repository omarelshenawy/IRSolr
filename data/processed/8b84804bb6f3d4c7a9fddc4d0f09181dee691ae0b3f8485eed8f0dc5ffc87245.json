				"after": "Peake was born to a Lincolnshire family in about 1551.[5] He began his training on 30 April 1565 under Laurence Woodham,[6] who lived at the sign of \"The Key\" in Goldsmithâs Row, Westcheap.[7] He was apprenticed, three years after the miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard, to the Goldsmithsâ Company in London.[8] He became a freeman of the company on 20 May 1576. His son William later followed in his father's footsteps as a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company and a portrait painter.[9] Peakeâs training would have been similar to that of John de Critz and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, who may have been pupils of the Flemish artist Lucas de Heere.[10]",
