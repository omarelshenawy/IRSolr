				"previous": "Different formulas or algorithms may describe the same function. For instance f(x) = (xâ+â1)â(xâââ1) is exactly the same function as f(x) = x2âââ1.[6] Furthermore, a function need not be described by a formula, expression, or algorithm, nor need it deal with numbers at all: the domain and codomain of a function may be arbitrary sets. One example of a function that acts on non-numeric inputs takes English words as inputs and returns the first letter of the input word as output.",
