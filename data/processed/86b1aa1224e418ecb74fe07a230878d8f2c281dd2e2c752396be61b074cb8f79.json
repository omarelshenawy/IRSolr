				"after": "In 1902, the Boston architectural firm Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson was awarded a major construction contract that set the predominantly neogothic architectural style still seen today.[86] Most of the buildings of the central cadet area are in this style, as typified by the Cadet Chapel, completed in 1910.[87] These buildings are nearly all constructed from granite that has a predominantly gray and black hue. The barracks that were built in the 1960s were designed to mimic this style.[86] Other buildings on post, notably the oldest private residences for the faculty, are built in the Federal, Georgian, or English Tudor styles.[88] A few buildings, such as Cullum Hall and the Old Cadet Chapel, are built in the Neoclassical style.[89]",
