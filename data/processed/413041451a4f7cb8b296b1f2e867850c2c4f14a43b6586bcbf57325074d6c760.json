Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park.[9] As of 2009, Millennium Park trailed only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction.[10]",
