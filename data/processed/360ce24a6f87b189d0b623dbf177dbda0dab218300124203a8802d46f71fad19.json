Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre-transcriptionally;[35] this process is referred to as RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function.[36] As a consequence, the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins.[37] Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and centromere formation,[38] causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division.[39] In some cases, similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.[40]",
