				"previous": "Ovarian cancer frequently recurs after treatment. If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months progression-free survival). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.[10] Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used.[14]",
				"after": "Globally, as of 2010, about 160,000 people died from ovarian cancer, up from 113,000 in 1990.[57] As of 2014, more than 220,000 diagnoses of epithelial ovarian cancer were made yearly.[10] In 2010, in the United States, an estimated 21,880 new cases were diagnosed and 13,850 women died of ovarian cancer. Around 1800 of the new diagnoses were sex-cord or stromal tumors.[11] In the United Kingdom as of 2014, approximately 7,000-7,100 yearly diagnoses were made and 4,200 deaths occurred.[10][16] It is the 5th most common cancer in UK women. Ovarian cancer is most commonly diagnosed after menopause.[16]",
