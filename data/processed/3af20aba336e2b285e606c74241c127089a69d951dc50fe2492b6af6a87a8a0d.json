				"after": "The Canberra Museum and Gallery in the city is a repository of local history and art, housing a permanent collection and visiting exhibitions.[209] Several historic homes are open to the public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the Tuggeranong Valley,[210][211] Mugga-Mugga in Symonston,[212] and Blundells' Cottage in Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers.[13] Calthorpes' House in Red Hill is a well preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra's very early days.[213] Canberra has many venues for live music and theatre: the Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions;[214] and Llewellyn Hall (within the ANU School of Music), a world-class concert hall are two of the most notable.[215] The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings.[215] The Albert Hall was the city's first performing arts venue, opened in 1928. It was the original performance venue for theatre groups such as the Canberra Repertory Society.[216]",
