				"previous": "Similar to the inherited genetic diseases of other breeds of animal (such as hip dysplasia in canines), a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported. Most commonly, the roan coloration of Abyssinian guinea pigs is associated with congenital eye disorders and problems with the digestive system.[112] Other genetic disorders include \"waltzing disease\" (deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles), palsy, and tremor conditions.[113]",
				"after": "If handled correctly early in life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch.[60] They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself.[53] Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored.",
