				"previous": "A US Navy F/A-18F from VFA-122 Tactical Demonstration team crashed on 6 April 2011, killing both crew members. The crash occurred when the crew attempted to perform a loaded roll with too much speed and insufficient angle-of-attack. The loaded roll has since been removed from the Navy's F/A-18F flight demonstration routine.[144]",
