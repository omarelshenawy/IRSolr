				"after": "The La Cobata region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the Olmec heartland.[24] The La Cobata colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded.[24] It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, on the north side of El Vigia volcano near to Santiago Tuxtla.[143] The head was largely buried when found; excavations uncovered a Late Classic (600â900 AD) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12-centimetre (4.7Â in) long obsidian knife placed pointing northwards towards the head. The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted.[144] The La Cobata Head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago.[24]",
