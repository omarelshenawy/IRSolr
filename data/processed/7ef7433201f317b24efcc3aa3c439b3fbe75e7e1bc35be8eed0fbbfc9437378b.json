				"after": "In 1843 Scottish inventor Alexander Bain invented a device that could be considered the first facsimile machine. He called his invention a \"recording telegraph\". Bain's telegraph was able to transmit images by electrical wires. Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine. In 1855 an Italian abbot, Giovanni Caselli, also created an electric telegraph that could transmit images. Caselli called his invention \"Pantelegraph\". Pantelegraph was successfully tested and approved for a telegraph line between Paris and Lyon.[41][42]",
