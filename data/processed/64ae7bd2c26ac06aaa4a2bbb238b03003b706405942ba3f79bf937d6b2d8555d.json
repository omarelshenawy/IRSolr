It can range from 2 to 14 kilograms (4 to 30Â lb), but is usually between 3.5 and 9 kilograms (8 and 20Â lb). The smallest specimens are found in Southern Florida, while those near the northern limits of the raccoon's range tend to be the largest (see Bergmann's rule).[68] Males are usually 15 to 20% heavier than females.[69] At the beginning of winter, a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring because of fat storage.[70] The largest recorded wild raccoon weighed 28.4Â kg (62.6Â lb) and measured 140Â cm (55Â in) in total length, by far the largest size recorded for a procyonid.[71][72]",
