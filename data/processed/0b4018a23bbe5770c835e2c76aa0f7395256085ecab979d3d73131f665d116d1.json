It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist[137] Gavrilo Princip.[138] Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). The War left more than 16Â million civilians and military dead.[139] Over 60Â million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.[140]",
