				"after": "The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items located at or near ground level including invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions as well as a wide variety of insectsâcockroaches, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet.[67] It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts.[68] Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae.[69] One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration.[70] Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food.[71] Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.[72]",
