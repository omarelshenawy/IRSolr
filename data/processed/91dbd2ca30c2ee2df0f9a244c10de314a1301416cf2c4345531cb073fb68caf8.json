				"after": "The Second Aliyah led to further expansion. In 1906, a group of Jews, among them residents of Jaffa, followed the initiative of Akiva Aryeh Weiss and banded together to form the Ahuzat Bayit (lit. \"homestead\") society. The society's goal was to form a \"Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment, planned according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene.\"[20][unreliable source?] The urban planning for the new city was influenced by the Garden city movement.[32] The first 60 plots were purchased in Kerem Djebali near Jaffa by Jacobus Kann, a Dutch citizen, who registered them in his name to circumvent the Turkish prohibition on Jewish land acquisition.[33] Meir Dizengoff, later Tel Aviv's first mayor, also joined the Ahuzat Bayit society.[34][35] His vision for Tel Aviv involved peaceful co-existence with Arabs.[20][unreliable source?]",
