The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press,[92] which again speculated why Fender was not chosen.[93] Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. Fender pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy.[88] Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped;[94] he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender.[95] When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply.[96] Fender was married at the end of the 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the Daily Express.[97]",
