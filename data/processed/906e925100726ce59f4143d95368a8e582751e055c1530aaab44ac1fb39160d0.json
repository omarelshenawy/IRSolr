Cougars and gray wolves will kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park.[50] Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens.[51][52][53] There is at least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass.[54] Bobcat remains have occasionally been found in the resting sites of male fishers.[55]",
