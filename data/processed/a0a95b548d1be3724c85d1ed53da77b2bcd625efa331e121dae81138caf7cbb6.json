				"after": "The barn swallow is similar in its habits to other aerial insectivores, including other swallow species and the unrelated swifts. It is not a particularly fast flier, with a speed estimated at about 11Â m/s, up to 20Â m/s and a wing beat rate of approximately 5, up to 7â9 times each second,[35][36] but it has the manoeuvrability necessary to feed on flying insects while airborne. It is often seen flying relatively low in open or semi-open areas.",
