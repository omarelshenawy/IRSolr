				"previous": "In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda. Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts, such as kalarippayattu, musti yuddha, silambam, and marma adi, originated in India. Chess, commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaá¹ga, is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[309][310] Pachisi, from which parcheesi derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.[311]",
				"after": "The improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[312] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[313][314] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[315] (Saina Nehwal is the top ranked female badminton player in the world), boxing,[316] and wrestling.[317] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[318]",
