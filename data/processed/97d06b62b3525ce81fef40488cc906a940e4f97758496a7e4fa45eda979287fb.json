				"after": "In 1690, Sir John Brownlow was granted permission to enclose an area of 1000Â acres (4Â kmÂ²) to transform into a park, with a grant to keep deer. There is evidence to suggest that some of this area had been a park since at least 1580. The park was laid out with avenues, including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house. Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21,400 ash trees, 9,500 oak trees, and 614 fruit trees. It is thought that William Winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens.[41] Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens, including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the \"rond-points\" (circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate) introduced by the landscape gardener AndrÃ© Le NÃ´tre. By the end of the eighteenth century, these formal parterres had been removed and the canal ponds filled in.[42]",
