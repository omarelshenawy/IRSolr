				"after": "Excluding the two species of condors, the king vulture is the largest of the New World vultures. Its overall length ranges from 67â81Â centimeters (27â32Â in) and its wingspan is 1.2â2Â meters (4â6.6Â ft). Its weight ranges from 2.7â4.5Â kilograms (6â10Â lb).[9][26] An imposing bird, the adult king vulture has predominantly white plumage, which has a slight rose-yellow tinge to it.[27] In stark contrast, the wing coverts, flight feathers and tail are dark grey to black, as is the prominent thick neck ruff.[3] The head and neck are devoid of feathers, the skin shades of red and purple on the head, vivid orange on the neck and yellow on the throat.[28] On the head, the skin is wrinkled and folded, and there is a highly noticeable irregular golden crest attached on the cere above its orange and black bill;[3] this caruncle does not fully form until the birdâs fourth year.[29]",
