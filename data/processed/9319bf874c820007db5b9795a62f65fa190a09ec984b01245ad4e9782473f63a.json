				"previous": "The T38-A-1 power sections each contained 17-stage compressors giving a pressure ratio of 6.3:1, eight combustion chambers, and four-stage turbines. A combining reduction gearbox was driven via extension shafts from the power sections. Each transmission shaft incorporated a clutch to allow the power sections to be run independently.[1]",
				"after": "Accessories included a Master Control Unit, mounted above the compressors; and an air driven starter on the gearbox. The compound reduction gear had an overall reduction ratio of 15.75:1 and incorporated an airscrew brake to prevent windmilling when the engine was stopped. Anti-icing for the air intakes was supplied by compressor bleed air. The contra-rotating propeller consisted of two 14Â ft (4.3Â m) three-bladed Aeroproducts propellers fitted to concentric shafts.[1]",
