These ranges overlapâby about 30% according to data from the eastern forestsâbut females usually have separated ranges. Home ranges grow during the dry season, perhaps because less food and water is available. In general, radio-collared fossas travel between 2 and 5 kilometres (1.2 and 3.1Â mi) per day,[26] although in one reported case a fossa was observed moving a straight-line distance of 7Â km (4.3Â mi) in 16Â hours.[15] The animal's population density appears to be low: in Kirindy Forest, where it is thought to be common, its density has been estimated at one animal per 4Â km2 (1.5Â sqÂ mi) in 1998.[9] Another study in the same forest between 1994 and 1996 using the mark and recapture method indicated a population density of one animal per 3.8Â km2 (1.5Â sqÂ mi) and one adult per 5.6Â km2 (2.2Â sqÂ mi).[27]",
