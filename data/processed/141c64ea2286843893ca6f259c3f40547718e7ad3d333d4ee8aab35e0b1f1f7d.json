				"previous": "Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters.[40][68][70][71] Their first lines of defence are the saponins present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours.[72] Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out large quantities of repellent mucus. They also have body armour in the form of hard plates and spines.[73] The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours.[74] Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.[73]",
				"after": "Several species sometimes suffer from a wasting condition caused by bacteria in the genus Vibrio;[70] however, a more widespread wasting disease, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV).[75] The protozoan Orchitophrya stellarum is known to infect the gonads of starfish and damage tissue.[70] Starfish are vulnerable to high temperatures. Experiments have shown that the feeding and growth rates of P. ochraceus reduce greatly when their body temperatures rise above 23Â Â°C (73Â Â°F) and that they die when their temperature rises to 30Â Â°C (86Â Â°F).[76][77] This species has a unique ability to absorb seawater to keep itself cool when it is exposed to sunlight by a receding tide.[78] It also appears to rely on its arms to absorb heat, so as to protect the central disc and vital organs like the stomach.[79]",
