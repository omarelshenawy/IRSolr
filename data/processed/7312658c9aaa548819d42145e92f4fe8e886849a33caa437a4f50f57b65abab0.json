The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms.[71] Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations.[117] Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half the area of the park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef.[118] Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters.[119] The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef on the edge of the Florida carbonate platform, the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to 10-meter (33Â ft) water depth, and staghorn coral below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral. The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and Porites finger corals.[120]",
