				"after": "A field study late in the Florida nesting season revealed that on an average day, adult American white ibis spent 10.25Â hours looking for food, 0.75Â hours flying, 13Â hours resting, roosting, and attending to their nests.[32] Much of the time roosting is spent preening, biting and working their feathers with their long bills, as well as rubbing the oil glands on the sides of their heads on back plumage. American white ibis generally only preen themselves, not engaging in allopreening unless part of courtship behavior. Bathing often takes place before preening; ibis squat in water 5â20Â cm (2.0â7.9Â in) deep and flick water over themselves with each wing in succession. Hundreds of birds may bathe together around the time of courtship.[22]",
