				"previous": "The MD-10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC-10 and a re-designation to MD-10. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 and was launched in 1996.[36] The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This allows companies such as FedEx Express, which operate both the MD-10 and MD-11, to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions.[37]",
				"after": "In July 2014, there were 68 DC-10s and MD-10s in airline service with operators FedEx Express (60), Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter (4), and others with fewer aircraft.[38] The aging models are now largely used as dedicated freight aircraft. \"The DC-10 is going to be remembered as a better cargo plane than passenger plane,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group.[39]",
