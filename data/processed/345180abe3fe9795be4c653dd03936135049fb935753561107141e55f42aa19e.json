				"previous": "Miller, the vice-captain, almost missed the trip to India after turning up late for the voyage.[171] On arrival in India, Miller scored 46 in a draw against North Zone.[172][173] Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay, top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw.[174][175] In a match against India, Miller took two wickets.[176][177] At this point, with most of the team suffering from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to travel by air,[178] some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy, with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him.[178][179] This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia.[180] Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team.[178][179][181]",
				"after": "The team played East Zone in Calcutta as the city was in the grip of deadly pro-independence riots.[182] Miller's friend Denis Compton was batting for East Zone when rioters invaded the pitch. Their leader ran up to Compton and said: \"Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop\".[179][183][184][185] In later years, whenever Miller opposed Compton, he would quote this remark when Compton came to the crease.[186] In 2005, the ECB and Cricket Australia decided that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the ComptonâMiller Medal, recognising their friendship and rivalry.[187]",
