Because of its significant diaspora, this former Portuguese colony also has an active presence in cyberspace. Its history is entwined with the Portuguese expansion in Asia, and also with pre-Portuguese trading routes linking South and West Asia and beyond. Its connection to the Portuguese colonies in Africa, Macau, and Brazil has resulted in a wide range of historical records relating to those regions being maintained in its libraries and government buildings.",
