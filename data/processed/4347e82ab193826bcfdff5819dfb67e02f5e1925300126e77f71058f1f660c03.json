				"after": "Runestone SÃ¶ 345 (location) was first documented during the national search for historic monuments in 1667, and it was then used as a doorstep to the porch of YtterjÃ¤rna church. It had probably been used for this purpose during a considerable period of time, because according to a drawing that was made a few years later, it was very worn down. In 1830 a church revision noted that it was in a ruined state and so worn that only a few runes remained discernible, and when Hermelin later depicted the stone, he noted that the stone had been cracked in two pieces. In 1896, the runologist Erik Brate visited the stone and discovered that one of the pieces had disappeared and that the only remaining part was reclining on the church wall. The remaining piece measured 1.10Â m (3Â ft 7Â in) and 1.15Â m (3Â ft 9Â in).[128] The stone has since then been reassembled and raised on the cemetery.",
