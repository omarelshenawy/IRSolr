				"previous": "Stuyvesant, along with other similar schools, has regularly been excluded from Newsweek's annual list of the Top 100 Public High Schools. The May 8, 2008 issue states the reason as being, \"because so many of their students score well above average on the SAT and ACT.\"[70][71] US News & World Report, however, included Stuyvesant on its list of \"Best High Schools\" published in December 2009, ranking 31st.[72] In its 2010 progress report, the New York City Department of Education assigned it the highest possible grade of \"A\".[63]",
				"after": "Stuyvesant fields 32 varsity teams,[73] including a swimming team, as well as golf, bowling, volleyball, soccer, basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, fencing, baseball/softball, handball, tennis, track/cross country,[74] cricket, football,[73] and starting in Spring 2008, lacrosse teams.[73] In addition, Stuyvesant club teams include boys' varsity and junior varsity, and girls' varsity Ultimate teams.
