				"previous": "A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom.[485] England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, and The Football Association is the oldest of its kind, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley.[486][487] Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and league system. The English top division, the Premier League, is the most watched football league in the world.[488] The first-ever international football match was contested by England and Scotland on 30 November 1872.[489] England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland compete as separate countries in international competitions.[490] A Great Britain Olympic football team was assembled for the first time to compete in the London 2012 Olympic Games. However, the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent statusÂ â a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter.[491]",
				"after": "In 2003, rugby union was ranked the second most popular sport in the UK.[485] The sport was created in Rugby School, Warwickshire, and the first rugby international took place on 27 March 1871 between England and Scotland.[492][493] England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the Six Nations Championship; the premier international tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sport governing bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland organise and regulate the game separately.[494] If any of the British teams or the Irish team beat the other three in a tournament, then it is awarded the Triple Crown.[495]",
