				"after": "Yellow-tailed black cockatoos are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and are often heard before being seen.[20] They make long journeys by flying at a considerable height while calling to each other, and they are often seen flying high overhead in pairs, or trios comprising a pair and their young, or small groups.[20][27] Outside of the breeding season in autumn or winter they may coalesce into flocks of a hundred birds or more, while family interactions between pairs or trios are maintained.[20] They are generally wary birds, although they can be less shy in urban and suburban areas.[20] They generally keep to trees, only coming to ground level to inspect fallen pine or banksia cones or to drink. Flight is fluid and has been described as \"lazy\", with deep, slow wingbeats.[27]",
