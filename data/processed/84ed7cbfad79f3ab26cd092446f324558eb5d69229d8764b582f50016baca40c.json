				"after": "Until his death in 1848, Muhammad Ali Pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt.[44][45] However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city,[46] those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape.[47] Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha (r. 1863â1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il environs a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, came to fruition.[48] Isma'il also sought to modernize the city, which was merging with neighboring settlements, by establishing a public works ministry, bringing gas and lighting to the city, and opening a theater and opera house.[49][50]",
