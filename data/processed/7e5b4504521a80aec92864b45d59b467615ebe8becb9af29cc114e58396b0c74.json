Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an inland delta, and often occurs on former lake beds. The Inner Niger Delta and PeaceâAthabasca Delta are notable examples. The Amazon has also an inland delta before the island of MarajÃ³.",
