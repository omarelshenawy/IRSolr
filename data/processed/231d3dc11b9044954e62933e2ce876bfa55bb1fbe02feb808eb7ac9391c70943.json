				"previous": "This frog is similar in appearance to the magnificent tree frog (L.Â splendida), which inhabits only north-western Australia. Older members of that species have very large parotoid glands, which cover the entire top of their heads and droop over their tympana. The parotoid gland of the green tree frog is much smaller, and it also lacks the yellow speckling on the back and the yellow markings on the hand, groin and thigh.[11] It can be distinguished from the giant tree frog (L.Â infrafrenata) by the distinct white stripe that that species has along the edge of the lower jaw and extending to the shoulder, which is not present in the green tree frog.[12]",
				"after": "The tadpoles' appearance changes throughout their development. When newly hatched, they are 8Â mm (0.3Â in) long and when fully developed, 44Â mm (1.7Â in). They are initially mottled with brown, and increase in pigmentation (to either green or brown) during development. Their underside is initially dark but later becomes lighter in hue. The eggs are brown and are wrapped in a clear jelly; they are 1.1 to 1.4 millimetres (0.043 to 0.055Â in) in diameter.[9]",
