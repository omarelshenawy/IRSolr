				"previous": "The Iroquois men also organized in a cooperative fashion. The men acted collectively during military actions.[11] The other jobs of men, such as hunting and fishing, also involved cooperative elements. The men more often organized as a whole village rather than as a clan.[12] The men organized hunting parties where they used extensive cooperation to kill a large amount of game. One firsthand account told of a hunting party that built a large brush fence in a forest to form a V. The hunters set a fire across from the open side of the V, forcing the animals to run towards the point where the hunters awaited them. They could kill one hundred deer at a time by such a plan.[13]",
				"after": "The men also fished in large groups. Fishing expeditions included men in canoes using weirs and nets to cover entire streams and harvest large amounts of fish, sometimes a thousand in half of a day.[14] A hunting or fishing party's takings were considered common property; they were divided among the party by the leader or taken to the village for a feast.[15] Hunting and fishing were not always cooperative efforts, but the Iroquois generally did better in parties than as individuals.[16]",
