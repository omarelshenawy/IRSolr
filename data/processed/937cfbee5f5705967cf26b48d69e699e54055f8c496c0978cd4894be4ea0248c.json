				"after": "As English cricket had not fully recovered from the effects of the war,[130] the team which toured Australia was weak in bowling. Confronted by a far better Australian side than anyone had expected, England lost all five Test matches, an unprecedented result that Wisden regarded as a \"disaster\".[131] Rhodes now played for Yorkshire as a middle-order batsman and front-line bowler but England's captain Douglas showed uncertainty whether to use Rhodes in this capacity, or to revert to his pre-war role as Hobbs's opening partner.[132] Until the first Test Rhodes batted mainly down the order; after this he returned to opening the batting. On the tour Rhodes scored two centuries, one a double-century, totalling in all 730 runs in all first-class matches at an average of 38.42.[16][132] Although a leading bowler in England in 1919 and 1920, Rhodes bowled infrequently and with limited success.[132] After taking six for 39 against Victoria in helpful conditions,[133] he rarely bowled,[132] and took only 18 first-class wickets (averaging 26.61) on the tour.[15]",
