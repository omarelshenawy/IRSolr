				"previous": "Subfossil parrot remains were later excavated from grottos on RÃ©union. X-rays of the two existing stuffed Mascarene parrots made it possible to compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to RÃ©union as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects, they were more similar to those of the Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it.[10]",
				"after": "The affinities of the Mascarene parrot are unclear, and two hypotheses have competed since the mid-19th century.[11] Some authors grouped it with the Coracopsinae (of African origin) due to its dark plumage, and others with the Psittaculinae parrots (of Asian origin) based on the large red beak, a feature which is diagnostic for that group.[6][12] Its plumage pattern was mostly atypical for a psittaculine, though other members have black facial patterns.[2]",
