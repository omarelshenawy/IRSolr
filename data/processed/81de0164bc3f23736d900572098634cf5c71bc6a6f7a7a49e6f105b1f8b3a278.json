				"previous": "While Guernsey has complete autonomy over internal affairs and certain external matters, the topic of complete independence from the British Crown has been discussed widely and frequently, with ideas ranging from Guernsey obtaining independence as a Dominion to the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey uniting and forming an independent Federal State within the Commonwealth, whereby both islands retain their independence with regards to domestic affairs but internationally, the islands would be regarded as one state.[6]",
				"after": "At 49Â°28â²N 2Â°35â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿49.467Â°N 2.583Â°Wï»¿ / 49.467; -2.583, Alderney, Guernsey, Herm, Sark, and some other smaller islands have a total area of 78 square kilometres (30Â sqÂ mi) and a coastline of about 50 kilometres (31Â mi). By itself, the island of Guernsey has a total area of 63.4 square kilometres (24.5Â sqÂ mi). Guernsey is situated 50 kilometres (31Â mi) west of France's Normandy coast and 120 kilometres (75Â mi) south of Weymouth, England and lies in the Gulf of St Malo. Lihou, a tidal island, is attached to Guernsey by a causeway at low tide. The terrain is mostly level with low hills in southwest.[14][15] The southeastern point is Jerbourg Point, used by the Germans during World War II. Elevation varies across the bailiwick from sea level to 114Â m (374Â ft) at Le Moulin on Sark. The highest point in mainland Guernsey is Hautnez (111Â m (364Â ft)), in Alderney at Le Rond But (101Â m (331Â ft)), in Jethou (76Â m (249Â ft)) and Herm (98Â m (322Â ft)). Natural resources include cropland.[16]",
