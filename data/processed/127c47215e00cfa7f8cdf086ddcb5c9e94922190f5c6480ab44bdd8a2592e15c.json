				"According to The New York Times, students \"share a love of books [and] a disdain for the conventional style of education. Many say they did not have a good high school experience\".[11] Students, who tend to be individualistic and creative thinkers, are encouraged to ask questions.[12] Shimer has historically averaged 125 students, and enrolled 97 in 2014.[4] Most Shimer alumni go on to graduate studies. Notable alumni include writers, political theorists, inventors, avant-garde artists and musicians, politicians and computing pioneers."

On May 11, 1853, the new seminary opened in a local church with eleven students.[15]",
