				"previous": "The group velocity therefore depends upon the dispersion relation connecting Ï and k. For example, in quantum mechanics the energy of a particle represented as a wave packet is E = Ä§Ï = (Ä§k)2/(2m). Consequently, for that wave situation, the group velocity is",
				"after": "showing that the velocity of a localized particle in quantum mechanics is its group velocity.[13] Because the group velocity varies with k, the shape of the wave packet broadens with time, and the particle becomes less localized.[16] In other words, the velocity of the constituent waves of the wave packet travel at a rate that varies with their wavelength, so some move faster than others, and they cannot maintain the same interference pattern as the wave propagates.",
