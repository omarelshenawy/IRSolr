				"after": "By the late 15th century, England was a relatively insignificant state on the periphery of Europe. The great victories against France in the Hundred Years' War were in the past; only the small enclave of Calais in northern France remained as a remnant of the vast continental holdings of the English kings. The War of the Rosesâthe civil war between the houses of York and Lancasterâhad ended with HenryÂ VII's establishment of the House of Tudor, the new ruling dynasty of England. The ambitious naval policies of HenryÂ V were not continued by his successors, and from 1422 to 1509 only six ships were built for the crown. The marriage alliance between Anne of Brittany and CharlesÂ VIII of France in 1491, and his successor LouisÂ XII in 1499, left England with a weakened strategic position on its southern flank. Despite this, HenryÂ VII managed to maintain a comparatively long period of peace and a small but powerful core of a navy.[1]",
