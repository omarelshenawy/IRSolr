				"after": "Although zoos and botanic gardens are not often thought of as museums, they are in fact \"living museums\". They exist for the same purpose as other museums: to educate, inspire action, and to study, develop and manage collections. They are also managed much like other museums and face the same challenges. Notable zoos include the Bronx Zoo in New York, the London Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo, the Saint Louis Zoological Park, the San Diego Zoo, Berlin Zoological Garden, Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden the Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Frankfurt Zoological Garden, Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and ZÃ¼rich Zoologischer Garten in Switzerland. Notable botanic gardens include Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Chicago Botanic Garden, Taipei Botanical Garden and Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario).",
