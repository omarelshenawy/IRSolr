				"The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is a state located in the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic regions of the United States of America.",
				"Pennsylvania has been known as the Keystone State since 1802, based in part upon its central location among the original Thirteen Colonies forming the United States. It was also a keystone state economically, having both the industry common to the North, making such wares as Conestoga wagons and rifles, and the agriculture common to the South, producing feed, fiber, food, and tobacco."
