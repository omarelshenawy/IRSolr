				"previous": "The Amazon's rubber was undercut in the world market and demand for it fell. This rapidly resulted in the stagnation of the regional economy. There was a lack of entrepreneurial or governmental vision to find alternatives for development. The \"rubber barons\" and economic elite followed the money, leaving the region to seek their next fortunes elsewhere.",
				"after": "Although the railroad and the cities of Porto Velho and GuajarÃ¡-Mirim remained as a legacy to this bright economic period, the recession caused by the end of the rubber boom left profound scars on the Amazon region. There was a massive loss of state tax income, high levels of unemployment, rural and urban emigration, and abandoned and unneeded housing. Those who remained in the region had few expectations for the future. Deprived of their income, the rubber workers remained in the periphery of Manaus, searching for new work. Because of the lack of housing, in the 1920s they built the cidade flutuante (\"floating city\"), a type of residence that was consolidated in the 1960s.",
