Anyone with appropriate skills may contribute, with commit rights being awarded on merit and de Raadt acting as coordinator.[17] Two official releases are made per year, with the version number incremented by 0.1,[18] and these are each supported for twelve months. Snapshot releases are also available at very frequent intervals. Maintenance patches for supported releases may be applied manually or by regularly updating the system against the patch branch of the CVS repository for that release.",
