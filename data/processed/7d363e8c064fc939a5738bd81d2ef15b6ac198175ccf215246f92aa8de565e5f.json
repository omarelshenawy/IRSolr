The airline was government-owned, having an initial investment of LYDÂ 2Â million. It began operations flying regional routes in AugustÂ 1965Â (1965-08) using Sud SE-210 Caravelle equipment. Following the carrier starting services along the TripoliâBenghazi run the Libyans prevented foreign companies that also flew the route from operating on it in order to allow the national airline to expand.[3] Absorbing Libavia and United Libya Airlines operations,[4] international flights radiating from Benghazi and Tripoli began in OctoberÂ 1965Â (1965-10), initially serving Athens, Cairo, London, Malta, Paris, Rome and Tunis.[5]",
