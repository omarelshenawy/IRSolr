				"after": "Phellinus ellipsoideus produces resupinate fruit bodies that are hard and woody, whether fresh or dry.[2] The original description characterized them as measuring up to 30 centimetres (12Â in) \"or more\" in length,[7] 20Â cm (7.9Â in) in width, and extending 8Â mm (0.3Â in) from the wood on which they grow at their thickest point.[note 1] The outermost layer is typically yellow to yellowish-brown, measuring 2Â mm (0.08Â in) in thickness. The shiny surface of the hymenium, the spore-producing section of the fruit body, is covered in pores and ranges in colour from yellow-brown to rust-brown. There are between 5 and 8 pores per millimetre. The tubes are up to 8Â mm (0.3Â in) in depth, have the same colouration as the surface of the hymenium, and are distinctively layered. They are also hard and woody. The very thin yellow-brown layer of flesh measures less than 0.5Â mm (0.02Â in) in width. As with much of the rest of the fruit body, it is firm, solid, and reminiscent of wood.[10] The fruit bodies lack any odour or taste.[2]",
