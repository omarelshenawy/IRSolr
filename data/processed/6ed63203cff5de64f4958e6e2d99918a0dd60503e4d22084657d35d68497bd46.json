				"The mountain infantry of Austria have their roots in the three LandesschÃ¼tzen regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The mountain infantry of Germany carry on certain traditions of the Alpenkorps (Alpine corps) of World War I. Both countries' mountain infantry share the EdelweiÃ insignia. It was established in 1907 as a symbol of the Austro-Hungarian LandesschÃ¼tzen regiments by Emperor Franz Joseph I. These troops wore their edelweiss on the collar of their uniforms. When the Alpenkorps came to aid the LandesschÃ¼tzen in defending Austria-Hungary's southern frontier against the Italian attack in May 1915, the grateful LandesschÃ¼tzen honoured the men of the Alpenkorps by awarding them their own insignia: the edelweiss. Together with the FallschirmjÃ¤ger (Paratroopers) they are perceived as the elite infantry units of the German Army."

				"During World War II the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS raised a number of mountain infantry units.",
				"An entire corps was formed in Norway by 1941. Its divisions were lightly equipped, with much of the transport provided by mules. These mountain infantry were equipped with fewer automatic weapons than regular infantry, however the MG 34 or MG 42 machine gunners were provided with more ammunition than their regular infantry counterparts.[1] Mountain infantry were identified by the edelweiss insignia worn on their sleeves and their caps."
