				"previous": "The event was organised as a round-robin tournament in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July. Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were Austria, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland and the USSR; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially.[7] All of the matches were played at Dynamo Minor Arena in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start,[3] and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams.[8] The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turfâ\"none of us had ever seen it before\", Chick recalled[8]âwere offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit.[9] They considered themselves serious underdogs and did not expect to win a medal.[8]",
				"after": "Zimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July.[10] Pat McKillop scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before Pat Davies, Linda Watson and Chase each added one more to round off a 4â0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2â2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2â0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1â1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.[5]",
