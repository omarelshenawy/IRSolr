The city has been one of history's most powerful and important centres, being the home of the emperor during the Roman Empire and the Italian government. The city also has a significant place in Christianity and is the present day home of the Roman Catholic Church and the site of the Vatican City, an independent city-state run by the Catholic Church.[3] Due to this, the city has often been nicknamed \"Caput Mundi\" (Latin for \"Capital of the World\")[4] and \"The Eternal City\". Also, Rome is widely regarded as one of the world's most beautiful ancient cities[5].",
