				"previous": "The year 1492 also marked the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World, during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, although he remained convinced that he had reached the Orient. The colonisation of the Americas started, with conquistadores like HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s and Francisco Pizarro. Miscegenation was the rule between the native and the European cultures and people.",
				"after": "As Renaissance New Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility, and the word EspaÃ±a, whose root is the ancient name Hispania, began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms.[31] With their wide-ranging political, legal, religious and military reforms, Spain emerged as the first world power.",
