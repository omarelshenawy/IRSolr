				"As of May 2015, the JetBlue Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft with an average age of 8.6 years:",
				"Nearly every plane in JetBlue's fleet (except for the transcontinental A321 fleet) is named with a designation containing some form of the word \"blue\" (the transcontinental A321 fleet uses variations of the word \"mint\" to denote their multi-class configuration), with four exceptions. The only plane that has not been named by a JetBlue employee is tail number N655JB, \"Blue 100,\" which was named by the company in celebration for JetBlue's 100th Airbus A320. Also, the plane had its own original tail fin."
