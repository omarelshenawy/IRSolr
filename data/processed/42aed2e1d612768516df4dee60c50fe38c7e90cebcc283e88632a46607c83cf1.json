				"previous": "In parts of Europe it is conventional to employ Roman numerals to represent the days of the week in hours-of-operation signs displayed in windows or on doors of businesses,[27] and also sometimes in railway and bus timetables. Monday is represented by I, which is the initial day of the week. Sunday is represented by VII, which is the final day of the week. The hours of operation signs are tables composed of two columns where the left column is the day of the week in Roman numerals and the right column is a range of hours of operation from starting time to closing time. In the sample chart (left), the business opens from 9Â AM to 5Â PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays; 10Â AM to 7Â PM on Tuesdays and Fridays; and to 1Â PM on Saturdays; and is closed on Sundays.",
				"after": "In several European countries Roman numerals are used for floor numbering.[28][29] For instance, apartments in central Amsterdam are indicated as 138-III, with both an Hindu-Arabic numeral (number of the block or house) and a Roman numeral (floor number). The apartment on the ground floor is indicated as '138-huis'.",
