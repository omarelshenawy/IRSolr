				"previous": "The United States Army used this lifesaving technique in Burma toward the end of World War II, using Sikorsky R-4B helicopters. The first helicopter rescue was by 2nd Lt Carter Harman, in Japanese-held Burma, who had to make several hops to get his Sikorsky YR-4B to the 1st Air Commando Group's secret airfield in enemy territory, then made four trips from there between April 25 and 26 in order to recover the American pilot and four injured British soldiers, one at a time.[3] The first medivac under fire was done in Manila in 1945 when five pilots evacuated 75-80 soldiers one or two at a time.[4]",
