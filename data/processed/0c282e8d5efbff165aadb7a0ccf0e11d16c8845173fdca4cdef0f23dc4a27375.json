Four members of the Association of American Universities are in Greater Boston (more than any other metropolitan area): Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, and Brandeis University.[195] Hospitals, universities, and research institutions in Greater Boston received more than $1.77 billion in National Institutes of Health grants in 2013, more money than any other American metropolitan area.[196] Greater Boston has more than 100 colleges and universities, with 250,000 students enrolled in Boston and Cambridge alone.[197] Its largest private universities include Boston University (the city's fourth-largest employer)[198] with its main campus along Commonwealth Avenue and a medical campus in the South End; Northeastern University in the Fenway area;[199] Suffolk University near Beacon Hill, which includes law school and business school;[200] and Boston College, which straddles the Boston (Brighton)âNewton border.[201] Boston's only public university is the University of Massachusetts Boston, on Columbia Point in Dorchester. Roxbury Community College and Bunker Hill Community College are the city's two public community colleges. Altogether, Boston's colleges and universities employ over 42,600 people, accounting for nearly 7 percent of the city's workforce.[202]",
