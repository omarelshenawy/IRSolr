				"previous": "Tremendous scientific and technological changes in Germany during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, together with the growth of the welfare state, created widespread hopes that utopia was at hand and that soon all social problems could be solved.[46] At the same time a racist, social Darwinist, and eugenicist world-view which declared some people to be more biologically valuable than others was common.[47] Historian Detlev Peukert states that the Shoah did not result solely from antisemitism, but was a product of the \"cumulative radicalization\" in which \"numerous smaller currents\" fed into the \"broad current\" that led to genocide.[48] After the First World War, the pre-war mood of optimism gave way to disillusionment as German bureaucrats found social problems to be more insoluble than previously thought, which in turn led them to place increasing emphasis on saving the biologically \"fit\" while the biologically \"unfit\" were to be written off.[49]",
				"after": "The economic strains of the Great Depression led many in the German medical establishment to advocate the idea of euthanisation of the \"incurable\" mentally and physically disabled as a cost-saving measure to free up money to care for the curable.[51] By the time the Nazis came to power in 1933, a tendency already existed in German social policy to save the racially \"valuable\" while seeking to rid society of the racially \"undesirable\".[52]",
