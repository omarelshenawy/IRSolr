Hodge arrived in Incheon to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel.[55] Appointed as military governor, General Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK 1945â48).[58] He established control by restoring to power the key Japanese colonial administrators, but in the face of Korean protests he quickly reversed this decision.[59] The USAMGIK refused to recognize the provisional government of the short-lived People's Republic of Korea (PRK) because it suspected it was communist.",
