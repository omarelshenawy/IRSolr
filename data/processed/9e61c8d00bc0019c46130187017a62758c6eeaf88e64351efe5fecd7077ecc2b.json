				"previous": "There were two views on the role the IMF should assume as a global economic institution. British economist John Maynard Keynes imagined that the IMF would be a coÃ¶perative fund upon which member states could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through periodic crises. This view suggested an IMF that helped governments and to act as the U.S. government had during the New Deal in response to World War II. American delegate Harry Dexter White foresaw an IMF that functioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay their debts on time.[22] Most of White's plan was incorporated into the final acts adopted at Bretton Woods.",
				"after": "The IMF formally came into existence on 27 December 1945, when the first 29 countries ratified its Articles of Agreement.[23] By the end of 1946 the IMF had grown to 39 members.[24] On 1 March 1947, the IMF began its financial operations,[25] and on 8 May France became the first country to borrow from it.[24]",
