				"previous": "According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 28.0 square miles (73Â km2) with 22.0 square miles (57Â km2) being land and the remaining (21.54%) being water. Erie is home to Presque Isle State Park (known to the locals as \"The Peninsula\"), a peninsula that juts into Lake Erie and has 7 miles (11Â km) of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.",
				"after": "Erie is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown area.[16] The downtown buildings are separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.[16] The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral at 265 feet (81Â m) and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at 198 feet (60Â m) tall. Erie has generally small ethnic neighborhoods including Little Italy. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.",
