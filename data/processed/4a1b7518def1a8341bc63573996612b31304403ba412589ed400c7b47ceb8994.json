				"previous": "Nicosia, Beirut and Cairo were soon added to the airline's international flight destinations. However, domestic services remained the Turkish carrier's main focus until the early 1960s.[11]",
				"after": "In 1956, the Turkish government reorganized the airline under the name TÃ¼rk Hava Yollari A.O. (often abbreviated as THY).[9] It was capitalized at TRL 60 million. The airline joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA) shortly thereafter. In 1957, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) began supplying technical support after acquiring a 6.5 percent shareholding, which it held for about 20 years.[11]",
