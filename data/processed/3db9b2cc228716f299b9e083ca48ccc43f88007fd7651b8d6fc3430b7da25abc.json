				"previous": "With the field rugged computers, GPS and laser rangefinders, it is possible to perform mapping directly in the terrain.",
				"after": "In understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1Â inch to 1 mile) \"Ordnance Survey\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail.",
