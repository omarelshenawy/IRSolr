				"after": "Madonna performed \"Erotica\" as the opening song on The Girlie Show World Tour (1993). The show opened with a topless dancer slithering down a metal pole that was dangling high above the stage.[41] Then Madonna emerged onto the stage, dressed as a black-masked dominatrix to perform \"Erotica\".[41] According to Stuart Lenig in his book The Twisted Tale of Glam Rock, the song had a \"lush, clubby orchestration,\" and during the performance Madonna rubbed a riding crop between her legs as her backup dancers \"posed and danced suggestively.\"[41] When reviewing the performance, John Pareles from The New York Times commented that \"through her own achievement, or her own fault, the shock value has abated...and when her dance troupe acts out the suggestions in her songs, like the ethereal 'Put your hands all over my body' in 'Erotica', the choreography suggests exercises rather than unbridled passion.\"[42]",
