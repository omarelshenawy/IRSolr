				"Don Douglas stated in a 1935 article on the DC-2 that the first DC-1 cost $325,000 to design and build.[5]",
				"Donald Douglas was initially reluctant to participate in the invitation from TWA. He doubted that there would be a market for 100 aircraft, the number of sales necessary to cover development costs. Nevertheless, he submitted a design consisting of an all-metal, low-wing, twin-engined aircraft seating 12 passengers, a crew of two and a flight attendant. The aircraft exceeded the specifications of TWA even with two engines. It was insulated against noise, heated, and fully capable of both flying and performing a controlled takeoff or landing on one engine."

				"after": "Only one aircraft was produced. The prototype made its maiden flight on July 1, 1933,[6] flown by Carl Cover. It was given the model name DC-1, derived from \"Douglas Commercial\". During a half-year of testing, it performed more than 200 test flights and demonstrated its superiority versus the most used airliners at that time, the Ford and Fokker Trimotors. It was flown across the United States, making the journey in the record time of 13 hours 5 minutes.",
