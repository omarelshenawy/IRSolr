Similar practices exist in other cultures, including the Chinese tradition of penjing from which the art originated, and the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese hÃ²n non bá». The Japanese tradition dates back over a thousand years, and has evolved its own unique aesthetics and terminology.",
