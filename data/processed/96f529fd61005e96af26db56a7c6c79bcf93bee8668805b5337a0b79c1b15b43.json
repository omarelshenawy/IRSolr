				"previous": "The closest living relative (though not a direct ancestor) of the GalÃ¡pagos giant tortoise is the Argentine tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis), a much smaller species from South America. The divergence between C.Â chilensis and C.Â nigra probably occurred 6â12Â million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern GalÃ¡pagos Islands 5Â million years ago.[57] Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (EspaÃ±ola and San CristÃ³bal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a \"stepping stone\" fashion via local currents.[58][59] Restricted gene flow between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern subspecies. The evolutionary relationships between the subspecies thus echo the volcanic history of the islands.[31]",
				"after": "Modern DNA methods have revealed new information on the relationships between the subspecies:",
