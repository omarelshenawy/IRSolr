				"after": "Christiaan Hendrik Persoon described this species as Agaricus myomyces var. pardinus in 1801, although he queried whether it was a distinct species.[2] However, the German naturalist Jacob Christian SchÃ¤ffer had in 1762 published Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur Icones,[3] in which he described a mushroom he called Agaricus tigrinus. The illustration accompanying the name fits what we now know as Tricholoma pardinum, although the description is less clear.[4] To confuse matters further, Elias Magnus Fries used the name Agaricus tigrinus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum,[5] in accordance with Bulliard's 1782 description, which now corresponds with Lentinus tigrinus.[4] In his 1838 work Epicrisis systematis mycologici: seu synopsis hymenomycetum, Fries assigned a different fungus again to the binomial name and linked it to SchÃ¤ffer's 1762 description.[6] French mycologist Lucien QuÃ©let reclassified it as a species in 1873, giving it its current binomial name.[7] Italian mycologist Alfredo Riva has noted that Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan provided a description forty years before QuÃ©let, in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse,[8] and queried why it was ignored. He has proposed the fungus be written as Tricholoma pardinum (Secr.) QuÃ©l.[4] However, Secretan's works are generally not recognised for nomenclatural purposes because he did not use binomial nomenclature consistently.[9][10]",
