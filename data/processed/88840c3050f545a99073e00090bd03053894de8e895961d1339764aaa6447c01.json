				"after": "Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction.[245] Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct,[246] and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species.[247] These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events.[248] The CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier PermianâTriassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction.[248] The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100â1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century.[249] Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event;[250] global warming may further accelerate it in the future.[251]",
