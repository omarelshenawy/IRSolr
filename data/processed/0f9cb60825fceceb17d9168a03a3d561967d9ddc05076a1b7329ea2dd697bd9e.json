				"previous": "On 1 August 1936, a pro-Republican rally of 20,000 people confronted Blum, demanding that he send aircraft to the Republicans, at the same time as right-wing politicians attacked Blum for supporting the Republic and being responsible for provoking Italian intervention on the side of Franco.[143] Germany informed the French ambassador in Berlin that Germany would hold France responsible if it supported \"the manoeuvres of Moscow\" by supporting the Republicans.[144] On 21 August 1936, France signed the Non-Intervention Agreement.[144]",
				"after": "However, the Blum government provided aircraft to the Republicans through covert means with Potez 54 bomber aircraft (nicknamed the 'Flying Coffin') by Spanish Republican pilots),[146] Dewoitine aircraft, and Loire 46 fighter aircraft being sent from 7 August 1936 to December of that year to Republican forces.[147] The French also sent pilots and engineers to the Republicans.[148] Also, until 8 September 1936, aircraft could freely pass from France into Spain if they were bought in other countries.[149]",
