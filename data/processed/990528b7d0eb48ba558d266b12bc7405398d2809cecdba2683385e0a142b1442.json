				"after": "The broad-billed parrot possessed a distinct frontal crest of feathers. Ridges on the skull indicate that this crest was firmly attached, and that the bird, unlike cockatoos, could not raise or lower it.[5] The 1601 Gelderland sketch was examined in 2003 by Hume, who compared the ink finish with the underlying pencil sketch and found that the latter showed several additional details. The pencil sketch depicts the crest as a tuft of rounded feathers attached to the front of the head at the base of the beak, and shows long primary covert feathers, large secondary feathers, and a slightly bifurcated tail.[15] Measurements of sub-fossils known by 1893 show that the mandible was 65â78Â mm (2.5â3Â in) in length, 65Â mm (2.5Â in) in width, the femur was 58â63Â mm (2.2â2.4Â in) in length, the tibia was 88â99Â mm (3.4â3.8Â in), and the metatarsus 35Â mm (1.3Â in).[11] Unlike other Mascarene parrots, the broad-billed parrot had a flattened skull.[5]",
