				"previous": "Due to confusion with synonyms during translation, some of the animals depicted by the English words did not exist in ancient China. For example, ç¾ can mean ram, sheep or Goat. Similarly, é¼  (Rat) can also be translated as mouse, as there are no distinctive words for the two genera in Chinese. Further, è±¬ (Pig) is sometimes translated to boar (çª) after its Japanese name, and ç plainly means cow or Ox, and not water buffalo, æ°´ç. é(Rooster) may mean chicken, hen or cock. However, Rooster is the most commonly used one among all the synonyms, same for ç¾, é¼ , etc.",
