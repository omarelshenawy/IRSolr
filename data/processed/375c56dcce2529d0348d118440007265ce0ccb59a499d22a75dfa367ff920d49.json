As a successful, highly trained woman artist who never married, Cassattâlike Ellen Day Hale, Elizabeth Coffin, Elizabeth Nourse and Cecilia Beauxâpersonified the \"New Woman\".[39] She \"initiated the profound beginnings in recreating the image of the 'new' women\", drawn from the influence of her intelligent and active mother, Katherine Cassatt, who believed in educating women to be knowledgeable and socially active. She is depicted in Reading 'Le Figaro' (1878).[40]",
