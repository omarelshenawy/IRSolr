				"previous": "Without an atomic line filter, laser tracking and communication may be difficult. Usually, intensified charge-coupled device cameras must be used in conjunction with simple dielectric optical filters (e.g. interference filters) to detect laser emissions at a distance. Intensified CCDs are inefficient and necessitate the use of a pulsed laser transmission within the visible spectrum. With the superior filtering system of an ALF, a non-intensified CCD may be used with a continuous wave laser more efficiently. \"[Atomic line filters] with passbands of about 0.001Â nm have been developed to improve the background rejection of conventionally filtered laser receivers\".[3] The total energy consumption of the latter system is \"30 to 35 times less\" than that of the former,[35] so space-based, underwater and agile laser communications with ALFs have been proposed and developed.[2][29]",
