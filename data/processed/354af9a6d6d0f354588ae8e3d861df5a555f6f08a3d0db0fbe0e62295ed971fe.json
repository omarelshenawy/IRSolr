				"previous": "Axial compressors, particularly near design conditions are, on the whole, amenable to analytical treatment, and usually a good estimate of their performance can be made before they are run. Away from the design points, the performances are conveniently thought of in terms of the overall characteristics of pressure-rises, temperature-rises, and efficiencies plotted against mass-flows.[5]",
				"after": "we can determine performance of axial compressor",
