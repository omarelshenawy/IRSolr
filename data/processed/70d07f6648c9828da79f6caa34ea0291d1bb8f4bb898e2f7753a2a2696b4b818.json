				"after": "Banksia aquilonia occurs in coastal areas of northern Queensland from the Cedar Bay National Park to Paluma Range National Park,[2] in areas with an annual rainfall of 1,000 to 4,000Â mm (39 to 157Â in).[16] It occurs from near sea level to an altitude of 1,000Â m (3,300Â ft), in a variety of habitats and aspects.[3] It grows in wet sclerophyll forest or rainforest margins,[5] on plateaus, ridges, slopes and low-lying swampy areas on sandy or rocky soils,[3] generally of granitic origin,[4] or sometimes clay.[3] It commonly grows with tree species such as the pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia), forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis), swamp turpentine (Lophostemon suaveolens), forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), and black sheoak (A.Â littoralis), and understorey species such as coin spot wattle (Acacia cincinnata) and yellow wattle (A.Â flavescens). Much of its lowland habitat in the Wet Tropics has been degraded or fragmented.[17] Although the range overlaps with B.Â dentata, the two species are not known to occur together.[4]",
