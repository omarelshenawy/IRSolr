				"after": "In the 1580s, Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb. Among these, the fragmentary Resurrection, now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel.[39] This work owes a clear debt to Michelangelo, who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the Medici chapels in Florence.[40] Pilon's statue of St Francis in Ecstasy now stands in the church of St Jean and St FranÃ§ois. In art historian Anthony Blunt's view, it marks a departure from the tension of Mannerism and \"almost foreshadows\" the Baroque.[41]",
