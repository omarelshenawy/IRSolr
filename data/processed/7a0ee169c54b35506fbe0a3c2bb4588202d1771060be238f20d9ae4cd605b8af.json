				"previous": "During December 1941, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt devised the name \"United Nations\" for the Allies. He referred to the Big Three and China as a \"trusteeship of the powerful\", and then later the \"Four Policemen\".[2] The Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942 was the basis of the modern United Nations (UN).[5] At the Potsdam Conference of JulyâAugust 1945, Roosevelt's successor, HarryÂ S. Truman, proposed that the foreign ministers of China, France, the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and the United States \"should draft the peace treaties and boundary settlements of Europe\", which led to the creation of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the \"Big Five\", and soon thereafter the establishment of those states as the permanent members of the UNSC.[6]",
