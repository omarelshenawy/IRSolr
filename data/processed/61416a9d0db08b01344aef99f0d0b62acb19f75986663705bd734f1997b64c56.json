				"Manitoba's capital is the city of Winnipeg.",
				"The name Manitoba comes from the aboriginal word \"manitou\" which means \"Great spirit\". Winnipeg, along with other regions in the province, has been known as the \"Gateway to the West\". Lake Winnipeg is the 11th largest lake in the world and 5th largest in Canada, and along with the sizable Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipegosis, makes up much of the province's nearly 100,000 kmÂ² of water area. Manitoba's most widely-used symbol is the Bison, used by the Province of Manitoba along with many sports teams and businesses located within the province. The animal used to roam freely over the vast prairie lands in southern Manitoba and was historically an integral part of trade between many Manitoba First Nations. Another symbol of the area is the Red River ox cart, used throughout most of the 19th century in the fur trade. One of the province's most historical locations is The Forks, the area located in downtown Winnipeg at the confluence of the Red River from the south and the Assiniboine River from the west, which for millennia was a meeting place for aboriginal groups in the area. The province has produced many well-known and successful hockey players, musicians, authors, and artists. Manitoba and its capital city have also been featured in many feature films and television shows, including recent films My Winnipeg and The Stone Angel, as well as The Simpsons episode \"Midnight Rx\"."
