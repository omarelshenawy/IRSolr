Gradec and Zagreb were united in 1851 by ban Josip JelaÄiÄ, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban JelaÄiÄ Square in his honour.[8] During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.[9]",
