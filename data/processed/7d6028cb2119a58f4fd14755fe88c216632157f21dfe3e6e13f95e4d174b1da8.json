				"previous": "Vietnam Airlines has its origins in JanuaryÂ 1956Â (1956-01),[7][8] when it was established by the North Vietnamese government under the name \"Vietnam Civil Aviation\" following the nationalization of Gia Lam Airport. It was instituted after the government signed the Decree No. 666/TTg.[9] The airline was created as part of the air force for civilian purposes with support from both the Soviet Union and China; initially, its fleet consisted of two Lisunov Li-2s that were later replaced by two Ilyushin Il-14 and three Aero Ae-45s.[10] This was due to an embargo that prohibited the airline from leasing and/or buying American technology or components.[11]",
				"after": "The airline's development and expansion was seriously hampered by the Vietnam War (1954â1975).[12] Following the war, its first international destination was Beijing, followed by Vientiane in 1976.[13] During that year, the airline was known as General Department of Civil Aviation in Vietnam, and began full operations; it carried around 21,000 passengers, one-third of whom were on international flights, and 3,000 tonnes (6,600,000Â lb) of cargo.[7] In 1978, another important destination of Vietnam Airlines was added, with flights offered to Bangkok.[13] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the expansion of the network to Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Singapore.[13]",
