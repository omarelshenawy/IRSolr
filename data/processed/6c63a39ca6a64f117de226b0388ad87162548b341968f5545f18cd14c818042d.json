The channel was launched on October 1, 1992, after Turner purchased the animation studio Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1991. It was originally a 24-hour outlet for classic animation properties from the Turner Broadcasting libraries and was all-ages-oriented which it broadcasts in time-sharing with TCM, but now the channel targets children and teens (about ages 7â15) and older teens and adults with mature content during its late night daypart Adult Swim, which is treated as a separate entity for promotional and ratings purposes.",
