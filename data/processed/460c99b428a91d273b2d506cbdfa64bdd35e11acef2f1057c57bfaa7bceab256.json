				"after": "\"Living for Love\" was written and produced by Madonna and Diplo, with additional writing from Maureen McDonald, Toby Gad, Ariel Rechtshaid, and U. Emenike. Madonna's collaboration with Diplo was revealed in May 2014 through an image on her Instagram showing her working on her laptop with him.[1] She had invited him for her annual Oscar party, and he could not make it. So he began texting with her about music and sent some music. Madonna replied with a 20-page text containing her anecdotes on the music. Following this they started collaborating for the album.[2] In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his \"craziest record\" for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that \"Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing... [S]he was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and Madonna was very open-minded to my ideas... she was down from day one.\"[3] According to Diplo, \"Living for Love\" had almost 20 versions ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM composition, ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromising on a middle level. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined for writing sessions with them, improving the verse of the song.[2][4] Madonna denied that there were 20 versions of the song, admitting it \"might be a little too high\", and commented how she wanted it to sound:",
