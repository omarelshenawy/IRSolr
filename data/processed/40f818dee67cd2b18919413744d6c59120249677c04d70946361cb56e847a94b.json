				"previous": "The airport consists of three terminals, with an overall number of 90 gates (of which some are currently out of use): Terminal A (gates A1-A30, which all are currently out of use), Terminal B (gates B31-B60) and Terminal C (gates C61-C90). SeaPort Airlines does not operate out of the main passenger terminal; they use the private aviation terminal. Kansas City closed Terminal A on January 8, 2014. Kansas City is considering a plan to tear down Terminal A and build a new Central Terminal there, but no formal announcement on that plan has been made yet.[19]",
