				"after": "The TAROM logo, representing a swallow in flight, has been used on all TAROM aircraft since 1954. In the 1970s livery the logo on the tail was painted in red, with a red cheatline. The livery introduced in the early 1990s (on the Airbus A310 aircraft) is a \"Eurowhite\" scheme with the titles and the tailfin painted in dark blue. Today's color scheme (introduced in 2006 on the A318) is a slightly modified version of the previous one, with an oversized logo on the tailfin, and the engine pods also painted in dark blue.",
