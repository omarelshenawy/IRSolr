Tacitus describes the \"Anglii\" as one of the more remote Suebic tribes compared to the Semnones and Langobardi, who lived on the Elbe and were better known to the Romans. He grouped the Angles with several other tribes in that region, the Reudigni, Aviones, Varini, Eudoses, Suarini and Nuitones.[1] These were all living behind ramparts of rivers and woods;[2] and therefore inaccessible to attack.",
