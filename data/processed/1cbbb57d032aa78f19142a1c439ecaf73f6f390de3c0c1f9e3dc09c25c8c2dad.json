				"after": "The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period.[20] This was first seen in manuscript illumination, which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism, perspective and skill in rendering colour,[21] peaking with the Limbourg brothers and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G, to whom the most significant leaves of the Turin-Milan Hours are usually attributed.[22] Although his identity has not been definitively established, Hand G, who contributed c. 1420, is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother Hubert. According to Georges Hulin de Loo, Hand G's contributions to the Turin-Milan Hours \"constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book, and, for their period, the most astounding work known to the history of art.\"[23]",
