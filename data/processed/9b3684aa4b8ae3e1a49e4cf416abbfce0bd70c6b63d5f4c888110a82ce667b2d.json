				"previous": "The fruiting structure is a stout woody \"cone\", with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts.[1] Up to 70 woody follicles, each of which contains a single seed, may be embedded in the cone. As with other Banksia species, only a small proportion of flowers go on to form follicles; in the case of B.Â telmatiaea, the proportion is around 4% for those \"cones\" that set some fruit. However, about 80% of fruiting structures set no fruit at all. According to John K. Scott, \"there [is] no obvious reason on the basis of morphology of pollination for this lack of seed set\".[3]",
