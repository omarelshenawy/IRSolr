				"previous": "The first rural cemetery in the United StatesâMount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusettsâwas developed in the 1830s.[4] Rural cemeteries are burial grounds typically located on the fringe of a city that offer a natural setting for interment of the dead. The development of rural cemeteries followed closely with the English garden movement of the early 19thÂ century.[4]",
				"after": "The Troy Cemetery Association was formed on September 9, 1848; John Paine, D. Thomas Vail, Isaac McConihe, George M. Tibbits, John B. Gale, and Stephen E. Warren were elected its trustees. It was the first rural cemetery association incorporated under an 1847 law authorizing the incorporation of such associations.[6] The trustees appointed a committee to report on an eligible location for a cemetery and on September 5, 1849, the first parcel of land was purchased.[7] On October 16, 1850, the land of the cemetery was consecrated[8] and Oakwood became the fourth rural cemetery founded in New York.[6] The Association is made up of lot owners who are elected by fellow lot owners; the position is voluntary and receives no pay.[2]",
