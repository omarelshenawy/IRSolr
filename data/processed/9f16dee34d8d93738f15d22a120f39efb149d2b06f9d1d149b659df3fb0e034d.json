				"previous": "Though Braniff had been the US launch customer in 1964 for the British-built BAC One-Eleven, in 1965 Lawrence ordered twelve new US-built Boeing 727s and cancelled most of the remaining One-Eleven orders. The 727s had been selected before Lawrence's arrival, but no orders had been placed. These planes were the C model, which had a large freight loading door at the front of the aircraft. This allowed Braniff to begin late-night cargo service, while the aircraft carried passengers during the day. This doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open a new cargo business, AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a cargo/passenger configuration if needed.",
				"after": "In 1970 Braniff accepted delivery of the 100th Boeing 747 builtâa 747-127, N601BNâand began \"jumbo jet\" flights from Dallas to Hawaii on January 15, 1971. This plane, dubbed \"747 Braniff Place\" and \"The Most Exclusive Address In The Sky\", was Braniff's flagship, and it flew an unprecedented 15 hours per day with a 99 percent dispatch reliability rate.[1] In 1978 N601BN flew the first flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to London.[1]",
