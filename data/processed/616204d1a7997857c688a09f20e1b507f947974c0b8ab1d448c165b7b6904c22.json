				"after": "The Pinta Island subspecies (abingdonii, now extinct) has been found to be most closely related to the subspecies on the islands of San CristÃ³bal (chathamensis) and EspaÃ±ola (hoodensis) which lie over 300Â km (190Â mi) away,[31] rather than that on the neighbouring island of Isabela as previously assumed. This relationship is attributable to dispersal by the strong local current from San CristÃ³bal towards Pinta.[64] This discovery informed further attempts to preserve the abingdonii lineage and the search for an appropriate mate for Lonesome George, who had been penned with females from Isabela.[65] Hope was bolstered by the discovery of an abingdonii hybrid male in the VolcÃ¡n Wolf population on northern Isabela, raising the possibility that there are more undiscovered living Pinta descendants.[66]",
