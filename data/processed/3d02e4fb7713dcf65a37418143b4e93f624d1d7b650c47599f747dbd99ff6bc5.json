Six minor injuries were reported, and damage totaled about $100,000 (2002Â USD, $131Â thousand 2015Â USD).[7]",
				"after": "On the same day that Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam, President George W. Bush declared the island a major disaster area.[11] Around the time of the cyclone passing over the island, 2,271Â residents were in shelters, and by the next day it increased to 3,467 after people discovered their homes were uninhabitable.[7] With thirteen Red Cross shelters across Guam,[12] most remained in shelters for about three weeks before disaster tents were distributed.[7] The American Red Cross worked with the United States Department of Agriculture to provide meals for shelter attendees for a two-week period following the typhoon.[12] Through the collaboration of federal and other agencies, disaster assistance on Guam totaled over $300Â million (2003Â USD, $335Â million 2007Â USD) by 100Â days after the typhoon struck, including $60Â million (2002Â USD, $78.7Â million 2015Â USD) in initial disaster response. Nearly 29,000Â individuals registered for disaster assistance, with the first assistance check arrived ten days after the disaster declaration. By three months after the storm, the United States Small Business Administration approved $130Â million (2003Â USD, $167Â million 2015Â USD) in low-interest loans.[1]",
