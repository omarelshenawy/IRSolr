				"after": "The species is found in New South Wales (Australia) from the Watagan Mountains southward to Ulladulla, with a relatively widespread distribution in the Central Coast region.[4] It usually occurs as an understory shrub in open forest on sandy soils in areas with moderately high rainfall,[3] receiving on average around 1200Â mm (50Â in) a year.[18] Dappled shade from eucalyptus (Eucalyptus) trees reduces sunlight by around 30%.[5] Much of its range occurs in the Sydney Basin, an area with one of the highest human populations and most intense development in Australia. The impact of habitat fragmentation and decreased fire interval (time between bushfires) on the gene pool of Telopea speciosissima, which relies on outcrossing, is unclear. Although largely protected within National Parks and conservation reserves in the Sydney area, most populations are small, numbering under 200 plants, and are often located near urban developments.[16]",
