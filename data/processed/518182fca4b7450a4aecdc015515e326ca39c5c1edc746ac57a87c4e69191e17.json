				"previous": "Ireland has a wealth of structures,[133] surviving in various states of preservation, from the Neolithic period, such as BrÃº na BÃ³inne, Poulnabrone dolmen, Castlestrange stone, Turoe stone, and Drombeg stone circle.[134] As the Romans never conquered Ireland, architecture of Greco-Roman origin is extremely rare. The country instead had an extended period of Iron Age architecture.[135] The Irish round tower originated during the Early Medieval period.",
				"after": "Christianity introduced simple monastic houses, such as Clonmacnoise, Skellig Michael and Scattery Island. A stylistic similarity has been remarked between these double monasteries and those of the Copts of Egypt.[136] Gaelic kings and aristocrats occupied ringforts or crannÃ³gs.[137] Church reforms during the 12th century via the Cistercians stimulated continental influence, with the Romanesque styled Mellifont, Boyle and Tintern abbeys.[138] Gaelic settlement had been limited to the Monastic proto-towns, such as Kells, where the current street pattern preserves the original circular settlement outline to some extent.[139] Significant urban settlements only developed following the period of Viking invasions.[137] The major Hiberno-Norse Longphorts were located on the coast, but with minor inland fluvial settlements, such as the eponymous Longford.",
