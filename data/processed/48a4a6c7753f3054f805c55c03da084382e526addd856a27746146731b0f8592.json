He will forever be known as \"Dollar Mark\", thanks to Homer Davenport and many other columnists who drew him as a malevolent presence.[119] McKinley biographer Margaret Leech regretted Davenport's effect on the former president's image: \"the representation of McKinley as pitiable and victimized was a poor service to his reputation. The graphic impression of his spineless subservience to Hanna would long outlive the lies of [Journal columnist] Alfred Henry Lewis.\"[121]",
