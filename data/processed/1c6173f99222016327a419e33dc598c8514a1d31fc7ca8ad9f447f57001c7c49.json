When the French orientalist Ernest Renan visited the area in 1860, he noticed that the Awali bridge abutments were built of finely rusticated blocks that originated from an earlier structure. He also noted in his report, Mission de PhÃ©nicie, that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the Awali bridge.[20]",
