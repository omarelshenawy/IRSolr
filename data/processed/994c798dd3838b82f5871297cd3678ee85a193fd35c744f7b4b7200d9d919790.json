At its peak in the 19th century, Omani influence or control extended across the Strait of Hormuz to Iran, and modern day Pakistan, and as far south as Zanzibar. Oman has long-standing military and political ties with the United Kingdom and the United States, although it maintains an independent foreign policy.",
