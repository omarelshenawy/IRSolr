The wing of the female was 180â190Â mm (7â7.4Â in), the tail 100Â mm (4Â in), the culmen 33Â mm (1.3Â in), and the tarsus was 60Â mm (2.3Â in).[15] Adult Choiseul pigeons of both sexes were blue-grey overall with a buffy orange belly.[9] The pigeon had a distinctive long, rounded crest that had a hairy texture. This crest, like the crown, was slaty-blue and emerged from the bird's hindcrown.[11] Though many artists have speculated, it is unknown how the pigeon held its crest in life as Meek's notes did not cover this subject. John Gerrard Keulemans (who produced the illustration accompanying Rothschild's original description), depicted the crest as being flat based on Meek's specimens; other artists have presented it as spread and scraggly like that of the crowned pigeons.[16] It has been suggested that the crests of the museum specimens were flattened during preparation.[15]",
