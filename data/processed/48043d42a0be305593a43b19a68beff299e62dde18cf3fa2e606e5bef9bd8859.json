				"after": "The Age of Enlightenment was a European affair. The 17th century \"Age of Reason\" opened the avenues to the decisive steps towards modern science, which took place during the 18th century \"Age of Enlightenment\". Directly based on the works[103] of Newton, Descartes, Pascal and Leibniz, the way was now clear to the development of modern mathematics, physics and technology by the generation of Benjamin Franklin (1706â1790), Leonhard Euler (1707â1783), Mikhail Lomonosov (1711â1765) and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717â1783), epitomized in the appearance of Denis Diderot's EncyclopÃ©die between 1751 and 1772. The impact of this process was not limited to science and technology, but affected philosophy (Immanuel Kant, David Hume), religion (the increasingly significant impact of science upon religion), and society and politics in general (Adam Smith, Voltaire), the French Revolution of 1789 setting a bloody cesura indicating the beginning of political modernity[citation needed]. The early modern period is seen as a flowering of the European Renaissance, in what is often known as the Scientific Revolution, viewed as a foundation of modern science.[104]",
