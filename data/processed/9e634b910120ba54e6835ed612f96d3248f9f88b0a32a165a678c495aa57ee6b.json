The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851 and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the Methodist Church.[17] In 1892 Trinity College moved to Durham, largely due to generosity from Julian S. Carr and Washington Duke, powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco and electrical industries.[7] Carr donated land in 1892 for the original Durham campus, which is now known as East Campus. At the same time, Washington Duke gave the school $85,000 for an initial endowment and construction costsâlater augmenting his generosity with three separate $100,000 contributions in 1896, 1899, and 1900âwith the stipulation that the college \"open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men.\"[18]",
