				"previous": "Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism[212][213][214][215] and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, markets, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property),[203] and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production,[216][217] direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\".[218][219]",
				"after": "Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.[220][221][222][223] Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.[224][225][226]",
