				"previous": "Several rare species and subspecies, too, have been recorded as causing problems. The Carnaby's black cockatoo, a threatened Western Australian endemic, has been considered a pest in pine plantations where the birds chew off the leading shoots of growing pine trees, resulting in bent trunks and reduced timber value.[89] They are also known to damage nut and fruit crops,[90] and have learnt to exploit canola crops.[91] The Baudin's black cockatoo, also endemic to the south-west of Western Australia, can be a pest in apple and pear orchards where it destroys the fruit to extract the seeds.[89] Muir's corella, the nominate subspecies of the western corella, is also a declared pest of agriculture in Western Australia, as well as being nationally vulnerable and listed under state legislation as being \"rare or likely to become extinct\".[92]",
				"after": "According to the IUCN and BirdLife International, seven species of cockatoo are considered to be vulnerable or worse and one is considered to be near threatened.[95][96] Of these, two speciesâthe red-vented cockatoo and the yellow-crested cockatooâare considered to be critically endangered.[97]",
