				"after": "The ordinate y of the Mercator projection becomes infinite at the poles and the map must be truncated at some latitude less than ninety degrees. This need not be done symmetrically. Mercator's original map is truncated at 80Â°N and 66Â°S with the result that European countries were moved towards the centre of the map. The aspect ratio of his map is 198/120=1.65. Even more extreme truncations have been used: a Finnish school atlas was truncated at approximately 76Â°N and 56Â°S, an aspect ratio of 1.97.",
