				"after": "In 1858, geologist Ebenezer Emmons described two large fossil teeth found in Bladen County, North Carolina.[30] Emmons assigned these teeth to Polyptychodon, which he then believed to be \"a genus of crocodilian reptiles\".[30] Later discoveries showed that Polyptychodon was actually a pliosaur, a type of marine reptile.[13] The teeth described by Emmons were thick, slightly curved, and covered with vertically grooved enamel; he assigned them a new species name, P. rugosus.[30] Although not initially recognized as such, these teeth were probably the first Deinosuchus remains to be scientifically described.[13] Another large tooth that likely came from Deinosuchus, discovered in neighboring Sampson County, was named Polydectes biturgidus by Edward Drinker Cope in 1869.[13]",
