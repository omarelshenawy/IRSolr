				"after": "The vowels of Australian English can be divided according to length. The long vowels, which include monophthongs and diphthongs, mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of Received Pronunciation (RP) as well as its centring diphthongs. The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels. There exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving Australian English phonemic length distinction, which is unusual amongst the various dialects of English, though not unknown elsewhere, such as in regional south-eastern dialects of the UK and eastern seaboard dialects in the US.[12] As with General American and New Zealand English, the weak-vowel merger is complete in Australian English: unstressed /Éª/ (sometimes written as /É¨/ or /áµ»/) is merged into /É/ (schwa), unless it is followed by a velar consonant.",
