				"On October 21, 2012, Aegean Airlines announced that it had struck a deal to acquire Olympic Air,[9] and the buyout was approved by the European Commission a year later, on 9 October 2013.[10] Both carriers continue to operate under separate brands.[11] In addition, Aegean Airlines participated in the final stages of the tender for the privatization of Cyprus Airways, the national carrier of Cyprus.[12] Following the bankruptcy of Cyprus Airways, Aegean Airways plans to establish a hub at Larnaca Airport, thus initiating scheduled flights to and from the island to various destinations and filling the service gap created by the services termination of Cyprus Airways."
