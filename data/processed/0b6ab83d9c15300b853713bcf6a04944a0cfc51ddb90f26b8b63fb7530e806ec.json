				"previous": "While within-country income inequality has increased throughout the globalization period, globally inequality has lessened as developing countries have experienced much more rapid growth.[28] Economic inequality varies between societies, historical periods, economic structures or economic systems, ongoing or past wars, between genders, and between differences in individuals' abilities to create wealth.[29] Among the various numerical indices for measuring economic inequality, the Gini coefficient is most often-cited.",
				"after": "Economic inequality affects equity, equality of outcome and subsequent equality of opportunity. Although earlier studies considered economic inequality as necessary and beneficial,[31] some economists see it as an important social problem.[32] Early studies suggesting that greater equality inhibits economic growth did not account for lags between inequality changes and growth changes.[33] Later studies claimed that one of the most robust determinants of sustained economic growth is the level of income inequality.[30]",
