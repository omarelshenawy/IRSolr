				"after": "Wales cites Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek's essay, \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\", which he read as an undergraduate,[24] as \"central\" to his thinking about \"how to manage the Wikipedia project\".[16] Hayek argued that information is decentralizedâthat each individual only knows a small fraction of what is known collectivelyâand that as a result, decisions are best made by those with local knowledge, rather than by a central authority.[16] Wales reconsidered Hayek's essay in the 1990s, while reading about the open source movement, which advocated for the free distribution of free software. He was particularly moved by \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\", an essay, which was later adapted into a book, by one of the founders of the movement, Eric S. Raymond, as it \"opened [his] eyes to the possibilities of mass collaboration.\"[24]",
