				"previous": "A variation of this proof does not require the use of the maximum modulus principle (in fact, the same argument with minor changes also gives a proof of the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions). If we assume by contradiction that aÂ := p(z0) â  0, then, expanding p(z) in powers of z â z0 we can write",
				"after": "Here, the cj are simply the coefficients of the polynomial z â p(z + z0), and we let k be the index of the first coefficient following the constant term that is non-zero. But now we see that for z sufficiently close to z0 this has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial , in the sense that (as is easy to check) the function is bounded by some positive constant M in some neighborhood of z0. Therefore if we define and let , then for any sufficiently small positive number r (so that the bound M mentioned above holds), using the triangle inequality we see that",
