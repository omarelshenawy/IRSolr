				"previous": "On April 7, 1967, TWA became one of the USA's first all-jet airlines with the retirement of their last Lockheed L-749A Constellation and L-1649 Starliner cargo aircraft. That morning, throughout the TWA system, aircraft ground-service personnel placed a booklet on every passenger seat titled \"Props Are For Boats.\"",
				"after": "In 1967-72, TWA was the world's third-largest airline by passenger-miles, behind Aeroflot and United. In 1969, TWA carried the most transatlantic passengers of any airline; until then Pan American World Airways had always been number one. In the Transpacific Route Case of 1969, TWA was given authority to fly across the Pacific to Hawaii and Taiwan, and for a few years TWA had a round-the-world network.[17]",
