To avoid crossing nations internally, the IDL deviates west around the US Aleutian Islands, separating them from islands in the far east of Russia, and further south, it deviates east around various island nations in the Pacific such as Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and Tokelau. These various deviations, east or west, generally accommodate the political and/or economic affiliations of the affected areas.",
