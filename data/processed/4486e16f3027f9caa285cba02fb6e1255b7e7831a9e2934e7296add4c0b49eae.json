				"previous": "The archaeological site at the Amman Citadel, also called Jabal al-Qal'a in Arabic, shows evidence of continuous occupation from the Middle Bronze Age to occupation by the Mamluks. It is a major tourist attraction in Amman.[30]",
				"after": "The New York Times praised the cuisine of Amman. \"Youâll find the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordanâs neighbor, Iraq. Itâs known as the food of the LevantÂ â an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isnât just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity.\"[31]",
