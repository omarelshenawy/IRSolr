Terminal 3 was initially advertised as \"Trillium Terminal 3\" and the \"Trillium Terminal\". It was built as a private venture and was a state-of-the-art terminal containing a U.S. customs preclearance facility, among other things. A parking garage and hotel is located across from the terminal and is connected by an elevated pedestrian walkway. At the time of the opening, the hotel was managed by SwissÃ´tel. However, it was rebranded as a Sheraton property in October 1993.[36] In 1997, the GTAA purchased Terminal 3 and shortly thereafter implemented a C$350 million expansion.[37]",
