Strike Wing adopted its badge from the former No. 485 Squadron RAF of the Second World War. When Strike Wing disbanded with the retirement of the Skyhawks, a new name had to be found for the supervisory wing, as Strike Wing at Ohakea needed to merge with the Operations Wing in Auckland. The result was that the World War II numbering of the original squadron was chosen.",
