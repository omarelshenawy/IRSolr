He composed it as an audition piece for the position of director of church music in Leipzig, and first performed it in a church service there at St. Thomas (pictured) on 7 February 1723. The work begins with a scene from the Gospels in which Jesus predicts his suffering in Jerusalem. The unknown poet of the cantata text took the scene as a starting point for reflections in which the contemporary Christian takes the place of the disciples who do not understand what Jesus is telling them. The closing chorale is a stanza from Elisabeth Cruciger's \"Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn\". The work, structured in five movements, shows that Bach had mastered the composition of a dramatic scene, an expressive aria with obbligato oboe, a recitative with strings, an exuberant dance, and a chorale in the style of Johann Kuhnau, his predecessor in Leipzig. According to the Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones, elements such as a \"frame of biblical text and chorale around the operatic forms of aria and recitative\" became standards for Bach's Leipzig cantatas and even his Passions.
