				"after": "The Zapata rail is a Cuban endemic restricted to the northern part of the 4500Â km2 (1740Â mi2) Zapata Swamp, which is also the only location for the Zapata wren,[14] and the nominate subspecies of the Zapata sparrow.[15] The favoured habitat of the Zapata rail is flooded vegetation, 1.5â2.0Â m (60â80Â in) tall, consisting of tangled, bush-covered swamp and low trees, and preferably near higher ground. Typical plants of the swamp are wax myrtle, the willow Salix longipes, the sawgrass Cladium jamaicensis, and the narrow leaf cattail.[12]",
