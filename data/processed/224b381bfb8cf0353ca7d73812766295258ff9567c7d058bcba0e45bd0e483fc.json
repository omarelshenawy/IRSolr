				"after": "The term \"Romance\" comes from the Vulgar Latin adverb romanice, derived from Romanicus: for instance, in the expression romanice loqui, \"to speak in Roman\" (that is, the Latin vernacular), contrasted with latine loqui, \"to speak in Latin\" (Medieval Latin, the conservative version of the language used in writing and formal contexts or as a lingua franca), and with barbarice loqui, \"to speak in Barbarian\" (the non-Latin languages of the peoples living outside the Roman Empire).[5] From this adverb the noun romance originated, which applied initially to anything written romanice, or \"in the Roman vernacular\".",
