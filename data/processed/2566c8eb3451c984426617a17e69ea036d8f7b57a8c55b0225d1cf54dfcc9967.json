				"after": "Boeing began work on pressurized long-range bombers in 1938, when, in response to a United States Army Air Corps request, it produced a design study for the Model 334, a pressurized derivative of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress with nosewheel undercarriage. Although the Air Corps did not have money to pursue the design, Boeing continued development with its own funds as a private venture,[4] so that when, in December 1939, the Air Corps issued a formal specification for a so-called \"superbomber\", capable of delivering 20,000Â lb (9,100Â kg) of bombs to a target 2,667Â mi (4,290Â km) away and capable of flying at a speed of 400Â mph (640Â km/h), they formed a starting point for Boeing's response.[5]",
