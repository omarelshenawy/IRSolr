He is also the one who gave them the name \"X-rays\" (signifying an unknown quantity[57]) though many others referred to these as \"RÃ¶ntgen rays\" (and the associated X-ray radiograms as, \"RÃ¶ntgenograms\") for several decades after their discovery and even to this day in some languages, including RÃ¶ntgen's native German.",
