				"previous": "Banksia ericifolia depends on fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and eventually die out.[30] However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around six years to reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15â30Â years.[31] For a large part of its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas.[32][33] The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.[30]",
				"after": "Banksia ericifolia is listed in Part 1 Group 1 of Schedule 13 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974; this means that as a common and secure species it is exempted from any licensing or tagging requirements under the 2002â2005 management plan to minimise and regulate the use of protected and threatened plants in the cut-flower industry in New South Wales.[34]",
