				"after": "Flocke was born at the Nuremberg Zoo on 11 December 2007 to Vera (born 2002 in Moscow) and Felix (born 2001 in Vienna).[1] Felix also mated with Vera's sister Vilma, who gave birth some weeks earlier in November to what officials thought were two cubs. Zookeepers, enforcing a strict non-interference policy, were not able to determine exactly how many cubs were born.[2] The zoo reportedly did not wish to create a media circus similar to the one that surrounded Knut, an orphaned polar bear at the Berlin Zoo who became an international celebrity the previous year.[3] Days after the zoo reaffirmed its non-interference policy, mass circulation daily Bild ran a story with a headline reading \"Why Won't Anyone Save the Cute Baby Knuts in Nuremberg Zoo?\"[4]",
