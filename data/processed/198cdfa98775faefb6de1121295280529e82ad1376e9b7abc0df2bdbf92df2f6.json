Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the College's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty.[88] The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking faÃ§ade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.[89] Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium.[88] The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes (\"Hinman boxes\")[90] and the Courtyard CafÃ© dining facility.[91] The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation,[92] and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.[93]",
