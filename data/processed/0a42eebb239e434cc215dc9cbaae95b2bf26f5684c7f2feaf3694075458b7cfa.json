Being among one of Pittsburghâs largest tourist destinations, it attracts more than three million people annually. It is also frequented by Pittsburgh natives because of its many shops, restaurants and live performances. The retail development was built at the location of a former station on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, with some of the original structures such as the freight house building and the elegant concourse being converted into restaurants and a shopping mall. Proximity to a stop on the Port Authority of Allegheny County 'T' Pittsburgh Light Railsystem, and the dock for the Gateway Clipper Fleet of local river cruise boats makes Station Square a major parking and jumping-off point for activities and events around the city. The property is operated by Forest City Enterprises.",
