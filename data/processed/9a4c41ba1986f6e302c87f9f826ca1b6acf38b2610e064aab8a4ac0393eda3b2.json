				"after": "Kolkata is known for its literary, artistic, and revolutionary heritage; as the former capital of India, it was the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought.[200] Kolkata has been called the \"City of Furious, Creative Energy\"[201] as well as the \"cultural [or literary] capital of India\".[202][203] The presence of paras, which are neighbourhoods that possess a strong sense of community, is characteristic of the city.[204] Typically, each para has its own community club and, on occasion, a playing field.[204] Residents engage in addas, or leisurely chats, that often take the form of freestyle intellectual conversation.[205][206] The city has a tradition of political graffiti depicting everything from outrageous slander to witty banter and limericks, caricatures, and propaganda.[207][208]",
