Madelung co-invented the ribbon parachute, a device used to stabilise the V-1 in its terminal dive.[citation needed] Schmidt's prototype bomb failed to meet German Air Ministry specifications, especially owing to poor accuracy, range and high cost. The original Schmidt design had the pulsejet placed in a fuselage like a modern jet fighter, unlike the eventual V-1 which had the engine placed above the warhead and fuselage.",
