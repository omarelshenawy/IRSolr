				"previous": "Families such as the Imagawa were influential in the development of warrior ethics and were widely quoted by other lords during their lifetime. The writings of Imagawa Sadayo were highly respected and sought out by Tokugawa Ieyasu as the source of Japanese Feudal Law. These writings were a required study among traditional Japanese until World War II.[citation needed]",
				"after": "Historian H. Paul Varley notes the description of Japan given by Jesuit leader St. Francis Xavier (1506â1552): \"There is no nation in the world which fears death less.\" Xavier further describes the honour and manners of the people: \"I fancy that there are no people in the world more punctilious about their honour than the Japanese, for they will not put up with a single insult or even a word spoken in anger.\" Xavier spent the years 1549â1551 converting Japanese to Christianity. He also observed: \"The Japanese are much braver and more warlike than the people of China, Korea, Ternate and all of the other nations around the Philippines.\"[24]",
