				"after": "Portrait of a Young Girl is a small oil-on-oak panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus, housed in the GemÃ¤ldegalerie, Berlin. Christus completed the work towards the end of his life, between 1465 and 1470.[1][2] The work is a major stylistic advance in the oeuvres of both Christus and contemporary portraiture. The girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional and realistic setting,[3] and stares out at the viewer with an expression that is reserved yet alert and intelligent.[4]",
