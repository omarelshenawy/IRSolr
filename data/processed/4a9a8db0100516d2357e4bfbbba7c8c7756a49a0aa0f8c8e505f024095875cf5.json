A preliminary version of the X-51, the \"Ground Demonstrator Engine No. 2\", completed wind tunnel tests at the NASA Langley Research Center on 27 July 2006.[12] Testing continued there until a simulated X-51 flight at Mach 5 was successfully completed on 30 April 2007.[13][14] The testing is intended to observe acceleration between Mach 4 and Mach 6 and to demonstrate that hypersonic thrust \"isn't just luck\".[15][16] Four test flights were initially planned for 2009, but the first captive flight of the X-51A on a B-52 was not conducted until 9 December 2009,[17][18] with further captive flights in early 2010.[19][20]",
