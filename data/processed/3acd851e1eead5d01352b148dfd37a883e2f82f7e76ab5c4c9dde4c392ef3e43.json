				"In 1989 Piedmont merged with USAir; the new merged operations kept the USAir name.",
				"In the mid-1980s the old terminal site was converted to a cargo center, and the central concourse and Eastern 'unit terminal' were removed to make way for more cargo buildings. The original main building still stands and is used for office space. The old control tower was removed in the late 1990s."

				"after": "In 1990, a new 80,000-square-foot (7,400Â m2) international and commuter concourse (Concourse D) opened, and in 1991 further expansion of the central terminal building continued, reflective of USAir's dominating presence at the airport. A monumental bronze statue of Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (the namesake of the city), created by Raymond Kaskey, was placed in front of the main terminal.",
