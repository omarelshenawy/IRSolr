The Matabele unrest led to what has become known as 'Gukurahundi' (Shona: \"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains\")[44] or the Matabeleland Massacres, which lasted from 1982 until 1985. It has been estimated that at least 20,000 Matabele were murdered and tens of thousands of others were tortured in military internment camps.[45] The slaughter only ended after Nkomo and Mugabe reached a unity agreement in 1987 that merged their respective parties, creating the Zimbabwe African National Union â Patriotic Front (ZANUâPF).[46][47]",
