				"previous": "The Comet was involved in 26 hull-loss accidents, including 13 fatal crashes which resulted in 426 fatalities.[173] Pilot error was blamed for the type's first fatal accident, which occurred during takeoff at Karachi, Pakistan on 3 March 1953 and involved a Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A.[81] Three fatal Comet 1 crashes due to structural problems, specifically BOAC Flight 783/057 on 2 May 1953, BOAC Flight 781 on 10 January 1954, and South African Airways Flight 201 on 8 April 1954, led to the grounding of the entire Comet fleet. After design modifications were implemented, Comet services resumed in 1958.[81]",
				"after": "Pilot error resulting in controlled flight into terrain was blamed for five fatal Comet 4 accidents: an AerolÃ­neas Argentinas crash near AsunciÃ³n, Paraguay on 27 August 1959, AerolÃ­neas Argentinas Flight 322 at Campinas near SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil on 23 November 1961, United Arab Airlines Flight 869 in Thailand's Khao Yai mountains on 19 July 1962, a Saudi Arabian Government crash in the Italian Alps on 20 March 1963, and United Arab Airlines Flight 844 in Tripoli, Libya on 2 January 1971.[81] The Dan-Air de Havilland Comet crash in Spain's Montseny range on 3 July 1970 was attributed to navigational errors by air traffic control and pilots.[174] Other fatal Comet 4 accidents include a British European Airways crash in Ankara, Turkey following instrument failure on 21 December 1961, United Arab Airlines Flight 869 during inclement weather near Bombay, India on 28 July 1963, and the terrorist bombing of Cyprus Airways Flight 284 off the Turkish coast on 12 October 1967.[81]",
