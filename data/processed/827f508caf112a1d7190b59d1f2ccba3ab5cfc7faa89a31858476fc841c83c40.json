				"where:",
				"The equation for viscous resistance or linear drag is appropriate for objects or particles moving through a fluid at relatively slow speeds where there is no turbulence (i.e. low Reynolds number, ).[17] Note that purely laminar flow only exists up to Re = 0.1 under this definition. In this case, the force of drag is approximately proportional to velocity, but opposite in direction. The equation for viscous resistance is:[18]"

			"after": [
				"The resulting expression for the drag is known as Stokes' drag:[19]",
				"For example, consider a small sphere with radius = 0.5 micrometre (diameter = 1.0Â Âµm) moving through water at a velocity of 10Â Âµm/s. Using 10â3 PaÂ·s as the dynamic viscosity of water in SI units, we find a drag force of 0.09 pN. This is about the drag force that a bacterium experiences as it swims through water."
