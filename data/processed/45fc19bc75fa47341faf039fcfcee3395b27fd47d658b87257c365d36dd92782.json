				"previous": "The first Mail coach ran in 1784, operating between Bristol and London. Delivery staff received uniforms for the first time in 1793, and the Post Office Investigation Branch was established; it is the world's oldest recognised criminal investigations authority. The first mail train ran in 1830, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The Post Office's Money order system was introduced in 1838.[17]",
				"after": "In December 1839 the first substantial reform started when postage rates were revised by the short-lived Uniform Fourpenny Post.[18] Greater changes took place when the Uniform Penny Post was introduced on 10 January 1840 whereby a single rate for delivery anywhere in Great Britain and Ireland was pre-paid by the sender.[19] A few months later, to certify that postage had been paid on a letter, the sender could affix the first adhesive postage stamp, the Penny Black that was available for use from 6 May the same year.[20] Other innovations were the introduction of pre-paid William Mulready designed postal stationery letter sheets and envelopes.[21]",
