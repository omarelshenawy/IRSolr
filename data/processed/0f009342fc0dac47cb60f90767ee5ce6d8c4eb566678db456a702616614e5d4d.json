The -200 was rolled out on June 29, 1967, and entered service at United in April 1968. The 737-200 Advanced is an improved version of the -200, introduced into service by All Nippon Airways on May 20, 1971.[108] The -200 Advanced has improved aerodynamics, automatic wheel brakes, more powerful engines, more fuel capacity, and longer range than the -200.[109] Boeing also provided the 737-200C (Convertible), which allowed for conversion between passenger and cargo use and the 737-200QC (Quick Change), which facilitated a rapid conversion between roles. The 1,095th and last delivery of a -200 series aircraft was in August 1988 to Xiamen Airlines.[1][58] Many 737-200s have been phased out due to fuel efficiency, and higher maintenance costs than newer 737 versions.[citation needed] In July 2014, there were a combined 116 Boeing 737-200s in service, mostly with \"second and third tier\" airlines, and those of developing nations.[110]",
