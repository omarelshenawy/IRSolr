The failure of these systems can have catastrophic consequences, as in the case of Austral LÃ­neas AÃ©reas Flight 2553, Birgenair Flight 301 (investigators suspected that some kind of insect could have created a nest inside the pitot tube: the prime suspect is the black and yellow mud dauber wasp), Northwest Airlines Flight 6231, AeroperÃº Flight 603 (blocked static port), and of one X-31.[5] The French air safety authority BEA said that pitot tube icing was a contributing factor in the crash of Air France Flight 447 into the Atlantic Ocean.[6] In 2008 Air CaraÃ¯bes reported two incidents of pitot tube icing malfunctions on its A330s.[7]",
