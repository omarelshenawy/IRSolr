				"previous": "Gardner sent the prints along with the original glass-plate negatives to Harold Snelling, a photography expert. Snelling's opinion was that \"the two negatives are entirely genuine, unfaked photographsÂ ... [with] no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models\".[7] He did not go so far as to say that the photographs showed fairies, stating only that \"these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time\".[8] Gardner had the prints \"clarified\" by Snelling, and new negatives produced, \"more conducive to printing\",[5][6] for use in the illustrated lectures he gave around the UK.[6] Snelling supplied the photographic prints which were available for sale at Gardner's lectures.[9][10]",
				"after": "Author and prominent Spiritualist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle learned of the photographs from the editor of the Spiritualists' publication Light.[11] He had been commissioned by The Strand Magazine to write an article on fairies for their Christmas issue, and the fairy photographs \"must have seemed like a godsend\" according to broadcaster and historian Magnus Magnusson. Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs, and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article. Arthur Wright was \"obviously impressed\" that Doyle was involved, and gave his permission for publication, but he refused payment on the grounds that, if genuine, the images should not be \"soiled\" by money.[12]",
