				"In July 2010, Alitalia joined Air France, KLM and Delta's transatlantic Joint Venture, meaning that the profits from flights across the Atlantic are shared between the four airlines.[68]",
				"Alitalia has been in the SkyTeam alliance since 2009; Alitalia-LAI originally joined in 2001.[66] Alitalia has since arranged code-share agreements with SkyTeam members, allowing passengers to fly to numerous destinations (with some or all segments operated by airlines other than Alitalia) using a single Alitalia ticket.[67]"
