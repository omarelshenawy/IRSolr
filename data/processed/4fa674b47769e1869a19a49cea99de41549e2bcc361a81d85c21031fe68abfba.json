				"previous": "Outside the breeding season, the typical male's head and neck decorations and the bare facial skin are lost and the legs and bill become duller. The upperparts are grey-brown, and the underparts are white with grey mottling on the breast and flanks.[10]",
				"after": "The female, or \"reeve\", is 22â26Â cm (8.7â10.2Â in) long with a 46â49Â cm (18.1â19.32Â in) wingspan,[10] and weighs about 110Â g (3.9Â oz).[12] In breeding plumage, she has grey-brown upperparts with white-fringed, dark-centred feathers. The breast and flanks are variably blotched with black. In winter, her plumage is similar to that of the male, but the sexes are distinguishable on size.[3] The plumage of the juvenile ruff resembles the non-breeding adult, but has upperparts with a neat, scale-like pattern with dark feather centres, and a strong buff tinge to the underparts.[10]",
