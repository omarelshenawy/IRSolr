In hot and arid regions, day-foraging ants face death by desiccation, so the ability to find the shortest route back to the nest reduces that risk. Diurnal desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis such as the Sahara desert ant navigate by keeping track of direction as well as distance travelled. Distances travelled are measured using an internal pedometer that keeps count of the steps taken [102] and also by evaluating the movement of objects in their visual field (optical flow).[103] Directions are measured using the position of the sun.[104] They integrate this information to find the shortest route back to their nest.[105] Like all ants, they can also make use of visual landmarks when available [106] as well as olfactory and tactile cues to navigate.[107][108] Some species of ant are able to use the Earth's magnetic field for navigation.[109] The compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the Sun, which is used to determine direction.[110][111] These polarization detectors are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum.[112] In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column sometimes may turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion.[113]",
