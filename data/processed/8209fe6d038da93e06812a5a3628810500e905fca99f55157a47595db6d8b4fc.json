				"In January 2007, the U.S. Air Force formally launched the KC-X program with a request for proposal (RFP). KC-X is first phase of three acquisition programs to replace the KC-135 fleet.[30] On 29 February 2008, the US Defense Department announced that it had selected the EADS/Northrop Grumman \"KC-30\" (to be designated the KC-45A) over the Boeing KC-767.[31][32][33] Boeing protested the award on 11 March 2008, citing irregularities in the competition and bid evaluation.[34] On 18 June 2008, the US Government Accountability Office sustained Boeing's protest of the selection of the Northrop Grumman/EADS's tanker.[35] In February 2010, the US Air Force restarted the KC-X competition with the release of a revised request for proposal (RFP).[36][37] After evaluating bids, the USAF selected Boeing's 767-based tanker design, with the military designation KC-46, as a replacement in February 2011.[38]"
