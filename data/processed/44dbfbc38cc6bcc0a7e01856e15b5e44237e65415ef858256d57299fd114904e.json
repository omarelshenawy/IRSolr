Sockeye salmon, Coho and Chinook (also known as \"king\") salmon, and steelhead, all of the genus Oncorhynchus, are ocean fish that migrate up the rivers at the end of their life cycles to spawn.[140] White sturgeon, which take 15 to 25Â years to mature, typically migrate between the ocean and the upstream habitat several times during their lives.[141]",
