				"previous": "Smoluchowski's theory of Brownian motion[15] starts from the same premise as that of Einstein and derives the same probability distribution Ï(x, t) for the displacement of a Brownian particle along the x in time t. He therefore gets the same expression for the mean squared displacement: . However, when he relates it to a particle of mass m moving at a velocity u which is the result of a frictional force governed by Stokes's law, he finds",
				"after": "where Î¼ is the viscosity coefficient, and a is the radius of the particle. Associating the kinetic energy with the thermal energy RT/N, the expression for the mean squared displacement is 64/27 times that found by Einstein. The fraction 27/64 was commented on by Arnold Sommerfeld in his necrology on Smoluchowski: \"The numerical coefficient of Einstein, which differs from Smoluchowski by 27/64 can only be put in doubt.\"[16]",
