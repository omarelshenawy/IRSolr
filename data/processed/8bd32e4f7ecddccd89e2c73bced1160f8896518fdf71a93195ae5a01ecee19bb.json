				"previous": "Both buildings boasted towers and edifices of similar design. The complementary names and purposes of these buildings reflected the School's founding principles of valuing both theory and practice, while their similar appearance emphasized the equal standing of these principles. Construction work, contracted by Angus McGilvray with his low bid of US$43,250 ($Â 1.14Â million in 2015), began with the Academic Building in June 1887; the building was completed in September 1888. The Shop Building, completed shortly afterward, was destroyed by fire in 1892 and rebuilt more modestly without a tower.[2] Following this, the Academic Building, later known as Tech Tower,[10] became the oldest building on the Georgia Tech campus, a distinction it continues to hold more than a century later.[1]",
