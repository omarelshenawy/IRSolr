				"previous": "Blond Afros occur in 10% of the population in the islands.[37] After years of questions, studies have resulted in the better understanding of the blond gene. The findings show that the blond hair trait is due to an amino acid change of protein TYRP1.[38] This, therefore, accounts for the highest occurrence of blond hair outside of European influence in the world.[39] While 10% of Solomon Island's people display the gene variation, about 26% of the population carry it as well.[40]",
			"after": [
				"Education in Solomon Islands is not compulsory and only 60 percent of school-age children have access to primary education.[41][42]",
				"From 1990 to 1994, the gross primary school enrolment rose from 84.5 percent to 96.6 percent.[41] Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Solomon Islands as of 2001.[41] While enrolment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect children's participation in school.[41]"
