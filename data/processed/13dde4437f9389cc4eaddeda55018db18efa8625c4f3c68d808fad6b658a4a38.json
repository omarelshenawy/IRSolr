				"previous": "The parish of Exmoor Forest was part of the Hundred of Williton and Freemanners.[56]",
				"after": "During the Middle Ages, sheep farming for the wool trade came to dominate the economy. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During the 16th and 17th centuries the commons were overstocked with agisted livestock, from farmers outside the immediate area who were charged for the privilege. This led to disputes about the number of animals allowed and the enclosure of land.[57] In the mid-17th century James Boevey was the warden. The house that he built at Simonsbath was the only one in the forest for 150 years.[58] When the royal forest was sold off in 1818, John Knight bought the Simonsbath House and the accompanying farm for Â£50,000. He set about converting the royal forest into agricultural land.[57] He and his family also built most of the large farms in the central section of the moor as well as 35.4Â km (22.0Â mi) of metalled access roads to Simonsbath and a 46.7Â km (29.0Â mi) wall around his estate, much of which still survives.[59]",
