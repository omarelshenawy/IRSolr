				"previous": "Early Byzantine art was also marked by the cultivation of ivory carving.[21] Ivory diptychs, often elaborately decorated, were issued as gifts by newly appointed consuls.[22] Silver plates were another important form of luxury art:[23] among the most lavish from this period is the Missorium of Theodosius I.[24] Sarcophagi continued to be produced in great numbers.",
				"after": "Significant changes in Byzantine art coincided with the reign of Justinian I (527â565). Justinian devoted much of his reign to reconquering Italy, North Africa and Spain. He also laid the foundations of the imperial absolutism of the Byzantine state, codifying its laws and imposing his religious views on all his subjects by law.[25]",
