				"A lattice element y is said to cover another element x, if y>x, but there does not exist a z such that y>z>x. Here, y>x means x â¤ y and x â  y.",
				"A lattice (L,â¤) is called graded, sometimes ranked (but see this article for an alternative meaning), if it can be equipped with a rank function r from L to â, sometimes to â¤, compatible with the ordering (so r(x)<r(y) whenever x<y) such that whenever y covers x, then r(y)=r(x)+1. The value of the rank function for a lattice element is called its rank."
