				"after": "San DiegoâTijuana is an international and cosmopolitan metropolitan area centered on the two global cities San Diego, California, United States and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. The metropolitan region is centered on the bays and coast of the Pacific Ocean, shared between Mexico and the United States. San DiegoâTijuana traditionally consists of four sub-state entities. These are San Diego County, Tijuana Municipality, Rosarito Beach Municipality, and Tecate Municipality. Ensenada's proximity to the region has allowed some to call for its inclusion; developing projects further closing the gap between Tijuana and Ensenada are allowing for this. The ties within the region are so strong that at least 300,000 people commute between the centers daily. San Diego has historically been the cultural and economic center of the region, though Tijuana is presently the larger city and contemporary industrial and medical manufacture center.",
