				"previous": "Boeing had been studying short-haul jet aircraft designs and wanted to produce another aircraft to supplement the 727 on short and thin routes.[8] Preliminary design work began on May 11, 1964,[9] and Boeing's intense market research yielded plans for a 50- to 60-passenger airliner for routes 50 to 1,000Â mi (80 to 1,609Â km) long.[8][10] Lufthansa became the launch customer on February 19, 1965,[11] with an order for 21 aircraft, worth $67Â million[12] in 1965, after the airline received assurances from Boeing that the 737 project would not be canceled.[13] Consultation with Lufthansa over the previous winter resulted in an increase in capacity to 100 seats.[11]",
				"after": "On April 5, 1965, Boeing announced an order by United Airlines for 40 737s. United wanted a slightly larger airplane than the 737-100. So Boeing stretched the fuselage 91 centimeters (36Â in) ahead of, and 102Â cm (40Â in) behind the wing.[14] The longer version was designated 737-200, with the original short-body aircraft becoming the 737-100.[15]",
