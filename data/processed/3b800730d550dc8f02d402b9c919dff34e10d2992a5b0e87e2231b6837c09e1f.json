				"previous": "The term \"artillery\" has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal guidance systems, preferring the term \"missilery\",[citation needed] though some modern artillery units employ surface-to-surface missiles. Advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large-caliber guided projectiles to be developed, blurring this distinction.",
				"after": "One of the most important roles of logistics is the supply of munitions as a primary type of artillery consumable, their storage and the provision of fuses, detonators and warheads at the point where artillery troops will assemble the charge, projectile, bomb or shell.",
