				"after": "Fox remains a prominent figure in Canadian folklore. His determination united the nation; people from all walks of life lent their support to his run and his memory inspires pride in all regions of the country.[75] A 1999 national survey named him as Canada's greatest hero,[76] and he finished second to Tommy Douglas in the 2004 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program The Greatest Canadian.[77] Fox's heroic status has been attributed to his image as an ordinary person attempting a remarkable and inspirational feat.[78][79] Others have argued that Fox's greatness derives from his audacious vision, his determined pursuit of his goal, his ability to overcome challenges such as his lack of experience and the very loneliness of his venture.[78][80] As Fox's advocate on The Greatest Canadian, media personality Sook-Yin Lee compared him to a classic hero, Phidippides, the runner who delivered the news of the Battle of Marathon before dying, and asserted that Fox \"embodies the most cherished Canadian values: compassion, commitment, perseverance\". She highlighted the juxtaposition between his celebrity, brought about by the unforgettable image he created, and his rejection of the trappings of that celebrity.[81] Typically amongst Canadian icons, Fox is an unconventional hero, admired but not without flaws.[82] An obituary in the Canadian Family Physician emphasized his humanity and noted that his angerÂ â at his diagnosis, at press misrepresentations and at those he saw as encroaching on his independenceÂ â spoke against ascribing sainthood for Fox, and thus placed his achievements within the reach of all.[78]",
