				"previous": "Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of Yasada or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala and written about the year 1374.[62] Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India.[10][63] The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century.[63]",
				"after": "Alchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a condenser. Some alchemists called this zinc oxide lana philosophica, Latin for \"philosopher's wool\", because it collected in wooly tufts, whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it nix album.[64]",
