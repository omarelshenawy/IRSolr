				"after": "In the early nineteenth century, the original Norman castle had been enlarged and refashioned by Henry Holland for the 1st Marquess, the 3rd Marquess's great-grandfather. The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work. The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\",[74] and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale.[70] Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale,[75] creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\"[67]",
