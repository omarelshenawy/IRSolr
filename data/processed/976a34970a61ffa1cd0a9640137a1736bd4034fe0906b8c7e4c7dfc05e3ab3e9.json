				"previous": "Demand for zapiekanki fell with the reintroduction of market economy in the 1990s, but remained on the menus of some of those \"small gastronomy\" establishments that survived the competition with large fast food chains. Some zapiekanka stands even attained cult following, such as those located in Plac Nowy (New Square) in the Kazimierz district of KrakÃ³w. Once a Jewish neighborhood, Kazimierz declined into desolation following the Holocaust, but experienced a revival after Steven Spielberg shot his 1993 film, Schindler's List, on location there.[8]:133 The district became a tourist attraction and then, a nightlife hub. The round brick building constructed in 1900 in the middle of the square, which used to house a kosher butcher's shop, now serves as an outdoor food court operating into the wee hours, with numerous stalls serving all kinds of zapiekanki to partygoers made hungry by a night of revelry.[8]:17,76",
