				"previous": "\"Bullfrog\" was the name Frank \"Shorty\" Harris and Ernest \"Ed\" Cross, the prospectors who started the Bullfrog gold rush, gave to their mine. As quoted by Robert D. McCracken in A History of Beatty, Nevada, Harris said during a 1930 interview for Westways magazine, \"The rock was green, almost like turquoise, spotted with big chunks of yellow metal, and looked a lot like the back of a frog.\"[5] The Bullfrog Mining District, the Bullfrog Hills, the town of Bullfrog, and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine.[6]",
				"after": "\"Bullfrog\" became so popular that Giant Bullfrog, Bullfrog Merger, Bullfrog Apex, Bullfrog Annex, Bullfrog Gold Dollar, Bullfrog Mogul, and most of the district's other 200 or so mining companies included \"Bullfrog\" in their names.[7] The name persisted and, decades later, was given to the short-lived Bullfrog County.[8]",
