				"after": "The Wii Mini (stylized as Wii mini) is a smaller, redesigned Wii with a top-loading disc drive. This model lacks YPBPR (component video/D-Terminal), S-Video, RGB SCART output, Nintendo GameCube compatibility, online connectivity, the SD card slot and Wi-Fi support, and has only one USB port unlike the previous models' two.[223][224] The initial release omitted a pack-in game, but Mario Kart Wii was included at no extra charge beginning on September 18, 2013 in Canada[225] and from launch in the United States.[9] It was released in Canada on December 7, 2012 with a MSRP of C$99.99,[7] in Europe on March 22, 2013,[8] and in the United States on November 17, 2013.[9] Nintendo uses this console and the Nintendo Selects game series to promote low cost gaming. The Wii Mini is styled in matte black with a red border, and includes a red Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk. A composite video/audio cable, wired sensor bar and power adapter are also included.[226]",
