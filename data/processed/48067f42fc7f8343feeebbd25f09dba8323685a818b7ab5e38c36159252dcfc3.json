Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away.[262] In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that \"yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter\" and ordered his troops to retreat to BÃ©xar and await further instructions.[259]",
