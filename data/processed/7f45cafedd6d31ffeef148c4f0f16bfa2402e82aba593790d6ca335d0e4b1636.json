Discussions focus on multiple areas,[16] such as the level at which open-source hardware is defined,[17] ways to collaborate in hardware development, as well as a model for sustainable development by making open-source appropriate technology.[18][19] In addition there has been considerable work to produce open-source hardware for scientific hardware using a combination of open-source electronics and 3-D printing.[20][21]",
