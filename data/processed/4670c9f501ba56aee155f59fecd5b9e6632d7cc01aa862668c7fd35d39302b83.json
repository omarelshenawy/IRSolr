				"after": "The Appaloosa is best known for its distinctive, preferred leopard complex spotted coat. Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base coat colors. There are three other distinctive, \"core\" characteristics: mottled skin, striped hooves, and eyes with a white sclera.[1] Skin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle, eyes, anus, and genitalia.[2] Striped hooves are a common trait, quite noticeable on Appaloosas, but not unique to the breed.[3] The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the iris; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back, to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds.[3] Because the occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern, the ApHC allows \"regular\" registration of horses with mottled skin plus at least one of the other core characteristics. Horses with two ApHC parents but no \"identifiable Appaloosa characteristics\" are registered as \"non-characteristic,\" a limited special registration status.[1]",
