				"previous": "When BuÃ±uel was just four and a half months old, the family moved to Zaragoza, where they were one of the wealthiest families in town.[12]:p.22 In Zaragoza, BuÃ±uel received a strict Jesuit education at the private Colegio del Salvador.[12]:pp.23â36 After being kicked and insulted by the study hall proctor before a final exam, BuÃ±uel refused to return to the school.[15] He told his mother he had been expelled, which was not true; in fact, he had received the highest marks on his world history exam.[16] BuÃ±uel finished the last two years of his high school education at the local public school.[15] Even as a child, BuÃ±uel was something of a cinematic showman; friends from that period described productions in which BuÃ±uel would project shadows on a screen using a magic lantern and a bedsheet.[17] He also excelled at boxing and playing the violin.[2]",
				"after": "In his youth, BuÃ±uel was deeply religious, serving at Mass and taking Communion every day, until, at age 16, he grew disgusted with what he perceived as the illogicality of the Church, along with its power and wealth.[18]:p.292",
