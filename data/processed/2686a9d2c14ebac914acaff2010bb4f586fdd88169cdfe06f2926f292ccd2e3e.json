				"after": "The influence of this period of Scandinavian settlement can still be seen in the North of England and the East Midlands, and is particularly evident in place-names: name endings such as -howe, -by (meaning \"village\") or -thorp (\"hamlet\") having Norse origins. There seems to be a remarkable number of Kirby/Kirkby names, some with remains of Anglo-Saxon building[24] indicating both a Norse origin and early church building.[25] Scandinavian names blended with the English -ton give rise to typical hybrid place-names.[26]",
