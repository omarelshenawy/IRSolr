				"previous": "Many of the reception rooms have painted ceilings copied from Italian palazzi, most notably from the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. The largest room in the house is the Music Room, which opens onto the east portico. The ceiling fresco in this room depicts the \"Banquet of the Gods\" and was copied from the Villa Farnesina. The Saloon, which occupies the centre of the north front, contains many marbles, including statuettes of the four seasons. The ceiling depicting \"The Council of the Gods and the Admission of Psyche\" is also a copy from Villa Farnesina.",
				"after": "The Dining Room walls are painted faux jasper and hold paintings of the house's patronâSir Francis Dashwoodâand his fellow members of the Divan Club (a society for those who had visited the Ottoman Empire). The room also has a painted ceiling from Wood's Palmyra.",
