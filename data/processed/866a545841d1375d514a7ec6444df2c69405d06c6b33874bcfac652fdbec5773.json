				"previous": "In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. Given migration of other groups into Florida, by 1960 the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%.[96]",
				"after": "The most common languages spoken in Florida are English and Spanish. English is the state's official language, a position that was added to the Florida Constitution in 1988 in response to the state's growing Spanish-speaking Hispanic population. But 27% of Florida's population speaks a mother language other than English, and over 200 first languages other than English are spoken at home in the state.[97][98]",
