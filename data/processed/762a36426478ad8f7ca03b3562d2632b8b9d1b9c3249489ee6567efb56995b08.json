				"after": "A total of 184 B90 models were produced before the Model C90 was introduced in 1971,[3] with wingspan increased over earlier models by 4Â ft 11Â in (1.50Â m) to 50Â ft 3 in (15.32 m), Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) increased by 350Â lb (160Â kg) to 9,650Â lb (4,378Â kg), and PT6A-20A engines. The broadly similar Model E90 was introduced the following year, with PT6A-28 engines; the two were produced in parallel. Further refinement of the 90 series resulted in the Model F90 and follow-on Model F90-1. The F-models featured the T-tail of the Model 200 King Air mated to the fuselage and wings of the E90, with PT6A-135 engines of 750 shp (560Â kW) driving four-bladed propellers. The F90 prototype flew on 16 January 1978 and 203 production versions followed between 1979 and 1983, when the F90 was superseded by the F90-1.[3] The F90 prototype was re-engined with Garrett AiResearch TPE-331 engines to test the feasibility of a Model G90, but this model was not put into production.",
