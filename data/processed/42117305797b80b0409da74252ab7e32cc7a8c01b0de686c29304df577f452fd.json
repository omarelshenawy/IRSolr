There are several well-known swimming locations. These include Deep Eddy Pool, Texas' oldest man-made swimming pool, and Barton Springs Pool, the nation's largest natural swimming pool in an urban area.[136][137] Barton Springs Pool is spring-fed while Deep Eddy is well-fed. Both range in temperature from about 68.0Â Â°F (20.0Â Â°C) during the winter to about 71.6Â Â°F (22.0Â Â°C) during the summer.[138][139][140] Hippie Hollow Park, a county park situated along Lake Travis, is the only officially sanctioned clothing-optional public park in Texas. Activities include rockclimbing, kayaking, swimming, mountain biking, exploring, and hiking along the greenbelt, a long-spanning area that runs through the city. Zilker Park, a large green area close to downtown, forms part of the greenbelt along the Colorado River. Hamilton Pool is a pool and wildlife park located about 30 minutes from the city.[141]",
