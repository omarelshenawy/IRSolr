				"previous": "Six years later, the college's board of trustees decided to erect a building to house the college's new scientific programs.[1]:p.101 At this time, Rutgers was celebrating the centennial anniversary of its second charter (1770) and college president William Henry Campbell (1808â1890) solicited donations from alumni and other supporters in an extensive fundraising effort aimed at supporting these new programs.[3] With these funds, the trustees commissioned a design for a Geological Hall from Henry Janeway Hardenbergh (1847â1918), a young architect from New Brunswick.[1]:p.101[5] Hardenbergh received these contracts through family connections, as several members of his family were graduates, trustees, or associated with the school. His great-great-grandfather, the Rev. Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh (1736â1790), was Rutgers' first president and one of its founders, and his grandfather, Rev. Jacob Janeway served as vice president of the college and had turned down the post of president in 1840.[5][6]",
				"after": "Hardenbergh's design was described as employing both Gothic elements and classical forms that preceded the extreme eclecticism that was to mark a later Victorian Gothic Revival period.[7] The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick,[7] but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark.[8] Geology Hall, built on the south side of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) that housed the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) the year before. The third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.[5]",
