				"after": "Madonna performed the song during the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, as the second song on the opening segment of the show. \"Nobody Knows Me\" was rehearsed with the Peter Rauhofer's Private Life remix.[36] According to Dirk Timmerman, author of Madonna Live! Secret Re-inventions and Confessions on Tour, Madonna lip-synched the performance.[37] During this section, the singer wore a jewel encrusted corset, created by designer Christian Lacroix.[38][39] After the opening number, \"Vogue\", she started an energetic version of the song, on a conveyor belt with some laser light words appearing on the backdrop screens behind her.[40] It also features a giant catwalk lowered from the ceiling.[41] After this performance, she performed \"Frozen\" alone on stage.[42] The performance of \"Nobody Knows Me\" was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.[43]",
