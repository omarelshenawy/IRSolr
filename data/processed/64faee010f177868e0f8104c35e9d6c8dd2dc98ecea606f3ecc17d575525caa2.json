				"previous": "Cooper's career during the post-war years drifted in new directions as American society was changing.[225] While he still played conventional heroic roles, his films now relied less on his heroic screen persona and more on novel stories and exotic settings.[226] In November 1945, Cooper appeared in Sam Wood's nineteenth century period drama Saratoga Trunk with Ingrid Bergman, about a Texas cowboy and his relationship with a beautiful fortune-hunter.[227] Filmed in early 1943, the movie's release was delayed for two years due to the increased demand for war movies.[228] Despite poor reviews, Saratoga Trunk did well at the box office[229] and became one of Paramount's top money-makers of the year.[230] Cooper's only film in 1946 was Fritz Lang's romantic thriller Cloak and Dagger, about a mild-mannered physics professor recruited by the OSS during the last years of World War II to investigate the German atomic bomb program.[231] Playing a part loosely based on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer,[232] Cooper was uneasy with the role and was unable to convey the \"inner sense\" of the character.[233] The film received poor reviews and was a box-office failure.[234] In 1947, Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille's epic adventure film Unconquered with Paulette Goddard, about a Virginia militiaman who defends settlers against an unscrupulous gun trader and hostile Indians on the Western frontier during the eighteenth century.[235] The film received mixed reviews, but even long-time DeMille critic James Agee acknowledged the picture had \"some authentic flavor of the period\".[236] This last of four films made with DeMille was Cooper's most lucrative, earning the actor over $300,000 in salary and percentage of profits.[237] Unconquered would be his last unqualified box-office success for the next five years.[236]",
				"after": "In 1948, after making Leo McCarey's romantic comedy Good Sam,[238] Cooper sold his company to Universal Studios and signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed $295,000 per picture.[239] His first film under the new contract was King Vidor's drama The Fountainhead (1949) with Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey.[240] In the film, Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism in the face of societal pressures to conform to popular standards.[241] Based on the novel by Ayn Rand who also wrote the screenplay, the film reflects her Objectivist philosophy and attacks the concepts of altruism and collectivism while promoting the virtues of selfishness and individualism.[242] For most critics, Cooper was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark.[243] In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther concluded he was \"Mr. Deeds out of his element\".[244] Cooper returned to his element in Delmer Daves' war drama Task Force (1949), about a retiring rear admiral who reminisces about his long career as a naval aviator and his role in the development of aircraft carriers.[245] Cooper's performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper's most popular during this period.[246] In the next two years, Cooper made four poorly received films: Michael Curtiz' period drama Bright Leaf (1950), Stuart Heisler's Western melodrama Dallas (1950), Henry Hathaway's wartime comedy You're in the Navy Now (1951), and Raoul Walsh's Western action film Distant Drums (1951).[247]",
