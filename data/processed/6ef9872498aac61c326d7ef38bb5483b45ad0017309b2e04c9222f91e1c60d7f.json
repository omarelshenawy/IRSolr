				"after": "After Robert Cardus's death in 1900 the family moved several times, eventually breaking up altogether.[15] Cardus left school in 1901 and took a variety of short-term, unskilled jobs before finding more secure employment as a clerk with Flemings' marine insurance agency.[4][16] He lived for a time with his Aunt Beatrice[16] with whom, according to Brookes, he had at an early age \"embarked on a lifelong love affairÂ ... In his eyes she could do no wrong\".[17] A flamboyant character, Beatrice brought colour into Cardus's life; she encouraged him to read worthwhile books and her memory, Brookes asserts, \"remained a potent inspirational force\" throughout his later life as a writer.[18] She also bought him his first cricket bat.[19]",
