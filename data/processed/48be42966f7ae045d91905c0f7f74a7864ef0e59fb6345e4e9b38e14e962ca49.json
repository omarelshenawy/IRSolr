				"previous": "The area around Pithole, and modern-day Venango County, was formerly inhabited by Eries, who were eventually wiped out by the Iroquois in 1653.[22] On October 23, 1784, the Iroquois, which included the Seneca, ceded the land to Pennsylvania in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix.[23] Venango County was formed from portions of Allegheny and Lycoming counties on MarchÂ 12, 1800.[24] Cornplanter Township was settled in 1795 and was incorporated on November 28, 1833.[24]",
				"after": "In 1859, Edwin Drake successfully drilled the first oil well along the banks of Oil Creek, outside of Titusville in Crawford County. Within a half year, over 500Â wells were built along Oil Creek, in the 16-mile (26Â km) corridor from Titusville to the creek's mouth at the Allegheny River in Oil City.[8] Other wells were drilled down the Allegheny towards Franklin and upriver to Tionesta in Forest County. Pithole Creek did not attract the same attention from speculators and investors, who preferred to risk their money on the tried-and-true method of drilling on flatter terrain near large rivers like the Allegheny and Oil Creek, rather than gamble on rougher terrain.[25] In JanuaryÂ 1864, Isaiah Frazier leased two tracts of land, totaling 35 acres (14Â ha), from Thomas Holmden, a farmer along Pithole Creek. Frazier, James Faulkner Jr., Frederick W. Jones and J. Nelson Tappan formed the United States Petroleum Company in AprilÂ 1864 and started drilling what was dubbed the United States Well, or Frazier Well, in June. On January 7, 1865, the Frazier Well struck oil.[26]",
