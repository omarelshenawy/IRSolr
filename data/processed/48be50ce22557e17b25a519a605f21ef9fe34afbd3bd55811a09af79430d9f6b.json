				"previous": "In 1976, Cessna stopped marketing the aircraft as the 172 and began exclusively using the \"Skyhawk\" designation. This model year also saw a redesigned instrument panel to hold more avionics. Among other changes, the fuel and other small gauges are relocated to the left side for improved pilot readability compared with the earlier 172 panel designs. Total production of \"M\" models was 7306 over the four years it was manufactured.[14]",
				"after": "The Skyhawk N, or Skyhawk/100 as Cessna termed it, was introduced for the 1977 model year. The \"100\" designation indicated that it was powered by a Lycoming O-320-H2AD, 160 horsepower (119Â kW) engine designed to run on 100 octane fuel, whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel. Unfortunately, this engine proved troublesome and it was replaced by the similarly-rated O-320-D2J to create the 1981 172P.",
