				"previous": "The redback is mainly nocturnal;[24] the female remains concealed during the day, and spins her web during the night,[2] usually remaining in the same location for most of her adult life.[25] Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although the threads seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey.[26] The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments.[16] The vertical strands act as trip wires to initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare and haul prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around.[27] These webs are usually placed between two flat surfaces, one beneath the other.[28] The female spends more time in the funnel and less time moving around during cooler weather.[29]",
