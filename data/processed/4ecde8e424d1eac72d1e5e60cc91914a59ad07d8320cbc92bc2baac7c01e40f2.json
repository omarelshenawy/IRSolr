				"previous": "where is the identity matrix. It is a fundamental result of linear algebra that an equation has a non-zero solution if, and only if, the determinant of the matrix is zero. It follows that the eigenvalues of are precisely the real numbers that satisfy the equation",
				"after": "The left-hand side of this equation can be seen (using Leibniz' rule for the determinant) to be a polynomial function of the variable . The degree of this polynomial is , the order of the matrix. Its coefficients depend on the entries of , except that its term of degree is always . This polynomial is called the characteristic polynomial of ; and the above equation is called the characteristic equation (or, less often, the secular equation) of .",
