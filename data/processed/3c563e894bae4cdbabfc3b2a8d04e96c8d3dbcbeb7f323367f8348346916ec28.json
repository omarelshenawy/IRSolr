				"after": "While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there is no obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87Â Â±Â 10 (Between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually). However, the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere,[159] while noting that a significant downward trend in tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region near Australia (based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation).[160] In spite of that, there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. Kerry Emanuel stated, \"Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30Â years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime.\"[161]",
