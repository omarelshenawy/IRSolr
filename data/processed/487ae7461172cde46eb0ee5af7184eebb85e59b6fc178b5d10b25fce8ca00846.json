Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea,[73] and filaments form within their cells,[74] but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood.[75] In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.[76]",
