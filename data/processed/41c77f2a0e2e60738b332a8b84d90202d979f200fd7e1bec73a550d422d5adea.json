				"previous": "The original 10-metre, 32' pipe stayed in Switzerland and was built into a new organ in the MÃ¼nster Cathedral, which belongs to the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance. This pipe, capable of reproducing a tone of 16.35Â Hz, the bass note C0 four octaves below middle C, was recreated in Moscow and added to the cathedral's organ in 2009.[14]",
				"after": "The five church bells are located on the cathedral's roof behind a tripartite screen of lancet arches on the left side of the faÃ§ade. They were poured by the FelczyÅski bell foundry in PrzemyÅl, Poland and donated by bishop Wiktor Skworc[4][12] The bells are electronically activated. The largest weighs 900 kilograms (2,000Â lb) and bears the name \"Our Lady of FÃ¡tima\". The other bells are named, from the smallest to the largest: \"John PaulÂ II\"; \"St. Jude\", named after the patron saint of archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz; \"Anniversary-2000\"; and \"St. Victor\", named after the patron saint of Bishop Wiktor Skworc.[4][12]",
