However, the specimen on which these were identified were illegally exported from China to Germany, where it was described while awaiting repatriation. The specimen, in the Senckenberg Museum, showed integument from most major regions of the skeleton. It has not yet been identified as a specific species, and was referred to as P. sp. by the 2002 study describing it. Various scales were present across the body, including impressions from the shoulder similar to those identified on Chasmosaurus, with irregular rows of larger and rounded scales surrounded by smaller hexagonal ones.[11]",
