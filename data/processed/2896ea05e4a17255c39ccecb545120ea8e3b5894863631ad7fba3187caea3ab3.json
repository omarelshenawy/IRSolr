This includes more than 150Â species of birds, 26Â species of fish of which 12Â species are native[6] several kinds of amphibians, western pond turtles, beaver, muskrat, river otter, and black-tailed deer.[66] Juvenile salmon enter the lower slough as well as Smith and Bybee Lakes.[70] Coastal cutthroat trout inhabit Fairview Creek and Osborn Creek.[70] Three species of native freshwater mussel live in the slough and in Smith and Bybee Lakes.[71] Crayfish have been found throughout the slough.[72] Bald eagles are among the resident birds, and great blue herons have established rookeries in the watershed.[66] Migrants that visit the slough include more than a dozen species of ducks, geese, swans, and raptors, as well as neotropical shorebirds and songbirds.[66] Invasive species adapted to the slough include the nutria, common carp, bullfrog, and European starling.[66]",
