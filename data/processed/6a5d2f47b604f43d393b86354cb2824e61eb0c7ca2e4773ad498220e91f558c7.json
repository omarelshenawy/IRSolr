The government maintains a policy of \"mother tongue instruction\" (Chinese: æ¯èªæå­¸) in which the medium of instruction is Cantonese,[195] with written Chinese and English, while some of the schools are using English as the teaching language. In secondary schools, 'biliterate and trilingual' proficiency is emphasised, and Mandarin-language education has been increasing.[196] The Programme for International Student Assessment ranked Hong Kong's education system as the second best in the world.[197]",
