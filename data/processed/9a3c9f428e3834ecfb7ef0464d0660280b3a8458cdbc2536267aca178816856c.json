				"A partially ordered set is a bounded lattice if and only if every finite set of elements (including the empty set) has a join and a meet. For every element x of a poset it is trivially true (it is a vacuous truth) that and , and therefore every element of a poset is both an upper bound and a lower bound of the empty set. This implies that the join of an empty set is the least element , and the meet of the empty set is the greatest element . This is consistent with the associativity and commutativity of meet and join: the join of a union of finite sets is equal to the join of the joins of the sets, and dually, the meet of a union of finite sets is equal to the meet of the meets of the sets, i.e., for finite subsets A and B of a poset L,"

				"A lattice element y is said to cover another element x, if y>x, but there does not exist a z such that y>z>x. Here, y>x means x â¤ y and x â  y.",
				"A lattice (L,â¤) is called graded, sometimes ranked (but see this article for an alternative meaning), if it can be equipped with a rank function r from L to â, sometimes to â¤, compatible with the ordering (so r(x)<r(y) whenever x<y) such that whenever y covers x, then r(y)=r(x)+1. The value of the rank function for a lattice element is called its rank."
