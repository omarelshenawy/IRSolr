				"previous": "Books were expensive, since each copy had to be written out individually on a roll of papyrus (volumen) by scribes who had apprenticed to the trade.[465] The codexâa book with pages bound to a spineâwas still a novelty in the time of the poet Martial (1st century AD),[466] but by the end of the 3rd century was replacing the volumen[467] and was the regular form for books with Christian content.[468] Commercial production of books had been established by the late Republic,[469] and by the 1st century AD certain neighbourhoods of Rome were known for their bookshops (tabernae librariae), which were found also in Western provincial cities such as Lugdunum (present-day Lyon, France).[470] The quality of editing varied wildly, and some ancient authors complain about error-ridden copies,[471] as well as plagiarism or forgery, since there was no copyright law.[472] A skilled slave copyist (servus litteratus) could be valued as highly as 100,000 sesterces.[473]",
				"after": "Collectors amassed personal libraries,[474] such as that of the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure (otium) associated with the villa lifestyle.[475] Significant collections might attract \"in-house\" scholars; Lucian mocked mercenary Greek intellectuals who attached themselves to philistine Roman patrons.[476] An individual benefactor might endow a community with a library: Pliny the Younger gave the city of Comum a library valued at 1 million sesterces, along with another 100,000 to maintain it.[477] Imperial libraries housed in state buildings were open to users as a privilege on a limited basis, and represented a literary canon from which disreputable writers could be excluded.[478] Books considered subversive might be publicly burned,[479] and Domitian crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous.[480]",
