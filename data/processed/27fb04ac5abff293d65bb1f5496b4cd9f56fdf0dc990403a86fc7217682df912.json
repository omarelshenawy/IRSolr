				"after": "the derivatives of the function f appear linearly (as opposed to fâ²â²(x)2, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (i.e., (f + g)â² = fâ² + gââ² and (cÂ·f)â² = cÂ·fâ² for a constant c) this assignment is linear, called a linear differential operator. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation D(f) = 0 form a vector space (over R or C).",
