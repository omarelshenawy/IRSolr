This order, if all options are exercised, would make Cathay Pacific the largest operator of 777-300ERs in Asia and largest operator of 747-8Fs in the world.[76] On 6 December 2007, the airline, already the biggest operator of the Airbus A330, placed a firm order for eight more Airbus A330-300 aircraft valued at approximately US$1.7Â billion at list prices. Together with the commitment for 17 long-haul passenger aircraft and freighters, the new aircraft took Cathay Pacific Group's fleet size to 200 by 2012. From those 200 aircraft, the airline operates 155 itself, and the rest are used by its subsidiaries.[77]",
