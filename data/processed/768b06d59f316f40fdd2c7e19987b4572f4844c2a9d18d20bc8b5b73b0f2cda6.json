				"after": "On December 6, 1935, Governor Clarence Martin presided over the ceremonial first concrete pour.[37] During construction, bulk concrete was delivered on site by rail-cars where it was further processed by eight large mixers before being placed in form. Concrete was poured into 50Â sqÂ ft (4.6Â m2) columns by crane-lifted buckets, each supporting eight tons of concrete.[38] To cool the concrete and facilitate curing, about 2,000Â mi (3,200Â km) of piping was placed throughout the drying mass. Cold water from the river was pumped into the pipes, reducing the temperature within the forms from 105Â Â°F (41Â Â°C) to 45Â Â°F (7Â Â°C). This caused the dam to contract about eight inches in length; the resulting gaps were filled with grout.[29]",
