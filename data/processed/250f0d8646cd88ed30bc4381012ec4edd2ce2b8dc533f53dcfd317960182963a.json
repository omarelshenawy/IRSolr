As of 2012[update], about 357,000 Virginian jobs were in agriculture, with over 47,000Â farms, averaging 171 acres (0.27Â sqÂ mi; 0.69Â km2), in a total farmland area of 8.1Â million acres (12,656Â sqÂ mi; 32,780Â km2). Though agriculture has declined significantly since 1960 when there were twice as many farms, it remains the largest single industry in Virginia.[185] Tomatoes surpassed soy as the most profitable crop in Virginia in 2006, with peanuts and hay as other agricultural products.[186] Although it is no longer the primary crop, Virginia is still the fifth-largest producer of tobacco nationwide.[187] Eastern oyster harvests are an important part of the Chesapeake Bay economy, but declining oyster populations from disease, pollution, and overfishing have diminished catches.[188] Wineries and vineyards in the Northern Neck and along the Blue Ridge Mountains also have begun to generate income and attract tourists.[189]",
