Fremantle, Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in London, requesting him to \"find a first class die-sinker who would be willing to take the position of Assistant Engraver at the Mint at Philadelphia.\"[8] In response to Linderman's request, Fremantle wrote \"My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver lead me very strongly to recommend for the post Mr. George Morgan, age 30, who has made himself a considerable name, but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country.\"[8] An agreement was reached between Linderman and Morgan for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver William Barber on a six-month trial basis.[8]",
