				"previous": "In a bid to involve their fans for This Is War, Thirty Seconds to Mars held an event, called The Summit, at the Avalon Club in Los Angeles, where they invited fans to provide backing vocals and percussion.[40] After the success of the initial Summit, the group repeated the event in eight countries and extended it digitally.[41] The band also invited fans to submit close-up shots of their faces in order to make 2,000 different individual covers for the album.[42] Leto described This Is War as a record about survival: \"It was a two-year creative battle that was ferocious and tough but creatively rewarding, and all of those adverse elements, in hindsight, made us stronger and made the record stronger.\"[43]",
				"after": "Although the release date was changed many times, This Is War was eventually released in December 2009. The album reached the top ten of several national album charts and entered the Billboard 200 at number 18, with first-week sales of 67,000 in the United States.[44] Its first two singles, \"Kings and Queens\" and \"This Is War\", reached the number-one spot on the US Alternative Songs chart.[45] After a promotional tour in winter 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars embarked on their Into the Wild Tour in February 2010.[46]",
