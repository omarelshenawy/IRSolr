				"after": "The first commercial recordings of Sullivan's music, beginning in 1898, were of individual numbers from the Savoy operas.[n 28] In 1917, the Gramophone Company (also known as HMV) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Mikado, followed by recordings of eight more of the operas.[285] Electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s. These recordings were supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte.[286] The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce recordings until 1979.[287] Between 1988 and 2003, after the company was revived, it recorded seven of the operas.[288]",
