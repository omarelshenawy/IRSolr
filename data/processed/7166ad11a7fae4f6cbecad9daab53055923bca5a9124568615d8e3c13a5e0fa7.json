				"after": "A year after his public debut, Knut was reported as weighing more than 130Â kg (286Â lb). A plate of six-inch glass, strong enough to resist a mortar blast, was erected between him and zoo visitors.[30] At the end of March 2008, Markus RÃ¶bke, one of the keepers who helped rear Knut, reported that the bear should leave the zoo as soon as possible in order to help him acclimate to a life alone.[31] RÃ¶bke also said that Knut plainly misses his past father-figure, Thomas DÃ¶rflein, and has become so used to attention that he cries when no one is near his enclosure. \"Knut needs an audience,\" RÃ¶bke stated. \"That has to change\".[31] In April, animal welfare campaigners criticized the zoo for allowing Knut to kill and eat ten carp from the moat surrounding his enclosure, saying that it was a breach of German animal protection regulations. The zoo's bear expert, Heiner KlÃ¶s, however, said that Knut's behavior was \"all part of being a polar bear.\"[32]",
