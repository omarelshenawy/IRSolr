				"previous": "In order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Ãlvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects.[95] It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves.[95] The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate.[95] This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver from nine different sources of inherited silver.[95] In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.[95]",
				"after": "The elves could be seen dancing over meadows, particularly at night and on misty mornings. They left a circle where they had danced, which were called Ã¤lvdanser (elf dances) or Ã¤lvringar (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause venereal diseases. Typically, elf circles were fairy rings consisting of a ring of small mushrooms, but there was also another kind of elf circle:",
