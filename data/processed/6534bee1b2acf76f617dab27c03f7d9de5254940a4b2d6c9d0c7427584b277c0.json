				"previous": "By MarchÂ 1970Â (1970-03), AerolÃ­neas Argentinas had a fleet of six Boeing 707s that served routes to Europe and the United States, three Caravelles 6Rs and four Comet 4s that flew regional services, and 12 HS-748s that flew domestically, whereas six Boeing 737-200s were on order.[29] During the decade, the fleet saw the arrival of three different aircraft types from Boeing: the 727âthe first example entered the fleet in DecemberÂ 1979Â (1979-12) on lease from Hughes AirWest and three more were ordered directly from Boeing[30][31]â, the 737,[32] and the 747.[33] The incorporation of the Fokker F-28 into the fleet in the mid-1970s prompted the withdrawal of the last HS-748s, making the company to be the first South American airline in operating an all-jet aircraft park.[34] Frankfurt, Madrid and Rome became the first destinations to be served with the brand new 747s, starting JanuaryÂ 1977Â (1977-01).[35] Another milestone for the company took place in JuneÂ 1980Â (1980-06) with the first south polar scheduled service, linking Buenos Aires with Hong Kong via Auckland.[36] Late that year, a second-hand Boeing 747SP was acquired from Braniff for US$51,000,000 ($145,976,171 in 2015).[37]",
				"after": "The airline was assigned by law the monopoly of international operations from Argentina in 1971.[38] This meant no other Argentine airline was able to operate international flights, let alone the already created Austral. The carrier therefore became the flag carrier of the country. The same law also assigned AerolÃ­neas Argentinas a 50% of the domestic market share.[38] Following the acquisition of Austral by the Argentine government in 1980, both AerolÃ­neas Argentinas and Austral became government-owned, to the extent that some routes were simultaneously operated, even using similar equipment. However, there existed a state of continuous tension over salary differences between both companies that eventually led the AerolÃ­neas Argentinas' pilots to a three-week-long strike that started on 1 July 1986.[39] During this strike, the government leased pilots from the Argentine Air Force to operate some aircraft. Other companies took advantage from this situation and gained the market share AerolÃ­neas Argentinas lost, as domestic routes were operated by Austral, LADE and LAPA, and the government temporarily authorised foreign carriers to exploit the company's international routes.[40]",
