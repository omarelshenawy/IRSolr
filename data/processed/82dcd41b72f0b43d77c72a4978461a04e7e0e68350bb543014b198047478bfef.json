				"previous": "The Cessna Company planned to drop the previous 172 configuration for the 1968 model year and replace it with a cantilever-wing/stabilator configuration that would be the 172J. However, as time for model introduction neared, those dealers who were aware of the change began applying pressure on the factory to continue the previous configuration. They felt the new model would be less usable as a trainer. Consequently, and at the last minute, the decision was made to continue the 172 in its original configuration. The planned 172J configuration would be introduced as a new model, the 177. The deluxe option would become the 177 Cardinal. The \"J\" designation was never publicly used.",
				"after": "The next model year was the 1969 \"K\" model. The 1969 172K had a redesigned tailfin cap and reshaped rear windows. Optional long-range 52Â USÂ gal (197Â l) wing fuel tanks were offered. The rear windows were slightly enlarged by 16 square inches (103Â cm2). The 1969 model sold for US$12,500 for the 172 and US$13,995 for the Skyhawk, with 1,170 made.[14]",
