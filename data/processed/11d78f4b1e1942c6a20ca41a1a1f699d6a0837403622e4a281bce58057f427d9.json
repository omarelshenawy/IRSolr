				"previous": "An important parameter in the efficiency of combustion engines is the specific heat ratio of the air-fuel mixture, Î³. This varies somewhat with the fuel, but is generally close to the air value of 1.4. This standard value is usually used in the engine cycle equations below, and when this approximation is made the cycle is called an air-standard cycle.",
