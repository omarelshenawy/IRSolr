Rabbits, having only been added to the CPL in 2005,[41] have been among the least studied, although in 2010, the organization named the American Rabbit as the most endangered breed of rabbit in the US.[42] Work with cattle has also been limited, although in one case, a member rescued the last of the Randall Cattle herd from slaughter; the breed has since been built up to more than 300 members.[12] One major initiative with cattle is the Heritage Dairy Cattle Breed Recovery program, which assists heritage cattle breeders and breed organizations with funding, marketing and communications, with a focus on selling their product to other small operations, including cheese and dairy operations.[35]",
