				"previous": "During this early period of change, Chadderton's parliamentary representation was limited to two Members of Parliament for Lancashire. Nationally, the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and unemployment for textile workers.[21] Nevertheless, despite years of distress and unrest, major disturbances of machine-breaking did not occur until 1826.[22] By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the lack of suffrage in northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political Radicalism in the region.[21] The Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, began to organise a mass public demonstration in Manchester to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. Organised preparations took place, and a spy reported that in neighbouring Thornham, \"seven hundred men drilledÂ ... as well as any army regiment would\".[23] A few days later, on 3Â August, a royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling was posted in Manchester.[24] On 16Â August 1819, Chadderton (like its neighbours) sent a contingent of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration now known as the Peterloo Massacre (owing to the 15 deaths and 400â700 injuries which followed).[16][25] Two of the 15Â deceased were from the area: John Ashton of Cowhill and Thomas Buckley of Baretrees.[26]",
				"after": "New markets in Europe and South America increased the demand for Britain's cheap cotton goods. Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in the United States to Manchester.[27][28] From the markets in Manchester, mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into yarn and cloth. Supplies were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861â65 as a result of the American Civil War, leading to the formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis.[29] Despite a brief economic depression, the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine. The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton's plentiful cheap open land, used for farming since antiquity, vanished under distinctive rectangular multi-storey brick-built factoriesâ35 by 1891.[18] Chadderton's former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a mill town around these factories and a network of newly created roads, canals and railways.[19][30][31] The Chadderton landscape was \"dominated by mill chimneys, many with the mill name picked out in white brick\".[32] Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world)[17][33] encroached upon Chadderton's eastern boundary, urbanising the town and surrounds,[34] and forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Royton, Lees and Shaw and Cromptonâthe Oldham parliamentary constituencyâwhich at its peak was responsible for 13Â perÂ cent of the world's cotton production.[35] These Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road, by Chadderton's eastern boundary with Oldham.[12][30] Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926,[18] and 6,000 people, a quarter of Chadderton's population, worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century.[36] Industries ancillary to cotton spinning, such as engineering, coal mining, bleaching and dyeing became established during this period, meaning the rest of Chadderton's population were otherwise involved in the sector. Philip Stott was a Chadderton-born architect, civil engineer and surveyor of cotton mills. Stott's mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom, multiplying the town's industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity.[33]",
