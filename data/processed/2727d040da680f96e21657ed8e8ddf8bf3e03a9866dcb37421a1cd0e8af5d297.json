				"after": "Aristotle (384â322 BC) and Pliny (23â79 AD) both wrote about the legend of a contest among the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird that had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title.[69][70] Following from this legend, in much European folklore the wren has been described as the \"king of the birds\" or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the Regulus species, the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles,[71] and, because of the legend's reference to the \"smallest of birds\" becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren.[31][72] The confusion was probably compounded by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Greek words for the wren (Î²Î±ÏÎ¹Î»ÎµÏÏ basileus, \"king\") and the crests (Î²Î±ÏÎ¹Î»Î¹ÏÎºÎ¿Ï basiliskos, \"kinglet\").[73] In English, the association between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been reinforced by the kinglet's old name of \"gold-crested wren\".[74]",
