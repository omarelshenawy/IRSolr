Shull, a former member of the Town Council, who was elected in an unopposed May 4 election, and served four years as mayor.[60] Shull succeeded Ray E. Ewing, who had served sinceÂ 1994,[61] and retired at the end of his term.[62] The representative body of Stephens City is known as the Town Council, whose members (as of November 2012) include Ronald Bowers, Linden A. Fravel, Jr., James H. Harter, Joseph Hollis, Joseph Grayson and Martha W. Dilg.[2] Dilg was elected in a May 4,Â 2010, election to succeed Michael Grim, who left the Town Council at the end of his term.[63] Shull's replacement on Town Council was originally to be decided at a May 5,Â 2010, Town Council meeting[61] but was not announced until June 29,Â 2010, when Joseph Grayson was officially named to fill Shull's seat.[64] On November 6, 2012, Joseph Hollis, Joseph Grayson and Ronald Bowers were all reelected to the Stephens City Town Council.[65] Council member James Harter resigned on December 31, 2013, as he had moved outside of the town limits.[66]",
