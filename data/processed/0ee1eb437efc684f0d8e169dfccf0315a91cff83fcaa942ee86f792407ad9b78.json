				"previous": "Thus, even though the local dew point inside the vortex cores is even lower than in the ambient air, the water vapor may nevertheless condense â if the formation of the vortex brings the local temperature below the new local dew point. Let's verify that this can indeed happen under realistic conditions.",
				"after": "Let's first determine the temperature in the vortex core. It is given by the equation above as or 0.86Â Â°CÂ =Â 33.5Â Â°F.",
