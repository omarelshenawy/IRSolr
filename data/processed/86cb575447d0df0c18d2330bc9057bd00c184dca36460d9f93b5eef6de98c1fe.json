				"previous": "The airline was established in 1981 and started operations on 17 May 1981 as Corse Air International. It was founded by the Corsican Rossi family; in 1990 it was acquired by Nouvelles FrontiÃ¨res, a French tour operator, and the name was changed to \"Corsair\". Worldwide traffic rights were obtained in 1991. In 2000 TUI AG, one of the world's leading tour operator groups, took over Nouvelles FrontiÃ¨res.",
				"after": "In 2004, Corsair aircraft were repainted with the colours of TUI, blue fuselage with the TUI-logo, like its sister airlines. At the end of 2005 the TUI Group, decided to rename all its affiliated airlines TUIfly. As an interim step Corsair aircraft were repainted with Corsairfly markings, although all airlines in the group were expected to have adopted the common TUIfly brand by 2008.[3]",
