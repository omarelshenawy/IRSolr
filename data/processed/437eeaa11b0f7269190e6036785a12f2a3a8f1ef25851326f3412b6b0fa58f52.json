				"previous": "Smoluchowski[17] attempts to answer the question of why a Brownian particle should be displaced by bombardments of smaller particles when the probabilities for striking it in the forward and rear directions are equal. In order to do so, he uses, unknowingly, the ballot theorem, first proved by W.A. Whitworth in 1878.[18] The ballot theorem states that if a candidate A scores m votes and candidate B scores nâm that the probability throughout the counting that A will have more votes than B is",
				"after": "no matter how large the total number of votes n may be. In other words, if one candidate has an edge on the other candidate he will tend to keep that edge even though there is nothing favoring either candidate on a ballot extraction.",
