				"previous": "Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain constitutional independence from the government.[59] This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.[69] The Privy Council in London was the country's final court of appeal until 2004, when it was replaced with the newly established Supreme Court of New Zealand. The judiciary, headed by the Chief Justice,[70] includes the Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts.[59]",
				"after": "Almost all parliamentary general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system.[71] The elections since 1930 have been dominated by two political parties, National and Labour.[71] Since the 1996 election, a form of proportional representation called Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) has been used.[59] Under the MMP system each person has two votes; one is for electoral seats (including some reserved for MÄori),[72] and the other is for a party. Since the 2005 election, there have been 70 electorate seats (which includes, since the 1996 election, 7 MÄori electorates), and the remaining fifty seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, although a party has to win one electoral seat or 5 percent of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats.[73] Between March 2005 and August 2006 New Zealand became the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land (Head of State, Governor-General, Prime Minister, Speaker and Chief Justice) were occupied simultaneously by women.[74]",
