Trams leave about every sixÂ minutes between 7:15 and 18:30, and every 12Â minutes at other times of the day.[96] The nearest main line railway station is Trafford Park, on the Liverpool to Manchester line. Services are roughly every twoÂ hours in each direction, with extra services calling during the peak hours.[97] The 20-acre (8Â ha) Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal, opened in 1993, is in the Gorse Hill area of Stretford. It cost Â£11Â million and has the capacity to deal with 100,000 containers a year. The containers are handled by two huge gantry cranes, the noise from which has led to complaints from some local residents.[98]",
