				"after": "Weighing between 16 and 20Â kg (35 and 44Â lb), Babakotia radofilai was a medium-sized lemur and noticeably smaller than the large sloth lemurs (Archaeoindris and Palaeopropithecus), but larger than the small sloth lemurs (Mesopropithecus).[5][2] In many ways, it had an intermediate level of adaptations for suspensory behavior between the large sloth lemurs and the small sloth lemurs.[2][3][11][9][12] This includes its highly mobile hip and ankle joints, as well as other specializations in the vertebral column, pelvis, and limbs.[12] Its forelimbs were 20% longer than its hind limbs, giving it a higher intermembral index (~119) than Mesopropithecus (~97 to 113), suggesting that it was convergently similar to arboreal sloths.[12][13] It had a reduced tarsus and curved, elongated digits, adapted for grasping and suggesting suspensory behavior.[12][14] Its hind feet were reduced, making it well-adapted for climbing and hanging (like in other palaeopropithecids), but not leaping (like in indriids).[5][2][3] Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrated that this species was a vertical climber.[15] Additionally, analysis of its semicircular canals,[16] lumbar vertebrae and its spinous processes indicate slow movement and climbing (antipronograde) adaptations, but not necessarily sloth-like hanging, vertical clinging, or leaping.[17] Therefore, it was likely a slow climber like a loris and also exhibited some suspensory behavior like a sloth.[8]",
