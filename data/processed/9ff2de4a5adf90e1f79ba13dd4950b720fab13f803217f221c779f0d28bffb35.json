				"previous": "Lindow Man's official name is LindowÂ II, as there are other finds from the area: LindowÂ I (Lindow Woman)[18] refers to a human skull, LindowÂ III to a \"fragmented headless body\", and LindowÂ IV to the upper thigh of an adult male, possibly that of Lindow Man.[19] After the discovery of Lindow Man, there were no further archaeological excavations at Lindow Moss until 1987. A large piece of skin was found by workmen on the elevator on 6Â February 1987. On this occasion, the police left the investigation to the archaeologists. Over 70Â pieces were found, constituting LindowÂ III. Although the bone was not as well preserved as that of Lindow Man, the other tissues survived in better condition.[20] The final discovery was that of LindowÂ IV on 14Â June 1988. Part of a left leg and buttocks were found on the elevator, from a site just 50 feet (15Â m) west of where Lindow Man was found. Nearly three months later, on 12Â September, a right thigh was discovered in the peat on the bucket of a digger. The proximity of the discovery sites, coupled with the fact that the remains were shown to come from an adult male, means that LindowÂ IV is probably part of Lindow Man.[21]",
				"after": "The discovery of Lindow Man marked the first well-preserved bog body discovered in Britain; its condition was comparable to that of Grauballe Man and Tollund Man from Denmark. Before Lindow Man, it was estimated that 41Â bog bodies had been found in England and Wales and 15 in Scotland. Encouraged by the discovery of Lindow Man, a gazetteer was compiled and revealed a far higher number of bog bodies: over 85 in England and Wales and over 36 in Scotland. Prior to the discovery of the bodies in Lindow Moss, British bog bodies had been a relatively neglected subject compared to European examples. The interest caused by Lindow Man led to more in-depth research of accounts of discoveries in bogs since the 17thÂ century; by 1995, the numbers had changed to 106 in England and Wales and 34 in Scotland. The remains covered a large time frame.[22]",
