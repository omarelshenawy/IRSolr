This approach follows Frege's (1897) Principle of Compositionality: the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts, and the way in which those parts are combined into structured meanings. Krifkaâs structured meaning theory represents focus in a transparent and compositional fashion it encompasses sentences with more than one focus as well as sentences with a single focus. Krifka claims the advantages of structured meanings are twofold: 1) We can access the meaning of an item in focus directly, and 2) Rooth's[20][21] alternative semantics can be derived from a structured meaning approach but not vice versa. To see Krifkaâs approach illustrated, consider the following examples of single focus shown in (10) and multiple foci shown in (11):",
