A keep used to stand on the motte which is on the south west of the site, although most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period.[1] In the 17th century the motte was landscaped with the addition of a path.[71] The bailey was incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.[1]",
