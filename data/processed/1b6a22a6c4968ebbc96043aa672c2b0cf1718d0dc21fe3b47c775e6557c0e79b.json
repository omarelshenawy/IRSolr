				"previous": "Apart from the last formula, these formulas also assume that g negligibly varies with height during the fall (that is, they assume constant acceleration). The last equation is more accurate where significant changes in fractional distance from the center of the planet during the fall cause significant changes in g. This equation occurs in many applications of basic physics.",
