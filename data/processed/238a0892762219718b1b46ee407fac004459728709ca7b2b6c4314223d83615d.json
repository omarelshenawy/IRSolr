				"previous": "Kentucky adopted the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in most public spheres after the Civil War, but the state never disenfranchised African American citizens to the level of the Deep South states, and it peacefully integrated its schools after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education verdict, later adopting the first state civil rights act in the South in 1966.[129]",
				"after": "The biggest day in American horse racing, the Kentucky Derby, is preceded by the two-week Derby Festival[130] in Louisville. Louisville also plays host to the Kentucky State Fair,[131] the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival,[132] and Southern gospel's annual highlight, the National Quartet Convention.[133] Bowling Green, the state's third-largest city and home to the only assembly plant in the world that manufactures the Chevrolet Corvette,[134] opened the National Corvette Museum in 1994.[135] The fourth-largest city, Owensboro, gives credence to its nickname of \"Barbecue Capital of the World\" by hosting the annual International Bar-B-Q Festival.[136]",
