Quarry operations, also a threat, have obliterated several square miles of traprock ridgeline in both Massachusetts and Connecticut. Ridges and mountains affected include Trimountain, Bradley Mountain, Totoket Mountain, Chauncey Peak, Rattlesnake Mountain, East Mountain, Pocumtuck Ridge, and the former Round Mountain of the Holyoke Range.[1][3][42] The gigantic man-like profile of the Sleeping Giant, a traprock massif visible for more than 30 miles (50Â km) in south central Connecticut, bears quarrying scars on its \"head\". Mining there was halted by the efforts of local citizens and the Sleeping Giant Park Association.[12]",
