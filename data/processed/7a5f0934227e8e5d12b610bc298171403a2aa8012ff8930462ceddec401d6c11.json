				"previous": "The art world developed a new appreciation for VelÃ¡zquez's less Italianate paintings after 1819, when FerdinandÂ VII opened the royal collection to the public.[74] In 1879 John Singer Sargent painted a small-scale copy of Las Meninas, and in 1882 painted a homage to the painting in his The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit, while the Irish artist Sir John Lavery chose VelÃ¡zquez's masterpiece as the basis for his portrait The Royal Family at Buckingham Palace, 1913. GeorgeÂ V visited Lavery's studio during the execution of the painting, and, perhaps remembering the legend that PhilipÂ IV had daubed the cross of the Knights of Santiago on the figure of VelÃ¡zquez, asked Lavery if he could contribute to the portrait with his own hand. According to Lavery, \"Thinking that royal blue might be an appropriate colour, I mixed it on the palette, and taking a brush he [GeorgeÂ V] applied it to the Garter ribbon.\"[74]",
				"after": "Between August and December 1957, Pablo Picasso painted a series of 58 interpretations of Las Meninas, and figures from it, which currently fill the Las Meninas room of the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, Spain. Picasso did not vary the characters within the series, but largely retained the naturalness of the scene; according to the museum, his works constitute an \"exhaustive study of form, rhythm, colour and movement\".[76] A print of 1973 by Richard Hamilton called Picasso's Meninas draws on both VelÃ¡zquez and Picasso.[77] Photographer Joel-Peter Witkin was commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Culture to create a work titled Las Meninas, New Mexico (1987) which references VelÃ¡zquez's painting as well as other works by Spanish artists.[78]",
