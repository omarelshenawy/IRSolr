				"after": "Acetic acid is produced industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made for use in the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below.[11] Alternative methods account for the rest. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar, as many food purity laws stipulate that vinegar used in foods must be of biological origin. As of 2003â2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Â Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was then produced in the United States. European production stood at approximately 1Â Mt/a and was declining, and 0.7Â Mt/a were produced in Japan. Another 1.5Â Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Â Mt/a.[39][40] Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further, however, slowing increase in production is predicted.[41] The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.[42]",
