Thomas and Znaniecki had begun to collaborate, and soon Thomas invited Znaniecki to come to Chicago to continue work with him in the United States.[27][28] In July 1914, just on the eve of World War I, Znaniecki left Poland to work with Thomas as a research assistant.[28][29] From 1917 to 1919 Znaniecki also lectured in sociology at the University of Chicago.[30]",
