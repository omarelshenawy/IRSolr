				"after": "Platinum's rarity as a metal has caused advertisers to associate it with exclusivity and wealth. \"Platinum\" debit and credit cards have greater privileges than \"gold\" cards.[60] \"Platinum awards\" are the second highest possible, ranking above \"gold\", \"silver\" and \"bronze\", but below diamond. For example, in the United States, a musical album that has sold more than 1Â million copies, will be credited as \"platinum\", whereas an album that sold more than 10Â million copies will be certified as \"diamond\".[61] Some products, such as blenders and vehicles, with a silvery-white color are identified as \"platinum\". Platinum is considered a precious metal, although its use is not as common as the use of gold or silver. The frame of the Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, manufactured for her coronation as Consort of King George VI, is made of platinum. It was the first British crown to be made of this particular metal.[62]",
