				"previous": "The Great Rift Valley runs through the country from north to south, and to the east of the valley lies Lake Malawi (also called Lake Nyasa), making up over three-quarters of Malawi's eastern boundary.[11] Lake Malawi is sometimes called the Calendar Lake as it is about 365 miles (587Â km) long and 52 miles (84Â km) wide.[46] The Shire River flows from the south end of the lake and joins the Zambezi River 250 miles (400Â km) farther south in Mozambique. The surface of Lake Malawi is located at 1,500 feet (457Â m) above sea level, with a maximum depth of 2,300 feet (701Â m), which means the lake bottom is over 700 feet (213Â m) below sea level at some points.",
				"after": "In the mountainous sections of Malawi surrounding the Rift Valley, plateaus rise generally 3,000 to 4,000 feet (914 to 1,219Â m) above sea level, although some rise as high as 8,000 feet (2,438Â m) in the north. To the south of Lake Malawi lie the Shire Highlands, gently rolling land at approximately 3,000 feet (914Â m) above sea level. In this area, the Zomba and Mulanje mountain peaks rise to respective heights of 7,000 and 10,000 feet (2,134 and 3,048Â m).[11]",
