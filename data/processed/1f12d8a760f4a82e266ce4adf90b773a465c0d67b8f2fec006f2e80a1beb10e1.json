				"after": "Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as \"the Colours\".[13] Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons â flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect.[14] Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units. As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.[15] Units awarded battle honours have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons. They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen. Artillery do not have Battle Honours â their single Honour is \"Ubique\" which means \"Everywhere\" â although they can received Honour Titles.[16]",
