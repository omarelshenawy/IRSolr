				"after": "Parcels of the right-of-way between Lloyd and the neighboring town of New Paltz were sold off by the county shortly before ownership of the remaining corridor was transferred to Lloyd and converted to a rail trail.[13][14] Roughly $400,000 in funding to convert the corridor to a trail was acquired through an easement from the town of Lloyd to a broadband utility for the laying of fiber optic cable,[15] though only $70,000 was needed to pave the trail.[14] The trail remains a right-of-way for the fiber optic line.[5] The development of the trail was supported by Highland's Rotary club, which has since built several utilities for trail users, including a pavilion, garden and parking lot.[14] The corridor was officially opened as a trail in 1997.[16] Initially 2.5 to 3 miles (4.0 to 4.8Â km) long,[15][16] it stretched from Riverside Road in the west to Vineyard Avenue in the east; the removal of an overpass on Vineyard Avenue, as well as a blockage under a bridge on U.S. Route 9W, prevented the trail from continuing east to the Poughkeepsie Bridge.[16]",
