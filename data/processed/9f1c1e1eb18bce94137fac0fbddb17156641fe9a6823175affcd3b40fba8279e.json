				"previous": "This position on property is much different from the native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor[80] and trade. However, in 1886 Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, \"with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself.\"[81] Other egoists include James L. Walker, Sidney Parker, Dora Marsden and John Beverly Robinson.",
				"after": "In Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.[82] They rejected organizing, believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and domination, believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism.[83] This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman[82]",
