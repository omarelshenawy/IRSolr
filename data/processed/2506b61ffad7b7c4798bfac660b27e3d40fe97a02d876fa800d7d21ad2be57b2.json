				"previous": "Unlike those of other mammals, the necks of anteaters, especially the giant, are thicker than the backs of their heads.[13] A small hump can be found at the back of its neck. The giant anteater's coat is mostly grey and salted with white. Its fore limbs are white, with black bands around the wrists, while its hind limbs are dark. Thick black bands with white outlines stretch from throat to shoulder, where they end in triangular points. The body ends in a brown tail. The coat hairs are long, especially on the tail, which makes the tail look larger than it actually is. A stiff mane stretches along its back.[4] The bold pattern was thought to be disruptive camouflage, but a 2009 study suggests it is warning coloration.[15] While adult males are slightly larger and more muscular than females, with wider heads and necks, visual sex determination can be difficult. The (retracted) penis and testes are located internally between the rectum and urinary bladder in males, and females have a single pair of mammary glands near the armpits.[16]",
				"after": "The giant anteater has broad ribs. Despite its specific name, it has five toes on each foot. Four toes on the front feet have claws, which are particularly elongated on the second and third digits.[16] The giant anteater walks on its front knuckles, similar to the African apes, specifically gorillas and chimpanzees. Doing this allows the giant anteater to keep its claws out of the way while walking. The middle digits, which support most of its weight, are extended at the metacarpophalangeal joints and bent at the interphalangeal joints.[17] Unlike the front feet, the hind feet have short claws on all five toes and walk plantigrade.[4] As a \"hook-and-pull\" digger, the giant anteater's enlarged supraspinous fossa gives the teres major more leverageâincreasing the front limbs' pulling powerâand the triceps muscle helps power the flexion of the thickened third digit of the front feet.[18]",
