				"previous": "When Rickenbacker learned of the Armistice, he flew an airplane above the western front to observe the ceasefire and the displays of joy and comradeship, as the formerly warring troops crossed the front lines and joined in the celebrations.",
				"after": "After World War I ended, Rickenbacker was approached several times about exploiting his fame. He chose to go on a Liberty bond tour. After the tour he was released from the army with the rank of Major. He felt he had earned the rank of captain and used that one the rest of his life.[11] He was offered many movie positions, but did not want all the attention, even though he was the most celebrated aviator in America (soon to be supplanted by Charles Lindbergh after his solo flight across the Atlantic). Rickenbacker described his World War I flying experiences in his memoirs, Fighting the Flying Circus, published after the war. In this book, he also describes the character, exploits, and death of fellow pilot Lt. Quentin Roosevelt, the son of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.[12] Rickenbacker also continued to associate with Reed Chambers, with whom he had served in World War I; they jointly founded an airline.[13]",
