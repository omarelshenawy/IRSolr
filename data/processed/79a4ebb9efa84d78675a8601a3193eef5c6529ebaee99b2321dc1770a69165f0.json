				"after": "Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding exclusively on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers and roots. Some are omnivorous and a few are predators.[2] The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae.[28] The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.[29] The Texas pocket gopher avoids emerging onto the surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy.[30] The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.[31]",
