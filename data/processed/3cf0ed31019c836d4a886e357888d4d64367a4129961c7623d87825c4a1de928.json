Linking each shape to its color is a function from X to Y: each shape is linked to a color (i.e., an element in Y), and each shape is \"linked\", or \"mapped\", to exactly one color. There is no shape that lacks a color and no shape that has two or more colors. This function will be referred to as the \"color-of-the-shape function\".",
