				"previous": "Variety queletiformis can be distinguished from the main form by the reddish discolouration of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh.[40] Variety rubriceps has a deep crimson red cap, while var. lupiniformis has a pale yellow or dirty ochre cap, sometimes with pink tones throughout.[35]",
				"after": "The spore dust is olive to brownish olive. The spores are oval to somewhat fuse-shaped, measuring 11â15Â Î¼m long by 4.5â6.5Â Î¼m wide.[39] The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, and measure 29.2â36.5 by 11.0â12.4Â Î¼m. Cystidia on the sides of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33â48 by 7.3â13.5Â Î¼m; cheilocystidia (on the edges of the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7â5.8Â Î¼m wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7â8.8Â Î¼m. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections.[41] The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.[42]",
