				"The Rolls-Royce Buzzard (also referred to as the H engine) was a British piston aero engine of 36.7 litres (2,240 cubic inch) capacity that produced about 800 horsepower (600Â kW). Designed and built by Rolls-Royce Limited it featured 12 cylinders in a 'V' configuration of 6 inch bore and 6.6 inch stroke. It was manufactured in the late 1920s, but only 100 were sold. A further development was the Rolls-Royce R Schneider Trophy engine. The Buzzard was developed by scaling-up the Kestrel engine in the ratio of 5:6.[1]"
