				"An airport terminal is a building at an airport where passengers transfer between ground transportation and the facilities that allow them to board and disembark from aircraft.",
				"Within the terminal, passengers purchase tickets, transfer their luggage, and go through security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concourses. However, the terms \"terminal\" and \"concourse\" are sometimes used interchangeably, depending on the configuration of the airport."
