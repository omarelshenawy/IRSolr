				"after": "Historically, Sale was a township in the ancient parish of Ashton upon Mersey in the hundred of Bucklow and county of Cheshire.[1] Throughout the Middle Ages it was governed by the Lord of the Manor. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Sale was joined with the Altrincham Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security.[1] The unit changed its name to Bucklow Poor Law Union in 1895.[1] Sale adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in November 1866, and Sale Local Board was formed to govern the township at the beginning of 1867.[38] Members were elected to the local board by the town's ratepayers. A household had one vote for every Â£10 (Â£800 as of 2015)[39] of rateable value.[40] Under the Local Government Act 1888 Sale became an urban district of the administrative county of Cheshire. The local board was replaced by Sale Urban District Council in 1894. The parish of Ashton upon Mersey became an urban district in 1895.[41] In 1930, the Ashton upon Mersey UD was merged into Sale UD under a county review order.[40][41]",
