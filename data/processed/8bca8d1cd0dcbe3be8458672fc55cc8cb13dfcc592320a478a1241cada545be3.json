				"after": "The yellowhammer breeds across Eurasia between the 16â20Â Â°C (61â68Â Â°F) July isotherms. It is the commonest and most widespread European bunting,[9] although it is absent from high mountains, Arctic regions, the western Netherlands, most of Iberia and Greece, and low-lying regions of other countries adjoining the Mediterranean Sea. It breeds in Russia east to Irkutsk, and in most of Ukraine. The Asian range extends into northwest Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Kazakhstan.[10]",
