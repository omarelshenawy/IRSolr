				"The flexibility of an unbranched chain polymer is characterized by its persistence length.",
				"A common means of expressing the length of a chain is the degree of polymerization, which quantifies the number of monomers incorporated into the chain.[23][24] As with other molecules, a polymer's size may also be expressed in terms of molecular weight. Since synthetic polymerization techniques typically yield a polymer product including a range of molecular weights, the weight is often expressed statistically to describe the distribution of chain lengths present in the same. Common examples are the number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight.[25][26] The ratio of these two values is the polydispersity index, commonly used to express the \"width\" of the molecular weight distribution.[27] A final measurement is contour length, which can be understood as the length of the chain backbone in its fully extended state.[28]"
