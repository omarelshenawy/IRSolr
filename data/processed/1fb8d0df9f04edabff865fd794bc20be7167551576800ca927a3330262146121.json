				"after": "Russula virescens was first described by German polymath Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774 as Agaricus virescens.[3] The species was subsequently transferred to the genus Russula by Elias Fries in 1836.[4][5] According to the nomenclatural authority MycoBank, Russula furcata var. aeruginosa (published by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1796[6]) and Agaricus caseosus (published by Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth in 1883[7]) are synonyms of Russula virescens.[2] The variety albidocitrina, defined by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1876,[1] is no longer considered to have independent taxonomic significance.[8] According to Rolf Singer's 1986 classification of Russula, R.Â virescens is the type species of subsection Virescentinae in section Rigidae, a grouping of mushrooms characterized by a cap surface that breaks into patches of bran-like (furfuraceous) particles.[9] In a molecular phylogenetic analysis of European Russula, R.Â virescens formed a clade with R.Â mustelina; these two species were sister to a clade containing R.Â amoenicolor and R.Â violeipes.[10]",
