				"after": "According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as of April 2015, the Indian economy is nominally worth US$2.306 trillion; it is the 7th-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$7.996 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP.[9] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011â12,[202] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[203] However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP.[204] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[205] since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system[206][207] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[208] India's recent economic model is largely capitalist.[207] India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.[209]",
