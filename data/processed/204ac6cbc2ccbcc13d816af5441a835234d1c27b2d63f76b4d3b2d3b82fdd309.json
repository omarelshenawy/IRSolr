				"after": "In December 1887 the LNC appointed Cyril Tubbs to supervise the LNC estate.[83] Tubbs was given a broad remit to \"advance the company's interests\", including buying and selling land, supervising the railway stations, advertising the cemetery and liaising with the LSWR.[83] Tubbs set about restructuring the design of Brookwood Cemetery to make it more appealing to mourners and visitors. The cemetery was divided into numbered sections, separated by an expanded network of avenues. These avenues were all named, and signposts were erected along them, to allow visitors easily to find their way around the sprawling Brookwood site, and to locate particular graves; the naming and numbering system devised by Tubbs has remained in use ever since.[83]",
