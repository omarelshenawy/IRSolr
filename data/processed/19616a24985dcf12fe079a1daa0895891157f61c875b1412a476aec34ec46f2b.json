				"after": "A notable feature of Bristol's architecture is the Bristol Byzantine style.[71] Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style was used in the construction of factories, warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era. Surviving examples include the Colston Hall,[72] the Granary on Welsh Back, and the Gloucester Road Carriage Works,[73] along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the Arnolfini, which now houses an art gallery.[74] Clarks Wood Company warehouse,[75] the St Vincent's Works[76] in Silverthorne Lane, and the Wool Hall[77] in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.",
