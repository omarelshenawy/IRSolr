				"previous": "According to the Government's Jakarta in Figures document, the population stood at 10,187,595 in 2011 and 9,761,407 in 2012.[78]",
				"after": "With 28 million people in the metropolitan area, nearly 10 million vehicles in daily use, and limited rapid transit system[79] Jakarta is strained by transportation problems.[80] The city suffers a lack of urban public transport services due to prioritized development of road networks, which were mostly designed to accommodate private vehicles.[81] Most trips, however, are undertaken by non-motorized transportation (particularly walking) and numerous modes of public or demand-responsive transportation services.[82]",
