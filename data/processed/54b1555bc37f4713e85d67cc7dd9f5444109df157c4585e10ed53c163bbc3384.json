				"after": "The skull has a long rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase.[55] It differs from that of T.Â bolivaris in various proportions, which are more apparent in adults than in juveniles.[48] The skull of H.Â megacephalus is distinctly larger.[43] The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar.[56] The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward.[31] The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins;[57] T.Â bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading[58] and H.Â megacephalus entirely lacks the beading.[59] The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.Â bolivaris.[58] The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.[31]",
