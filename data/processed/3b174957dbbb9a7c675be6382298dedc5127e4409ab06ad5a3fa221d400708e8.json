				"previous": "In case of a rocket or a jet aircraft, the force is exactly the thrust produced by the engine. If the rocket or aircraft is moving at about a constant speed, then distance divided by time is just speed, so power is thrust times speed:[5]",
				"after": "This formula looks very surprising, but it is correct: the propulsive power (or power available [6]) of a jet engine increases with its speed. If the speed is zero, then the propulsive power is zero. If a jet aircraft is at full throttle but attached to a static test stand, then the jet engine produces no propulsive power, however thrust is still produced. Compare that to a piston engine. The combination piston engineâpropeller also has a propulsive power with exactly the same formula, and it will also be zero at zero speed â- but that is for the engineâpropeller set. The engine alone will continue to produce its rated power at a constant rate, whether the aircraft is moving or not.",
