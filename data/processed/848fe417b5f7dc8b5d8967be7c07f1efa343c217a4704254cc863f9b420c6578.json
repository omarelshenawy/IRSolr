				"after": "Houston could not spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful defense.[29] Instead, he sent Colonel James Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery from the Alamo and destroy the complex.[28][Note 4] Bowie was unable to transport the artillery since the Alamo garrison lacked the necessary draft animals. Neill soon persuaded Bowie that the location held strategic importance.[30] In a letter to Governor Henry Smith, Bowie argued that \"the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping BÃ©xar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine.\"[31][Note 5] The letter to Smith ended, \"Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy.\"[31] Bowie also wrote to the provisional government, asking for \"men, money, rifles, and cannon powder\".[31] Few reinforcements were authorized; cavalry officer William B. Travis arrived in BÃ©xar with 30Â men on February 3. Five days later, a small group of volunteers arrived, including the famous frontiersman and former U.S. Congressman David Crockett of Tennessee.[32]",
