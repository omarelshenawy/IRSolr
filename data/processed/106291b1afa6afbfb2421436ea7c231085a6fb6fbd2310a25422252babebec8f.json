				"after": "Mobile broadband is the marketing term for wireless Internet access delivered through mobile phone towers to computers, mobile phones (called \"cell phones\" in North America and South Africa), and other digital devices using portable modems. Some mobile services allow more than one device to be connected to the Internet using a single cellular connection using a process called tethering. The modem may be built into laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices, added to some devices using PC cards, USB modems, and USB sticks or dongles, or separate wireless modems can be used.[66]",
