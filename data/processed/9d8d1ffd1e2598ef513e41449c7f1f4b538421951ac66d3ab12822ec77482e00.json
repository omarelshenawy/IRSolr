				"after": "Given Envisat's orbit and its area-to-mass ratio, it will take about 150 years for the satellite to be gradually pulled into the Earthâs atmosphere.[11] Envisat is currently operating in an environment where 2 catalogued objects can be expected to pass within about 200Â m (660Â ft) of it every year, which would likely trigger the need for a maneuver to avoid a possible collision.[12] A drifting satellite as big as Envisat is more than just a huge space wreck: in case of collision, given its mass, volume and shape, it might generate a cloud of smaller debris large enough to populate the orbit, initiating a self-sustaining chain-reaction of collisions and fragmentation with production of new debris. This phenomenon, known as the Kessler Syndrome, would eventually make space operations difficult or even impossible, and may prevent access to space to future human generations.[12]",
