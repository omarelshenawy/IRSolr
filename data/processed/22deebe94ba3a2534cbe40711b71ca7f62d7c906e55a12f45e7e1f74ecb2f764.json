				"previous": "for all positive integers in integers ? The case is answered in the positive by Lagrange's four-square theorem. The general solution was given by Ramanujan. He proved that if we assume, without loss of generality, that then there are exactly 54 possible choices for such that the problem is solvable in integers for all . (Ramanujan listed a 55th possibility , but in this case the problem is not solvable if .[8])",
				"after": "The number of representations of a natural number n as the sum of four squares is denoted by r4(n). Jacobi's four-square theorem states that this is eight times the sum of the divisors of n if n is odd and 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of n if n is even (see divisor function), i.e.",
