The bird is featured in at least three of Aesop's Fables: The Fox and the Stork, The Farmer and the Stork, and The Frogs Who Desired a King.[125] They were also thought to care for their aged parents, feeding them and even transporting them, and children's books depicted them as a model of filial values. A Greek law called Pelargonia, from the Ancient Greek word pelargos for stork, required citizens to take care of their aged parents.[8] The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death.[126] It was allegedly protected in Ancient Thessaly as it hunted snakes, and widely held to be Virgil's \"white bird\".[127] Roman writers noted the white stork's arrival in spring, which alerted farmers to plant their vines.[128]",
