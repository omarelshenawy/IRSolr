Interstate Highways are numbered in a gridâeven-numbered routes are eastâwest routes (but the lowest numbers are along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico), and odd-numbered routes are northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean). US Highways are also numbered in a gridâeven numbered for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). For this reason, mainline (two-digit) Interstate Highways in Michigan all have numbers above 69 and mainline US Highways all have numbers below 45. Three-digit Interstate and U.S. Highways, also known as \"child routes,\" are branches off their main one- or two-digit \"parents\". The Interstate and US Highways are maintained by MDOT. InterstateÂ 75 (I-75) and US HighwayÂ 23 (USÂ 23) are the longest examples in the state.",
