				"previous": "As in all mushroom-producing fungi, the fruit bodies (sporocarps) are the reproductive structures that are produced from fungal mycelium when the appropriate environmental conditions of temperature, humidity and nutrient availability are met. Hydnellum peckii is a stipitate hydnoid fungus, meaning that it has a cap atop a stipe (stem), and a form resembling a Hydnumâcharacterized by a teeth-like hymenium, rather than gills or pores on the underside of the cap. Fruit bodies growing closely together often appear to fuse together (this is called \"confluence\"). They can reach a height of up to 10.5Â cm (4.1Â in).[5] Fresh fruit bodies exude a striking, thick red fluid when they are moist.[2]",
				"after": "The cap's surface is convex to flattened, more or less uneven and sometimes slightly depressed in the center. It is usually densely covered with \"hairs\" that give it a texture similar to felt or velvet; these hairs are sloughed off in age, leaving the caps of mature specimens smooth.[5] Its shape varies from somewhat round to irregular, 4 to 10Â cm (1.6 to 3.9Â in), or even as much as 20Â cm (7.9Â in) wide as a result of confluence. The cap is initially whitish, but later turns slightly brownish, with irregular dark-brown to nearly black blotches where it is bruised. In maturity, the surface is fibrous and tough, scaly and jagged, grayish-brown in the upper part of the cap, and somewhat woody. The flesh is a pale pinkish-brown.[12]",
