				"after": "Feathers on the alula or bastard wing are not generally considered to be flight feathers in the strict sense; though they are asymmetrical, they lack the length and stiffness of most true flight feathers. However, alula feathers are definitely an aid to slow flight. These feathersâwhich are attached to the bird's \"thumb\" and normally lie flush against the anterior edge of the wingâfunction in the same way as the slats on an airplane wing, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attackÂ â and thus liftÂ â without resulting in a stall. By manipulating its thumb to create a gap between the alula and the rest of the wing, a bird can avoid stalling when flying at low speeds or landing.[11]",
