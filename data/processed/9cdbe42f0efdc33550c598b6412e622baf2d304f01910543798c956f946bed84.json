				"previous": "In the Atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap.[372] Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft[373] and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.[374] Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War,[375] were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics.[376] Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious.",
				"after": "Land warfare changed from the static front lines of World WarÂ I to increased mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.[377] In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,[378] and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.",
