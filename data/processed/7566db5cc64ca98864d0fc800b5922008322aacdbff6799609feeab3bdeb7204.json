The yellow-legged gull is a particular problem in the Mediterranean, and great skuas were estimated to kill 7,500 petrels a year on St Kilda, an unsustainable number.[17][48] Some great black-backed gulls on the Atlantic islands specialise in taking seabird chicks at night,[39] and peregrine falcons hunt adults at sea.[25] Localised predators include Eleonora's falcon on the Columbretes Islands and the nocturnal barn owl on the Balearics; a few owls can wipe out a colony.[17] The little owl is also a predator of both adults and young where it occurs.[39]",
