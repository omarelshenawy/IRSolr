				"previous": "Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri are largely dictated by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering.[102] Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick.[103] The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time.[104] Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro.[104] Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability.[105] Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten.[105] Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made.[105] In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest.[104] (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.[104]) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.[106]",
				"after": "Houses in rural Ratanakiri are made from bamboo, rattan, wood, saek, and kanma leaves, all of which are collected from nearby forests; they typically last for around three years.[34] Village spatial organization varies by ethnic group.[60] Kreung villages are constructed in a circular manner, with houses facing inwards toward a central meeting house.[60] In Jarai villages, vast longhouses are inhabited by all extended families, with the inner house divided into smaller compartments.[60] Tampuan villages may follow either pattern.[60]",
