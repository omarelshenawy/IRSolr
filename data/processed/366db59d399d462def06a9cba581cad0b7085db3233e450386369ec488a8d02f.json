				"previous": "At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True[74] was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region.[76] Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist.[77] With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics.[78] The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animalsÂ â lizards, serpents, birdsÂ â and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas.[76] In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.[79]",
				"after": "With the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers, True also devised an innovative color-coding for the pipes and machinery, which was implemented throughout all BOR projects.[80] True's consulting artist job lasted through 1942; it was extended so he could complete design work for the Parker, Shasta and Grand Coulee dams and power plants. True's work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in The New Yorker, part of which read, \"lose the spark, and justify the dream; but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme\".[81]",
