				"after": "The assumptions on the etymology of the name \"Italia\" are very numerous and the corpus of the solutions proposed by historians and linguists is very wide.[27] According to one of the more common explanations, the term Italia, from Latin: Italia,[28] was borrowed through Greek from the Oscan VÃ­teliÃº, meaning \"land of young cattle\" (cf. Lat vitulus \"calf\", Umb vitlo \"calf\").[29] The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the Social War. Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus,[30] mentioned also by Aristotle[31] and Thucydides.[32]",
