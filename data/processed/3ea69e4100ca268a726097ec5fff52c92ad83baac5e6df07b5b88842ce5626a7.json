				"In free space (that is, space not containing electric charges), the equations take the form (using SI units):[29]",
				"In 1864, James Clerk Maxwell (1831â1879) presented a combined theory of electricity and magnetism. He combined all the laws then known relating to those two phenomenon into four equations. These vector calculus equations which use the del operator () are known as Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism."
