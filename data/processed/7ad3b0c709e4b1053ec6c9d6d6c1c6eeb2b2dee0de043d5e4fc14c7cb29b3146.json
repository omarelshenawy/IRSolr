				"previous": "Before Rusa affected South Korea, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued high sea warnings on AugustÂ 29.[13] Airports were closed in the southern portion of the country,[14] and dams let out water to prevent excessive flooding.[15] Typhoon Rusa affected much of South Korea with heavy rainfall and high winds.[4] Jeju Island off the country's southern coast reported 660Â mm (26Â in) of rainfall, producing flash flooding that flooded cars. On the island, high winds downed trees and left 60,000Â people without power. All lower and middle schools on the island were closed, and residents were stranded after officials halted ferry and airline service.[14] On the South Korean mainland, winds reached as high as 180Â km/h (110Â mph). High amounts of rainfall were reported on Jeju Province and along the country's southern coast, although the heaviest rainfall was only reported in a small region. In Gangneung, located in the eastern portion of the country, severe thunderstorms developed due to high instability resulting from humid air from the east interacting with the Taebaek Mountains, producing high amounts of precipitation. The city reported the highest rainfall total in the country with 897.5Â mm (35.33Â in), of which 880Â mm (35Â in) was observed in one day. The total represented 62% of Gangneung's average yearly rainfall, and became the highest daily rainfall in the country's history, exceeding the previous record set in 1981 by 300Â mm (12Â in). In the South Korea interior, rainfall rates were considered a 1 in 200 year event.[4]",
				"after": "Damage in South Korea was estimated at $4.2Â billion (â©5.15Â trillion KRW).[6] Damage was heaviest in Gangneung,[4] where about 36,000Â homes and 622Â military buildings were flooded. At the airbase in Gangneung, floods submerged 16Â jet fighters.[3] Along the coast, high winds damaged 640Â boats and about 200,000Â marine buildings, and 265Â industrial buildings were also damaged.[6] The heavy rainfall left mudslides in the country, one of which covered ten cars in Gangneung.[16] Flooding and the landslides disrupted the country's infrastructure;[6] the storm destroyed 274Â bridges and damaged roads and rails at 164Â locations.[17] Rusa killed 300,000Â livestock and flooded 85,000Â hectares (210,000Â acres) of crop fields,[17][18] representing 6% of the country's agricultural lands, mostly affecting fruit and vegetables.[6] The storm caused the Vana H Cup KBC Augusta golf tournament to end early,[19] and a stadium to be used for the 2002 Asian Games was damaged.[20] Across the country, 88,625Â people were forced to evacuate due to the typhoon,[3] and 17,046Â houses were damaged.[21] High winds left 1.25Â million people after blowing down 24,000Â power lines.[17][18] There were 213Â deaths in the country, and another 33Â were missing and presumed dead;[6] This made Rusa the deadliest typhoon in the country in more than 43Â years.[22]",
