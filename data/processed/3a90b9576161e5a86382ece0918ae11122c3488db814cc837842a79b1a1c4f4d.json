				"after": "William Champion's brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process.[17] Prior to this, only calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter.[78] Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium, which processed even more zinc.[63] Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch.[79] He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect \"animal electricity\".[80] The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection.[80]",
