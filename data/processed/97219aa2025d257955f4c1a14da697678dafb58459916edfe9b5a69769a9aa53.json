				"after": "With large metallic red inflorescences and attractive feathery leaves that are perhaps the softest of all Banksia species,[11] B.Â brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. Seeds and plants are readily available in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback.[16][17] Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate.[43] The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour as soon as they open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage.[11]",
