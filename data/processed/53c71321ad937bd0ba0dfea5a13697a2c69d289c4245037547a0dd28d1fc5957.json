It also had the effect of drawing the Transvaal and the Orange Free State (led by President Martinus Theunis Steyn) together in opposition to perceived British imperialism. In 1897, a military pact was concluded between the two republics. President Paul Kruger proceeded to re-equip the Transvaal army, and imported 37,000 of the latest Mauser Model 1895 rifles, and some 40 to 50 million rounds of ammunition.[17] The best modern European artillery was also purchased.",
