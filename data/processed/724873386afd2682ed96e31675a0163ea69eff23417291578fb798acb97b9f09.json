				"after": "Music is cherished in Boston. The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the \"Big Five,\" a group of the greatest American orchestras, and the classical music magazine Gramophone called it one of the \"world's best\" orchestras.[153] Symphony Hall (located west of Back Bay) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, (and the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra, which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation) and the Boston Pops Orchestra. The British newspaper The Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall \"one of the top venues for classical music in the world,\" adding that \"Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design.\"[154] Other concerts are held at the New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall. The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston Opera House. Other performing-arts organizations located in the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company, Opera Boston, Boston Baroque (the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US),[155] and the Handel and Haydn Society (one of the oldest choral companies in the United States).[156] The city is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups, several of which are associated with the city's conservatories and universities. These include the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Boston Musica Viva.[155] Several theaters are located in or near the Theater District south of Boston Common, including the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Citi Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre.[157]",
