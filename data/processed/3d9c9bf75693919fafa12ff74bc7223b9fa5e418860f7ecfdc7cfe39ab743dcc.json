				"previous": "The blue-faced honeyeater was first described by ornithologist John Latham in his 1802 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae. However, he described it as three separate species, seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case: The blue-eared grackle (Gracula cyanotis), the blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops cyanops), and as the blue-cheeked thrush (Turdus cyanous).[2][3] It was as the blue-cheeked bee-eater that it was painted between 1788 and 1797 by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter.[4]",
				"after": "It was reclassified in the genus Entomyzon, which was erected by William Swainson in 1825, who observed the \"Blue-faced Grakle\" as the only insectivorous member of the genus and posited it was a link between the smaller honeyeaters and the riflebirds of the genus Ptiloris.[5] The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek ento-/ÎµÎ½ÏÎ¿- (\"inside\") and myzein/Î¼ÏÎ¶ÎµÎ¹Î½ \"to drink\" or \"suck\". The specific epithet, cyanotis, means \"blue-eared\" and combines cyano-/ÎºÏÎ±Î½Î¿- \"blue\" with otis, a Latinised form of ÏÏÎ¿Ï, the Greek genitive of ous/Î¿ÏÏ \"ear\".[6] Swainson spelt it Entomiza in an 1837 publication,[7] and George Gray wrote Entomyza in 1840.[8]",
