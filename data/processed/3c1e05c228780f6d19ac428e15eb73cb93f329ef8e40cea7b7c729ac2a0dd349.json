				"previous": "Most passerines are smaller than typical members of other avian orders. The heaviest and altogether largest passerines are the thick-billed raven and the larger races of common raven, each exceeding 1.5Â kg (3.3Â lb) and 70Â cm (28Â in). The superb lyrebird and some birds-of-paradise, due to very long tails or tail coverts, are longer overall. The smallest passerine is the short-tailed pygmy tyrant, at 6.5Â cm (2.6Â in) and 4.2Â g (0.15Â oz).",
