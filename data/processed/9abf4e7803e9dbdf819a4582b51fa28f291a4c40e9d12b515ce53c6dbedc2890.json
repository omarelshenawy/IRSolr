				"after": "Protected under the United States Federal Endangered Species Act,[16] the bog turtle is considered threatened in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as of November 4, 1997. Due to a \"similarity of appearance\" to the northern population, the bog turtle is also threatened in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia (considered to be the southern population).[21] In addition to the federal listing of threatened, states in the southern range list the bog turtle as either endangered or threatened.[39] Changes to the bog turtle's habitat have resulted in the disappearance of 80Â percent of the colonies that existed 30Â years ago.[7] Because of the turtle's rarity, it is also in danger of illegal collection, often for the worldwide pet trade.[51] Despite regulations prohibiting their collection, barter, or export, bog turtles are commonly taken by poachers.[21] Road traffic has also led to declines.[38] The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a plan for the recovery of the northern population.[52] The bog turtle was listed as critically endangered in the 2011 IUCN Red List.[53]",
