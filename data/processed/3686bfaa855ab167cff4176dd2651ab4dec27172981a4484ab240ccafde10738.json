				"after": "Bacon often created second versions of his major paintings. In 1988, he completed a near-copy of the original Three Studies. At 78 Ã 58Â inches (198 Ã 147Â cm), this second version is more than twice the size of the original, and the orange background has been replaced by a blood-red hue. The figures occupy a smaller proportion of the canvas than those of the 1944 version, a device which, according to the Tate Gallery's catalogue, \"plung[es] them into a deep void\".[52]",
