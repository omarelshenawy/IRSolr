				"after": "Constance Parkin was born in 1906 in the hamlet of Miram, near Nhill in western Victoria.[2] The family moved to Melbourne in 1920, where she completed her schooling at Genazzano convent in the suburb of Kew.[3] Constance was short, just under five feet tall, and had dark hair.[4] She trained between 1925 and 1929 at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne. Over the summer of 1925â1926 the Gallery held a competition for its students, who were asked to paint \"holiday subjects\"; Constance won the prize for a landscape. The competition was judged by artist George Bell, who would have a continuing influence over her artistic career.[5][6]",
