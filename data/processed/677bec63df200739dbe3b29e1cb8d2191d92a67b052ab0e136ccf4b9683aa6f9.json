				"after": "Another important aspect of St Kildan life was the daily 'Parliament'. This was a meeting held in the street every morning after prayers and attended by all the adult males during the course of which they would decide upon the day's activities. No one led the meeting, and all men had the right to speak. According to Steel (1988), \"Discussion frequently spread discord, but never in recorded history were feuds so bitter as to bring about a permanent division in the community\".[64] This notion of a free society influenced Enric Miralles' vision for the new Scottish Parliament Building, opened in October 2004.[65]",
