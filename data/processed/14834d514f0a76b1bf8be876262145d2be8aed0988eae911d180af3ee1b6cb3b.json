				"previous": "In 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many Little Nemo strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Robert had worked. Many of the recovered originals were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of Little Nemo strips in Italy.[126] His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University.[127]",
				"after": "McCay's work, grounded solidly in his understanding of realistic perspective, presaged the techniques featured in Walt Disney's feature films.[13] Disney paid tribute to McCay in 1955 on an episode of Disneyland. The episode, \"The Story of Animated Drawing\", gave a history of animation, and dramatized McCay's vaudeville act with Gertie. Robert was invited to the Disney studios as a consultant on the episode, where Disney told him, \"Bob, all this should be your father's\".[128]",
