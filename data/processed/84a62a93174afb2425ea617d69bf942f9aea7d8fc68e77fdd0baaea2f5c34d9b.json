				"previous": "In 1939, Nazi German occupation forces closed the university after invading Poland.[16] Able-bodied males were required to work, so from 1940 to 1944 WojtyÅa variously worked as a messenger for a restaurant, a manual labourer in a limestone quarry and for the Solvay chemical factory, to avoid deportation to Germany.[17][25] In 1940 he was struck by a tram, suffering a fractured skull. The same year he was hit by a lorry in a quarry, which left him with one shoulder higher than the other and a permanent stoop.[27] His father, a former Austro-Hungarian non-commissioned officer and later officer in the Polish Army, died of a heart attack in 1941,[19] leaving WojtyÅa as the immediate family's only surviving member.[18][20][28] \"I was not at my mother's death, I was not at my brother's death, I was not at my father's death,\" he said, reflecting on these times of his life, nearly forty years later, \"At twenty, I had already lost all the people I loved.\"[28]",
				"after": "After his father's death, he started thinking seriously about the priesthood.[29] In October 1942, while the war continued, he knocked on the door of the Bishop's Palace in KrakÃ³w and asked to study for the priesthood.[29] Soon after, he began courses in the clandestine underground seminary run by the Archbishop of KrakÃ³w, Adam Stefan Cardinal Sapieha. On 29 February 1944, WojtyÅa was hit by a German truck. German Wehrmacht officers tended to him and sent him to a hospital. He spent two weeks there recovering from a severe concussion and a shoulder injury. It seemed to him that this accident and his survival was a confirmation of his vocation. On 6 August 1944, a day known as 'Black Sunday',[30] the Gestapo rounded up young men in KrakÃ³w to curtail the uprising there, [30] similar to the recent uprising in Warsaw.[31][32] WojtyÅa escaped by hiding in the basement of his uncle's house at 10 Tyniecka Street, while the German troops searched above.[29][31][32] More than eight thousand men and boys were taken that day, while WojtyÅa escaped to the Archbishop's Palace,[29][30][31] where he remained until after the Germans had left.[18][29][31]",
