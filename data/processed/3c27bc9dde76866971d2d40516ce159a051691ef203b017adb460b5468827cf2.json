				"after": "This runestone is located in TransjÃ¶. It is one of the older stones as it is in the style RAK. The runes are unusual as the m-runes are dotted () and the k-runes have a stroke to the left instead of to the right. The stone was raised in memory of a son who died in England named Ketill, who was described as being Ã³nÃ­Ã°ingr. ÃnÃ­Ã°ingr, which with the Ã³- prefix means the opposite of the Old Norse pejorative word nÃ­Ã°ingr, was used to describe a man as being virtuous and is translated in the Rundata database as \"unvillainous.\" It is used as a descriptive term on inscriptions SÃ¶ 189 in Ãkerby, Sm 37 in RÃ¶rbro, Sm 147 in Vasta Ed, and DR 68 in Ãrhus, and appears as a name or part of a name on inscriptions Ãg 77 in HovgÃ¥rden, Ãg 217 in Oppeby, Sm 2 in AringsÃ¥s, and Sm 131 in Hjortholmen.[43] The text on Sm 5, Sm 37, and Ãg 77 use the same exact phrase manna mÃ¦str oniÃ°ingR or \"most unvillainous of men\" to describe the deceased,[43] and DR 68 uses a variant of this phrase.[44]",
