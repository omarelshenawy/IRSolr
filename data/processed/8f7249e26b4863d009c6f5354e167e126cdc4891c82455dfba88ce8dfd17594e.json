				"previous": "McCay's detailed hatching[22] mastery of perspective enhanced the illusions in his drawings, particularly in Little Nemo.[13] Fantastic grotesqueries such as what McCay witnessed during his time at the Wonderland and Eden Musee appeared often in McCay's work.[10] McCay was noted for the speed and accuracy with which he could draw; crowds of people would gather around to watch him paint billboards.[142]",
				"after": "McCay had a taste for the ornate. The architecture he drew was inspired by that of carnivals and the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The detailed illustrations in British illustrated newspapers The Illustrated London News and The Graphic. The Maison QuantinÂ (fr) of Paris published a series of illustrated books called Images Enphantines, whose pages bear a striking resemblance to McCay's early Little Nemo strips, both in their graphic sense and their imaginative layouts.[143]",
