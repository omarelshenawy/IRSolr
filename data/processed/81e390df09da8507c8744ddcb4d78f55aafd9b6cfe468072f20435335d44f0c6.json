				"after": "Bohemian Rhapsody was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is in the style of a stream-of-consciousness nightmare that has unusual song structure, more akin to a classical rhapsody than popular music. The song has no chorus, instead consisting of three main parts including an operatic segment, an a cappella passage, and a heavy rock solo. When it was released as a single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" became a commercial success, staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks. It reached number one again in 1991, after Freddie Mercury's death, achieving total sales of 2,176,000 and becoming the UK's third best selling single of all time.",
