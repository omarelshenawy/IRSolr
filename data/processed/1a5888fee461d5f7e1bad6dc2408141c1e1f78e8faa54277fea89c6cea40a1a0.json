				"after": "Some populations of cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult for this species.[21] In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand in the winter and return in the spring.[27] Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non-breeding season.[21] Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September.[34][35] During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India[36] and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.[7]",
