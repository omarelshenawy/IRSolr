				"after": "Since warp knitting requires that the number of separate strands of yarn (\"ends\") equals the number of stitches in a row, warp knitting is almost always done by machine, not by hand. Warp knitting comprises several types of knitted fabrics, including tricot, raschel knits, milanese knits and stitch-bonding. All warp-knit fabrics are resistant to runs and relatively easy to sew. Raschel laceâthe most common type of laceâis a warp knit fabric but using many more guide-bars (12+) than the usual machines which mostly have three or four bars.",
