				"previous": "In 1946, the school became a Secondary Modern. Between 1957 and 1963 the secondary facilities were closed, leaving the school as a primary school.[43] In 1965, the school came under the control of the newly created London Borough of Haringey.[42] Following reorganisation of Haringey's education services, it is now a primary school serving approximately 500 pupils between the ages of three and 11.[44]",
				"after": "Although Plumbe's original plans for the estate had envisaged a recreational area in the centre of the estate, this never came into being and the land reserved for it was built over during the estate's early development. Despite Noel Park's proximity to the leisure facilities of nearby Alexandra Park, in 1929 a long, thin strip of land near the south of the estate was designated as parkland and given the name \"Russell Park\". In 2003, following consultation with residents, the park was renamed \"Noel Park\" by Haringey Council.[41] Its name has since been changed back to Russell Park.[45]",
