				"previous": "The new school was built after Cox and his wife, Barbara, were able to raise the money in six months[4][6] partly by mortgaging their house.[1][9] Cox also obtained financial support from others and took over payments on the mortgage for the school. Verne Read, a businessman and financial supporter of Bat Conservation International,[10] took over payments on the mortgage for the school.[5][11] Ken Murdock, founder of the herbal company Nature's Way, and Rex Maughan, owner of Forever Living Products, funded the construction of the school[5][12] and repaid the loggers for their US$20,000 advance.[5][13] During a tribal ceremony held in February 1989, Cox, along with the village chiefs (matai) signed the \"The Falealupo Covenant,\" which legally protected the forest for 50Â years in exchange for their help.[2][3] During the ceremony, the village chiefs also bestowed chief's titles on Murdock and Maughan and proclaimed that Cox was a reincarnation of their god, Nafanua,[14] because like Nafanua, he did not come from Samoa and both had fought to protect the village and the forest.[15] The title bestowed upon him made Cox responsible for the well-being of the village and obligated that he return to visit.[1]",
				"after": "In 1992, Cox and his friends had finished helping the Samoan villagers at Falealupo, as well as nearby Tafua, which encountered the same problem.[16] Prior to that, Murdock, who later became Seacology's President, suggested continuing their work by seeking out more villages with which they could exchange projects for marine and forest reserves.[5] As demand among island villages grew, Bill MarrÃ©, a business consultant and executive coach who later became a member of the Board of Trustees and the Chairman's Advisory Council, suggested establishing a nonprofit organization to continue their work.[16] He suggested the name \"Seacology\" to reflect the organization's focus on island conservation, and helped cofound the nonprofit in 1991, along with Cox and Murdock.[5] Using his own funds, MarrÃ© paid the costs of starting the organization and covered its administrative costs for the first three years. Together with his assistant, MarrÃ© helped advertise Seacology by giving lectures at schools and universities, visiting other island nations, and writing articles about the work for the local media.[16]",
