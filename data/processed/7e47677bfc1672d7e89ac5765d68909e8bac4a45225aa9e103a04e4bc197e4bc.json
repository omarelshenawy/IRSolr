				"after": "Keith Caulfield from Billboard complimented the song's \"enlightment\" theme.[8] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that the song turned clichÃ© comments like \"Love at first sight\" into a pop slogan.[6] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly said that it was fluid in nature and called Madonna as a \"restless soul aching to connect\" in the song.[9] Jason Shawhan from About.com also complimented the song by describing it as a \"weird and wonderful number.\"[5] Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media wrote: \"On 'Get Together', as Price's synths ebb and flow moodily, Madonna asks the eternal question, 'Do you believe in love at first sight?', over a tripping vocal melody.\"[10] Joan Morgan of The Village Voice wrote: \"The momentum builds rapidly with a seamless transition into the wicked alchemy of 'Get Together', where Madge and Price offer up an irresistible manipulation of rather sweet vocals laced over thumping percussion, seductive synthesizers, and a few subtle soul-claps thrown in for good measure.\"[11]",
