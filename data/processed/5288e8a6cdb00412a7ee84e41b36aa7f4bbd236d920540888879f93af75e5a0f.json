Eisenhower announced a new Atoms for Peace policy, and the United States Congress enacted his program into law the following year.[8] Atoms for Peace \"made funding accessible to anyone who had the imagination, if not the ability, to harness the atom's power for peaceful purposes\".[37] Under the new program, the airplane manufacturer Curtiss-Wright Corporation sought a large isolated area in central Pennsylvania \"for the development of nuclear-powered jet engines and to conduct research in nucleonics, metallurgy, ultrasonics, electronics, chemicals and plastics\".[38][39] Curtiss-Wright worked closely with the state and, in June 1955, George M. Leader, the Governor of Pennsylvania, signed legislation that authorized the construction of a research facility at Quehanna. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sold Curtiss-Wright 8,597 acres (3,479Â ha) for $181,250 ($22.50 an acre, $55.60 a hectare), and gave the company a 99-year lease on the remaining 42,596 acres (17,238Â ha) at $30,000 a year. Curtiss-Wright controlled 51,193 acres (80.0Â sqÂ mi; 207.2Â km2) in a regular 16-sided polygon, which was easier to fence than a circular area.[8][37][40][41]",
