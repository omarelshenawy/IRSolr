Printing arrived in Jersey only in the 1780s, but the island supported a multitude of regular publications in French (and JÃ¨rriais) and English throughout the 19th century, in which poetry, most usually topical and satirical, flourished (see JÃ¨rriais literature).The first JÃ¨rriais book to be published was Rimes et PoÃ©sies Jersiaises de divers auteurs rÃ©unies et mises en ordre, edited by Abraham Mourant in 1865. Writers born in Jersey include Elinor Glyn, John LempriÃ¨re, Philippe Le Sueur Mourant, Robert Pipon Marett, and Augustus Asplet Le Gros. Frederick Tennyson and Gerald Durrell were among authors who made Jersey their home. Contemporary authors based in Jersey include Jack Higgins.",
