				"previous": "Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45Â°âan amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in a fraction of a second.[93] The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus' mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timberâalthough it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.[94]",
				"after": "Scientists have produced a wide range of maximum speed estimates, mostly around 11 metres per second (40Â km/h; 25Â mph), but a few as low as 5â11 metres per second (18â40Â km/h; 11â25Â mph), and a few as high as 20 metres per second (72Â km/h; 45Â mph). Researchers have to rely on various estimating techniques because, while there are many tracks of very large theropods walking, so far none have been found of very large theropods runningâand this absence may indicate that they did not run.[95] Scientists who think that Tyrannosaurus was able to run point out that hollow bones and other features that would have lightened its body may have kept adult weight to a mere 4.5 metric tons (5.0 short tons) or so, or that other animals like ostriches and horses with long, flexible legs are able to achieve high speeds through slower but longer strides. Additionally, some have argued that Tyrannosaurus had relatively larger leg muscles than any animal alive today, which could have enabled fast running 40â70 kilometres per hour (25â43Â mph).[96]",
