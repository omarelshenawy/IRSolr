				"previous": "More recently, the emergence of human security â a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats â has led to a growing recognition of a relationship between security and development. Human security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.",
