Instead the turtle is classified as G5 (demonstrably widespread) in its Natural Heritage Global Rank,[69] and the IUCN rates it as a \"Least Concern\" species.[3] The painted turtle's high reproduction rate and its ability to survive in polluted wetlands and artificially made ponds have allowed it to maintain its range,[7][143] but the post-Columbus settlement of North America has reduced its numbers.[36][144]",
