				"after": "Allosaurus was a typical large theropod, having a massive skull on a short neck, a long tail and reduced forelimbs. Allosaurus fragilis, the best-known species, had an average length of 8.5Â m (28Â ft),[2] with the largest definitive Allosaurus specimen (AMNH 680) estimated at 9.7Â meters long (32Â ft),[3] and an estimated weight of 2.3Â metric tons (2.5Â short tons).[3] In his 1976 monograph on Allosaurus, James Madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of 12 to 13Â m (39 to 43Â ft).[4] As with dinosaurs in general, weight estimates are debatable, and since 1980 have ranged between 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds), 1,000 to 4,000Â kg (2,200 to 8,800Â lb), and 1,010 kilograms (2,230 pounds) for modal adult weight (not maximum).[5] John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggests that 1,000Â kg (2,200Â lb) is reasonable for large adults of A. fragilis, but that 700Â kg (1,500Â lb) is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average-sized thigh bones he has measured.[6] Using the subadult specimen nicknamed \"Big Al\", researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of 1,500 kilograms (3,300Â lb) for the individual, but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately 1,400 kilograms (3,100Â lb) to approximately 2,000 kilograms (4,400Â lb).[7]",
