				"previous": "Long-term field research has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality.[14] It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society,[11][13][14][19] although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous.[11][14] This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.[19]",
