				"previous": "The industrial sector is small, contributing 14.3% of GDP in 2010.[77] Products manufactured include cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles and cigarettes.[77] Rwanda's mining industry is an important contributor, generating US$93Â million in 2008.[147] Minerals mined include cassiterite, wolframite, gold, and coltan, which is used in the manufacture of electronic and communication devices such as mobile phones.[147][148]",
				"after": "Rwanda's service sector suffered during the late-2000s recession as banks reduced lending and foreign aid projects and investment were reduced.[149] The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP.[77] Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health.[149] Tourism is one of the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2011.[150] In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination;[151] The Directorate of Immigration and Emigration recorded 405,801 people visiting the country between January and June 2011; 16% of these arrived from outside Africa.[152] Revenue from tourism was US$115.6Â million between January and June 2011; holidaymakers contributed 43% of this revenue, despite being only 9% of the numbers.[152] Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park, attracts thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits.[153] Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.[154]",
