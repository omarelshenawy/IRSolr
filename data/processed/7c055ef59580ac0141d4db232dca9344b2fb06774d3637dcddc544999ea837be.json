				"previous": "Tropical cyclones have formed in all months.[19] Three tropical cyclones existed during the month of January, two of which formed during late December: the second Hurricane Alice in 1954/1955, and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005/2006. The only hurricane to form in January was a Category 1 hurricane in the 1938 season. A subtropical storm in January also began the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season.[20] The strongest storm outside the hurricane season, Hurricane Able in 1951, attained Category 3 status on 21 May and ranks as the earliest intense hurricane on record.[30]",
