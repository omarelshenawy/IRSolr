				"after": "A leading literary magazine, The Atlantic has published many significant works and authors. It was the first to publish pieces by the abolitionists Julia Ward Howe (\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" on February 1, 1862), and William Parker's slave narrative, \"The Freedman's Story\" (in February and March 1866). It also published Charles W. Eliot's \"The New Education\", a call for practical reform that led to his appointment to presidency of Harvard University in 1869; works by Charles Chesnutt before he collected them in The Conjure Woman (1899); and poetry and short stories, helping launch many national literary careers.[citation needed] For example, Emily Dickinson, after reading an article in The Atlantic by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, asked him to become her mentor.[citation needed] In 2005, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for fiction.[citation needed]",
