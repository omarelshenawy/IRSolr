				"Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary.",
				"During classical antiquity, Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and beyond and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek. In its modern form, the Greek language, today is the official language in two countries; Greece and Cyprus, recognized minority language in seven other countries, and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. The language is spoken by at least 13 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, large parts of Albania, the Balkans, and the Greek diaspora."
