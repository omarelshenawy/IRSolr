				"after": "Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic. Exposure to large amounts can cause hyperirritability and spasms, due to the chemical similarity of caesium to potassium, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources and nonradioactive caesium is not a significant environmental hazard.[104] The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3Â g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride.[105] The principal use of nonradioactive caesium, as caesium formate in petroleum drilling fluids, takes advantage of its low toxicity compared to less costly alternatives.[71]",
