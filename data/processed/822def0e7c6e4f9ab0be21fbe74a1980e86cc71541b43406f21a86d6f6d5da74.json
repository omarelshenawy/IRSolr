He created a small sewing shop in the heart of Montreal to make a well fitting, good quality bra in the mid-priced range (from $1.00 to $1.50 retail). As part of this effort, he traveled to New York City and met with Israel Pilot and licensed the Wonder-Bra trademark and diagonal slash patent.[6] In Canada, the trademark lost the hyphen, and became \"WonderBra,\" and \"Wonderbra\" at the U.S. reintroduction.",
