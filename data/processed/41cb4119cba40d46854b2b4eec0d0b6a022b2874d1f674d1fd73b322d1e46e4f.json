Parrots were hunted, kept as pets, and traded by Amerindians in the Caribbean before the arrival of Europeans. The Cuban macaw was reportedly \"stupid\" and slow to escape, and therefore was easily caught. It was killed for food; Gemelli Careri found the meat tasty, but Gundlach considered it tough.[2] Archaeological evidence suggests the Cuban macaw was hunted in Havana in the 16thâ18th centuries.[7] It may also have been persecuted as a crop pest, though it did not live near dwellings.[2]",
