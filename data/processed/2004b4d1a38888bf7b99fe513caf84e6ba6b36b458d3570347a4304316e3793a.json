The sex ratio is 899Â females per 1000Â malesâlower than the national average.[95] The ratio is depressed by the influx of working males from surrounding rural areas, from the rest of West Bengal, and from neighbouring states, mainly Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Orissa; these men commonly leave their families behind.[96] Kolkata's literacy rate of 87.14%[95] exceeds the all-India average of 74%.[97] The urban agglomeration had a population of 14,112,536 in 2011.[11]",
