				"Approximately 11,000 people out of a population of 60,000 died of plague in 1675.[64]",
				"The knights, led by Frenchman Jean Parisot de Valette, Grand Master of the Order, withstood a siege by the Ottomans in 1565. The knights, with the help of Spanish and Maltese forces were victorious and repelled the attack. Speaking of the battle Voltaire said, \"Nothing is better known than the siege of Malta.\"[63] After the siege they decided to increase Malta's fortifications, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of Valletta, named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established watchtowers along the coastsÂ â the Wignacourt, Lascaris and De Redin towersÂ â named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights' presence on the island saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of CittÃ  Vittoriosa, the construction of new cities including CittÃ  Rohan and CittÃ  Hompesch and the introduction of new academic and social resources."
