				"previous": "Therefore every blade of grade r can be written as a geometric product of r vectors. More generally, if a degenerate geometric algebra is allowed, then the orthogonal matrix is replaced by a block matrix that is orthogonal in the nondegenerate block, and the diagonal matrix has zero-valued entries along the degenerate dimensions. If the new vectors of the nondegenerate subspace are normalized according to",
				"after": "then these normalized vectors must square to +1 or â1. By Sylvester's law of inertia, the total number of +1s and the total number of â1s along the diagonal matrix is invariant. By extension, the total number p of these vectors that square to +1 and the total number q that square to â1 is invariant. (If the degenerate case is allowed, then the total number of basis vectors that square to zero is also invariant.) We denote this algebra . For example, models 3D Euclidean space, relativistic spacetime and a 3D conformal geometric algebra.",
