				"after": "The Royal Opera House, often referred to as simply \"Covent Garden\", was constructed as the \"Theatre Royal\" in 1732 to a design by Edward Shepherd.[47] During the first hundred years or so of its history, the theatre was primarily a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. In 1734, the first ballet was presented; a year later Handel's first season of operas began. Many of his operas and oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premiÃ¨res here.[48] It has been the home of The Royal Opera since 1945, and the Royal Ballet since 1946.[49]",
