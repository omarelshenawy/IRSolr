				"previous": "Rather than continuing the Amiens battle past the point of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.[157]",
				"after": "British and Dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the Battle of Albert on 21 August.[158] The assault was widened by French[159] and then further British forces in the following days. During the last week of August the pressure along a 70-mile (113Â km) front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, \"Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines.\"[157]",
