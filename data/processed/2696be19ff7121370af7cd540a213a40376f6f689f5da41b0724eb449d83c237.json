				"For example, consider the cyclic permutation matrix",
				"Since the eigenvalues are roots of the characteristic polynomial, an matrix has at most eigenvalues. If the matrix has real entries, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are all real; but it may have fewer than real roots, or no real roots at all."

				"after": "The fundamental theorem of algebra implies that the characteristic polynomial of an matrix , being a polynomial of degree , has exactly complex roots. More precisely, it can be factored into the product of linear terms,",
