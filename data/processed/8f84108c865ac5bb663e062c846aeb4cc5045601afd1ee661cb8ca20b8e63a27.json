				"previous": "Residents in both Seattle near their Lake Union seaport [10] and in Victoria have been growing increasingly concerned about noise and safety on the water. In Sept 2011 Victoria the St. James Community commissioned a report [11] that calls for \"serious restrictions\" on seaplane businesses\" (which include other services like helicopters). Kenmore Air has responded by encouraging their pilots to follow limited flight paths in Seattle [12] In 2013 when new high rise condos were proposed by Vulcan in South Lake Union neighborhood, Kenmore requested that an easemented be placed on new residents to prevent them from filing noise complaints and despite promises to cease operations by 8 pm as of June 2014 flights on Lake Union are occurring as late as 9 pm.",
