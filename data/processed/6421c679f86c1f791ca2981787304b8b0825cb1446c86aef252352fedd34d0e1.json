				"previous": "The prototype (G-ASHG) rolled out of the Hurn assembly hall on 28 July 1963, at which point BAC had received orders for the type from a number of operators. On 20 August 1963, the prototype conducted its first flight, painted in BUA's livery. The first flight had taken place almost a year before the Douglas DC-9, a rival American jetliner; BAC considered the BAC to hold a technological edge.[17] The One-Eleven's lead was of significant importance commercially, since â as shown by the Bonanza Air Lines case â US authorities could refuse to approve sales of foreign aircraft to domestic airlines where an American alternative existed.",
				"after": "The One-Eleven prototype, flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow, crashed on 22 October during Stall testing, with the loss of all on board. The investigation led to the discovery of what became known as deep stall or superstall, a phenomenon caused by reduced airflow to the tailplane caused by the combined blanking effects of the wing and the aft-mounted engine nacelles at high angles of attack, which prevents recovery of normal (nose-down) flight.[18] To prevent such stalls, BAC designed and added devices known as stick shakers and stick pushers to the One-Eleven's control system.[19] It also redesigned the wing's leading edge to smooth airflow into the engines and over the tailplane. The specially modified aircraft used for testing this problem is at Brooklands Museum.",
