				"after": "Young specimens of C.Â geaster have a hollow, club-shaped dark-brown fruit body, connected to a stem. The stem, which is usually buried in the ground, is shorter than the hollow fruit body or equals it in length, although the stem length is somewhat variable depending on the depth of the underground root to which it is attached. The flesh of the stem and the wall of the fruit body is white, while the inner surface is yellowish-white, turning light brown with age. The fruit body varies in width from 1.2 to 3.5Â cm (0.5 to 1.4Â in) in the thickest portion, and has a length of 4 to 12Â cm (1.6 to 4.7Â in); the stem is 0.75 to 1.5Â cm (0.3 to 0.6Â in) wide by 1 to 5Â cm (0.4 to 2.0Â in) long.[5] Both stem and fruit body are covered by a dense layer of soft brown velvety \"hairs\", or tomentum. In maturity, the fruit body splits open into 4â7 rays that curve downward, similar to mushrooms of the genus Geastrum. The spores are borne on the inner surface of the rays, which, depending on the maturity of the specimen, may range in color from whitish to saffron to salmon to butterscotch to chestnut.[15] The leathery rays are up to 0.35Â cm (0.1Â in) thick.[5]",
