				"For small elements, the angle PKQ is approximately a right angle and therefore",
				"The relations between y(Ï) and properties of the projection, such as the transformation of angles and the variation in scale, follow from the geometry of corresponding small elements on the globe and map. The figure below shows a point P at latitudeÂ Ï and longitudeÂ Î» on the globe and a nearby point Q at latitude Ï+Î´Ï and longitude Î»+Î´Î». The vertical lines PK and MQ are arcs of meridians of length RÎ´Ï.[9] The horizontal lines PM and KQ are arcs of parallels of length R(cosÂ Ï)Î´Î».[10] The corresponding points on the projection define a rectangle of widthÂ Î´x and heightÂ Î´y."
