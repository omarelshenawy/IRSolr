				"after": "Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20Â million years after the PermianâTriassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth.[31][32] Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.[33] Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs;[34] if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators.[35] The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.[36]",
