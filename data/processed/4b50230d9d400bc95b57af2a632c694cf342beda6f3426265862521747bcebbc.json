				"previous": "Since raccoons in high mortality areas have a higher rate of reproduction, extensive hunting may not solve problems with raccoon populations. Older males also claim larger home ranges than younger ones, resulting in a lower population density.",
				"after": "In the mythology of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, the raccoon was the subject of folk tales.[228] Stories such as \"How raccoons catch so many crayfish\" from the Tuscarora centered on its skills at foraging.[229] In other tales, the raccoon played the role of the trickster which outsmarts other animals, like coyotes and wolves.[230] Among others, the Dakota Sioux believe the raccoon has natural spirit powers, since its mask resembled the facial paintings, two-fingered swashes of black and white, used during rituals to connect to spirit beings.[231] The Aztecs linked supernatural abilities especially to females, whose commitment to their young was associated with the role of wise women in their society.[232]",
