				"previous": "With the initial quantity committed (75 pieces were returned to the mint, most likely because they were damaged or misstruck), the Association requested that more pieces be produced. A hundred thousand were coined at the San Francisco Mint in October and November, bearing the mint mark S (1926-S).[35] The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar thus became the first commemorative coin struck at multiple mints; Bowers notes that this set \"a precedent which would be expanded and abused in the years to come\".[36] According to Swiatek and Breen, \"the AssociationÂ ... [was] expecting that the collectors who bought 1926 Philadelphia coins would turn out in similar or greater numbers for the second variety\".[28] Although a few thousand quickly sold, the market for the half dollars proved saturated, and tens of thousands remained at the mint pending payment.[35][36] On December 29, 1926, Meeker celebrated his 96th birthday in New York; he was presented with 96 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars by the Association.[37]",
				"after": "Despite the many unsold 1926-S half dollars still in the government's hands, the Association sought the issuance of 1927-dated half dollars; this was refused by the Treasury Department (of which the Bureau of the Mint was a part) due to the backlog.[35] In 1928, 50,000 more were struck at the Philadelphia Mint.[28] Meeker continued his exploits: he was presented with 97 coins on his birthday in December 1927 by the Association[37] and brought his half dollars to the visitor's gallery of the New York Stock Exchange, though he was refused permission to go onto the floor.[38] In April 1928, Meeker wrote to the American Numismatic Association, urging its coin-collecting members to purchase both the 1926 and 1926-S pieces.[39] Nevertheless, although Meeker organized a national campaign to sell the coins, the OTMA lost $10,000 by his efforts, due to office and other expenses. \"The aged pioneer did not appear to be that good with money\".[40]",
