				"previous": "Design innovations included keeping the power turbine and propeller shaft sections independent, connecting them with a fluid coupling analogous to an automotive torque converter.[6] The igniter starts only the gas generator, making the engine easy to start, particularly in cold weather.[6] The engine consists of two sections that can be easily separated for maintenance.[6] In the gas-generator section air enters through an inlet screen into the low-pressure axial compressor. This has three stages on small and medium versions of the engine and four stages on large versions. The air then flows into a single-stage centrifugal compressor, through the annular reverse-flow combustion chamber, and finally through a single-stage compressor turbine that powers the compressors at about 45,000Â rpm. The hot gas from the gas generator section then flows into a separate power section of the engine, containing a single-stage power turbine driving the power take-off system at about 30,000Â rpm. For turboprop use, this powers a two-stage planetary output reduction gearbox, which turns the propeller at a speed of 1,900 to 2,200Â rpm. The exhaust gas then escapes through two side mounted ducts in the power turbine housing. The engine is arranged such that the power turbines are mounted inside the combustion chamber, reducing overall length.",
				"after": "In most aircraft installations the PT6 is mounted backwards in the nacelle, so that the intake side of the engine is facing the rear of the aircraft. This places the power section at the front of the nacelle, where it can drive the propeller directly without the need for a long shaft. Intake air is usually fed to the engine via an underside mounted duct, and the two exhaust outlets are directed rearward. This arrangement also aids maintenance by allowing the entire power section to be removed along with the propeller, exposing the gas-generator section. It also allows rough-field operations with foreign objects slung outside and around the turbine intake by internal separators in the inlet.[7]",
