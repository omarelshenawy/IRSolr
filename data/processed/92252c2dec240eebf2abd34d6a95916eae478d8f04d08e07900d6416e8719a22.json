				"after": "On November 18, the impatient Roosevelt directed that the second set of dies be used to strike coins, directly ordering the Mint to \"begin the new issue, even if it takes you all day to strike one piece!\"[3] Over 12,000 of these \"High Relief\" pieces were struck and were released into circulation in 1907 and 1908.[38] Barber wrote of the High Relief pieces to Landis, \"Mr. Hart has put the mill into operation and I send you two pieces showing the result; these are not selected as all the coins now made are the same as these two, which gives me alarm as they are so well made that I fear the President may demand the continuance of this particular coin.\"[39] Barber completed work on his version of the design, with a greatly lowered relief, and the new coin went into production on a large-scale basis. A total of 361,667Â of the revised design were produced by the Mint in 1907; the \"Low Relief\" coins were released into circulation at the end of December 1907.[40] Barber's modifications were denounced both by the sculptor's family and by Hering.[35] Among other alterations, Barber changed the Roman numeral MCMVII for the date to the Arabic numeral \"1907\".[35] In spite of the modifications, according to R.S. Yeoman in his A Guide Book of United States Coins, many consider the Saint-Gaudens double eagles the most beautiful of U.S. coins.[41]",
