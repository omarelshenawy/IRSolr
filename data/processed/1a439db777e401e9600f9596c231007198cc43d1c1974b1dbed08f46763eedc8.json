In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the west of Ireland.[38] In Tibet, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000Â m (16,400Â ft), and as high as 6,350Â m (20,600Â ft) on Mount Everest.[46][48] The population sometimes known as the Punjab ravenâdescribed as Corvus corax laurencei (also spelt lawrencii or laurencii) by Allan Octavian Hume but more often considered synonymous with subcorax[17]âis restricted to the Sindh district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India.[39][49] Except in Arctic habitats,[50] they are generally resident within their range for the whole year. Young birds may disperse locally.[51]",
