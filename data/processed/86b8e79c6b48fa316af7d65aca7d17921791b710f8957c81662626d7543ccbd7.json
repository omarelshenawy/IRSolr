				"after": "According to the Argentine newspaper La NaciÃ³n, the tour DVD was filmed during the performances at River Plate Stadium. Production director Chris Lamb stated that Madonna chose the Argentine audience because of the strong emotional bond they shared. However, at the time of Lamb's comments, no release date for the DVD had been announced, despite a trailer showing highlights of the Argentine performance on Madonna's official website.[59] On June 15, 2009, British newspaper The Sun reported that Sky1 had acquired the rights to broadcast the Sticky & Sweet Tour.[60] The \"Sweet Machine\" video was shortened, and the request song in Argentina, \"Like a Virgin\", was not aired. Latin American channel Cityvibe broadcast the show exclusively for Argentina, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela on September 19, 2009.[61] Unlike Sky1, the channel aired \"Madonna: Sticky & Sweet\" without any commercial block; additionally, both \"The Sweet Machine\" and the requested song were uncut. On October 30, 2009 the show was made available to watch on the Epix television channel, video-on-demand and the website, for those that have a subscription.[62]",
