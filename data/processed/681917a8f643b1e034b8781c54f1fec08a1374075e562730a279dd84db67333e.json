				"after": "Following Die Another Day, Madonna collaborated with fashion photographer Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from a photo shoot in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It then traveled the world in an edited form.[141] The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, American Life, which was based on her observations of American society, and received mixed reviews.[142] She commented, \"[American Life] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me.\"[143] Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that \"American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent\" while condemning it as \"a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously.\"[143][144] The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100.[39] Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq.[145] With only four million copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career.[146]",
