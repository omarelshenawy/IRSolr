				"previous": "In addition to The Chaser's major APEC security breach, the team performed stunts at the APEC Summit that received far less coverage in the media.",
				"after": "On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, mounted on a pantomime horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and asked them if they needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel.[15] He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid.[55] The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot.[56] This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.[15]",
