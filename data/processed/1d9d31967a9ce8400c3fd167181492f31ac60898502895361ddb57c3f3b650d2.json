				"previous": "Nicholas's successor AlexanderÂ II (1855â81) enacted significant changes in the country, including the emancipation reform of 1861. These Great Reforms spurred industrialization and modernized the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1877â78 Russo-Turkish War.",
				"after": "The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. AlexanderÂ II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son AlexanderÂ III (1881â94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, NicholasÂ II (1894â1917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian Revolution of 1905, triggered by the unsuccessful Russo-Japanese War and the demonstration incident known as Bloody Sunday. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms, including granting the freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the State Duma of the Russian Empire. The Stolypin agrarian reform led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into Siberia. More than four million settlers arrived in that region between 1906 and 1914.[68]",
