Henry apparently feared that Strongbow would set up an independent kingdom in Ireland, but Strongbow's actions were merely a catalyst for Henry's invasion.[5] Historian Peter Crooks writes that, \"No less than his predecessors, Henry II was happy to add Ireland to his empire\".[27] Henry, as William of Newburgh put it, wanted to have \"the glory of such a famous conquest\" and its proceeds for himself.[5]",
