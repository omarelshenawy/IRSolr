				"after": "The island of Ireland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51Â° and 56Â° N, and longitudes 11Â° and 5Â° W. It is separated from the neighbouring island of Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14Â mi)[103] at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a total area of 84,421Â km2 (32,595Â sqÂ mi)[1][104] Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term British Isles is controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term Britain and Ireland is often used as a neutral term for the islands.",
