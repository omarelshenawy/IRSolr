				"previous": "WiderÃ¸e was established on the foundations of two small airlines. The first was the company, Lotsberg & Skappel, which Helge Skappel owned along with Leiv Brun, Ditlef Smith and Erik EngnÃ¦s, operating a Gipsy Moth. The other was WiderÃ¸e & BjÃ¸rneby, which was founded by Viggo WiderÃ¸e and Halvor BjÃ¸rneby, and operated a Simmonds Spartan. Cooperation started between the two companies as well as Norsk Aero Klubb to establish air shows in Eastern Norway. During the winter, they stationed the planes at mountain resorts and made revenue from flying skiers into the wilderness. Advertisement flights were introduced, where a company or product name was painted on the hull, with a neon-light version underneath, and leaflets dropped from the planes.[2]",
				"after": "Viggo WiderÃ¸e travelled to the United States with NOKÂ 25,000 in 1933, and flew back a Waco Cabin. The same year, the company bought five used de Havilland DH.60 Moths from the Air Force and started aviation schools both in Oslo and Bergen. On 19 February 1934, WiderÃ¸e's Flyveselskap A/S was founded by Viggo WiderÃ¸e, Einar Isdahl and Arild WiderÃ¸e. For the winter months, skis were equipped on the Cabin and Spartan. The company also started ambulance flights. In April, the company expanded their share capital from NOKÂ 25,000 to NOKÂ 65,000. The money was used to buy a sea version of a Cabin, and on 15 June started flying the post route from Oslo via Kristiansand and Stavanger to Haugesund. During the summer, the company arranged a summer camp for youth, and the company bought a sail plane.[3]",
