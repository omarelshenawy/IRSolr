				"previous": "During the 1640s and 1650s, VelÃ¡zquez served as both court painter and curator of PhilipÂ IV's expanding collection of European art. He seems to have been given an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory of many of the Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, VelÃ¡zquez was widely respected in Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado todayâincluding works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubensâwere acquired and assembled under VelÃ¡zquez's curatorship.[11]",
