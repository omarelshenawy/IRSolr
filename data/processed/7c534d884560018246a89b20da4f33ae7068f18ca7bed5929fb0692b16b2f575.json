				"The F-135, a mixed-flow afterburning turbofan, was derived from the F-119 engine but was given a new fan and LP turbine.[28]",
				"There are 3 F-135 variants with the -400 being similar to the -100, the major difference being the use of salt-corrosion resistant materials.[29] The -600 is described below with an explanation of the engine configuration changes that take place for hovering. The engine and Rolls-Royce LiftSystem make up the Integrated Lift Fan Propulsion System(ILFPS).[30]"
