				"previous": "Ottoman classical music was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite, a number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as Selim III, whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of Byzantine music, Armenian music, Arabic music, and Persian music. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called usul, which are somewhat similar to meter in Western music, and melodic units called makam, which bear some resemblance to Western musical modes.",
				"after": "The instruments used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the saz, the baÄlama, the kemence), other Middle Eastern instruments (the ud, the tanbur, the kanun, the ney), andâlater in the traditionâWestern instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music, and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of folk music were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are: Balkan-Thracian TÃ¼rkÃ¼s, North-Eastern (Laz) TÃ¼rkÃ¼s, Aegean TÃ¼rkÃ¼s, Central Anatolian TÃ¼rkÃ¼s, Eastern Anatolian TÃ¼rkÃ¼s, and Caucasian TÃ¼rkÃ¼s. Some of the distinctive styles were: Janissary Music, Roma music, Belly dance, Turkish folk music.",
