If these gold open access growth curves are extrapolated to the next two decades, the Laakso et al. (BjÃ¶rk) curve would reach 60% in 2022, and the Springer curve would reach 50% in 2029 as shown in the figure below (the reference provides a more optimistic interpretation which does not match with the values shown in the figure).[169]",
