				"after": "Banksia aquilonia grows as a tall shrub or small tree up to 8Â m (26Â ft) high,[2] though plants up to 15Â m (49Â ft) have been recorded.[3] It has hard, fissured, grey bark, and narrow elliptic or lanceolate leaves measuring 5â20Â cm (2.0â7.9Â in) long by 0.6â1.2Â cm (0.2â0.5Â in) wide with entire (straight) margins and acute tips. They are a smooth shiny green above and white below with a prominent midrib covered in red-brown hair.[4] The brownish new growth appears in summer.[3] The plant is in bloom from March to June. Flowers occur in Banksia's characteristic vertical flower spike, an inflorescence made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. B.Â aquilonia's flower spike is a pale yellow colour, roughly cylindrical, 6â10Â cm (2.4â3.9Â in) high,[2] and up to 6Â cm (2.4Â in) in diameter. The tubular perianths of the individual flowers are 2.5â2.9Â cm (0.98â1.14Â in) long.[5] These open at maturity (anthesis) to release the styles. All old flower parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles develop on the bare woody spike. The follicles measure 0.8â1.2Â cm (0.3â0.5Â in) long, 0.5â0.9Â cm (0.20â0.35Â in) high, and 0.4â0.5Â cm (0.16â0.20Â in) wide. Furry at first, they become smooth with age and open when ripe,[2] and their two half-oval valves split to release the one or two seeds they contain.[4] The obovate dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwich a woody separator. Measuring 1.4â1.6Â cm (0.6â0.6Â in) long, they are made up of a wedge-shaped seed body, 0.8â1Â cm (0.3â0.4Â in) long by 0.2â0.3Â cm (0.08â0.1Â in) wide.[2] The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it.[4] Seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons around 1Â cm (0.39Â in) long.[5] Juvenile leaves are narrower, measuring 7â24Â cm (2.8â9.4Â in) long and 0.6â2.1Â cm (0.2â0.8Â in) wide, and often have serrate (toothed) margins.[4]",
