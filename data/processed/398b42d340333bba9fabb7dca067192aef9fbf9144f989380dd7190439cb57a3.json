				"after": "Large aircraft pose significant design issues not present in smaller types. These include structural efficiency, flight control response and sufficient power in a reliable and cost-effective installation. Making an aircraft design larger also has advantages, in that the overall fuel efficiency and manhours for transporting a given load improve, while a greater space is available for transporting lightweight cargoes and giving passengers more room to move.",
