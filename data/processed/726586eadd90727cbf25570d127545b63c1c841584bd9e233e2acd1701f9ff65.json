				"after": "What is known of the inhabitants of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce de LeÃ³n met with hostility from tribes that may have been the Ais and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce de LeÃ³n found at least one of the Calusa fluent in Spanish.[13] The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but anthropologists have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce de LeÃ³n was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida.[14] During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce de LeÃ³n was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them.[15] In the more than 200Â years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.",
