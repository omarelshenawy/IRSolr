				"after": "The blackcap's main breeding habitat is mature deciduous woodland, with good scrub cover below the trees. Other habitats, such as parks, large gardens and overgrown hedges, are used as long as they meet the essential requirements of tall trees for songposts and an established understory. Where other Sylvia warblers also breed, blackcaps tend to use taller trees than their relatives, preferably those with a good canopy, such as pedunculate oak. In prime habitat, breeding densities reach 100â200Â pairs per square kilometre (250â500Â pairs per square mile) in northern Europe, and 500â900Â pairs per square kilometre (1,250â2,250Â pairs per square mile) in Italy. Densities are much lower in poorer habitats such as conifer forests.[31] Breeding occurs in Europe at altitudes up to 2,200Â m (7,200Â ft).[12]",
