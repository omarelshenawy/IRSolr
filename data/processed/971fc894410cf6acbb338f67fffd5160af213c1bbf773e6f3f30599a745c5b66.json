				"previous": "Algebraic topology is another domain which prominently associates groups to the objects the theory is interested in. There, groups are used to describe certain invariants of topological spaces. They are called \"invariants\" because they are defined in such a way that they do not change if the space is subjected to some deformation. For example, the fundamental group \"counts\" how many paths in the space are essentially different. The PoincarÃ© conjecture, proved in 2002/2003 by Grigori Perelman, is a prominent application of this idea. The influence is not unidirectional, though. For example, algebraic topology makes use of EilenbergâMacLane spaces which are spaces with prescribed homotopy groups. Similarly algebraic K-theory relies in a way on classifying spaces of groups. Finally, the name of the torsion subgroup of an infinite group shows the legacy of topology in group theory.",
