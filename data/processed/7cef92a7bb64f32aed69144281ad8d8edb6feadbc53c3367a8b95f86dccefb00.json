				"previous": "Many other endemic species on RÃ©union became extinct after the arrival of humans and the resulting disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived with other now-extinct birds, such as the RÃ©union ibis, the Mascarene parrot, the RÃ©union parakeet, the RÃ©union swamphen, the RÃ©union owl, the RÃ©union night heron, and the RÃ©union pink pigeon. Extinct RÃ©union reptiles include the RÃ©union giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on RÃ©union and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands.[22]",
				"after": "The hoopoe starling was described as tame and easily hunted. In 1704, Feuilley explained how the birds were caught by humans and cats:",
