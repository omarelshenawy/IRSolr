				"previous": "The general strike action only became a feature of the political landscape with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For the first time in history, large numbers of people were members of the industrial working class; they lived in cities and exchanged their labour for payment. By the 1830s, when the Chartist movement was at its peak, a true and widespread 'workers consciousness' was beginning to awaken in England.",
				"after": "The first theorist to formulate and popularise the idea of a general strike for the purpose of political reform was the radical pamphleteer William Benbow.[3] Closely involved with planning the attempted Blanketeers protest march by Lancashire weavers in March 1817,[4] he became an associate of William Cobbett and passed his time \"agitating the labouring classes at their trades meetings and club-houses.\"[4]",
