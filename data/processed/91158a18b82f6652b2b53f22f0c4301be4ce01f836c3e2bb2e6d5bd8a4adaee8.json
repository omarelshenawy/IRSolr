				"after": "The Tasmanian devil is the largest surviving carnivorous marsupial. It has a squat, thick build, with a large head and a tail which is about half its body length. Unusually for a marsupial, its forelegs are slightly longer than its hind legs, and devils can run up to 13Â km/h (8.1Â mph) for short distances. The fur is usually black, often with irregular white patches on the chest and rump (although approximately 16% of wild devils do not have white patches).[37][38] These markings suggest that the devil is most active at dawn and dusk, and they are thought to draw biting attacks toward less important areas of the body, as fighting between devils often leads to a concentration of scars in that region.[38] Males are usually larger than females, having an average head and body length of 652Â mm (25.7Â in), a 258Â mm (10.2Â in) tail and an average weight of 8Â kg (18Â lb). Females have an average head and body length of 570Â mm (22Â in), a 244Â mm (9.6Â in) tail and an average weight of 6Â kg (13Â lb),[37] although devils in western Tasmania tend to be smaller.[39] Devils have five long toes on their forefeet, four pointing to the front and one coming out from the side, which gives the devil the ability to hold food. The hind feet have four toes, and the devils have non-retractable claws.[35] The stocky devils have a relatively low centre of mass.[40]",
