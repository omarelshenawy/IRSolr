				"after": "The Museum of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature pieceâLucy in the Field with Flowersâprotruding from between two trash cans on a Roslindale-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited Lucy in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found.[8] When Wilson acquired another \"equally lovely\" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled \"The Opening of the Museum of Bad Art\".[9]",
