				"previous": "Mangalore is located at 12Â°52â²N 74Â°53â²Eï»¿ / ï»¿12.87Â°N 74.88Â°Eï»¿ / 12.87; 74.88 in the Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka.[50] It has an average elevation of 22 metres (72Â ft) above mean sea level.[51] It is the administrative headquarters of the Dakshina Kannada district, the largest urban coastal center of Karnataka, and the second largest city in the state.[52] Mangalore is situated on the west coast of India, and is bounded by the Arabian Sea to its west and the Western Ghats to its east. Mangalore city, as a municipal entity, spans an area of 200Â km2 (77.22Â sqÂ mi).[53] Mangalore experiences moderate to gusty winds during day time and gentle winds at night.[54] The topography of the city is plain up to 30Â km (18.64Â mi) inside the coast and changes to undulating hilly terrain sharply towards the east in Western Ghats.[55] There are four hilly regions with natural valleys within the city. The geology of the city is characterised by hard laterite in hilly tracts and sandy soil along the seashore.[52] The Geological Survey of India has identified Mangalore as a moderately earthquake-prone urban centre and categorised the city in the Seismic III Zone.[56]",
				"after": "Mangalore lies on the backwaters of the Netravati and Gurupura rivers.[57] These rivers effectively encircle the city, with the Gurupura flowing around the north and the Netravti flowing around the south of the city. The rivers form an estuary at the south-western region of the city and subsequently flow into the Arabian sea.[58] The city is often used as a staging point for traffic along the Malabar Coast. The coastline of the city is dotted with several beaches, such as Mukka, Panambur, Tannirbavi, Suratkal, and Someshwara. Coconut trees, palm trees, and Ashoka trees comprise the primary vegetation of the city.",
