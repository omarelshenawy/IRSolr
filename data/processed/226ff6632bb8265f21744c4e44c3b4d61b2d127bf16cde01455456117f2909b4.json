It is a common dinosaur in American museums, due in particular to the excavations at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry; by 1976, as a result of cooperative operations, 38Â museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts.[4] Allosaurus is the official state fossil of Utah.[107]",
