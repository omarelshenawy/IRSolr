				"previous": "The flight control surfaces were controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the wing flaps and ailerons on one side and lowering them on the other provided roll. The V-tail fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical. Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these V-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high angle of attack (AoA) performance compared to legacy aircraft.[23] Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking.[24] To keep costs low despite the novel design, a number of \"commercial off-the-shelf\" components were used, including an F-15 nose wheel, F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit components of the F-15E Strike Eagle.[11][16]",
				"after": "The first YF-23, with Pratt & Whitney engines, supercruised at MachÂ 1.43 on 18 September 1990, while the second, with General Electric engines, reached MachÂ 1.6 on 29 November 1990. By comparison, the YF-22 achieved Mach 1.58 in supercruise.[25] The YF-23 was tested to a top speed of Mach 1.8 with afterburners and achieved a maximum angle-of-attack of 25Â°.[26] The maximum speed is classified, though sources state a maximum speed greater than Mach 2 at altitude and a supercruise speed greater than Mach 1.6.[27] The aircraft's weapons bay was configured for weapons launch, and used for testing weapons bay acoustics, but no missiles were fired; Lockheed fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles successfully from its YF-22 demonstration aircraft. PAV-1 performed a fast-paced combat demonstration with six flights over a 10-hour period on 30 November 1990. Flight testing continued into December.[28] The two YF-23s flew 50 times for a total of 65.2 hours.[29] The tests demonstrated Northrop's predicted performance values for the YF-23.[30] The YF-23 was stealthier and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile.[31][32]",
