				"previous": "For thousands of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed they could hear the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thÂ century despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.[66]",
				"after": "By the 1880s, Robert Deniston Hume of Astoria, had bought land on both sides of the lower Rogue River and established such a big fishing business that he became known as the Salmon King of Oregon.[66][n 2] His fleet of gillnetting boats, controlling most of the anadromous fish population of the river, plied its lower 12 miles (19Â km).[66] During his 32-year tenure, Hume's company caught, processed, and shipped hundreds of tons of salmon from the Rogue.[66] Upriver commercial fishermen also captured large quantities of fish. On a single day in 1913, Grants Pass crews using five drift boats equipped with gill nets caught 5,000 pounds (2,300Â kg) of salmon.[66]",
