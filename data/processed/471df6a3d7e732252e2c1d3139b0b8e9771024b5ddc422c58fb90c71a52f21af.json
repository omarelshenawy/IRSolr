				"after": "A notable multimedia software produced by Delrina was Echo Lake, an early form of scrapbook software that came out in June 1995.[101] During development it was touted internally as a \"cross [of] Quark Xpress and Myst\".[102] It featured an immersive 3D environment where a user could manipulate objects within a virtual desktop in a virtual office and assemble video and audio clips along with images, and then send them as either a virtual book other users of the program could then access, or its content could be printed.[103] It was an innovative product for its time,[104][105] and ultimately was hampered by the inability of many users to easily input or playback their own multimedia content into a computer from that period.[106]",
