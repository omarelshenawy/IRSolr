				"previous": "In late 1878, Edwards joined a theater company in Boston, replacing another actor as \"Schelm, Chief of Police\" at a revival of the spectacle The Exiles at the Boston Theatre on Washington Street.[25] After a four-week run, he performed in other productions at the theater through the 1879â1880 season.[26] In June, Edwards answered the 1880 census to report himself an England-born actor living with his English wife \"Marian\" and his Chinese servant, Gim Hing.[27]",
				"after": "From Boston, Edwards moved to New York to stay for some ten years, performing on stage and participating in insect studies. He was active in the Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae.[4] Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia.[28] Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.",
