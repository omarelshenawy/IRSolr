				"after": "To compete with the popular NES/Famicom, NEC launched the TurboGrafx-16 in 1987, and Sega followed suit with the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 1988. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.[9] Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.[10]",
