				"previous": "In the summer of 2012, three engines suffered Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) failures; one was caused by an assembly problem, which led to inspections of all other engines then in service.[4] During the spring and summer of 2013, GE learned of four 747-8F freighters that suffered icing in their engines at altitudes of 40,000 feet and above. The most serious incident involved an AirBridge Cargo freighter. On July 31, while at an altitude of 41,000 feet over China, the flight crew noted two engines surging while a third lost substantial power. The pilots were able to land the plane safely, but the engines were found to have sustained damage. Among the possible factors GE cited in an interview with the Wall Street Journal was \"'unique convective weather systems' such as unusually large thunderstorms reaching high altitudes.\"[5] Boeing told the newspaper that it is working with GE on software solutions to the problem.[5]",
