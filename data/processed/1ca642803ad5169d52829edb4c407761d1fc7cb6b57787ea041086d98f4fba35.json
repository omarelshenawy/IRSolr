				"previous": "Historians have expressed high regard for PedroÂ II and his reign. The scholarly literature dealing with him is vast and, with the exception of the period immediately after his ouster, overwhelmingly positive, and even laudatory.[308] He has been regarded by several historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian.[309][310] In a manner similar to methods which were used by republicans, historians point to the Emperor's virtues as an example to be followed, although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy. Historian Richard Graham noted that \"[m]ost twentieth-century historians, moreover, have looked back on the period [of PedroÂ II's reign] nostalgically, using their descriptions of the Empire to criticizeâsometimes subtly, sometimes notâBrazil's subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes.\"[311]",
