				"previous": "The Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Indus valley from Sindh to Multan in southern Punjab in 711 CE.[41][42][43][44] The Pakistan government's official chronology identifies this as the point where the \"foundation\" of Pakistan was laid.[41][45][46] This conquest set the stage for the rule of several successive Muslim empires in the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975â1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom and the Delhi Sultanate (1206â1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526â1857 CE). The Mughals introduced Persian literature and high culture, establishing the roots of Indo-Persian culture in the region.[47] In the early 16th century, the region remained under the Mughal Empire ruled by Muslim emperors.[48] By the early 18th century, the increasing European influence caused to slowly disintegrate the empire with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred.[48]",
				"after": "During this time, the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[48] Control over the seas, greater resources, technology, and military force projection by East India Company of British Empire led it to increasingly flex its military muscle; a factor that was crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over subcontinent by 1765 and sidelining the European competitors.[49] Expanding access beyond Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of region by the 1820s.[48] To many historians, this marked the starting of region's colonial period.[48] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration, the Company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.[48] Such reforms included the enforcement of English Education Act in 1835 and the introduction of the Indian Civil Service (ICS).[50] Tradition Madrasahsâ a primary institutions of higher learning for Muslims in subcontinentâ were no longer supported by the English Crown, and nearly all of the Madrasahs lost their financial endowment.[51]",
