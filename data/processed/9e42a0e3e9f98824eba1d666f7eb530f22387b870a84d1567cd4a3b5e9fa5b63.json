				"previous": "In wave dominated deltas, wave erosion controls the shape of the delta, and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line.[4]",
				"after": "Erosion is also an important control in tide dominated deltas, such as the Ganges Delta, which may be mainly submarine, with prominent sand bars and ridges. This tends to produce a \"dendritic\" structure.[5] Tidal deltas behave differently from river- and wave-dominated deltas, which tend to have a few main distributaries. Once a wave- or river- distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there's a lot of water around â such as floods or storm surges. These distributaries slowly silt up at a pretty constant rate until they fizzle out.[5]",
