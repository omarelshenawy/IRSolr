				"previous": "The organization of the treasury and chancery were developed under the Ottoman Empire more than any other Islamic government and, until the 17th century, they were the leading organization among all their contemporaries.[113] This organization developed a scribal bureaucracy (known as \"men of the pen\") as a distinct group, partly highly trained ulama, which developed into a professional body.[113] The effectiveness of this professional financial body stands behind the success of many great Ottoman statesmen.[132]",
