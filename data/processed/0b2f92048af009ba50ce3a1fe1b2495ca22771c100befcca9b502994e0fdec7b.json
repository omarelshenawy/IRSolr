				"previous": "Compared with a year earlier, April 2015 passenger numbers increased by 0.6Â percent to 3.18Â million (an increase of 18,000 over April 2014). All passenger traffic categories other than UK[nb 17] and European charter[nb 16] traffic recorded increases. The following changes were recorded amongst individual passenger traffic categories: North Atlantic traffic +8.2Â percent (151,900 passengers); Irish traffic +4.9Â percent (111,800 passengers); other long-haul[nb 15] traffic +1.4Â percent (292,300 passengers); European scheduled traffic +1.2Â percent (2.047Â million passengers); UK[nb 17] traffic -5.2 Â percent (301,100 passengers); European charter[nb 16] traffic -3.4Â percent (276,800 passengers). Air transport movements decreased by 0.3Â percent to 21,845. Cargo volume decreased by 11.2Â percent to 6,727 metric tonnes. The increase in North Atlantic passenger traffic resulted from the introduction of new transatlantic no-frills flights to New York, Los Angeles, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale by Norwegian Air Shuttle. The increase in passenger traffic to and from other long-haul[nb 15] destinations mainly resulted from a continuing increase in passengers travelling to and from Dubai, as a result of the introduction of the A380 by Emirates on two of its three daily flights. The increase in scheduled passenger traffic to and from destinations in Europe was driven by additional passengers on popular business and leisure routes, led by Barcelona.[106]",
				"after": "Gatwick has set goals of 40-Â percent public-transport use by the time annual passenger traffic reaches 40Â million (estimated in 2015) and 45Â percent by the time it reaches 45Â million.[107]",
