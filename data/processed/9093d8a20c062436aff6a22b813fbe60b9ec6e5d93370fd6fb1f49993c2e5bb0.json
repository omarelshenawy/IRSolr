				"after": "After the success of Star Wars, Hamill found that audiences identified him very closely with the role of Luke Skywalker. He attempted to avoid typecasting by appearing in Corvette Summer (1978) and the better-known World War II film The Big Red One (1980). He also made a guest appearance on The Muppet Show as both himself and Luke Skywalker. C-3PO and R2-D2 were along with him on a search for Chewbacca in that episode. As the 1980s wore on, Hamill did little film work outside of Star Wars. Instead, he acted on Broadway, starring in The Elephant Man, Harrigan 'N Hart (for which he received a Drama Desk Award nomination), The Nerd, and other stage plays, for which he received positive reviews, including the stage play of Amadeus, in which he played the title role and he himself was particularly praised for his performance as Mozart. When word of the play was going to be a film, Hamill auditioned to reprise the role for the big screen, but lost to Tom Hulce. It's said that a studio executive told the people making the film, \"I don't want Luke Skywalker in this film\".",
