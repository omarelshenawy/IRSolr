				"previous": "In 1838, FÃ©lix Ãdouard GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville pointed out that the double drummer is native to Australia and not China.[6] John Obadiah Westwood designated it the type species of the genus in 1843,[7][8] and it is also the type species for the tribe Thophini.[9] The common name is derived from the male cicada's sac-like tymbal covers (\"drums\") on either side of its abdomen.[10]",
				"after": "The adult double drummer is the largest Australian species of cicada, the male and female averaging 4.75Â cm (1.88Â in) and 5.12Â cm (2.02Â in) long respectively. The thorax is 2Â cm (0.8Â in) in diameter,[11] its sides distended when compared with the thorax of other Australian cicadas.[12] The forewings are 5â6.6Â cm (2.2â2.4Â in) long. The largest collected specimen has a wingspan of 15.1Â cm (5.9Â in),[2] while the average is 13.3Â cm (5.2Â in).[13] The average mass is 4.0Â g (0.14Â oz).[13] The sexes have similar markings, but males have large dark red-brown sac-like structures on each side of their abdomens.[11][14] These cover the tymbalsâspecialised structures composed of vertical ribs and a tymbal plate, which is buckled to produce the cicada's song.[15] The head is much broader than that of other cicadas, and is broader than the pronotum behind it. The head, antennae and postclypeus are black,[14] with a narrow broken pale brown transverse band across the vertex just behind the ocelli.[11] The eyes are black in young adult cicadas upon emerging, but turn brown with black pseudopupils at the posterior edge of the eye.[14] The ocelli are deep red.[11] The proboscis is 1.26Â cm (0.50Â in) in lengthâvery long compared with other Australian cicada species.[13] The thorax is brown, becoming paler in older individuals.[14] The pronotum is rusty brown with black anterior borders, while the mesonotum is a little paler with prominent black markings,[11] with paired cone-shaped spots with bases towards the front on either side of a median stripe;[10] lateral to these spots are a pair of markings resembling a \"7\" on the right hand side of the mesonotum and its reverse on the left.[11] The abdomen is black between the tymbal covers and red-brown and black more posteriorly. The underparts of the double drummer are red-brown and black,[14] and covered in fine silvery velvety hairs.[11] The female's ovipositor is very long, measuring 1.76Â cm (0.69Â in).[13] The wings are vitreous (transparent) with light brown veins.[11] They have an array of cuticular nanostructuresâconical protuberances with a spacing and height of about 200Â nm, tipped with a spherical cap with a radius of curvature of around 25â45Â nmâon the transparent panes of their wings.[16] These act as anti-wetting and anti-reflective surfaces.[16] The legs are dark brown and have grey velvety hairs.[11]",
