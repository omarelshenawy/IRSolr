				"after": "The Moreno family was poor, but could afford a house and some slaves. Ana MarÃ­a Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, was one of the few literate women in Buenos Aires.[138] Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of fourteen children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend TomÃ¡s Guido once the family raised the money.[139] The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later.[140] Moreno met MarÃ­a Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and MarÃ­a were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same, and married MarÃ­a in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.[141]",
