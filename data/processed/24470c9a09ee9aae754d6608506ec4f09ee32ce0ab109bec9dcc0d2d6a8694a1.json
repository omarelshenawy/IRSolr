They are also used as show hunters, steeplechasers, and in western riding speed events such as barrel racing. Mounted police divisions employ them in non-competitive work, and recreational riders also use them.[111] Thoroughbreds are one of the most common breeds for use in polo in the United States.[112] They are often seen in the fox hunting field as well.[113]",
