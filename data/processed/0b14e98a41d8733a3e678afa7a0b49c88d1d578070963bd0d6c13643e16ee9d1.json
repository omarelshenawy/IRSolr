				"previous": "If the latitudes of the end points cannot be determined with confidence then they can be found instead by calculation on the ruler distance. Calling the ruler distances of the end points on the map meridian as measured from the equator y1 and y2, the true distance between these points on the sphere is given by using any one of the inverse Mercator formulÃ¦:",

For example, on a map with R=1 the values of y=0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to latitudes of Ï=0Â°, 50Â°, 75Â°, 84Â° and therefore the successive intervals of 1Â cm on the map correspond to latitude intervals on the globe of 50Â°, 25Â°, 9Â° and distances of 5,560Â km, 2,780Â km, and 1,000Â km on the Earth.",
