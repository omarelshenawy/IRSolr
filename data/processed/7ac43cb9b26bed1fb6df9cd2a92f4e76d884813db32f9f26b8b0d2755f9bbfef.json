				"after": "St George's Church is a 14th-century stone building with slate roof.[95] The roof was thatched until 1863, when the church was heavily restored.[96] In 1886, it was struck by lightning and required extensive rebuilding.[97] Today, the church consists of a chancel, nave, north porch, and south vestry. The octagonal bowl font still has an original lead lining.[98] St. George's Church, a Grade II* listed building,[96] is part of the Ely Team Ministry.[99] The Baptist chapel was erected in 1867 on the site of its 1839 predecessor.[100]",
