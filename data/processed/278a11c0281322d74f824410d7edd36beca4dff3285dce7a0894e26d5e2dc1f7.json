A balance between cell division and cell death keeps the number of cells relatively constant in adults.[12] There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosisâor programmed cell deathâis a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes play a crucial role in this process.[43]",
