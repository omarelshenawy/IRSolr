				"after": "The Fame Ball Tour was a 2009 worldwide concert tour by American recording artist Lady Gaga. It was Gaga's first concert tour which helped promote her debut studio album The Fame. North American shows began in March, followed by dates in Oceania and a solo trek through Europe. Dates in Asia soon followed, as well as two performances at England's V Festival and two shows in North America that had been postponed from April. Gaga described the tour as a traveling museum show incorporating artist Andy Warhol's pop-performance art concept. Tickets were distributed for charity also. Alternate versions of the show with minimal variations were planned by Gaga to accommodate different venues.",
