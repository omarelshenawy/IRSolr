				"previous": "Cast iron was first produced in China during 5th century BCE,[53] but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period.[54][55] The earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern Luhe County, Jiangsu in China. Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare, agriculture, and architecture.[56] During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required as fuel.",
				"after": "Medieval blast furnaces were about 10 feet (3.0Â m) tall and made of fireproof brick; forced air was usually provided by hand-operated bellows.[55] Modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger.",
