On 20 October, the Red Army and the Partisans liberated Belgrade in a joint operation known as the Belgrade Offensive. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia â Serbia, Vardar Macedonia and Montenegro, as well as the Dalmatian coast.[citation needed]",
