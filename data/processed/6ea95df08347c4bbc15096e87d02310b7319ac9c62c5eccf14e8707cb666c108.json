				"previous": "Buoyed with their success at Tsushima, Japan laid down the four Tsukuba-class cruisers between 1905 and 1908. At a speed of 20.5 knots, they carried an extremely heavy main armament of four 12-inch (305Â mm) guns, 8 inches (203Â mm) of belt and turret armor and 3 inches (76Â mm) of deck armor. The Tsukubas were intended to take the place of aging battleships and thus showed Japan's intention of continuing to use armored cruisers in fleet engagements. The U.S. Navy raised the main gun caliber of its cruisers with its TennesseeÂ class, laid down between 1902 and 1904. These mounted four 10-inch (254Â mm) and 16 6-inch (152Â mm) guns, the former a size previously allocated to battleships. While they had thinner armor than the Pennsylvanias (5 inches (127Â mm) on their belts and 1 inch (25Â mm) on their decks) due to newly imposed congressional restraints on tonnage, they could still steam at 22 knots. They were built as a fast, powerful response in the eventuality of a Pacific war and were the largest and last American armored cruisers built.[34]",
				"after": "The British also considered 10-inch (254Â mm) and 12-inch (305Â mm) guns for its MinotaurÂ class cruisers, the culmination of its armored cruiser building program. They displaced 14,600 tons, were capable of 23 knots and were armed with four 9.2-inch (234Â mm) and 10 7.5-inch (191Â mm) guns. By the time these ships were commissioned, Britain possessed the largest armored cruiser force in the world. Undaunted and fully engaged in a naval arms race with the British, the Germans also continued to build armored cruisers, partly from their faith in them as fighting units and commerce raiders, partly from Japan's success. Between 1897 and 1906 they laid down eight of them for use on overseas stations. The initial two, SMSÂ FÃ¼rst Bismarck and SMSÂ Prinz Heinrich, were armed with 9.44-inch (240Â mm) guns; the six that followed had 8.2-inch (208Â mm) guns of a more modern design. The final pair, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, displaced 12,781 tons, steamed at 23.5 knots, carried 6 inches (152Â mm) of belt and 2 inches (51Â mm) of deck armor and were armed with eight 8.2-inch (208Â mm) guns.[35]",
