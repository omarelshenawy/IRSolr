				"after": "The painting was purchased in 2006 by the National Portrait Gallery, London, with funds raised through their 150th anniversary gala,[15] after more than nine months' consideration. The cost was rumoured to be more than Â£100,000,[13] though Zarin gives a price of Â£95,000.[22] The acquisition was criticised by Starkey, who said, \"if the National Portrait Gallery has public money to burn, then so be it ... [the decision] depends on mere hearsay and tradition, and it is not good enough\".[13] Foley countered, \"The evidence has been supported by people who know far more about the science of painting than David Starkey. I don't know what his problem isÂ â is it because he didn't find it?\"[13]",
