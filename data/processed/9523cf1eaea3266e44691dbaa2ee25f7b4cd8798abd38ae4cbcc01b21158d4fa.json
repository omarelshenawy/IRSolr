				"previous": "By MarchÂ 1980Â (1980-03), the carrier had a fleet of three Boeing 707-320Cs, three Boeing 737-200Cs, six Fokker F27s âfour -600s and two -200sâ, three L-100s âtwo -20s and one -30â and four Yakovlev Yak-40s to serve a number of domestic destinations, plus Brazzaville, SÃ£o Tome, Lagos, Maputo, Lisbon, Moscow, Paris and Rome.[24] The company was reorganised again during the year. On 8 June, a Yak-40 registration D2-TYC crashed near Matala killing all 19 occupants on board. On 16 May 1981, the crew of four on board a Lockheed L-100-20 Hercules, registration D2-EAS, lost their lives in an accident at Mongua. During the early 1980s the fleet also included a small number of Antonov An-26s that started being phased out. One of these examples (D2-TAB) was involved in an accident at Monte Bibala on 29 November 1982; 15 people lost their lives. Another fatal accident took place almost a year later, on 8 November 1983, when the crash of a Boeing 737-200 (D2-TBN) at Lubango resulted in 130 fatalities. Serious financial difficulties were uncovered during 1984. In the mid-1980s, an L-100 Hercules was withdrawn from service and two Ilyushin Il-62Ms were acquired for operations to Cuba.[15] The carrier phased in the first of these two aircraft in 1988.[25] On 21 July 1988, a Boeing 707 freighter owned by the airline crashed 20 kilometres (12Â mi) away from Murtala Muhammed International Airport; six crewmembers lost their lives in the accident.[26]",
				"after": "At MarchÂ 1990Â (1990-03), TAAG Angola Airlines had TAAG-Air Charter and TAAG Aviacao Ligeira as associated companies; the number of employees was 5,770. At this time, the fleet consisted of six Boeing 707-320s (one -320B and five -320Cs), four Boeing 737-200s, one Boeing 737-200C, one Lockheed L100-200, six Fokker F.27s (one -100, one -400M, one -500 and three -600s) and two Yakovlev Yak-40s. The carrierâââ'ââs network comprised 18 domestic points in Angola served from Luanda plus international flights to Berlin-Schonefeld, Brazaville, Havana, Kinshasa, Lisbon, Lusaka, Maputo, Moscow, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Sal and Sao Tome.[27] TAAG bought a Boeing 747-300 Combi from Singapore Airlines in 1997.[28]",
