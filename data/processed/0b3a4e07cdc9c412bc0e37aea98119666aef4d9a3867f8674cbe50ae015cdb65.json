				"previous": "The route network was expanded along the coast during the early 1950s. In 1951, Casablanca, Ghudamis and Tripoli were incorporated as destinations. In May that year, a TunisâTripoliâSabhah service was launched; it was routed via Sfax and Djerba in September. The Ghudamis route was terminated in 1952, and the Casablanca run was taken over by Air France the same year. In 1953, the service to Marseilles was extended to Paris. In 1954, a Douglas DC-4 was leased from Air France and used on the route to Paris.[7] At MarchÂ 1955Â (1955-03), the fleet comprised three Douglas DC-3s, one Douglas DC-4 and a SNCASE Languedoc.[8] During 1955, the carrier transported 92,344 passengers. At year end, the number of employees was 140. The airline had a revenue of Â£620,000 for 1955, and costs totalled to Â£550,000.[9] In 1957 the Tunisian government became the largest shareholder (51%) and the stake held by Air France was reduced to 15%.[7]",
				"after": "The carrier took delivery of its first jet-powered aircraft, a Sud Caravelle III, on 31 August 1961. A new service to Frankfurt was inaugurated in October but it was terminated in March the following year due to poor economical performance. A second Caravelle was ordered in 1963 and entered service in MarchÂ 1964Â (1964-03). In cooperation with Lufthansa, flights to Frankfurt were restarted in AprilÂ 1966Â (1966-04) using Caravelle equipment.[7] The Nord 262 was first put into service in 1969.[10] The entrance of this aircraft into the fleet along with the airline already having two Caravelles in operation allowed the carrier to phase out a DC-3 and two DC-4s.[11]",
