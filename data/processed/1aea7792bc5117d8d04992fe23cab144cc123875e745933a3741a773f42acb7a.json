				"after": "Upon its founding in 1987, Canadian revealed its new livery using the colours light grey, dark grey, navy blue, and red. The lower half of the aircraft's body was navy blue, topped with light grey and red borders while the tail was two-thirds blue, with the remaining third taken up by the carrier's logo. This was a light grey colour. Over the light grey were five dark grey lines, representing the five continents served by the carrier. Over these lines was a thick, bright red chevron. This character was a clever alternative to a true bilingual name on the fuselage (Canadian/Canadien).",
