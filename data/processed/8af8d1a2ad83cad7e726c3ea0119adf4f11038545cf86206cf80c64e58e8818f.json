				"previous": "The phrase \"A short, sharp shock\", heard in the Act 1 song \"I am so proud\" has entered the English language, appearing in titles of books and songs (most notably in samples of Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"), as well as political manifestos. Likewise \"Let the punishment fit the crime\" is an often-used phrase from the Mikado's Act II song and is particularly mentioned in the course of British political debates, though the concept, and similar phrases, long predate Gilbert.[126][127] For instance, in episode 80 of the television series Magnum, P.I., entitled \"Let the Punishment Fit the Crime,\" Higgins prepares to direct a selection of pieces from The Mikado to be staged at the Estate. The show features bits of several Mikado songs including \"Three Little Maids From School.\"[128] The phrase and the Mikado's song also are featured in the Dad's Army episode, \"A Soldier's Farewell.\" In The Parent Trap (1961), the camp director quotes the phrase before sentencing the twins to the isolation cabin together.",
				"after": "The name of the character Pooh-Bah has entered the English language as pooh-bah, a person who holds many titles, often a pompous or self-important person.[129] Pooh-Bah is mentioned in P. G. Wodehouse's novel Something Fresh, again in reference to his many titles.[n 11] In December 2009, BBC presenter James Naughtie, on Radio 4's Today programme, compared UK cabinet member Peter Mandelson to Pooh-Bah, because Mandelson held many offices of state, including Secretary of State for Business, First Secretary of State, Lord President of the Council, President of the Board of Trade, and Church Commissioner, and he sat on 35 cabinet committees and sub-committees. Mandelson replied, \"Who is Pooh-Bah?\" Mandelson was also described as \"the grand Pooh-Bah of British politics\" earlier the same week by the theatre critic, Charles Spencer, of The Daily Telegraph.[130] In the U.S., particularly, the term has come to describe, mockingly, people who hold impressive titles but whose authority is limited.[131] The term \"Grand Poobah\" has been used on the television shows, including The Flintstones and Happy Days, and other media, as the title of a high-ranking official in a men's club, spoofing clubs like the Freemasons, the Shriners, and the Elks Club.[132]",
