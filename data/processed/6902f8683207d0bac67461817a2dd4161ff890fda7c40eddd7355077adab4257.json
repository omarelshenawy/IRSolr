				"after": "Burges spent his first night at the house on 5 March 1878.[2] It provided a suitable backdrop for entertaining his range of friends, \"the whole gamut of Pre-Raphaelite London.\"[14] His dogs, Dandie, Bogie and Pinkie, are immortalised in paintings on various pieces of furniture such as the Dog Cabinet and the foot of The Red Bed.[15] Burges displayed his extensive collection of armour in the armoury.[16] The decoration of his bedroom hints at another of his passions: a fondness for opium. Stylised poppies cover the panels of a cupboard which was set next to his bed.[2]",
