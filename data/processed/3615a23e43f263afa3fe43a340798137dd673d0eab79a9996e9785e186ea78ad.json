This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11Â million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward.[b] Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.",
