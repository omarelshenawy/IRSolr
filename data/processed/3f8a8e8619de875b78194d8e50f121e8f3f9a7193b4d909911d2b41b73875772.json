				"previous": "The polynomial is an elementary symmetric polynomial and is thus equal to in case of Equation (1) and to zero in case of Equation (2), so we only need to seek values for the other two.",
				"after": "Thus, , and are left invariant by the cyclic permutations of the roots, which multiply them by . Also and are left invariant by the transposition of and which exchanges and . As the permutation group of the roots is generated by these permutations, it follows that and are symmetric functions of the roots and may thus be written as polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials and thus as rational functions of the coefficients of the equation. Let and in these expressions, which will be explicitly computed below.",
