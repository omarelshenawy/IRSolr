				"previous": "During the period of Communist rule, much housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the blokovi (blocks) of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall.[162] However, in the mid-1950s, the modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.[162]",
				"after": "Belgrade has the second oldest sewer system in Europe.[164]",
