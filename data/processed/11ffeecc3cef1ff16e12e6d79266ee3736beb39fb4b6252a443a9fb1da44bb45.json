				"previous": "Although the Bristol Model 302 was built first as part of the original BOAC order, BOAC released this series to other airlines; Aeronaves de Mexico took two Model 302s which entered service in December 1957.[41] The 18 Bristol Britannia 312s for BOAC were delivered from September 1957 with its service introduction on the first-ever non-stop flight from London to Canada on 19 December 1957.[38] In late December 1957 BOAC began regular Britannia flights from London to New York.[44] Other airlines, such as Israel's El Al, used the Britannia on transatlantic routes.[45] In 1959 BOAC started flying the Britannia across the Pacific to Tokyo and Hong Kong, thus extending their network round the world.[38] The westbound routing in 1959 for these intercontinental BOAC Britannia flights between the U.K. and Asia was London-New York-San Francisco-Honolulu-Wake Island-Tokyo-Hong Kong.[46]",
				"after": "On 1 April 1958 Canadian Pacific Air Lines took delivery of the first of six Model 314 Britannias,[29] with an additional two Model 324s (built to a 320 standard) arriving later and sold to Cathay Pacific in 1961.[47] BOAC ordered seven Model 302s but never took delivery, instead they were taken on by airlines including Aeronaves de MÃ©xico and Ghana Airways.[42][48] The main long-range series were the 310s, of which BOAC took 18 and, after deliveries began in September 1957, put them into service between London and New York; in March 1964 BOAC owned 50 aircraft, 10 being Britannia 312s.[49] BOAC's last scheduled Britannia flight was April 1965.[50]",
