				"after": "The outer marker is normally located 7.2 kilometres (3.9Â nmi; 4.5Â mi) from the threshold, except that where this distance is not practical, the outer marker may be located between 6.5 and 11.1 kilometres (3.5 and 6.0Â nmi; 4.0 and 6.9Â mi) from the threshold. The modulation is repeated Morse-style dashes of a 400Â Hz tone (--) (\"M\"). The cockpit indicator is a blue lamp that flashes in unison with the received audio code. The purpose of this beacon is to provide height, distance, and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on intermediate and final approach. In the United States, a NDB is often combined with the outer marker beacon in the ILS approach (called a Locator Outer Marker, or LOM). In Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced marker beacons entirely.",
