				"after": "Gnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from Usenet. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, \"I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy.\"[16] For example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for Adult, Arts, Business, Computers, Games, Health, Home, News, Recreation, Reference, Regional, Science, Shopping, Society, Sports and \"World\". While these sixteen top-level categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.",
