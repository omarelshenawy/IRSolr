				"previous": "In the 14th century the southern territories of ancient Rus', including principalities of GaliciaâVolhynia, Kiev and others, became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania which, in the 16th century, united with Catholic Poland to form the PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth. Due to their usage of the Latin script rather than the Cyrillic script, they were usually denoted by the Latin Ruthenia. Other spellings were also used in Latin, English and other languages during this period.",
