The variety of machinery is even wider and ranges from vehicles that are derived from production road cars â such as touring cars and GT cars â to high-tech purpose-built formula cars and GP motorcycles. See the section on Racing disciplines below. Competition is not confined to conventional first-past-the-flag races, but can include speed contests (such as drag racing), time trials (such as rallying) and skill tests (such as motorcycle trials).",
