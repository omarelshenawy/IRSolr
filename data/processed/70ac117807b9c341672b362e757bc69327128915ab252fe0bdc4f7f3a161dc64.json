After two seconds it will have fallen 1/2 Ã 9.8 Ã 22 = 19.6 meters; and so on. The second to last equation becomes grossly inaccurate at great distances. If an object fell 10,000 meters to Earth, then the results of both equations differ by only 0.08%; however, if it fell from geosynchronous orbit, which is 42,164 km, then the difference changes to almost 64%.",
