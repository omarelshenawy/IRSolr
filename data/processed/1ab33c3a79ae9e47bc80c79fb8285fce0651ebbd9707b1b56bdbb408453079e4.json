She left Bill in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[3] At a time when the Southern United States was segregated racially, Bill's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[3] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton, Sr., who owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[3] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.",
