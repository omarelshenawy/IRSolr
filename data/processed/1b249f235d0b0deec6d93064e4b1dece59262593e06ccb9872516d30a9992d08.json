				"previous": "The earliest ukiyo-e artists came from the world of Japanese painting.[16] Yamato-e painting of the 17th century had developed a style of outlined forms which allowed inks to be dripped on a wet surface and spread out towards the outlinesâthis outlining of forms was to become the dominant style of ukiyo-e.[17]",
				"after": "Around 1661, painted hanging scrolls known as Portraits of Kanbun Beauties gained popularity. The paintings of the Kanbun era (1661â73), most of which are anonymous, marked the beginnings of ukiyo-e as an independent school.[16] The paintings of Iwasa Matabei (1578â1650) have a great affinity with ukiyo-e paintings. Scholars diagree whether Matabei's work itself is ukiyo-e;[18] assertions that he was the genre's founder are especially common amongst Japanese researchers.[19] At times Matabei has been credited as the artist of the unsigned Hikone screen,[20] a byÅbu folding screen that may be one of the earliest surviving ukiyo-e works. The screen is in a refined KanÅ style and depicts contemporary life, rather than the prescribed subjects of the painterly schools.[21]",
