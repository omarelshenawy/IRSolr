				"after": "Byzantium has been often identified with absolutism, orthodox spirituality, orientalism and exoticism, while the terms \"Byzantine\" and \"Byzantinism\" have been used as bywords for decadence, complex bureaucracy, and repression. In the countries of Central and Southeast Europe that exited the Eastern Bloc in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the assessment of Byzantine civilisation and its legacy was strongly negative due to their connection with an alleged \"Eastern authoritarianism and autocracy.\" Both Eastern and Western European authors have often perceived Byzantium as a body of religious, political, and philosophical ideas contrary to those of the West. Even in 19th-century Greece, the focus was mainly on the classical past, while Byzantine tradition had been associated with negative connotations.[236]",
