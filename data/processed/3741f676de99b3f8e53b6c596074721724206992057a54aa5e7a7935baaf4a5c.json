				"after": "The origins of Typhoon Mitag were from a trough near the equator in late February 2002.[3] A circulation developed on FebruaryÂ 25 south of Pohnpei, which initially had disorganized convection due to moderate wind shear. After further organization,[1] the system developed into a tropical depression on FebruaryÂ 26. Located south of the subtropical ridge,[3][4] it moved generally westward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Mitag near Chuuk State in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) on FebruaryÂ 28. This was based off analysis from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA);[nb 3][4] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 4] estimated that the system intensified into a tropical storm a day prior.[3] It passed just south of Weno in Chuuk while continuing westward,[6] intensifying quickly due to decreasing wind shear.[1] The JTWC upgraded the storm to a typhoon on MarchÂ 1,[3] and the JMA followed suit a day later.[4]",
