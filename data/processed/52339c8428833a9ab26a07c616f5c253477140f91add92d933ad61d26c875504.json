				"after": "The airline was established in 1998 as an air taxi company to operate services for oil companies in the Campos Basin. Its name was then OceanAir and began to operate scheduled services in 2002, between SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, MacaÃ© and Campos. Soon afterwards, it started to become better known to the public with a flight (no longer operated now) connecting Congonhas Airport in SÃ£o Paulo and Santos Dumont Airport in Rio de Janeiro via SÃ£o Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, enabling international passengers from both cities easy access to the country's largest international hub from those cities' smaller but central and more convenient airports. At the time, OceanAir's fare between SÃ£o Paulo's airports was cheaper than a taxi and on a par with a luxury bus ride.",
