				"Cities and towns which have Roman origins, or were extensively developed by them are listed with their Latin names in brackets; civitates are marked C",
				"Roman towns can be broadly grouped in two categories. Civitates, \"public towns\" were formally laid out on a grid plan, and their role in imperial administration occasioned the construction of public buildings.[88] The much more numerous category of vici, \"small towns\" grew on informal plans, often round a camp or at a ford or crossroads; some were not small, others were scarcely urban, some not even defended by a wall, the characteristic feature of a place of any importance.[89]"
