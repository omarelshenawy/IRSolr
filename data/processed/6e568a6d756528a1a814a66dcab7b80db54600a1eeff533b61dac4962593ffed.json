It is a ruminant species, with a four-chambered stomach, and feeds on grasses, plants, leaves and bark. During the summer, elk eat almost constantly, consuming between 4 and 7 kilograms (8.8 and 15.4Â lb) daily.[22] In North America, males are called bulls, and females are called cows. In Asia, stag and hind, respectively, are sometimes used instead.",
