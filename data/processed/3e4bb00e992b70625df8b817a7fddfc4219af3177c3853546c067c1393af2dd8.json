It is known for its many 'cobbled sectors', being, with the Tour of Flanders and GentâWevelgem, one of the cobbled classics. Since 1977, the winner of ParisâRoubaix has received a sett (cobble stone) as part of his prize. The terrain has led to the development of specialised frames, wheels and tyres. Punctures and other mechanical problems are common and often influence the result.",
