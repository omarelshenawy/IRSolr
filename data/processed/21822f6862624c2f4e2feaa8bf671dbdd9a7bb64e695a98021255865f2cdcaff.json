The eggs of the last breeding pair of white-tailed sea eagle in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced.[131] The chough last bred on the island in 1900.[132][133] Mountain hare (apparently absent in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and preyed upon by wild cat and pine marten.[134] The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew.[135][136] Offshore the edible crab and edible oyster are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay.[137][138] There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs[139] and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh.[140]",
