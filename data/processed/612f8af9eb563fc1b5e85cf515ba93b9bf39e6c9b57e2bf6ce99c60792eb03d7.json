				"after": "Birmingham's explosive industrial expansion started earlier than that of the textile-manufacturing towns of the North of England,[52] and was driven by different factors. Instead of the economies of scale of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour, practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small, often self-owned workshops.[53] This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 â the core years of the Industrial Revolution â Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city.[54]",
