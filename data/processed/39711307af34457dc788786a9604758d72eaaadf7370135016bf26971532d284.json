The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a sound recording copyright symbol (â, the letterÂ P inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letterÂ P indicating a \"phonorecord\". Similarly, the phrase All rights reserved was once required to assert copyright.",
