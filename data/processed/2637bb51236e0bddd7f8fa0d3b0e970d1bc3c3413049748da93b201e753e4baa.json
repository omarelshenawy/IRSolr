				"previous": "The discovery of the ionization of gases by ultra-violet light was made by Philipp Lenard in 1900. As the effect was produced across several centimeters of air and made very great positive and small negative ions, it was natural to interpret the phenomenon, as did J. J. Thomson, as a Hertz effect upon the solid or liquid particles present in the gas.[15]",
				"after": "In 1902, Lenard observed that the energy of individual emitted electrons increased with the frequency (which is related to the color) of the light.[6]",
