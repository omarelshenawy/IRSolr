Progress was slow because the new college lacked the \"generous endowments\" that earlier colleges enjoyed.[21] Before new buildings were completed, the students lived in the old buildings of White Hall.[17] Between 1571 and his death in 1574, Price spent about Â£1,500[n 1] on the construction of buildings that were two storeys high. These ran from Turl Street (on the east of the site) south towards the corner of Cheyney Lane (as Market Street was then known) and then west along Cheyney Lane to the buildings of the old Great White Hall.[23] Land at the corner of Turl Street and Cheyney Lane was leased and built upon, and then purchased in 1580.[15] There is a college tradition, recorded in the college's first book of benefactors in the 17th century, that ElizabethÂ I gave \"all kind of timber\" from Shotover and Stow Wood for buildings erected by Price.[13] Until the later building works of Griffith Powell and Sir Eubule Thelwall (principals from 1613 to 1620 and 1621 to 1630 respectively), the college site consisted of \"a number of smallish, mainly detached buildings with nothing resembling a formal garden layout in between\".[18]",
