				"previous": "Maastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.",
				"after": "The universityâs arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastrichtâs city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the universityâs inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastrichtâs historic city centre.[39]",
