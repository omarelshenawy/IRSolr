The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Nighttime temperatures range from cool to cold. Light snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or TÃ³rshavn, Faroe Islands located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator.",
