				"previous": "The Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center includes an exhibit area, which depicts a variety of marine habitats (including the South Shore Estuary Reserve, the seashore and the dune environment), and child-centered activities, which allow indoor visitors to feel live marine animals, look through a microscope, or play in a children's activity area, and outdoor visitors to dig up whale bones in the Discovery Bone Cove, walk through a butterfly garden, view a shipwreck, or walk along an environmental boardwalk that leads to the dune environment to view the plants and animals that live there. The Center also offers interpretive programs for organized groups and the general public.[29]",
