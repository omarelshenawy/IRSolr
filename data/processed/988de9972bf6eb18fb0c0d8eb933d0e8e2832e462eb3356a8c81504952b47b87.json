				"previous": "The one-child policy (Family Planning Program) and sex-selective abortions in China have caused a growing disproportion in the country's gender balance.[1][2] Since 1979, when the one-child policy was introduced, approximately 20 million more men than women have been born, or 120 males to 100 females born,[12][13] and by 2020, China is expected to have 24 million more men than women.[14] The global average is 103 males to 107 females.[15]",
				"after": "According to The New York Times, the State Council of the People's Republic of China (Central People's Government) issued an \"edict\" in 2007 regarding the Population and Family Planning Program (one-child-policy) to address the urgent gender imbalance and cited it as a major \"threat to social stability\".[16] The council further cited \"upgrading population quality (suzhi)\" as one of its primary goals and appointed the All-China Women's Federation, a state agency established in 1949 to \"protect women's rights and interests\", to oversee and resolve the issue.[16]",
