				"previous": "USAF hopes to replace the Rocketdyne RL-10 engines used on the upper stage of both the Lockheed Martin Atlas V and the Boeing Delta IV, known as evolved expendable launch vehicles (EELV) that are the primary method of putting US satellites into space. While NASA frequently uses EELVs to launch large scientific payloads, the programme's administration is largely run through other channels.[15]",
				"after": "The other current model, the RL10A-4-2, is the engine used on Centaur upper stage for Atlas V.[29]",
