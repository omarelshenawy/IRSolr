				"previous": "The flood dislodged thousands of peasant farmers, many of whom joined roving bandit and rebel groups such as the Red Eyebrows to survive.[43] Wang Mang's armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups. Eventually, an insurgent mob forced their way into the Weiyang Palace and killed Wang Mang.[44]",
				"after": "The Gengshi Emperor (r.Â 23â25 AD), a descendant of Emperor Jing (r.Â 157â141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he was overwhelmed by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu Penzi.[45] Emperor Gengshi's brother Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r.Â 25â57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.[46]",
