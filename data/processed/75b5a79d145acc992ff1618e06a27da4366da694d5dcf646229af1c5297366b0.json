				"after": "The 1980 Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team won the gold medal in women's field hockey at that year's Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union capital, Moscow. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's white minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led Olympic boycott created in the women's hockey competition. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the round-robin tournament with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge upset, particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an \"irresistible fairy story\".[1] Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.",
