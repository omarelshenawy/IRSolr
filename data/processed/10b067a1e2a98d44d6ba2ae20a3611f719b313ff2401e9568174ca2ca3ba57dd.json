				"previous": "Cabin interior width is approximately 18 feet (550Â cm) at armrest level,[221] which is 1 inch (2.5Â cm) more than originally planned.[223] The Dreamliner's cabin width is 15 inches (38Â cm) more than that of the Airbus A330 and A340,[224] 5 inches (13Â cm) less than the A350,[225] and 16Â in (41Â cm) less than the 777.[226] Airlines use economy seat widths from a low of 16.33Â in (41.5Â cm) in charter configuration up to 20.66Â in (52.5Â cm) in premium economy layout.[227] The 787's economy seats can be up to 17.5Â in (44.4Â cm) wide for nine-abreast seating[228] and up to 19 inches (48Â cm) wide for eight-abreast seating arrangements. Most airlines are selecting the nine-abreast (3â3â3) configuration.[229] The 787 interior was designed to better accommodate persons with mobility, sensory, and cognitive disabilities. For example, a 56 by 57Â in (140 by 140Â cm) convertible lavatory includes a movable center wall that allows two separate lavatories to become one large, wheelchair-accessible facility.[230]",
				"after": "The 787's cabin windows are larger in area than any other civil air transport in-service or in development,[231] with dimensions of 10.7 by 18.4Â in (27 by 47Â cm),[231] and a higher eye level so passengers can maintain a view of the horizon.[232] The composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for structural reinforcement.[233] Instead of plastic window shades, the windows use electrochromism-based smart glass (supplied by PPG Industries)[234] allowing flight attendants[235] and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking,[236] reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world,[232][237] but the most opaque setting still has some transparency.[235][238][239] The lavatory, however, has a traditional sunshade.[236] The 787's cabin features light-emitting diodes (LEDs)[240] as standard equipment, allowing the aircraft to be entirely 'bulbless'. LED lights have previously been an option on the Boeing 777 and Airbus aircraft.[241][242] The system has three colors LEDs plus a white LED.[240]",
