				"previous": "The common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed 2,000 pairs,[43] but may occasionally number more than 20,000 pairs.[58] Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast. Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species, such as Arctic,[59] roseate and Sandwich terns, black-headed gulls,[60][61] and black skimmers.[62] Especially in the early part of the breeding season, for no known reason, most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea. This phenomenon is called a \"dread\".[43]",
				"after": "On their return to the breeding sites, the terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory,[63] and the actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish.[64] Terns defend only a small area, with distances between nests sometimes being as little as 50Â cm (20Â in), although 150â350Â cm (59â138Â in) is more typical. As with many birds, the same site is re-used year after year, with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons. Around 90% of experienced birds reuse their former territory, so young birds must nest on the periphery, find a bereaved mate, or move to another colony.[63] A male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring, and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late, in which case the pair may separate.[65]",
