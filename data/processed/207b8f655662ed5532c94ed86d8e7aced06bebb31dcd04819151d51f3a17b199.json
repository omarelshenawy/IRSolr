				"previous": "Iridium is used in particle physics for the production of antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.[68]",
				"after": "Carbonâhydrogen bond activation (CâH activation) is an area of research on reactions that cleave carbonâhydrogen bonds, which were traditionally regarded as unreactive. The first reported successes at activating CâH bonds in saturated hydrocarbons, published in 1982, used organometallic iridium complexes that undergo an oxidative addition with the hydrocarbon.[69][70]",
