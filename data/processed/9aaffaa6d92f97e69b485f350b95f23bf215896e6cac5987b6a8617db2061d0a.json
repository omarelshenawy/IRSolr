				"after": "The cathedral, built in a neo-Gothic style, is a three-aisled cross-shaped pseudo-basilica, which has three naves and an apse. It was constructed entirely from red brick, and was not rendered externally. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 metres (213Â ft), each with lateral arms 13 metres (43Â ft) long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 metres (98Â ft) high. The faÃ§ade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral.[5][12] Typically for old-style church buildings, each side aisle is strengthened by five buttresses, the ten together symbolising the Ten Commandments. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central faÃ§ade pinnacle and two other faÃ§ade pinnacles feature the crests of John PaulÂ II and archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz.[12]",
