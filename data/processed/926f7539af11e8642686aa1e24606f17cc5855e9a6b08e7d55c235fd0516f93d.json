About two-thirds of pupils attend privately run institutions.[219] Languages of instruction include English, Hindi, Urdu[220] and Telugu. Depending on the institution, students are required to sit the Secondary School Certificate[221] or the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education. After completing secondary education, students enroll in schools or junior colleges with a higher secondary facility. Admission to professional graduation colleges in Hyderabad, many of which are affiliated with either Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTUH) or Osmania University (OU), is through the Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test (EAM-CET).[222][223]",
