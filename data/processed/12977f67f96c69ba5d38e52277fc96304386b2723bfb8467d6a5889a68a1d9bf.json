				"The pressure coefficient is a parameter for studying the flow of incompressible fluids such as water, and also the low-speed flow of compressible fluids such as air. The relationship between the dimensionless coefficient and the dimensional numbers is [1] [2]"
			],
			"after": [
				"Using Bernoulli's Equation, the pressure coefficient can be further simplified for incompressible, lossless, and steady flow:[3]",
				"where V is the velocity of the fluid at the point at which pressure coefficient is being evaluated."
