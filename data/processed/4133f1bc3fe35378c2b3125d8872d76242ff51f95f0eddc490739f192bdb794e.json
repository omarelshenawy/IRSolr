The Sydney region passenger demand is forecast to reach 87Â million passengers by 2035, more than doubling, and to double again by 2060.[46] Close to half of all scheduled flights in Australia take off or land at Kingsford Smith. In 1998 the airport handled 45 per cent of international passengers in Australia.[47]",
