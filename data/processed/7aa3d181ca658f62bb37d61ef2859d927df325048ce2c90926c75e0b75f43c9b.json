				"previous": "Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed,[22] generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary.[23][24] Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa, at 4,973 feet (1,516Â m) above sea level, situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The state's lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel, OK, which dips to 289 feet (88Â m) above sea level.[25]",
