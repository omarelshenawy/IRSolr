				"after": "Although some morphological differences between the two fossa species have been described,[16] these may be allometric (growth-related), and in their 1986 Mammalian Species account of the fossa, Michael KÃ¶hncke and Klaus Leonhardt wrote that the two were morphologically identical.[17] However, remains of C.Â spelea are larger than any living C.Â ferox. Goodman and colleagues found that skull measurements in specimens they identified as C.Â spelea were 1.07 to 1.32 times as large as in adult C.Â ferox, and postcranial measurements were 1.19 to 1.37 times as large.[8] The only specimen of C.Â spelea in which condylobasal length (a measure of total skull length) could be ascertained measured 153.4Â mm (6.04Â in), compared to a range of 114.5 to 133.3Â mm (4.51 to 5.25Â in) in adult C.Â ferox. Humerus (upper arm bone) length in twelve C.Â spelea is 122.7 to 146.8Â mm (4.83 to 5.78Â in), averaging 137.9Â mm (5.43Â in), compared to 108.5 to 127.5Â mm (4.27 to 5.02Â in), averaging 116.1Â mm (4.57Â in), in the extant fossa.[18] Body mass estimates for C.Â spelea range from 17Â kg (37Â lb)[19] to 20Â kg (44Â lb),[20] and it was among the largest carnivores of the island.[21] By comparison, adult C.Â ferox range from 5Â kg (11Â lb) to 10Â kg (22Â lb).[22]",
