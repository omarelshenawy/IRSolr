				"after": "In 1799, Boone and his family left the mouth of the Little Sandy River and moved to a frontier area then part of Spanish Louisiana. (It eventually became the state of Missouri.) The Spanish, eager to promote settlement in the sparsely populated region, did not enforce the requirement that all immigrants had to be Roman Catholic. Looking to make a fresh start, Boone moved with much of his extended family to what is now St. Charles County. The Spanish governor appointed Boone \"syndic\" (judge and jury) and commandant (military leader) of the Femme Osage district. The many anecdotes of Boone's tenure as syndic suggest he sought to render fair judgments rather than to strictly observe the letter of the law.[citation needed]",
