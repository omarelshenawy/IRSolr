				"Clunies-Ross' workers were paid in a currency called the Cocos rupee, a currency John Clunies-Ross minted himself that could only be redeemed at the company store.[7]",
				"After some time, Hare's women began deserting him, and instead finding themselves mates amongst Clunies-Ross' sailors.[5] Disheartened, Hare left the island. He died in Bencoolen in 1834.[6]"

				"after": "On 1 April 1836, HMSÂ Beagle under Captain Robert FitzRoy arrived to take soundings establishing the profile of the atoll as part of the survey expedition of the Beagle. To the young naturalist Charles Darwin, who was on the ship, the results supported a theory he had developed of how atolls formed, which he later published as The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. He studied the natural history of the islands and collected specimens.[8] Darwin's assistant Syms Covington noted that \"an Englishman [he was in fact Scottish] and HIS family, with about sixty or seventy mulattos from the Cape of Good Hope, live on one of the islands. Captain Ross, the governor, is now absent at the Cape.\"",
