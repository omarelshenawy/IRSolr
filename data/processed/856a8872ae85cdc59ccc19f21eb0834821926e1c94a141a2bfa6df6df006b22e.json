In 2008 a species of trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti after Colbert.[156][157] The spider was discovered on the California coastline in 2007.[158] The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a professor of biology at East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him.[159] On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, \"And all I had to do was shamelessly beg on national television.\"[160]",
