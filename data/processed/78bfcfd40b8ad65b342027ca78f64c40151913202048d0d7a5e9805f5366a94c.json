				"after": "In addition to his cartooning, Davenport is remembered for playing a key role in bringing some of the earliest desertbred or asil Arabian horses to America. A longtime admirer of horses, Davenport stated in 1905, \"I have dreamed of Arabian horses all my life.\"[67] He had been captivated by the beauty of the Arabians brought to the Chicago Columbian Exposition in 1893.[68] Upon learning that these horses had remained in America and had been sold at auction, he sought them out,[62] finding most of the surviving animals in 1898[67] in the hands of millionaire fertilizer magnate Peter Bradley of Hingham, Massachusetts.[69] Davenport bought some Arabian horses outright between 1898 and 1905, paying $8,500 for one stallion,[67] but he later partnered with Bradley in the horse business.[70] Among his purchases, he managed to gather all but one of the surviving horses that had been a part of the Chicago Exhibition.[71]",
