				"after": "Before the invention or discovery of the concept of \"nature\" (Ancient Greek phusis), by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural \"way\" in which a plant grows,[9] and the \"way\" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish \"nature\" and \"convention\".[10] Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature, and the things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophyÂ â the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek technÄ) was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans.[11]",
