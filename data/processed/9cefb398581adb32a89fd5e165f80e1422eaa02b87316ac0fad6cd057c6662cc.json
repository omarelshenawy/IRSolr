				"after": "During the mid-15th century tapestry was one of the most expensive and prized artistic products in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 1400s, especially in the cities of Arras, Bruges and Tournai. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, Pope Julius II sent Raphael's cartoons to Brussels to be woven into hangings.[118] Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the Congress of Arras in 1435,[98] where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around (tout autour) with tapestries showing scenes of the \"Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege\".[119] At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room \"was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece\". Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from The Romance of the Rose.[119] For about two centuries, during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced \"innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen.\"[120]",
