				"previous": "The HoustonâThe WoodlandsâSugar Land MSA's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012 was $489Â billion, the fourth-largest of any metropolitan area in the United States and larger than Austria's, Venezuela's or South Africa's GDP.[100] Only 26 countries other than the United States have a gross domestic product exceeding Houston's regional gross area product.[101] In 2010, mining, which in Houston consists almost entirely of exploration and production of oil and gas, accounted for 26.3% of Houston's GAP, up sharply in response to high energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity; followed by engineering services, health services, and manufacturing.[102]",
				"after": "The University of Houston System's annual impact on the Houston-area's economy equates to that of a major corporation: $1.1 billion in new funds attracted annually to the Houston area, $3.13 billion in total economic benefit, and 24,000 local jobs generated.[104][105] This is in addition to the 12,500 new graduates the UHÂ System produces every year who enter the workforce in Houston and throughout Texas. These degree-holders tend to stay in Houston. After five years, 80.5Â percent of graduates are still living and working in the region.[105]",
