				"previous": "The critical points of a cubic equation are those values of x where the slope of the cubic function is zero. They are found by setting derivative of the cubic equation equal to zero obtaining: fÂ â²(x)Â = 3ax2Â +Â 2bxÂ +Â c = 0. The solutions of that equation are the critical points of the cubic equation and are given by: (using the quadratic formula)",
				"after": "If b2Â âÂ 3acÂ >Â 0, then the cubic function has a local maximum and a local minimum. If b2Â âÂ 3acÂ =Â 0, then the cubic's inflection point is the only critical point. If b2Â âÂ 3acÂ <Â 0, then there are no critical points. In the cases where b2Â âÂ 3acÂ â¤Â 0, the cubic function is strictly monotonic.",
