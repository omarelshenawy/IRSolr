The current estimates for the ISS are approaching â¬100 billion in total (development, construction and 10 years of maintaining the station) of which ESA has committed to paying â¬8 billion.[90] About 90% of the costs of ESA's ISS share will be contributed by Germany (41%), France (28%) and Italy (20%). German ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter was the first long-term ISS crew member.",
