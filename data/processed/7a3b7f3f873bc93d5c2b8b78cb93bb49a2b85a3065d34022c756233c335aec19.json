				"after": "Plans for a business jet version of the 737 are not new. In the late 1980s, Boeing marketed the Boeing 77â33 jet, a business jet version of the 737-300.[38] The name was short-lived. After the introduction of the next generation series, Boeing introduced the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) series. The BBJ1 was similar in dimensions to the 737-700 but had additional features, including stronger wings and landing gear from the 737-800, and has increased range (through the use of extra fuel tanks) over the other various 737 models. The first BBJ rolled out on August 11, 1998 and flew for the first time on September 4.[39]",
