				"previous": "As Landor's reputation grew, its client list expanded to encompass airlines, financial institutions, government agencies, hospitality services, and technology firms, among other businesses.[8] Over time, Landor broadened its consulting services to offer corporate and product naming, brand positioning and architecture, retail environment design, copywriting, internal brand engagement, digital branding, and BrandAsset Valuator analysis in addition to corporate identity and package design.[6]",
				"after": "From the 1960s to the 1980s, Landor Associates established its headquarters on board the renovated ferryboat Klamath, moored in San Francisco Bay.[10] This unusual arrangement was intended to foster creativity among the firm's employees.[11] Mixing business with pleasure, the Klamath also hosted business symposia, cultural events and parties that included dignitaries, artists, business tycoons and celebrities.[1] Although Landor's business eventually outgrew the ferryboat and moved to larger offices on land, the Klamath has remained its corporate symbol.[12]",
