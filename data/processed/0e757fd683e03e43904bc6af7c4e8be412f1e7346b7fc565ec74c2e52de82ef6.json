				"after": "The word lesbian is derived from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho.[1] From various ancient writings, historians gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification.[4] Little of Sappho's poetry remains, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls.[5] Before the late 19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.[note 1]",
