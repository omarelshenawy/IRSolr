				"previous": "The woman, who is probably in her late teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.Â 1395 â 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes to focus attention on the sitter.[5] It was not until Hans Memling (c.Â 1435â1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape.[6] In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession.[2] Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; it is likely that the angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.",
				"after": "The woman wears an elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur at the neck and wrist.[1][8] Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin aesthetic of the Gothic ideal.[note 1] Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention to the structure of the clothingâthe careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its positionâis typical for the artist.[9]",
