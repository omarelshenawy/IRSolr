				"after": "The School for Creative and Performing Arts arose, in part, as a response to the recurring desegregation battles in the Cincinnati Public Schools (CPS) in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[5] In a 1965 civil rights suit, the city prevailed when a federal judge found that the schools were not intentionally segregated, but that \"the racial composition of each school is simply a result of the racial composition of the neighborhoods which they serve\".[6] By 1971, Cincinnati's neighborhoods and schools had grown more segregated and the Supreme Court of the United States upheld forced busing as a remedy for school segregation in other cities.[7] Desiring to avoid such drastic remedies for Cincinnati, newly appointed Superintendent Dr. Donald Waldrip pushed forward a program of alternative schools (later called magnet schools), designed \"to calm the desires of parents for academic choice and to stem the demands of federal judges for court-ordered desegregation.\"[5] The theory behind alternative schools was open enrollment: students could attend any alternative school they chose at no cost, so long as an even racial balance at the new school was maintained.[8] So far as possible, students were admitted to these programs on a one white for one black basis.[9] The School for Creative and Performing Arts was the first alternative school in what would become one of the largest and most robust magnet programs in the country.[10]a[âº]",
