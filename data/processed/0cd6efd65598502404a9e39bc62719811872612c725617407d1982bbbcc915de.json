The Lisbon Metro is its main artery, connecting the city centre with the upper and eastern districts and now reaching the suburbs. Ambitious expansion projects will increase the network by almost one third, connecting the airport and the northern and western districts. Bus, funicular and tram services have been supplied by the Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa (Carris), for over a century.",
