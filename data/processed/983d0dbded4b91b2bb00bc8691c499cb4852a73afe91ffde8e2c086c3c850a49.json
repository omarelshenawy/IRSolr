				"previous": "Delta Comfort+ seats are installed on all Delta aircraft, as well as all two-cabin Delta Connection aircraft and feature 34â36 inches (860â910Â mm) of pitch; on all Delta One configured aircraft, 35â36 inches (890â910Â mm) of pitch and 50 percent more recline over standard Main Cabin seats.[84] The seats were known as \"Economy Comfort\" until March 1, 2015.[79] Additional amenities include priority boarding, complimentary spirits and the option of purchasing a premium meal prior to departure on international flights, and HBO programming. On transcontinental flights between JFK-LAX/SFO/SEA, Delta Comfort+ passengers also get 1 free premium snack and a free cold meal. Customers can upgrade from standard Main Cabin seats to Delta Comfort+ seats either for a fee or using either SkyMiles or for free if either a full fare Main Cabin ticket is purchased or with elite status. Delta Comfort+ more closely aligns Delta's offerings with its Transatlantic joint venture partners as KLM also offers a Delta Comfort+ section of its Main Cabin that features similar seat pitch and recline.",
				"after": "Main Cabin (also known as \"Economy Class\") is available on all aircraft with seats ranging from 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46Â cm) wide and 30 to 33 inches (76 to 84Â cm) of pitch. The main cabin on Boeing 737, 747-400, 777, and selected Boeing 757-200, 767-300, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft have an articulating seat bottom where the seat bottom moves forward in addition to the seat back tilting backwards when reclining.[citation needed][85]",
