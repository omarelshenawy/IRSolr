				"previous": "The function y(Ï) is plotted alongside Ï for the case R=1: it tends to infinity at the poles. The linear y-axis values are not usually shown on printed maps; instead some maps show the non-linear scale of latitude values on the right. More often than not the maps show only a graticule of selected meridians and parallels",
				"after": "The expression on the right of the second equation defines the Gudermannian function; i.e., Ï=gd(y/R): the direct equation may therefore be written as y=R.gdâ1(Ï).[11]",
