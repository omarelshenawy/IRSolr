				"previous": "Although designed primarily for passenger use, the Trimotor could be easily adapted for hauling cargo, since its seats in the fuselage could be removed. To increase cargo capacity, one unusual feature was the provision of \"drop-down\" cargo holds below the lower inner wing sections of the 5-AT version.[3][7]",
				"after": "One 4-AT with Wright J-4 200Â hp engines was built for the U.S. Army Air Corps as the C-3, and seven with Wright R-790-3 (235Â hp) as C-3As. The latter were upgraded to Wright R-975-1 (J6-9) radials at 300Â hp and redesignated C-9. Five 5-ATs were built as C-4s or C-4As.",
