				"previous": "On December 17, 2013 at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, John Magoffin's fully restored 1933 Lockheed Vega returned to the skies in Marana, Arizona after 18 years of restoration. This date was selected to commemorate the 110th anniversary of heavier-than-air powered flight.[5] The aircraft, Lockheed serial number #161, is one of nine all-metal (in contrast to the usual wood) fuselage Vegas built. First registration of the aircraft was NC12288.[6] This aircraft is frequently on display inside the Airbase Arizona Museum at Falcon Field in Mesa AZ, when not flying elsewhere. [7]",
