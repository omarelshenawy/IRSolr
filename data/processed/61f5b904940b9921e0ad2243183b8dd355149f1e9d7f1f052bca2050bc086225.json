				"previous": "The 1990s are remembered, by many in the West, as a time of relative prosperity and satisfaction.[155] According to some historians, visionary politics appeared to be on the decline.[156][157] However, even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology.[11] He did admit to being disillusioned with his approach. \"I knew my views (and I personally) would benefit from engagement with the real world of commerce and professional ambition\", he wrote.[158]",
				"after": "After graduating in 1995, Satin worked for a Manhattan law firm focusing on complex business litigation.[15] He also wrote about financial and legal issues.[159] He did not dislike his work, but felt he was \"sleepwalking\" because he was not doing what he loved, writing about visionary politics.[158] With six former law school classmates,[160] he began planning a political newsletter that could accommodate all he was learning about business and law.[158] In 1998 he returned to Washington, D.C., to launch Radical Middle Newsletter.[nb 15]",
