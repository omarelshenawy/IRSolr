				"previous": "The written protohistory of Scotland began with the arrival of the Roman Empire in southern and central Great Britain, when the Romans occupied what is now England and Wales, administering it as a province called Britannia. Roman invasions and occupations of southern Scotland were a series of brief interludes.",
				"after": "According to the Roman historian Tacitus, the Caledonians \"turned to armed resistance on a large scale\", attacking Roman forts and skirmishing with their legions.
