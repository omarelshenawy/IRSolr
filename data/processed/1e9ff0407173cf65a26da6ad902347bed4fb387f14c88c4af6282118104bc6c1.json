				"after": "The Subsecretaria de Telecomunicaciones of Chile ruled that zero-rating services like Wikipedia Zero, Facebook Zero, and Google Free Zone, that subsidize mobile data usage, violate net neutrality laws and had to end the practice by June 1, 2014.[18][19] The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said, \"Whilst we appreciate the intent behind efforts such as Wikipedia Zero, ultimately zero rated services are a dangerous compromise.\"[20] Accessnow.org has been more critical, saying, \"Wikimedia has always been a champion for open access to information, but itâs crucial to call out zero-rating programs for what they are: Myopic deals that do great damage to the future of the open internet.\"[21] The Wikimedia Foundation's Gayle Karen Young defended the program to the Washington Post, saying, \"We have a complicated relationship to [net neutrality]. We believe in net neutrality in America,\" while adding that Wikipedia Zero required a different perspective in other countries: \"Partnering with telecom companies in the near term, it blurs the net neutrality line in those areas. It fulfills our overall mission, though, which is providing free knowledge.\"[22]",
