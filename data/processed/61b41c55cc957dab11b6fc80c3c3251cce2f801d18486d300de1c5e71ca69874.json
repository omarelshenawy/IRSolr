				"previous": "The A and Bs are collectively known as the Einstein coefficients.[72]",
				"after": "Einstein was troubled by the fact that his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not determine the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which path it would follow.[33] Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation[44] from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function[80][81] was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.[82]",
