				"after": "The camas pocket gopher is, by a small margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys).[35] The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath.[36] There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus,[37] and it has blackish ear and nose markings.[6] The external ear is a thickened rim of tissue.[37] During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier.[6] The coat of the young is similar to the adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.[37]",
