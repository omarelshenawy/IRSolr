				"The addition operation is carried out from right to left; in this case, pence are processed first, then shillings followed by pounds. The numbers below the \"answer line\" are intermediate results.",
				"The total in the pence column is 25. Since there are 12 pennies in a shilling, 25 is divided byÂ 12 to giveÂ 2 with a remainder ofÂ 1. The valueÂ \"1\" is then written to the answer row and the valueÂ \"2\" carried forward to the shillings column. This operation is repeated using the values in the shillings column, with the additional step of adding the value that was carried forward from the pennies column. The intermediate total is divided byÂ 20 as there are 20Â shillings in a pound. The pound column is then processed, but as pounds are the largest unit that is being considered, no values are carried forward from the pounds column."
