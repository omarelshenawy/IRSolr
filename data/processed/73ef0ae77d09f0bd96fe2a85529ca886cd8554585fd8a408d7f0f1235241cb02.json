				"William Lantie Mallory and George Rihl headed CompaÃ±Ã­a Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n (\"Mexican Aviation Company\" or \"Mexican Airline Company\"), a competitor to CMTA; they acquired the latter's assets in 1924[7] and the company that emerged existed until 2010. In 1925 Sherman Fairchild purchased a 20% stake in the Mexican airline, introducing Fairchild FC2 airplanes in 1928. In February 1929, Juan Trippe of Pan Am took over the majority of the airline's stock, and the company opened its first international route, with service to the United States. Mexicana used the Ford Trimotor plane to operate the Mexico City-Tuxpan-Tampico-Brownsville, Texas, USA, route. Charles Lindbergh piloted the first flight on this route."
