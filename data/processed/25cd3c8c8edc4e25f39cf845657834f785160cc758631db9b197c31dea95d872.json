				"after": "Deteriorating climate in Scandinavia around 850 BC and later faster around 650 BC might have triggered migration of the Germanic tribes. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groupings had emerged.[34][35] The North Sea Germanic (or Ingvaeones) inhabited the northern part of the Low Countries. They would later develop into the Frisii and the early Saxons.[35] A second grouping, the Weser-Rhine Germanic (or Istvaeones), extended along the middle Rhine and Weser and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the Salian Franks.[35] Also the Celtic La TÃ¨ne culture (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest) had expanded over a wide range, including into the southern area of the Low Countries. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the Iron Age Nordwestblock culture,[36][37] that eventually was being absorbed by the Celts to the south and the Germanic peoples from the east.",
