The town of La LÃ­nea de la ConcepciÃ³n, a municipality of the province of CÃ¡diz, lies on the Spanish side of the border. The Spanish hinterland forms the comarca of Campo de Gibraltar (literally \"Countryside of Gibraltar\"). The shoreline measures 12 kilometres (7.5Â mi) in length. There are two coasts (\"Sides\") of Gibraltar: the East Side, which contains the settlements of Sandy Bay and Catalan Bay; and the Westside, where the vast majority of the population lives. Gibraltar has no administrative divisions but is divided into seven Major Residential Areas.",
