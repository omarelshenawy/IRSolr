				"after": "The Sea King became operational with the United States Navy in June 1961 as the HSS-2. When the unified aircraft designation system was introduced, the aircraft's designation changed to SH-3A. It was used primarily for anti-submarine warfare: detecting and tracking Soviet submarines. In time of war, it would have attacked them as well.[31] Sea Kings could also operate from offshore platforms to extend their surveillance and strike range. Nighttime ASW operations were possible with considerable difficulty.[32][33]",
