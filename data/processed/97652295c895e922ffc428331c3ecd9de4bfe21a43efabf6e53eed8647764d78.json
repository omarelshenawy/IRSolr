				"previous": "In 1890 the French engineer ClÃ©ment Ader completed the first of three steam-driven flying machines, the Ãole. On 9 October 1890 Ader made an uncontrolled hop of around 50Â m (165Â ft); this was the first manned airplane to take off under its own power.[45] His Avion III of 1897, notable only for having twin steam engines, failed to fly:[46] Ader would later claim success and was not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his attempt.",
				"after": "Sir Hiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England. He built his own whirling arm rig and wind tunnel, and constructed a large machine with a wingspan of 105 feet (32Â m), a length of 145 feet (44Â m), fore and aft horizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two lightweight compound steam engines each delivering 180Â hp (130Â kW). Overall weight was 8,000 pounds (3,600Â kg). It was intended as a test rig to investigate aerodynamic lift: lacking flight controls it ran on rails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it. Completed in 1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for several hundred feet at two to three feet altitude [47] and was badly damaged upon falling back to the ground. It was subsequently repaired, but Maxim abandoned his experiments shortly afterwards[48]",
