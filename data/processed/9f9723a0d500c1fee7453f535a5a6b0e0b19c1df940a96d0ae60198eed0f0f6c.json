				"after": "In Argentina Virginia Bolten is responsible for the publication of a newspaper called La Voz de la Mujer (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901. A similar paper with the same name was reportedly published later in Montevideo, which suggests that Bolten may also have founded and edited it after her deportation.[9] \"La Voz de la Mujer described itself as âdedicated to the advancement of Communist Anarchism.â Its central theme was that of the multiple nature of womenâs oppression. An editorial asserted, âWe believe that in present-day society nothing and nobody has a more wretched situation than unfortunate women.â Women, they said, were doubly oppressed - by bourgeois society and by men. Its feminism can be seen from its attack on marriage and upon male power over women. Its contributors, like anarchist feminists elsewhere, developed a concept of oppression that focused on gender oppression. Marriage was a bourgeois institution which restricted womenâs freedom, including their sexual freedom. Marriages entered into without love, fidelity maintained through fear rather than desire, oppression of women by men they hated - all were seen as symptomatic of the coercion implied by the marriage contract. It was this alienation of the individualâs will that the anarchist feminists deplored and sought to remedy, initially through free love and then, and more thoroughly, through social revolution.\"[10]",
