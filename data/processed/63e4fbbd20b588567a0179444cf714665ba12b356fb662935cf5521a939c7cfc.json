				"The word \"stearn\" was used for these birds in Old English as early as the eighth century, and appears in the poem The Seafarer, written in the ninth century or earlier. Variants such as \"tearn\" occurred by the eleventh century, although the older form lingered on in Norfolk dialect for several centuries.[3] Forms such as \"tearn\" occurred by the eleventh century, although the older form lingered on in Norfolk dialect for several centuries.[3] As now, the term was used for the inland black tern as well as the marine species.[15][16] Some authorities consider \"tearn\" and similar forms to be variants of \"stearn\",[3] while others derive the English words from Scandinavian equivalents such as Danish terne, Swedish tÃ¤rna or Norwegian terna, and ultimately from Old Norse Ã¾erna.[17][18] Linnaeus adopted \"stearn\" or \"sterna\" (which the naturalist William Turner had used in 1544 as a Latinisation of an English word, presumably \"stern\", for the black tern)[17][19] or a North Germanic equivalent for his genus name Sterna.[20]"
