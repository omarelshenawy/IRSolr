				"previous": "As relations between England and France worsened, however, a removal to France became impracticable.[151] Following the declaration of war of February 1793, and the Aliens Bill of March 1793, which forbade correspondence or travel between England and France, William Priestley left France for America. Joseph Priestley's sons Harry and Joseph chose to leave England for America in August 1793.[152] Finally Priestley himself followed with his wife, boarding the Sansom at Gravesend on 7 April 1793.[153] Five weeks after Priestley left, William Pitt's administration began arresting radicals for seditious libel, resulting in the famous 1794 Treason Trials.[154]",
				"after": "The Priestleys arrived in New York City in 1794, where they were fÃªted by various political factions vying for Priestley's endorsement. Priestley declined their entreaties, hoping to avoid political discord in his new country. Before travelling to a new home in the backwoods of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, at Point township (now Northumberland borough), Dr and Mrs Priestley lodged in Philadelphia, where Priestley gave a series of sermons, which led to the founding of the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. Priestley turned down an opportunity to teach chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania.[157]",
