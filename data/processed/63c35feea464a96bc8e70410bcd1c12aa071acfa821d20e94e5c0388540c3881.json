				"previous": "The Yuezhi are usually identified with the TÃ³kharoi (Î¤Î¿ÏÎ¬ÏÎ¹Î¿Î¹), named by Greek historians among the conquerors of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE.[9] At the beginning of the 20th century, manuscripts were discovered in the northern Tarim Basin written in two hitherto-unknown Indo-European languages dating from the 6th to 8th centuries CE. Believing the authors to be the TÃ³kharoi, Friedrich W. K. MÃ¼ller called these languages the Tocharian languages. Although few scholars now accept MÃ¼ller's identification, \"Tocharian\" remains the standard term for the languages of the Tarim Basin manuscripts and for the people who produced them.[10][11] Although the peoples who overran the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom are known to have spoken Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language, other scholars have argued that the Yuezhi were originally Tocharian-speakers.[12][13] In support of this claim, Christopher Beckwith argues that the character æ, usually read as Old Chinese *ÅÊ·jat > Mod. yuÃ¨,[14] could have been pronounced in an archaic northwestern dialect as *tokwar or *togwar, a form that resembles the Bactrian name ToÏÎ¿Î±Ï (ToÏwar ~ TuÏwar) and the medieval form ToÏar ~ ToÏÃ¢r.[15][16]",
				"after": "The Yuezhi are described in detail in Chinese historical accounts, in particular the 2ndâ1st century BCE Records of the Great Historian, or Shiji, by Sima Qian:[1]",
