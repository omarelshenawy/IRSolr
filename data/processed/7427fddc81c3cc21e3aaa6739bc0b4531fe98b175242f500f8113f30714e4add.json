				"previous": "In 1946, a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert in the Mongolian ÃmnÃ¶govi Province turned up a large theropod skull and some vertebrae in the Nemegt Formation. In 1955, Evgeny Maleev, a Soviet paleontologist, made this specimen the holotype (PIN 551-1) of a new species, which he called Tyrannosaurus bataar.[9] The specific name is a misspelling of the Mongolian Ð±Ð°Ð°ÑÐ°Ñ/baatar (\"hero\").[5] In the same year, Maleev also described and named three new theropod skulls, each associated with skeletal remains discovered by the same expedition in 1948 and 1949. The first of these (PIN 551-2) was named Tarbosaurus efremovi, a new generic name composed of the Ancient Greek ÏÎ±ÏÎ²Î¿Ï/tarbos (\"terror\", \"alarm\", \"awe\", or \"reverence\") and ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï/sauros (\"lizard\"),[14] and the species named after Ivan Yefremov, a Russian paleontologist and science fiction author. The other two (PIN 553-1 and PIN 552-2) were also named as new species and assigned to the North American genus Gorgosaurus (G. lancinator and G. novojilovi, respectively). All three of these latter specimens are smaller than the first.[1]",
				"after": "A 1965 paper by A.K. Rozhdestvensky recognized all of Maleev's specimens as different growth stages of the same species, which he believed to be distinct from the North American Tyrannosaurus. He created a new combination, Tarbosaurus bataar, to include all the specimens described in 1955 as well as newer material.[15] Later authors, including Maleev himself,[16] agreed with Rozhdestvensky's analysis, although some used the name Tarbosaurus efremovi rather than T. bataar.[17] American paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the material in 1992. He concluded that it belonged to the genus Tyrannosaurus, as originally published by Maleev, and lumped all the specimens into the species Tyrannosaurus bataar except the remains that Maleev had named Gorgosaurus novojilovi. Carpenter thought this specimen represented a separate, smaller genus of tyrannosaurid, which he called Maleevosaurus novojilovi.[10] George Olshevsky created the new generic name Jenghizkhan (after Genghis Khan) for Tyrannosaurus bataar in 1995, while also recognizing Tarbosaurus efremovi and Maleevosaurus novojilovi, for a total of three distinct, contemporaneous genera from the Nemegt Formation.[18] A 1999 study subsequently reclassified Maleevosaurus as a juvenile Tarbosaurus.[19] All research published since 1999 recognizes only a single species, which is either called Tarbosaurus bataar[4][8][20] or Tyrannosaurus bataar.[7]",
