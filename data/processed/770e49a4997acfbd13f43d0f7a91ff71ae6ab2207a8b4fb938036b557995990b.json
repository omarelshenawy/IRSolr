				"after": "Condors begin to look for a mate when they reach sexual maturity at the age of six.[37] To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display, in which the male turns his head red and puffs out his neck feathers. He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. If the female lowers her head to accept the male, the condors become mates for life.[40] The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. A mated female lays one bluish-white egg every other year. Eggs are laid as early as January to as late as April.[43] The egg weighs about 280Â g (10Â oz) and measures from 90â120Â mm (3.5â4.75Â in.) in length and about 67Â mm (2.6Â in.) in width. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, the parents \"double clutch\", or lay another egg to take the lost one's place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for puppet-rearing; this induces the parents to lay a second egg, which the condors are sometimes allowed to raise.[44]",
