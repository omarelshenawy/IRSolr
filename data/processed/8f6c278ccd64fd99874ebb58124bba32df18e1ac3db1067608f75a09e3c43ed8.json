				"after": "Inglis was involved with the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps (CUOTC), being commissioned a second lieutenant on 24 May 1909.[20] He served with the CUOTC's engineering detachment and noticed that when the unit was deployed on field days with the rest of the force it often had little to do.[7] To remedy this, Inglis designed a reusable steel bridge, with the intention that it could be erected and dismantled by the unit in a single afternoon.[7] An army general who was inspecting the unit noticed his design and offered advice: \"If you're making anything for the army, keep it simpleÂ â no complicated gadgets\".[2][7] Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Inglis volunteered for active service in the British Army and was officially listed as an Assistant Instructor in the School of Military Engineering, with the temporary rank of lieutenant.[21] The army expressed interest in Inglis' bridge design; it was approved for use by a panel of army officers that included the general who had first commented on the design, to whom Inglis said \"I hope, Sir, you will find I have profited by your advice\".[7] The design remained in service with the British Army until the higher-capacity Bailey bridge was introduced during the Second World War.[22][23]",
