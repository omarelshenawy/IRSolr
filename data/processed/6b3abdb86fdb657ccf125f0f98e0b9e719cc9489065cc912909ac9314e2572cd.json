				"previous": "In addition to the compounds where a noble gas atom is involved in a covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949,[42] consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained.[43] Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.[44]",
				"after": "Noble gases can form endohedral fullerene compounds, in which the noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. In 1993, it was discovered that when C 60, a spherical molecule consisting of 60Â carbonÂ atoms, is exposed to noble gases at high pressure, complexes such as He@C 60 can be formed (the @ notation indicates He is contained inside C 60 but not covalently bound to it).[45] As of 2008, endohedral complexes with helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon have been obtained.[46] These compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of the noble gas atom.[47]",
