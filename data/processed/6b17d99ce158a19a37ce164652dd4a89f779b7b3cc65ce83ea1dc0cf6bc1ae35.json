Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDS) maintained one-party rule under a continual state of emergency.[50] His government received support from the West and aid from the United States by its suppression of Islamic militants and peace with Israel.[50] Mubarak was often compared to an Egyptian pharaoh by the media and some critics, due to his authoritarian rule.[51] He was in the 30th year of his reign when the Revolution of 2011 began.[52]",
