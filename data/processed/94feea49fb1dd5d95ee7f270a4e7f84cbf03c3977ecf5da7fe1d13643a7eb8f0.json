Thirty thousand people were evicted between 1840 and 1880 alone, many of them forced to emigrate to the New World.[2][71] For example, the settlement of Lorgill on the west coast of Duirinish was cleared on 4 August 1830. Every crofter under the age of seventy was removed and placed on board the Midlothian on threat of imprisonment, with those over that age being sent to the poorhouse.[72] The \"Battle of the Braes\" involved a demonstration against a lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices. The incident involved numerous crofters and about 50 police officers. This event was instrumental in the creation of the Napier Commission, which reported in 1884 on the situation in the Highlands. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 Crofters' Act and on one occasion 400 marines were deployed on Skye to maintain order.[73] The ruins of cleared villages can still be seen at Lorgill, Boreraig and Suisnish in Strath Swordale,[72][74] and Tusdale on Minginish.[68][75]",
