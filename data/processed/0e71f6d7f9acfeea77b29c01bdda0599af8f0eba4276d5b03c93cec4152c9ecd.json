				"previous": "The electrical system of the first flight test aircraft was successfully powered up in March 2013 and tests on the static test airframe proceeded satisfactorily and on schedule.[66]",
				"after": "In June 2013, due to upgrades of the aircraft's software and final ground testing, Bombardier shifted the timeline for the first flight into July 2013.[67] On 24 July 2013, due to a longer than expected system integration process, the first flight was delayed into \"the coming weeks\".[68] On 30 August 2013, Bombardier received the flight test permit from Transport Canada, granting permission to perform high speed taxi testing and flight testing.[1] As Bombardier planned,[69] a CS100 took the maiden flight for the model and the CSeries on 16 September 2013 from Mirabel Airport north of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.[70][71] Over 14,000 data points were gathered on this first flight, and after some reconfigurations and software upgrades, the aircraft flew for the second time on 1 October 2013.[72]",
