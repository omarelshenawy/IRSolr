				"previous": "Later that year, South African Airways made a successful bid for a 49% stake in Air Tanzania. The move highlighted SAA's wish to gain a foothold in the East African region. The bid was worth $20Â million, and was SAA's first acquisition of a foreign airline.[43][44] The merger failed in 2006 when new SAA management felt that the arrangement was a fruitless mistake made by previous SAA managers.[45]",
				"after": "In 1999, South African Airways and Delta Air Lines started codesharing on flights from Atlanta to South Africa. Those flights took place on South African Airways planes. 2000 saw South African Airways jets arrive at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.",
