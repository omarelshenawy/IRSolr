The stone, which is of greyish granite measuring 2Â m (6Â ft 7Â in) in height and 1.2Â m (3Â ft 11Â in) in width,[32] is raised on a slope some 100Â m (330Â ft) north of HÃ¤gerstalund farm, formerly Hansta(lund). The stone was discovered by Johan PeringskiÃ¶ld during the national search for historic monuments in the late 17th century. The stone shares the same message as U 72, together with which it once formed a monument,[32] but U 72 was moved to Skansen in 1896.[33] The latter stone relates that \"these stones\" were raised by GerÃ°arr and JÃ¶rundr in memory of Ernmundr and Ingimundr. Consequently, U 73's phrase \"Inga's sons\" and \"they died in Greece\" refer to Ernmundr and Ingimundr.[32] Ernmundr and Ingimundr had inherited from their father, but they departed for the Byzantine Empire and died there as Varangians. As they had not fathered any children, their mother Inga inherited their property, and when she died, her brothers GerÃ°arr and JÃ¶rundr inherited from her. These two brothers then raised the two memorials in honour of their nephews, which was probably due to the nephews having distinguished themselves in the South. However, it may have also been in gratitude for wealth gathered by the nephews overseas. At the same time, the monument served to document how the property had passed from one clan to another.[32][34] Sawyer (2000), on the other hand, suggests that because the two inscriptions do not mention who commissioned them, the only eventual claimant to the fortune, and the one that had the stones made, may have been the church.[35] The runemaster has been identified as VisÃ¤te.[31]",
