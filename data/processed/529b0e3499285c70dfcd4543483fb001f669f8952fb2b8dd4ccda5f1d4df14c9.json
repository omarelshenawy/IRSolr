				"previous": "One of the first properties of Z that can fail in the ring of integers O of an algebraic number field K is that of the unique factorization of integers into prime numbers. The prime numbers in Z are generalized to irreducible elements in O, and though the unique factorization of elements of O into irreducible elements may hold in some cases (such as for the Gaussian integers Z[i]), it may also fail, as in the case of Z[â-5] where",
				"after": "The ideal class group of O is a measure of how much unique factorization of elements fails; in particular, the ideal class group is trivial if, and only if, O is a unique factorization domain.",
