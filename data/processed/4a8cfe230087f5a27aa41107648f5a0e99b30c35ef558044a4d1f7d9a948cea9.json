				"after": "The Diocese of Moray was a regional bishopric unlike the pre-eminent see of the Scottish church, St Andrews, which had evolved from a more ancient monastic Celtic church and administered scattered localities.[3] It is uncertain whether there were bishops of Moray before c. 1120 [4] but the first known prelateâpossibly later translated to Dunkeldâwas Gregory (or Gregoir). He was probably bishop in name only, with the first resident diocesan being Richard of Lincoln.[5] Gregory was a signatory to the foundation charter of Scone Priory, issued by Alexander I (Alaxandair mac MaÃ­l Choluim) between December 1123 and April 1124,[6] and again in a charter defining the legal rights of the same monastery.[7] He is recorded for the last time when he witnessed a charter granted by David I to Dunfermline Abbey in c. 1128.[8] After the suppression of Ãengus of Moray's rebellion in 1130, King David must have regarded the continued presence of bishops in Moray as essential to the stability of the province.[9][10] These early bishops had no settled location for their cathedral, and sited it successively at the churches of Birnie, Kinneddar and Spynie.[11] Pope Innocent III issued an apostolic bull on 7 April 1206 that allowed bishop Bricius de Douglas to fix his cathedral church at Spynieâits inauguration was held between spring 1207 and summer 1208.[12] A chapter of five dignitaries and three ordinary canons was authorised and based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral.[13] Elgin became the lay centre of the province under David I, who probably established the first castle in the town,[10][14] and it may have been this castle, with its promise of better security, that prompted Bricius, before July 1216, to petition the Pope to move the seat from Spynie.[15]",
