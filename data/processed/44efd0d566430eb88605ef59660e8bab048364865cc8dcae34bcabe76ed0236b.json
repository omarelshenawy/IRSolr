Public parks exist along most of the shore line, with free electric barbecue facilities, fenced-in swimming areas, picnic tables and toilets.[52] These parklands form a large part of the area around the lake, and occupy 3.139Â km2 (776 acres) in total.[50] Some of the parks reserved for public recreation include Commonwealth, Weston, Kings and Grevillea Parks, Lennox Gardens and Commonwealth Place.[52] Commonwealth and Kings Park on the northern shore of the Central Basin are among the two most popular. The former is an urban horticultural park and is the location of the Canberra Festival.[14] Commonwealth Park is the location of Floriade, an annual flower festival that is held for around a month in spring and attracts upwards of 300,000 visitors,[103] a number comparable to the city population. The largest flower festival in Australia,[104] the event is a major tourist attraction for the city, and legal action was threatened after another festival in Australia wanted to use the same name.[105] An expansion is being planned to coincide with the centenary of the national capital.[106] The Weston Park to the west is known for its woodland and conifers, while Black Mountain Peninsula is known as a picnicking site with eucalypts.[14] Grevillea and Bowen Parks on the East Basin tend to be little used.[78]",
