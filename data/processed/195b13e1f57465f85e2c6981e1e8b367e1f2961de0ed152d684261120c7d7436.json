				"after": "Airbus Industrie was formally established as a Groupement d'IntÃ©rÃªt Ãconomique (Economic Interest Group or GIE) on 18 December 1970.[13] It had been formed by a government initiative between France, Germany and the UK that originated in 1967. Its initial shareholders were the French company AÃ©rospatiale and the German company Deutsche Airbus, each owning a 50% share. The name \"Airbus\" was taken from a non-proprietary term used by the airline industry in the 1960s to refer to a commercial aircraft of a certain size and range, for this term was acceptable to the French linguistically. AÃ©rospatiale and Deutsche Airbus each took a 36.5% share of production work, Hawker Siddeley 20% and the Dutch company Fokker-VFW 7%.[10] Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly items. In October 1971 the Spanish company CASA acquired a 4.2% share of Airbus Industrie, with AÃ©rospatiale and Deutsche Airbus reducing their stakes to 47.9%.[10] In January 1979 British Aerospace, which had absorbed Hawker Siddeley in 1977, acquired a 20% share of Airbus Industrie.[15] The majority shareholders reduced their shares to 37.9%, while CASA retained its 4.2%.[16]",
