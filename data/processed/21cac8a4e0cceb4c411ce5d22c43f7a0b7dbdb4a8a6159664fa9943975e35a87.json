The walks give school groups, scouting organizations, and other visitors a close and informed look at natural wetlands, old-growth forests, waterfalls, flora and fauna, and geologic formations.[3] Other programs are held in the park office, on topics such as safety around wild animals.[111] In summer and fall, park educators lead \"Ghost Town Walks\" to the ruins of the lumber village of Ricketts and to adjoining State Game Lands.[36]",
