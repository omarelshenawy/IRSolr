				"As it has a 33% larger landmass than the North Island it is often known as the \"mainland\"; however, only 23% of New Zealand's 4.5 million inhabitants live in the South Island. In the early stages of European (PÄkehÄ) settlement of the country, the South Island had the majority of the European population and wealth due to the 1860s gold rushes. The North Island population overtook the South in the early 20th century, with 56% of the population living in the North in 1911, and the drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the century.[2]"

The drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old, and portray animals, people and fantastic creatures, possibly stylised reptiles.[4] Some of the birds pictured are long extinct, including moa and Haast's eagles. They were drawn by early MÄori, but by the time Europeans arrived, local MÄori did not know the origins of the drawings.[5]",
