				"The shape of the airfoil is defined using the following geometrical parameters:",
				"Some important parameters to describe an airfoil's shape are its camber and its thickness. For example, an airfoil of the NACA 4-digit series such as the NACA 2415 (to be read as 2 - 4 - 15) describes an airfoil with a camber of 0.02 chord located Ã  0.40 chord, with 0.15 chord of maximum thickness."
