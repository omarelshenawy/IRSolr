				"previous": "The great majority of first-person computer games up until the late 1980s were turn-based, though a few had attempted to incorporated real-time elements, such as Dungeons of Daggorath and the 1985 game Alternate Reality: The City. Most first-person computer RPGs at the time, used turn-based movement, where if the party didn't move, neither did the enemies, though The Bard's Tale in 1985 attempted to generate random encounters when the player is away from the keyboard to give the impression that monsters weren't just waiting for players to stumble across them. In late 1987, FTL Games released Dungeon Master, a critically acclaimed dungeon crawler where the game world and combat was in real-time, requiring players to quickly issue orders to the characters, setting the standard for real-time first-person computer RPGs for the next several years.[2] Dungeon Master achieved the number-one sales rank in both the U.S. and Japan, where it was released in 1990.[citation needed] Other real-time first-person RPGs in the style of Dungeon Master include SSI's Eye of the Beholder (1990) and Raven Software's Black Crypt (1992).",
				"after": "Arsys Software released Star Cruiser for the NEC PC-8801 computer in early 1988. This innovative game is notable for being a very early example of an action RPG with fully 3D polygonal graphics,[96] combined with first-person shooter gameplay.[97] It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990.[97] That same year, Alpha Denshi's Crossed Swords for the arcades combined the first-person beat 'em up gameplay of SNK's The Super Spy (released the same year) with RPG elements, while replacing the first-person shooting with hack & slash combat.[91] In 1992, Blue Sky Productions released Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss, which was considered a technological marvel for its 3D first-person ray casting graphics combined with real-time action and a surprisingly deep role-playing experience. One of the game's developers, Warren Spector, would go on to help develop more games combining first-person action and RPG gameplay, such as System Shock and Deus Ex.",
