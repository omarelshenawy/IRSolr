				"previous": "As part of the Air Force's FY 2015 budget, the F-15C faces cuts or retirement in response to sequestration. Cuts are principally directed at platforms with single-mission capabilities. The retirement of some 250 F-15C fighters would save maintenance and upgrade costs, which could be redirected to speed procurement of the F-35 Lightning II. The air-to-air combat role would be taken up preeminently by the F-22 Raptor, while the F-35 would support it in conjunction with the Raptor. Even if this option is pursued, at least part of the F-15C fleet is likely to be preserved.[88][89] The Air Force's FY 2015 budget proposal would reduce the F-15C fleet by 51 aircraft.[90]",
				"after": "Twelve prototypes were built and used for trials by the F-15 Joint Test Force at Edwards Air Force Base using McDonnell Douglas and United States Air Force personnel. Most prototypes were later used by NASA for trials and experiments.",
