				"previous": "The Keep is 12 metres (39Â ft) in diameter with a square, spurred base; in the 13th century there would have been an adjacent turret, on the south-west side, containing latrines, but few traces remain.[81] There is no evidence that the tower that Burges termed a keep would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower.[81] The Kitchen Tower is also 12 metres (39Â ft) across and rests on a square, spurred base.[82] It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen; Burgess raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys.[82] The walls of these two towers are around 3.0 metres (10Â ft) thick at the base, thinning to 0.61 metres (2Â ft) at the top.[80] The Well Tower at 11.5 metres (38Â ft) in diameter is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower, with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground.[83] The Well Tower lacks the spurs of the other two towers and has a flat rather than curved back, facing onto the courtyard, similar to some of the towers built at Caerphilly by the de Clares.[84]",
				"after": "The towers contribute to what the architectural writer Charles Handley-Read considered the castle's \"sculptural and dramatic exterior\".[85] Almost equal in diameter, but of differing conical roof designs and heights, and topped with copper-gilt weather vanes, they combine to produce a romantic appearance,[3][78][86] which Matthew Williams described as bringing \"a Wagnerian flavor to the Taff Valley\".[87]",
