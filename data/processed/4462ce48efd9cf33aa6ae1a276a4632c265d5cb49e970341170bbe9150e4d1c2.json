				"previous": "By 2001 the number of employees had risen to 490 and the first CRJ700 had been delivered. That year services commenced to Hamburg, Hanover[19] and Marseille.[20] Meanwhile British Airways was building up operates at Birmingham Airport through two other franchise agreements, with Brymond Airways and British Regional Airlines. The franchise agreement with Maersk, set to expire on 24 March 2001, was extended that month through the summer season. This spurred speculation that Maersk would abandon the franchising agreement.[21] However, in August a five-year extension was signed.[22]",
				"after": "From May 2002 Maersk Air commenced three new routes, to Bordeaux, Nice, Toulouse, all in France.[23] By then the first two CRJ700s had been delivered, while the number of 737-500s was reduced to three. Services also commenced to Gothenburg, but by then the services to Brussels, Frankfurt, Newcastle, Rome and ZÃ¼rich had been terminated.[24]",
