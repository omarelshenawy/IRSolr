				"previous": "Unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only in a handful of galaxies;[23] these include the Milky Way, the Local Group galaxies M31 and M32, and a few galaxies beyond the Local Group, e.g. NGC 4395. In these galaxies, the mean square (or rms) velocities of the stars or gas rises as ~1/r near the center, indicating a central point mass. In all other galaxies observed to date, the rms velocities are flat, or even falling, toward the center, making it impossible to state with certainty that a supermassive black hole is present.[23] Nevertheless it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole.[24] The reason for this assumption is the M-sigma relation, a tight (low scatter) relation between the mass of the hole in the ~10 galaxies with secure detections, and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulges of those galaxies.[25] This correlation, although based on just a handful of galaxies, suggests to many astronomers a strong connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself.[24]",
				"after": "The nearby Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, contains a (1.1â2.3) Ã 108 (110-230 million) Mâ central black hole, significantly larger than the Milky Way's.[26] The largest supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's vicinity appears to be that of M87, weighing in at (6.4 Â± 0.5) Ã 109 (~6.4 billion) Mâ at a distance of 53.5 million light-years.[27][28] On 5 December 2011 astronomers discovered the largest supermassive black hole in the nearby universe yet found, that of the supergiant elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, weighing in at 2.1Ã1010 (21 billion) Mâ at a distance of 336 million light-years away in the Coma Berenices constellation.[29] Meanwhile, the supergiant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Phoenix Cluster hosts a black hole of 2.0Ã1010 (20 billion) Mâ at a distance of 5.7 billion light years. Black holes in quasars are much larger, due to their active state of continuous growing phase. The hyperluminous quasar APM 08279+5255 has a supermassive black hole with a mass of 2.3Ã1010 (23 billion) Mâ. Larger still is at another hyperluminous quasar S5 0014+81, the largest supermassive black hole yet found, which weighs in at 4.0Ã1010 (40 billion) Mâ, or 10,000 times the size of the black hole at the Milky Way Galactic Center. Both quasars are 12.1 billion light years away.",
