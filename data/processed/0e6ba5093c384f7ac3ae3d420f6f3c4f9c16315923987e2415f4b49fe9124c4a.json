This figure is facing to the right, kneeling on one knee with both hands raised. The sculpture was found near the riverbank at a crossing point of the river IxchayÃ¡, some 300 metres (980Â ft) to the west of the Central Group. It measures about 1.5 metres (59Â in) in height. MonumentÂ 1 dates to the Middle Preclassic and is distinctively Olmec in style.[129]",
