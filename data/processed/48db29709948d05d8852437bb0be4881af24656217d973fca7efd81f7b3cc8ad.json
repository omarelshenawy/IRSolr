				"previous": "New York's initial electoral vote certificate indicated that all of its 31 electoral votes for president were cast for \"John L. Kerry of Massachusetts\" instead of John F. Kerry, who won the popular vote in the state.[41] This was apparently the result of a typographical error, and an amended electoral vote certificate with the correct middle initial was transmitted to the President of the Senate prior to the official electoral vote count.[42]",
