				"previous": "At the moment, as far as we know, there is no program satisfying all these points. Anyway the members of the project made a list with several programs that have been used for drawing circuits on Wikipedia. Each program has a short comment and an example of its output; this list is at programs for drawing circuits. The only way to get a circuit in SVG format without drawing everything from scratch is using Xcircuit; for more info see How to draw SVG circuits using Xcircuit.",
				"after": "There is an image on commons specially intended to help drawing SVG circuits simple, fast and flexible. Just open this image in any common vector editor (e.g. Inkscape), copy, place and join the components as you wish. This technique produces nice and small SVG images. Except for 6th it achieves all the wishes mentioned above.",
