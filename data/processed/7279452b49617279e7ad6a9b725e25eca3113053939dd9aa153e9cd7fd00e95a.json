				"previous": "Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine successfully installed the beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, depending on the operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took more than an hour on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes.[50] An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.[50]",
				"after": "On 7 January 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials won the Best Free Software award from PC Advisor.[55] In December the same year, it secured the Bronze award from AV-Comparatives for proactive detection of 55Â percent of new or unknown malware, the Silver award for low false-positives (six occurrences) and the Bronze award for overall performance.[56]",
