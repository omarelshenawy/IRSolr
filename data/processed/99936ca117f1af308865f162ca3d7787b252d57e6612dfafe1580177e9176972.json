In many emergencies, it allows the entire airplane to descend safely and has been credited with saving 105 lives to date.[86] There have been no fatalities involving CAPS when deployed within the certified design parameters.[87] Cirrus was the first manufacturer to receive FAA certification for production aircraft with ballistic parachute systems, and remains the only aviation company to implement the device as a standard equipment on all its models.[88]",
