				"after": "In 1967 a larger 119-seat version was introduced as the One-Eleven 500 (also known as Super One-Eleven). This \"stretched\" version was delayed for at least a year while its launch customer BEA assessed its requirements. This gave competing US aircraft (being the Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737) the chance to make up for the One-Eleven's early penetration of the U.S. domestic market. The British aircraft's initial one-year advantage now turned into a one-year delay and the stretched series 500 failed to sell in the United States although the type did see service with Cayman Airways and Leeward Islands Air Transport (LIAT) in the Caribbean. Compared with earlier versions, the One-Eleven 500 was longer by 8Â ft 4in (2.54 m) ahead of the wing and 5Â ft 2in (1.57 m) behind it. The wing span was increased by 5Â ft (1.5 m), and the latest Mk. 512 version of the Spey was used. The new version sold reasonably well across the world, particularly to European charter airlines. In 1971 it received an incremental upgrade to reduce drag and reduce runway requirements.",
