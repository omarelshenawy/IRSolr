				"previous": "The first successful flight test of a Scramjet was performed by Russia in 1991. It was an axisymmetric hydrogen-fueled dual-mode scramjet developed by Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM), Moscow in the late 1970s. The scramjet ï¬ight was ï¬own captive-carry atop the SA-5 surface-to-air missile that included an experiment ï¬ight support unit known as the \"Hypersonic Flying Laboratory\" (HFL), \"Kholod\".[3] Then from 1992 to 1998 an additional 6 flight tests of the axisymmetric high-speed scramjet-demonstrator were conducted by CIAM together with France and then with NASA, USA.[4][5] Maximum flight velocity greater than Mach 6.4 was achieved and Scramjet operation during 77 seconds was demonstrated. These flight test series also provided insight into autonomous hypersonic flight controls.",
				"after": "In the 2000s, significant progress was made in the development of hypersonic technology, particularly in the field of scramjet engines.",
