The building was designed with a private pew for the royal family, elevated on a platform approximately 0.91 metres (3.0Â ft) high and accessed by a short staircase. A private entrance available to the royal family was accessible by a decorative exterior bridge linking the chapel to the raised embankment upon which Manampisoa stood.[61]",
