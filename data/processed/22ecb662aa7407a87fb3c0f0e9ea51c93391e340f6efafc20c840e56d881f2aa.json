				"after": "Manta rays are known for their large size, broad heads, triangular pectoral fins, and the horn-shaped cephalic fins located on either side of their mouths.[11] They have horizontally flattened bodies with eyes on the sides of their heads (behind the cephalic fins) and gill slits on their ventral surfaces.[11][19] Their tails lack skeletal support and are shorter than their disc-like bodies.[19] The dorsal fins are small and at the base of the tail. The largest mantas can reach 1,350Â kg (2,980Â lb).[11] In both species the width is approximately 2.2 times the length of the body; M. birostris reaches at least 7Â m (23Â ft) in width while M. alfredi reaches about 5.5Â m (18Â ft).[20] Dorsally, mantas are typically black or dark in color with pale markings on their \"shoulders\". Ventrally, they are usually white or pale with distinctive dark markings by which individual mantas can be recognized.[9] All black color morphs are known to exist.[19] The skin is covered in mucus which protects it from infection.[21]:2",
