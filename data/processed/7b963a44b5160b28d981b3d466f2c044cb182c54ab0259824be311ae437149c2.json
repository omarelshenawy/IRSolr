				"previous": "Some anarcho-primitivists believe that this concept is used to justify the values of modern industrial society and move individuals further from their natural habitat and natural needs.[44][45] John Zerzan has noted the existence of tribal societies with less violence than \"advanced\" societies.[46] Zerzan and Theodore Kaczynski have talked about other forms of violence against the individual in advanced societies, generally expressed by the term \"social anomie\", that result from the system of monopolized security.[47] These authors do not dismiss the fact that humanity is changing while adapting to its different social realities,[48] but consider the situation anomalous. The two results are (1) that we either disappear or (2) become something very different from what we have come to value in our nature. It has been suggested that this shift towards civilization, through domestication, has caused an increase in diseases, labor, and psychological disorders.[49][50][51] In contrast, Pierre Clastres maintains that violence in primitive societies is a natural way for each community to maintain its political independence, while dismissing the state as a natural outcome of the evolution of human societies.[52]",
