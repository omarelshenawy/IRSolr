				"previous": "Caesium has a total of 39 known isotopes that range in their mass number (i.e. number of nucleons in its nucleus) from 112 to 151. Several of these are synthesized from lighter elements by the slow neutron capture process (S-process) inside old stars,[42] as well as inside supernova explosions (R-process).[43] However, the only stable caesium isotope is 133Cs, which has 78 neutrons. Although it has a large nuclear spin (7â2+), nuclear magnetic resonance studies can be done with this isotope at a resonating frequency of 11.7Â MHz.[44]",
				"after": "The radioactive 135Cs has a very long half-life of about 2.3Â million years, longest of all radioactive isotopes of caesium. 137Cs and 134Cs have half-lives of 30 and two years, respectively. 137Cs decomposes to a short-lived 137mBa by beta decay, and then to nonradioactive barium, while 134Cs transforms into 134Ba directly. The isotopes with mass numbers of 129, 131, 132 and 136, have half-lives between a day and two weeks, while most of the other isotopes have half-lives from a few seconds to fractions of a second. There are at least 21 metastable nuclear isomers. Other than 134mCs (with a half-life of just under 3Â hours), all are very unstable and decay with half-lives of a few minutes or less.[45][46]",
