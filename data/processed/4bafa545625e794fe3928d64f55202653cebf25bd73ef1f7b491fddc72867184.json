				"previous": "Boeing 757â200 and 777-200ER aircraft included Audio-Video On-Demand (AVOD) in every seat back. Boeing 767 family aircraft were equipped with a personal television located in every seat back, using a tape system. On all Boeing 757â200 and Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, all rows were equipped with power-ports (two power ports per group of 3 seats) that do not require special power adapters or cables.[160]",
				"after": "Continental Airlines began offering 95 channels of live DirecTV television to all passengers on its domestic fleet beginning in January 2009.[161] Boeing 737-700s, 800s, 900s, and 900ERs and Boeing 757-300s will receive the service.[162] The service became available immediately after a credit card is swiped and confirmed, and could be activated at any point during the flight. Movies started at a set time and cannot be paused, rewound or fast-forwarded. The service was free to first-class passengers and was available for a charge of US$6 in the coach cabin.[161] Service could become limited and/or interrupted during descent.[162]",
