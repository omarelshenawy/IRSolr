				"after": "Nevirapine (also Viramune) is an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It was the first non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor to be licensed, which occurred in 1996. Like nucleoside inhibitors, nevirapine inhibits HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme, which copies the viral RNA into DNA and is essential for its replication. However, unlike nucleoside inhibitors, it binds not in the enzyme's active site but in a nearby hydrophobic pocket, causing a conformational change in the enzyme that prevents it from functioning. Mutations in this pocket generate resistance to nevirapine, which develops rapidly unless viral replication is completely suppressed. The drug is therefore used together with other anti-HIV drugs in combination therapy called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A single dose of nevirapine is a cost-effective way to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and has been recommended by the World Health Organization for use in resource-poor settings. Rash is the most common adverse event associated with the drug.",
