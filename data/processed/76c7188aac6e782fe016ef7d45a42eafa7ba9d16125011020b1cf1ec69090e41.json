				"after": "The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out. By 1898, the old growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk Tanning Company, was closed and dismantled.[44] Lumbering continued in the watershed, but the last logs were floated down Plunketts Creek to the Loyalsock in 1905.[35] The Susquehanna and Eagles Mere Railroad was abandoned in sections between 1922 and 1930, as the lumber it was built to transport was depleted.[48] The CPL logging railroad and their Masten sawmills were abandoned in 1930.[49] Without timber, the populations of Proctor and Barbours declined. The Barbours post office closed in the 1930s and the Proctor post office closed on July 1, 1953. Both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses.[44][51] Proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968, and a 1970 newspaper article on its thirty-ninth annual \"Proctor Homecoming\" reunion called it a \"near-deserted old tannery town\".[44][45] In the 1980s, the last store in Barbours closed, and the former hotel (which had become a hunting club) was torn down to make way for a new bridge across Loyalsock Creek.[22]",
