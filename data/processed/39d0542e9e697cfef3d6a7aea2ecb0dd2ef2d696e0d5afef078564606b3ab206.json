				"previous": "During construction the underground parking garage remained open.[44] An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating two levels of underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150Â \"outriggers\", or \"tiebacks\", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows for the removal of individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning.[2][45] Crown Fountain's design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, non-discriminatory, barrier-free accessibility, because its interactivity is not limited to the able-bodied. The force of the water accounts for the entire range of possible interactive visitors.[3][9]",
				"after": "Construction of the video sculpture was completed for testing without the fountain's water features on May 18, 2004.[31] Originally, Plensa had planned to have each face appear for 13 minutes,[19] and this continued to be the targeted duration when the testing of the sculpture occurred.[31] Eventually, professors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago convinced him to use only five-minute videos.[19]",
