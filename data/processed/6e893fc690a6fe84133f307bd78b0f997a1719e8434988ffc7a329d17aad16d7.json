				"after": "Plateosaurus had the typical body shape of a herbivorous bipedal dinosaur: a small skull, a long and flexible neck composed of 10 cervical (neck) vertebrae, a stocky body and a long, mobile tail composed of at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae.[1][2][3] The arms of Plateosaurus were very short, even compared to most other \"prosauropods\". However, they were strongly built, with hands adapted for powerful grasping.[2][4] The shoulder girdle was narrow (often misaligned in skeletal mounts and drawings),[4] with the clavicles (collar bones) touching at the body's midline,[2] as in other basal sauropodomorphs.[5] The hind limbs were held under the body, with slightly flexed knees and ankles, and the foot was digitigrade, meaning the animal walked on its toes.[2][6][7] The proportionally long lower leg and metatarsus show that Plateosaurus could run quickly on its hind limbs.[2][4][6][7] The tail of Plateosaurus was typically dinosaurian, muscular and with high mobility.[4]",
