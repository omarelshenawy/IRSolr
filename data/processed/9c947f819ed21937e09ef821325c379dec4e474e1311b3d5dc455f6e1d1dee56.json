				"after": "When ocean waters cool, loggerheads must migrate to warmer areas or hibernate to some degree. In the coldest months, they submerge for up to seven hours at a time, emerging for only seven minutes to breathe. Although outdone by freshwater turtles, these are among the longest recorded dives for any air-breathing marine vertebrate.[54] During their seasonal migration, juvenile loggerheads have the ability to use both magnetic and visual cues.[55] When both aids are available, they are used in conjunction; if one aid is not available, the other suffices.[55] The turtles swim at about 1.6Â km/h (0.9Â kn; 0.4Â m/s) during migration.[56]",
