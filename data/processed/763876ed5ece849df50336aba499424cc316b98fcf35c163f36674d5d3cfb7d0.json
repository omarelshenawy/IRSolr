The annual mean temperature is 26.8Â Â°C (80.2Â Â°F); monthly mean temperatures are 19â30Â Â°C (66â86Â Â°F).[68] Summers (MarchâJune) are hot and humid, with temperatures in the low 30s Celsius; during dry spells, maximum temperatures often exceed 40Â Â°C (104Â Â°F) in May and June.[68] Winter lasts for only about two-and-a-half months, with seasonal lows dipping to 9â11Â Â°C (48â52Â Â°F) in December and January. May is the hottest month, with daily temperatures ranging from 27â37Â Â°C (81â99Â Â°F); January, the coldest month, has temperatures varying from 12â23Â Â°C (54â73Â Â°F). The highest recorded temperature is 43.9Â Â°C (111.0Â Â°F), and the lowest is 5Â Â°C (41Â Â°F).[68] Often, in AprilâJune, the city is struck by heavy rains or dusty squalls followed by thunderstorms or hailstorms, bringing cooling relief from the prevailing humidity. These thunderstorms are convective in nature, and are known locally as kal bÃ´ishakhi (à¦à¦¾à¦²à¦¬à§à¦¶à¦¾à¦à§), or \"Nor'westers\" in English.[69]",
