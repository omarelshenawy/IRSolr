				"previous": "In December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600â64% were Jewish, 32% Muslim, and 2% Christian.[259] At the end of 2005, the population density was 5,750.4/km2 (14,893/sqÂ mi).[260][261] According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews.[262] Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.[263]",
				"after": "In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in.[260] Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.[260]",
