The smaller endowment, totaling $1.17 billion in assets, is run by the private Texas A&M Foundation.[4] A larger sum is distributed from the Texas Permanent University Fund (PUF). TAMUS holds a minority stake (one-third) in this fund; the remaining two-thirds belongs to the University of Texas system. As of 2006, the PUF ending net asset value stood at $10.3Â billion; $400.7Â million was distributed to the two university systems in fiscal year 2007.[75][76] Combined, the total endowment for the TAMUS stands at $7.6Â billion, as of 2012.[4]",
