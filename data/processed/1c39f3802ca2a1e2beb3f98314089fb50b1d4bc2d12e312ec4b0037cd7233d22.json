				"previous": "Germane (GeH4) is a compound similar in structure to methane. Polygermanesâcompounds that are similar to alkanesâwith formula GenH2n+2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known.[32] The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues.[32] GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3â anion.[32] The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.[32]",
				"after": "The first organogermanium compound was synthesized by Winkler in 1887; the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with diethylzinc yielded tetraethylgermane (Ge(C 2H 5) 4).[6] Organogermanes of the type R4Ge (where R is an alkyl) such as tetramethylgermane (Ge(CH 3) 4) and tetraethylgermane are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor germanium tetrachloride and alkyl nucleophiles. Organic germanium hydrides such as isobutylgermane ((CH 3) 2CHCH 2GeH 3) were found to be less hazardous and may be used as a liquid substitute for toxic germane gas in semiconductor applications. Many germanium reactive intermediates are known: germyl free radicals, germylenes (similar to carbenes), and germynes (similar to carbynes).[41][42] The organogermanium compound 2-carboxyethylgermasesquioxane was first reported in the 1970s, and for a while was used as a dietary supplement and thought to possibly have anti-tumor qualities.[43]",
