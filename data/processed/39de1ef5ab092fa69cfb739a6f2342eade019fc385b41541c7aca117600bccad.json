				"previous": "China Eastern Airlines has a strong presence on routes in Asia, North America and Australia. The airline looks to exploit the domestic market potential as it boosts flight frequencies from Shanghai to other Chinese cities. The airline is also accelerating the pace of international expansion by increasing flight frequencies to international destinations. In 2007 it began operations to New York from Shanghai, making it the longest non-stop route for the airline. On 22 November China Eastern Airlines started twice-weekly seasonal flights on the ShanghaiâBrisbane route but these flights didn't continue during 2010/11. Instead, the carrier operated charters to Cairns. On 9 August 2011, China Eastern started services to Honolulu from Shanghai, which marked the first ever direct service between mainland China and Hawaii.[24]",
