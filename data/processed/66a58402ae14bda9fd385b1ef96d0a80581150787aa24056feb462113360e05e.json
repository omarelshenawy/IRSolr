				"previous": "Administratively, the U.S. Virgin Islands are divided into three (3) districts and twenty (20) sub-districts.",
				"after": "While a Danish possession, the Islands were divided into \"quarters\" (five on St. John and nine on St. Croix) which were further divided into many dozens of \"estates\". Estate names are still used to write addresses; estates and quarters are used in describing real estate, especially on St. John[11] and St. Croix.[12] More densely populated towns such as Frederiksted and Christiansted on St. Croix were historically referred to as \"districts\", in contrast to the surrounding plantation land.",
