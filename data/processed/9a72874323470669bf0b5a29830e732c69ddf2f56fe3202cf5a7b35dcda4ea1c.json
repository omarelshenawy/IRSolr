The mansion is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period.[1] The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house;[2] the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes.[3] Only Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.[4]",
