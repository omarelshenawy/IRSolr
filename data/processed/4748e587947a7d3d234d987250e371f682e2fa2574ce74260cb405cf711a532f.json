				"previous": "A white stork pair raises a single brood a year. The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of one to seven have been recorded.[72] The eggs are white, but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering. They measure 72.58Â mm ÃÂ 51.86Â mm (2.857Â in ÃÂ 2.042Â in),[88] and weigh 96â129Â g (3.4â4.6Â oz),[72] of which 10.76Â g (0.380Â oz) is shell.[88] Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the brood hatches asynchronously, beginning 33 to 34Â days later. The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others. While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings, as is the case in some species, weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents.[89][90] This behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. White stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. Despite this, this behaviour has not commonly been observed.[89]",
				"after": "The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important; cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates.[45] Somewhat unexpectedly, studies have found that later-hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier-hatching nestmates.[91] The body weight of the chicks increases rapidly in the first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about 3.4Â kg (7.5Â lb) in 45Â days. The length of the beak increases linearly for about 50Â days.[92] Young birds are fed with earthworms and insects, which are regurgitated by the parents onto the floor of the nest. Older chicks reach into the mouths of parents to obtain food.[93] Chicks fledge 58 to 64Â days after hatching.[94]",
