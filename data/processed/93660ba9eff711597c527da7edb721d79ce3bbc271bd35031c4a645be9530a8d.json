				"after": "From SR 99 to south of Tracy, I-5 is known as the Westside Freeway. It parallels SRÂ 33, skirting along the far more remote western edge of the great Central Valley, and thus here is removed from the major population centers such as Bakersfield, Fresno and Modesto, with other state highways providing connections. I-5 still runs within the vicinity of Avenal, Coalinga, Los Banos, and the handful of other smaller cities on the western edge of the Central Valley. For most of this section, the Path 15 electrical transmission corridor follows the highway, forming an infrastructure corridor along with the California Aqueduct.[citation needed]",
