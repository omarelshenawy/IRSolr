				"previous": "In 1997 Mysore and Bangalore co-hosted the city's biggest sports event ever, the National Games of India. Mysore was the venue for six sports: archery, gymnastics, equestrianism, handball, table tennis and wrestling.[70] Cricket is by far the most popular sport in Mysore.[71][72] The city has four established cricket grounds, but is yet to host an international cricket match.[73] Javagal Srinath, who represented India for several years as its frontline fast bowler, comes from Mysore.[74] Other prominent sportsmen from the city are Prahlad Srinath, who has represented India in Davis Cup tennis tournaments; Reeth Abraham, a national champion in the heptathlon and a long jump record holder; Sagar Kashyap, the youngest Indian to officiate at the Wimbledon Championships; and Rahul Ganapathy, a national amateur golf champion.[75][76][77][78] The Mysore race course hosts a racing season each year from August through October.[79] India's first youth hostel was formed in the Maharaja's College Hostel in 1949.[80]",
