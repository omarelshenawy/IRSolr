				"previous": "The newly formed British Airways had inherited a mix of aircraft from its predecessors. It quickly retired the Standard VC10s that had come from BOAC and the last Vickers Vanguards from BEA.[27][28] It also ordered the Hawker Siddeley 748 for use on Scottish routes to enable the Vickers Viscount to be retired.[27] The first Lockheed L-1011 TriStar was delivered in October 1974, and introduced in January 1975;[29] more TriStars were ordered in following years.[27][30] The management of British Airways resisted political pressure to purchase the new Airbus A300, stating that it had no requirement for the aircraft;[31] this rejection complicated Britain's integration into the European Union.[32] Instead, the company planned to acquire American-made planes such as the Boeing 757;[33] in 1976 the British government approved the purchase of multiple Boeing 737 aircraft.[34] An innovation on 12 January 1975 was the British Airways Shuttle service from Heathrow to Glasgow (and later Edinburgh, Manchester, and Belfast), which allowed a walk-on no reservation service with a \"guaranteed seat\" â this latter feature facilitated by backup aircraft or sometimes transfers to British Midland flights.[27] From its formation in 1974, British Airways aeroplanes carried a Union Flag scheme painted on their tail fins.[35][36]",
				"after": "The Secretary of State for Trade, Peter Shore, reviewed the Government's aviation policy and in 1976 announced a \"spheres of influence\" policy that ended dual designation for British airlines on all long-haul routes.[37][38] British Airways and British Caledonian, the second-biggest airline in Britain, were no longer permitted to run competing scheduled flights on long-haul routes. British Caledonian had to withdraw from East Africa and from the London-New York and London-Los Angeles routes in favour of BA.[39][40] In return, British Caledonian became the sole British flag carrier to the entire South American mainland, taking over routes formerly served by British Airways to Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.[37][41]",
