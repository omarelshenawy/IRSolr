				"previous": "Details of giant otter reproduction and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided much of the information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days.[43] Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation.[3] At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water.[44] Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, with an average of two.[43][44] Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive.[3] Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.[43]",
				"after": "Mothers give birth to furred and blind cubs in an underground den near the river shore and fishing sites.[45] Males actively participate in rearing cubs and family cohesion is strong;[46] older, juvenile siblings also participate in rearing, although in the weeks immediately after birth, they may temporarily leave the group.[43] Pups open their eyes in their fourth week, begin walking in their fifth, and are able to swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks old.[3] They are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after.[43] The animal reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age and both male and female pups leave the group permanently after two to three years.[43][44] They then search for new territory to begin a family of their own.[47]",
