He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history,[1] and is presumed undefeated in battle.[2][3] Renowned for his military leadership and charisma, he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle.[4][5] By conquering the Persian Empire and unifying Greece, Egypt and Babylon, he forged the largest empire of the ancient world[6] and effected the spread of Hellenism throughout Europe and Northern Africa.[7]",
