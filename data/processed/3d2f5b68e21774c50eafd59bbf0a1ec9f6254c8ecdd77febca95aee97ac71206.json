				"previous": "Boeing had considered larger-capacity versions of the 747 several times during the 1990s and 2000s.[5] The 747-500X and -600X, proposed at the 1996 Farnborough Airshow, would have stretched the 747 and used a 777-derived wing,[5] but did not attract enough interest to enter development. In 2000, Boeing offered the 747X and 747X Stretch derivatives as alternatives to the Airbus A3XX. This was a more modest proposal than the previous â500X and â600X. The 747X would increase the 747's wingspan to 229Â ft (69.8Â m) by adding a segment at the root.[6] The 747X was to carry 430 passengers up to 8,700Â nmi (16,100Â km). The 747X Stretch would be extended to 263Â ft (80.2Â m) long, allowing it to carry 500 passengers up to 7,800Â nmi (14,400Â km).[6] However, the 747X family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production. Some of the ideas developed for the 747X were used on the 747-400ER.[7]",
				"after": "After the 747X program, Boeing continued to study improvements to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980Â nmi (14,780Â km), with better fuel efficiency and reduced noise.[8] Changes studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a 'sawtooth' engine nacelle for noise reduction.[9] Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced.",
