				"previous": "Singapore Airlines Suites[42] is a class available only on the Airbus A380. The product was designed by French luxury yacht interior designer Jean-Jacques Coste and consists of separate compartments with walls and doors 1.5 m high. The leather seat, upholstered by Poltrona Frau of Italy, is 35Â in (89Â cm) wide (with armrests up and 23Â in (58Â cm) wide when armrests are down) and a 23Â in (58Â cm) LCD TV screen is mounted on the front wall. The 78Â in (200Â cm) bed is separate from the seat and folds out from the back wall, with several other components of the suite lowering to accommodate the mattress. Windows are built into the doors and blinds offer privacy. Suites located in the center can form a double bed after the privacy blinds between them are retracted into special compartments between the beds and in the frame of the partition.",
