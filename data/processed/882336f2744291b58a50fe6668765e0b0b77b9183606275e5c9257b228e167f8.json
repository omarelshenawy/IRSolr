				"after": "Titanium was discovered included in a mineral in Cornwall, Great Britain, in 1791 by the clergyman and amateur geologist William Gregor, then vicar of Creed parish.[34] He recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite[5] when he found black sand by a stream in the nearby parish of Manaccan and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet.[34] Analysis of the sand determined the presence of two metal oxides: iron oxide (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify.[19] Gregor, realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match the properties of any known element, reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.[34][35]",
