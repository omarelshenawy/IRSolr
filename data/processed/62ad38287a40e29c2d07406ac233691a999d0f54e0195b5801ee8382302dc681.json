				"previous": "The KÄlacakra deity resides in the center of the mandala in his palace consisting of four mandalas, one within the other: the mandalas of body, speech, and mind, and in the very center, wisdom and great bliss.[3] The KÄlacakra sand mandala is dedicated to both individual and world peace and physical balance. The Dalai Lama explains: âIt is a way of planting a seed, and the seed will have karmic effect. One doesnât need to be present at the Kalachakra ceremony in order to receive its benefits.â[citation needed]",
				"after": "The KÄlacakra Tantra is divided into five chapters.[4]",
