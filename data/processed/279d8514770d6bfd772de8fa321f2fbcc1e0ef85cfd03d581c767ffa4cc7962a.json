Falun Gong refers to five sets of meditation exercises (four standing, and one sitting meditation) and spiritual teachings. According to Li, when one cultivates his or her xinxing (mind nature or character), he/she can assimilate to the supreme nature of the universeâTruthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance. In recent years, added emphasis has been placed on the concept of Fa-Rectification.",
