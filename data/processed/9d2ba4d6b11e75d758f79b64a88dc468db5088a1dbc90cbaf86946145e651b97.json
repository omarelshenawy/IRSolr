				"previous": "After its relatively short lifetime in the aircraft role, the JT4A found more enduring use in the naval role, where the FT4 was produced in a variety of models between 18,000 and 22,000Â hp. Well-known uses include the first all-turbine warships, the Canadian Iroquois class destroyers, as well as the United States Coast Guard's Hamilton class cutters, and it was considered for the US Navy's Asheville class gunboat. The same basic powerplant saw much wider use as a peak demand power turbine running on natural gas. From its introduction in 1960 over 1,000 FT4s have been sold, with many of them still in operation for electrical generation. Outdated by modern standards, refits are available that add catalytic converters to lower their emissions.",
