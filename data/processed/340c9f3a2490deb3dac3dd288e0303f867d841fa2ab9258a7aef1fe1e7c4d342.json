				"previous": "The classification theorem of closed surfaces states that any connected closed surface is homeomorphic to some member of one of these three families:",
				"after": "The surfaces in the first two families are orientable. It is convenient to combine the two families by regarding the sphere as the connected sum of 0 tori. The number g of tori involved is called the genus of the surface. The sphere and the torus have Euler characteristics 2 and 0, respectively, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of g tori is 2 â 2g.",
