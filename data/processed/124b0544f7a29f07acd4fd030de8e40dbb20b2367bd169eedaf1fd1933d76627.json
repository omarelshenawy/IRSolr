				"previous": "The building is cantilevered into a section of 420Â million-year-old limestone bedrock 110 feet (34Â m) underground. It uses 4-foot (1.2Â m)-wide stilt-like pillars that were drilled beneath the building. Every 30 feet (9.1Â m) around its perimeter, steel-reinforced concrete was poured into these holes to form the structural support.[10] On top of these caisson shafts and pillars, an 8,400-short-ton (7,600Â t) concrete pad foundation was built to support the building's spine.[10] The building has 241Â caissons, and the majority of the caissons only descend 75 feet (23Â m) into hard clay. However, 57 of them go an additional 35 feet (11Â m) into the ground, including 6 feet (1.8Â m) of bedrock.[1] The concrete spine uses five I-beam-shaped walls and exterior columns, narrowing to two as the building rises. Each floor is separated by a concrete slab, and stainless steel, glass, and aluminum panels are attached to each floor.[10] 50,000 short tons (45,000Â t) of reinforcing steel bars, called rebar, support the hotel.[42][105] The extensive use of concrete makes the building more fireproof. Of the $600Â million construction budget, $130Â million was earmarked for the James McHugh Construction Co, who handled the 180,000-cubic-yard (140,000Â m3) concrete-only portion of the job.[77]",
				"after": "Two earlier business decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings of time and money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus did not have to be broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.[1]",
