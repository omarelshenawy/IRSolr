				"after": "The name 'aileron', from French, meaning 'little wing', also refers to the extremities of a bird's wings used to control their flight.[1][2] It first appeared in print in the 7th edition of Cassell's French-English Dictionary of 1877, with its lead meaning of \"small wing\".[3] In the context of powered airplanes it appears in print about 1908. Prior to that, ailerons were often referred to as rudders, their older technical sibling, with no distinction between their orientations and functions, or more descriptively as horizontal rudders (in French, gouvernails horizontaux). Among the earliest printed aeronautical use of 'aileron' was that in the French aviation journal L'AÃ©rophile of 1908.[4]",
