				"after": "Stanford Memorial Church has suffered two major earthquakes, in 1906 and in 1989. Although extensively damaged, the church was restored after each. The 1906 quake wrecked much of the church, felled the spire, cracked the walls, and \"injured beyond repair\" the mosaics and Carrara marble statuary in the chancel.[18] The main cause of the severity of the damage was that the church's original construction failed to attach the crossing structure to the surrounding masonry and roof structures.[19] The result was that when the tower swayed in the earthquake, it pushed against the walls and roofs of the nave, transepts and chancel, causing the walls to move and the roof of the nave to be forced towards the gable of the facade.[20] The upper north face of the building was affected by the movement of the nave roof against the gable and fell forward into the Inner Quad courtyard,[20] \"its wondrous mosaic was blown out and totally destroyed\".[18]",
