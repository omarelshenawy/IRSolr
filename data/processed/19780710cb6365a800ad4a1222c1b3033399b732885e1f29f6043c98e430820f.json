The laws in Slovenia and Finland are expected to take effect in 2015 and on 1 March 2017, respectively. In the United States, same-sex marriages are recognized on the federal level, and same-sex couples can marry in thirty-six of the fifty states, in St. Louis (Missouri), in the District of Columbia. In Mexico, same-sex marriages are only performed regularly in Mexico City, Quintana Roo and Coahuila, but these marriages are recognized by all Mexican states and by the Mexican federal government.[79] Israel does not recognize same-sex marriages performed on their territory. Same-sex marriages performed in foreign jurisdictions are recorded strictly 'for statistical purposes', thereby avoiding official recognition of same-sex marriages by the state.[80]",
