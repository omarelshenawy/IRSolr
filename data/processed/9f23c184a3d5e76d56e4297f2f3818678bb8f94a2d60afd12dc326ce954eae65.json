				"previous": "Completed in 1908 at a cost of $50,000, this pagoda was intended to be the hotel/restaurant centerpiece of a luxury resort. When plans for the rest of the resort were abandoned, the 7-story wooden building on 10 acres (4.0Â ha) of land was donated to Reading in 1911. It is now part of the Mount Penn Reserve, 1,595 acres (645Â ha) of municipally-owned land.[2]",
				"after": "The Pagoda is 28 feet (8.5Â m) wide, 50 feet (15Â m) long, and 72 feet (22Â m) tall. Perched on the edge of a cliff, 620 feet (190Â m) above the city and 886 feet (270Â m) above sea level,[3] it offers a 30-mile (48Â km) panoramic view of the city and the surrounding countryside.[4]",
