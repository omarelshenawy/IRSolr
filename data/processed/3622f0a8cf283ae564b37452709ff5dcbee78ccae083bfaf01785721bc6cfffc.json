				"previous": "Most local bus services are run by More Bus who are based at the town's bus station and have served Poole since 1983.[124] More Bus operate networks across Poole, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Salisbury, in addition to operations on the Isle of Purbeck and the New Forest.[124] Other services are run by Bournemouth-based Yellow Buses and Damory Coaches.[125] Poole is connected to towns and villages along the Jurassic Coast by the First X53 service, which runs along a route of 142 kilometres (88Â mi) to Weymouth, Bridport, Lyme Regis, Seaton and Exeter.[125] Poole is also a calling point for National Express Coaches, which have frequent departures to London Victoria Coach Station. There are also direct services to the Midlands, the North of England and to Heathrow and Gatwick airports.[126]",
				"after": "Poole has four railway stations on the South Western Main Line from London Waterloo to Weymouth. From east to west these are Branksome near the border with Bournemouth, Parkstone, Poole railway station in the town centre and Hamworthy. Services are operated by South West Trains and consist of up to three trains an hour (fast, semi-fast and stopping services) to and from London, and twice an hour to and from Weymouth.[127] Plans for a Â£50Â million redevelopment of Poole railway station have stalled since 2006 due to contractual issues between land owners Network Rail and developers the Kier Group.[128]",
