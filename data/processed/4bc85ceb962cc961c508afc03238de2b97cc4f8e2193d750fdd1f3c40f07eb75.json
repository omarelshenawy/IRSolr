				"previous": "Independence was declared on 25 June 1991. Following that, Adria was facing an entirely new set of circumstances. On 28 June 1991, Yugoslav Federal Air Force attacked Adriaâs hangar, causing serious damage to 4 aircraft, building and vehicles. An Airbus A320, less than a year old, was heavily damaged and was flown to Toulouse later that year for almost a year of repairs. In addition, two Dash-7 and 1 DC-9-30 were damaged as well, while other planes escaped damage after being flown just hours earlier to the nearest airport of Klagenfurt. Adria was very handicapped that year because of the insurance and registration issues.[4][12]",
				"after": "In 1991 Adria had 13 aircraft; three Airbus A320, four MD-82, one MD-81, three DC-9-30 and two Dash-7. An additional two Airbus A320 that had been ordered to be delivered in June 1991, were sold to other airlines.",
