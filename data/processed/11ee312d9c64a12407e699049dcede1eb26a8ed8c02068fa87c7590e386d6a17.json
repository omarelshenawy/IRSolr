				"after": "The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. Encyclopaedia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[333][334][335] Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, \"The amorality of Web 2.0\", that criticized websites with user-generated content, like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote: \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\"[336] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, wrote in Nature that the \"wisdom of crowds\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals, with their rigorous peer review process.[337]",
