Kamin notes that these views are \"more intimate\" than the panoramic ones of the Signature Room, a restaurant near the top of the Hancock Center.[32] The views are described as equally impressive by day and by night.[37] The main part of the procession is the Tower Room, a dining room with a 30-foot (9.1Â m) dome-shaped ceiling made of West African wood. The dome is furnished with Swarovski chandeliers[38][39] and incorporates mirrors so that all diners can experience the view.[35] The Terrace, whose opening was reported on Reuters,[40] has views of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan as well as Navy Pier's seasonal Wednesday and Saturday evening fireworks, and was designed for outdoor or \"al fresco\" dining.[41] Located on the mezzanine level, the hotel bar named Rebar bar opened on April 18, 2008.[42]",
