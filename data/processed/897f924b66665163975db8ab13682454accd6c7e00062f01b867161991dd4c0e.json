				"after": "The Trait du Nord is an endangered breed; the Haras de CompiÃ¨gne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, had a major influence in saving the breed,[5] until it was closed in October 2009.[30] The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented,[5] and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.[13]",
