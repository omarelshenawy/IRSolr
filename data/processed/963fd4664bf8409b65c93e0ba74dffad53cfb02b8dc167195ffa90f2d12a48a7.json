Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the rest of the radiative zone.[65] Through most of the Sun's life, energy is produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through a series of steps called the pâp (protonâproton) chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.[68] Only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from the CNO cycle, though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun gets older.[69]",
