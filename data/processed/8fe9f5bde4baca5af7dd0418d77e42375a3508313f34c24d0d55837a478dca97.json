				"previous": "Sir Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110-foot (34-meter) wingspan that was powered by two 360-horsepower (270-kW) steam engines driving two propellers. In 1894, his machine was tested with overhead rails to prevent it from rising. The test showed that it had enough lift to take off. The craft was uncontrollable, which Maxim, it is presumed, realized, because he subsequently abandoned work on it.[14]",
				"after": "The Wright brothers' flights in 1903 are recognized by the FÃ©dÃ©ration AÃ©ronautique Internationale (FAI), the standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics, as \"the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight\".[15] By 1905, the Wright Flyer III was capable of fully controllable, stable flight for substantial periods.",
