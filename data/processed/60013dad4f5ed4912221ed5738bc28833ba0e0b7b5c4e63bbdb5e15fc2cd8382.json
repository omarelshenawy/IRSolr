				"previous": "In 2009, Vietnam Airlines and the Government of Cambodia established a joint-venture, having 49% and 51% stockholding, respectively,[68] with the goal of boosting tourism in Cambodia.[69][70] The joint-venture was a new Cambodian national airline named Cambodia Angkor Air, which started flying in July the same year,[71] using ATR-72 equipment;[68] an Airbus A321 joined the fleet in September.[70] Also in 2009, the carrier signed a deal for another 16 Airbus A321s plus two Airbus A350s, during the Paris Air Show.[72][73] In addition, Vietnam Airlines launched a new bilingual website in October to simplify bookings[74] and adopted a new passenger service system designed by IT provider Sabre Airline Solutions.[75]",
				"after": "On 26 August 2010, the airline teamed up with Boeing during the unveiling of its interior modernization programme to increase passenger comfort.[76] From late September to early October, Vietnam Airlines discounted up to 85% of its 90,000 fares to celebrate Thang Long-Hanoi's 1000th anniversary.[77] In November 2010, the airline awarded Honeywell a US$100Â million contract to retrofit the Airbus A321s' aircraft flight systems, which is calculated to save Vietnam Airlines US$10,000 per aircraft per year.[78][79]",
