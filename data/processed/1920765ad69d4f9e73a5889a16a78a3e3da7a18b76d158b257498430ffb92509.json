				"after": "Chapter one describes contemporary Paganism and defines \"the otherworld\". It discusses London's magical and Pagan subculture in the 1990s, and Greenwood's relationship with it. Admitting to being an \"insider\", she explores her mixed feelings at being both a practicing Pagan and an anthropological observer.[9] The second chapter examines the community's conceptions of the otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings of it as a realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.[10]",
