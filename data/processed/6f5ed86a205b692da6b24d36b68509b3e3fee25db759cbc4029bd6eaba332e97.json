				"previous": "A citizen of the United States is an \"American\". \"United States\", \"American\" and \"U.S.\" refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S.Â forces\"). \"American\" rarely refers to subjects not connected with the United States.[46]",
				"after": "The first North American settlers migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge approximately 15,000 or more years ago.[21][47][48] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. After European explorers and traders made the first contacts, the native population declined for various reasons, including diseases such as smallpox and measles,[49][50] and violence.[51][52][53]",
