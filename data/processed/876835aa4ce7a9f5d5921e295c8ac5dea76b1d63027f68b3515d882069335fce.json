				"previous": "The village sent 61Â men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30Â percent of the village population of 1911.[nb 4][39] Two villagers won Distinguished Conduct Medals.[40][41] Thirteen villagersâover sixÂ percent of the villageâdied at battles including La Cateau, Second Battle of Ypres, Gallipoli Campaign, Battle of the Somme, and the Battle of Arras.[nb 5][42]",
				"after": "One of the thatched houses in Little Thetford was destroyed by fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, the cause of the fire at the c.Â 13th-century six-room building was not known. Fireworks were being discharged at the other end of the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its thatched roof.[43]",
