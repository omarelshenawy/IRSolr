				"previous": "In 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a \"banquet\" in the House of Commons with well-known campaigners, including Arnold Lupton, who had been both a Member of Parliament and had also endured imprisonment for \"passive resistance to military or naval service\".[102]",
				"after": "In August 1920 Russell travelled to Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the Russian Revolution.[103] He met Vladimir Lenin and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin rather disappointing, sensing an \"impish cruelty\" in him and comparing him to \"an opinionated professor\". He cruised down the Volga on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He wrote a book The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism[104] about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from Britain, all of whom came home thinking well of the rÃ©gime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.[citation needed]",
