				"after": "The MSP building is connected to the Tower Buildings by way of the Garden Lobby and stands at the western end of the parliamentary complex, adjoining Reid's Close.[49] The block contains offices for each MSP and two members of staff, fitted out with custom-designed furniture.[49] The building is between four and six storeys in height, and is clad in granite.[49] MSPs occupy 108 of the total 114 rooms in the building.[49] Each office is divided into two partsâone for the MSP, with a floor space of 15Â squareÂ metres (160Â sqÂ ft) and another part for their staff, which has a floor space of 12Â squareÂ metres (130Â sqÂ ft).[49] The most distinctive feature of the MSP block are the unusual windows which project out from the building onto the western elevation of the parliamentary complex, inspired by a combination of the repeated leaf motif and the traditional Scottish stepped gable.[13] In each office, these bay windows have a seat and shelving and are intended as \"contemplation spaces\".[50] Constructed from stainless steel and framed in oak, with oak lattices covering the glass, the windows are designed to provide MSPs with privacy and shade from the sun.[49] Criticism has been levelled at the design of the windows by some MSPs who claim that the design blocks out natural light from their offices.[51] To remove the uniformity from the western side of the building, the windows jut out at different widths and angles.[13] At its north end, the building is six storeys high (ground floor plus five) stepping down to four storeys (ground floor plus three) at the south end.[49]",
