				"after": "Niue's economy is small, with a GDP of NZ$17 million in 2003,[28] or US$10 million at purchasing power parity.[29] The GDP has since grown to NZ$25.5 million as of 2009.[citation needed] Most economic activity revolves around the government, as the government has been in charge of organising and managing the affairs of the country since 1974. However, since the economy has reached a stage where state regulation may now give way to the private sector, there is an ongoing effort to develop the private sector. Following Cyclone Heta, the government made a major commitment towards rehabilitating and developing the private sector.[citation needed]",
