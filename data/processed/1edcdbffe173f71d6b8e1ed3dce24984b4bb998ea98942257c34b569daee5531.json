				"after": "Thescelosaurus was a heavily built bipedal animal, probably herbivorous,[3] but possibly omnivorous.[4] It would have browsed in the first meter or so from the ground, feeding selectively,[3] with food held in the mouth by cheeks while chewing.[5] There was a prominent ridge along the length of both maxillae (the tooth-bearing \"cheek\" bones),[1] and a ridge on both dentaries (tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw).[6] The ridges[6] and position of the teeth, deeply internal to the outside surface of the skull, are interpreted as evidence for muscular cheeks.[7] Aside from the long narrow beak, the skull also had teeth in the premaxilla, or upper beak (a primitive trait among ornithopods).[8] Long rod-like bones called palpebrals were present over the eyes, giving the animal heavy bony eyebrows.[8] Its teeth were of two types: small pointed premaxillary teeth, and leaf-shaped cheek teeth.[9] Six small teeth were present in both premaxillae, with a toothless section at the tip of the beak.[1]",
