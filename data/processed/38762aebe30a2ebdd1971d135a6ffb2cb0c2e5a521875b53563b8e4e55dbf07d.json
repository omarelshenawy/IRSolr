Based on its size and runic text, it has been suggested that U 812 was once part of a coupled monument located in a cemetery, but that the runestone with the first half of the overall text has been lost.[21] Other pairs of runestones that may have formed a coupled monument in a cemetery are U 49 and U 50 in LovÃ¶ and SÃ¶ Fv1948;282 and SÃ¶ 134 in Ludgo.[21]",
