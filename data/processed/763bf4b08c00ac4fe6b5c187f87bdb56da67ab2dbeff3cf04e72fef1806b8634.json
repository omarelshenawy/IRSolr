				"previous": "The State of Israel does not currently possess a specific jet for use of its Heads of State. Whenever the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flies long distances (out of the country), the Government leases an airliner from the state airline El Al. Meanwhile the President Reuven Rivlin and other high ranking dignitaries are relegated to El Al first class commercial service. As of 2014, the Knesset is considering the purchase of such an airplane, dubbed \"Israeli Air Force One\".",
