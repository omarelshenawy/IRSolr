				"previous": "As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona[63] and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[64] but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for â¬35Â million[65] on a four-year contract as the latest of the galÃ¡ctico signings by club president Florentino PÃ©rez. The news came as a bitter pill to the newly elected BarÃ§a president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign precisely on signing Beckham.[66] Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend Alfredo di StÃ©fano.[67] Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was currently assigned to club captain RaÃºl. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.[68]",
				"after": "In the week before Beckham presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham got reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid since Queiroz spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of the pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons; however, the presence of global marketing icon such as Beckham made this particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues.[69]",
