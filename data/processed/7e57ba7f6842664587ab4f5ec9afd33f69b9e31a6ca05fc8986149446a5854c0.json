				"previous": "ExpressJet previously had its headquarters in the North Belt Office Center IV, a building in the Greens Crossing office park, a 484-acre (1.96Â km2) mixed-use office park; the office park is in the Greenspoint area of Houston.[6][31][32]",
				"after": "ExpressJet was one of three tenants that leased space in the two-building, 107,200-square-foot (9,960Â m2) North Belt Office Center complex, which includes buildings III and IV. FORT Properties manages both buildings. ExpressJet uses the location due to the proximity to George Bush Intercontinental Airport and to Continental Center I, the Continental Airlines headquarters in Downtown Houston.[6] ExpressJet had relocated its headquarters to its final Houston location by 2006.[33] FORT had acquired the buildings in 2007, which were built in 2003.[34]",
