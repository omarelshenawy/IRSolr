				"previous": "During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.[28] Sturges Hall was constructed as the University's first library in 1855.[29] In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in Merrick Hall.[30] The Ohio Wesleyan Female College, established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877.[31][32] Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and music education greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.[33][34]",
				"after": "By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).[35] To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. University Hall, Slocum Library, extensions to the Monnett campus, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.[36]",
