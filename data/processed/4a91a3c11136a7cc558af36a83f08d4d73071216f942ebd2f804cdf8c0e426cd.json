				"previous": "Metalcore, a hybrid of extreme metal and hardcore punk,[206] emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s decade. It is rooted in the crossover thrash style developed two decades earlier by bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, and Stormtroopers of Death.[207] Through the 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon;[208] early bands include Earth Crisis,[209][210][211] Hogan's Heroes,[212][213] Converge,[210] Hatebreed[211][214] and Shai Hulud.[215][216] By 2004, melodic metalcoreâinfluenced as well by melodic death metalâwas popular enough that Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache and Shadows Fall's The War Within debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the Billboard album chart.[217]",
				"after": "Welsh band Bullet for My Valentine's third studio album Fever debuted at position number 3 on The Billboard 200 and number 1 on Billboard's Rock and Alternative charts, making it the band's most successful record to date. In recent years, metalcore bands have received prominent slots at Ozzfest and the Download Festival. Lamb of God, a groove metal band, hit the Billboard top 10 in 2006 with Sacrament. The success of these bands and others such as Trivium and Avenged Sevenfold[218] which have released both metalcore and straight-ahead thrash albums. Bands like Motionless In White have experimented with Metalcore further by including Gothic Metal and Industrial Metal influences. Other notable experiments include Asking Alexandria mixing Trance, this has led to an explosion of bands following this combination. One such band is Silent Descent who mix Melodic Death Metal with trance. Evolving even further from metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically complicated and progressive style brought to light by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero.[219] Mathcore's main defining quality is the use of odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic comparability to free Jazz.[220]",
