				"previous": "In 2006 the book was displayed in \"Joan MirÃ³, Illustrated Books\" at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is \"an especially powerful set, not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book's creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature MirÃ³'s familiar shapes, there's an unusual emphasis on texture.\" The critic continued, \"I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that's in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of MirÃ³'s work. Their poignancy is even greater, I think, when you read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d'artiste. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Desnos' bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Auschwitz, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos' widow, MirÃ³ set out to illustrate the poet's manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration.\"",
