Anthony dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on December 13, 1978.[45] First strikes at the Denver and San Francisco Mints followed on January 9, 1979 and January 29, respectively.[46] Mint officials feared that the coins would be hoarded upon release, so they ordered the creation of a stockpile consisting of 500 million coins prior to the release date in July 1979.[47] The dollars all bore a mint mark denoting their place of origin: 'P' for the Philadelphia Mint, 'D' for the Denver Mint and 'S' for the San Francisco Mint. The Anthony dollars were the first coin to bear a 'P' mint mark since the Jefferson nickels issued during World War II; other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note their place of origin.[48] In 1980, the 'P' mint mark was added to all other circulating coins, except the cent, struck in Philadelphia.[48]",
