				"previous": "The term \"mangrove\" comes to English from Spanish (perhaps by way of Portuguese), and is likely to originate from Guarani. It was earlier \"mangrow\" (from Portuguese mangue or Spanish mangle), but this word was corrupted via folk etymology influence of the word \"grove\".",
			"after": [
				"Mangrove swamps are found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas. Areas where mangal occurs include estuaries and marine shorelines.[5]",
				"The intertidal existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat. High tide brings in salt water, and when the tide recedes, solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity. The return of tide can flush out these soils, bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater."
