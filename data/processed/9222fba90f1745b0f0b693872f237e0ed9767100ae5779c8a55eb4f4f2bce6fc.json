				"after": "After the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror established a motte-and-bailey castle at Warwick in 1068 to maintain control of the Midlands as he advanced northwards.[7][8] Building a castle in a pre-existing settlement could require demolishing properties on the intended site. In the case of Warwick, the least recorded of the 11Â urban castles in the 1086 survey, four houses were torn down to make way for the castle.[9] A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a moundÂ â on which usually stands a keep or towerÂ â and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. William appointed Henry de Beaumont, the son of a powerful Norman family, as constable of the castle.[1] In 1088, Henry de Beaumont was made the first Earl of Warwick.[1] He founded the Church of All Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the Bishop of Worcester, believing that a castle was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127â28.[1]",
