Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries, or simply from panic.[1] However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation.[107] In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry.[1] Worldwide, canidsâincluding the domestic dogâare responsible for most sheep deaths.[108][109][110] Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.[107][111]",
