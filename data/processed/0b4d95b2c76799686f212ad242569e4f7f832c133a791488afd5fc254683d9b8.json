				"previous": "Another NASA project the engineers were interested in was the supercritical airfoil, designed by Richard Whitcomb. The supercritical design promised to greatly lower transonic drag, as much as a swept wing in some situations. This allowed an aircraft with such a wing to have low drag in cruise while also having a wing planform more suitable to lower-speed flight â swept wings have several undesirable characteristics at low speed. Additionally, the design has a larger leading edge radius that makes it particularly suitable for low-speed high-lift applications like a transport. Boeing incorporated the concept into their design, the first non-experimental aircraft to do so.",
				"after": "The request for proposal (RFP) was issued in January 1972, asking for operations into a 2,000Â foot (610Â m) semi-prepared field at 500 nautical miles (930Â km) with a 27,000Â lb (12,000Â kg) payload in both directions with no refueling. For comparison, the C-130 of that era required about 4,000Â ft (1,200Â m) for this load. Five companies submitted designs at this stage of the competition, Boeing with their Model 953 in MarchÂ 1972. On 10Â NovemberÂ 1972 the downselect was carried out, and Boeing and McDonnell Douglas won development contracts for two prototypes each.",
