				"previous": "The family continued collecting and selling fossils together, and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.[17]",
				"after": "Their first well-known find was in 1811, when Mary was 12; Joseph dug up a 4-foot ichthyosaur skull and a few months later, Mary found the rest of the skeleton. Henry Hoste Henley of Sandringham, Norfolk, who was lord of the manor of Colway, near Lyme Regis, paid the family about Â£23 for it,[19] and in turn he sold it to William Bullock, a well-known collector, who displayed it in London. There it generated considerable interest, because at a time when most people in England still believed in the Biblical account of creation, which implied that the Earth was only a few thousand years old,[20] it raised questions about the history of living things and of the Earth itself. It was later sold for Â£45 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a \"Crocodile in a Fossil State\" to Charles Konig, of the British Museum, who had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus for it.[21]",
