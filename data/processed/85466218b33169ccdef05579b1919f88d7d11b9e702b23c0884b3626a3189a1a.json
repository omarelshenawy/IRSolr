Its known range stretches from Honduras to northern Argentina, and fossil remains have been found as far north as northwestern Sonora, Mexico.[7] It is largely absent from the Andes[4] and has been extirpated in Uruguay.[2] It may also be extirpated in Belize, Costa Rica and Guatemala.[2] The species can be found in a number of habitats including both tropical rainforests and xeric shrublands,[11] provided enough prey is present to sustain it.[22]",
