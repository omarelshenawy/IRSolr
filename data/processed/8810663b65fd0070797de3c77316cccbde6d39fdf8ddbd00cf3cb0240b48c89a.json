				"MÃ¡laga is the fourth-ranking city in economic activity in Spain behind Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia.[2]",
				"The most important business sectors in MÃ¡laga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand. The Andalusia Technology Park (PTA) (In Spanish, \"Parque TecnolÃ³gico de AndalucÃ­a\"), located in MÃ¡laga, has enjoyed significant growth since its inauguration in 1992 by the King of Spain. In 2010, this high-tech, science and industrial park was home to 509 companies and employed over 14,500 people.[citation needed]"
