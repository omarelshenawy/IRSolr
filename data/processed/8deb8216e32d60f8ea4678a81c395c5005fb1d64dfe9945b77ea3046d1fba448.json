(A quadratic field consists of all numbers of the form , where and are rational numbers and is a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.) For that matter, the 11th-century chakravala method amountsâin modern termsâto an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither BhÄskara nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.",
