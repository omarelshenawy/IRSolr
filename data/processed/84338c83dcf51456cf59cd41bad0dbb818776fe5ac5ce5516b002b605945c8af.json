				"after": "The project was announced by Sanger on 15 September 2006, at the Wizards of OS 4 conference in Berlin. He gave no deadline for the full launch of the wiki.[62][63] However, on 2 October 2006, Sanger released a pilot project announcement that envisioned a fully functioning wiki within \"one to two months\".",
