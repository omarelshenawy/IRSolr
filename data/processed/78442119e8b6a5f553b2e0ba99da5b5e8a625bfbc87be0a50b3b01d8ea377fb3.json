				"previous": "The Siskiyou National Forest was created on October 5, 1906, protecting the entire upper portion of the Chetco watershed.[44] The nearby Rogue River National Forest was combined with it in 2004, creating the nearly 1,800,000-acre (728,000Â ha) Rogue River â Siskiyou National Forest.[45] In 1964, the United States Congress set aside over 80,000 acres (32,000Â ha) of the eastern Chetco River watershed and surrounding regions to create the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. The wilderness was expanded several times in the 1970s, and now encompasses over 180,000 acres (72,800Â ha).[46]",
				"after": "On October 28, 1988, a 44.5-mile (71.6Â km) stretch of the Chetco River was designated a National Wild and Scenic River, from its headwaters to the boundary of the Rogue River â Siskiyou National Forest.[24] In a court case in 1994, the Chetco was determined to be navigable.[47] In 2002, over 500,000 acres (202,000Â ha) of the eastern portion of the watershed and surrounding regions were destroyed in the Biscuit Fire. Originally five separate fires, it was caused by several lightning strikes between July 12 and 15. By August 17, all five had burned together, creating one massive fire. It burned for over five months and was not fully extinguished until December 31.[13]",
