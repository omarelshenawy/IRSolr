				"after": "As the timber was exhausted and the land burned, many companies simply abandoned their holdings.[25] Conservationists such as Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow without proper management. They called for a change in the philosophy of forest management and for the state to purchase land from the lumber companies. In 1895, Rothrock was appointed the first forestry commissioner in what became the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR). In 1897, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that authorized the purchase of \"unseated lands for forest reservations\" and the first of the Pennsylvania state forest lands were acquired the following year.[26][27]",
