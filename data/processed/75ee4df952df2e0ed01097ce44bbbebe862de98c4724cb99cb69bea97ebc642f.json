				"previous": "During the Franco-Prussian War (1870â1871) it was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal.[23] During World War II, the painting was again removed from the Louvre and taken safely, first to ChÃ¢teau d'Amboise, then to the Loc-Dieu Abbey and ChÃ¢teau de Chambord, then finally to the Ingres Museum in Montauban.",
				"after": "The painting's fame increased greatly when it was stolen on 21 August 1911.[24] The next day, Louis BÃ©roud, a painter, walked into the Louvre and went to the Salon CarrÃ© where the Mona Lisa had been on display for five years. However, where the Mona Lisa should have stood, he found four iron pegs. BÃ©roud contacted the section head of the guards, who thought the painting was being photographed for marketing purposes. A few hours later, BÃ©roud checked back with the section head of the museum, and it was confirmed that the Mona Lisa was not with the photographers. The Louvre was closed for an entire week to aid in investigation of the theft.",
