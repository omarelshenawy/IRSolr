				"after": "The Texas A&M culture is a product of the university's founding as a rural military and agricultural school. Although the school and surrounding community have grown, and military training is no longer required, the school's history has instilled in students \"the idealized elements of a small-town life: community, tradition, loyalty, optimism, and unabashed sentimentality.\"[145] Texas Monthly posits that Texas A&M students' respect for school traditions and values is the university's greatest strength.[146] Some of the school traditions date to the 1890s, while others have been introduced more recently. These traditions enable enrolled students and alumni to cultivate the Aggie Spirit, a sense of loyalty and respect for the school.[147] They dictate many aspects of student life, including how to greet others (using the official school greeting \"Howdy!\"),[148] how to act at an A&M sporting event, and often, what words a student may use in conversation.[149]",
