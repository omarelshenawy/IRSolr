				"previous": "The Baltimore City College football program began in the mid-1870s, has competed in more than 1,000 contests, and has won more than 20 Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) and Baltimore City League championships. The Knights primarily faced collegiate competition throughout the 1880s and 1890s because few secondary schools existed in Maryland at the time.[45] The team began competing against other high schools at the beginning of the 20th century.",
				"after": "City College holds the record for most consecutive games played without a loss in MSA and MPSSAA history. The Knights played 54 consecutive games without a loss between 1934â1941.[65] Harry Lawrence, who guided the Knights to a 38-game undefeated streak between 1936 and 1940 (including 35Â wins, threeÂ ties, and four MSA championships), remains City College's most successful head football coach.[66]",
