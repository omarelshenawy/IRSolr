Meanwhile, Lower Manhattan was left out of the economic boom. One exception was the construction of One Chase Manhattan Plaza in the Financial District by David Rockefeller, who led urban renewal efforts in Lower Manhattan.[5] In 1958, Rockefeller established the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association (DLMA), which commissioned Skidmore, Owings and Merrill to draw up plans for revitalizing Lower Manhattan. The plans, made public in 1960, called for a World Trade Center to be built on a 13-acre (53,000Â m2) site along the East River, from Old Slip to Fulton Street and between Water Street and South Street.[6][7] The complex would include a 900-foot (275Â m) long exhibition hall, and a 50â70 story building, with some of its upper floors used as a hotel.[8] Other amenities would include a theater, shops, and restaurants.[9] The plan also called for a new securities exchange building, which the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association hoped would house the New York Stock Exchange.[7]",
