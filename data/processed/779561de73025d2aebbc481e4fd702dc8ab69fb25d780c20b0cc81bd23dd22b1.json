				"after": "The aircraft fleet of Icelandair remained mainly unchanged until the Boeing 757-200 became the new backbone for transatlantic flights during the 1990s. The domestic Fokker F-27s were replaced by F-50s and Boeing 737s deployed on European routes. The European hub at Luxemburg-Findel Airport had been taken over from LoftleiÃ°ir. Passenger count topped one million in 1995[citation needed] as the company's business grew on a reputation as a \"backpacker airline\", similar to LoftleiÃ°ir, which had been referred to as \"Hippie Airline\" since the late 1960s. In the same year, it was begun to dismantle the Luxemburg hub in favor of today's decentralized European network, linking the largest cities non-stop to ReykjavÃ­k.[31]",
