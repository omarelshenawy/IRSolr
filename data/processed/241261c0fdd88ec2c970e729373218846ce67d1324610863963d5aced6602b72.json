				"previous": "Regardless of model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357Â km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378Â km (â3,950 â 3,963Â mi). Hence the Earth deviates from a perfect sphere by only a third of a percent, sufficiently close to treat it as a sphere in many contexts and justifying the term \"the radius of the Earth\". While specific values differ, the concepts in this article generalize to any major planet.",

Additionally, the bulge at the equator shows slow variations. The bulge had been declining, but since 1998 the bulge has increased, possibly due to redistribution of ocean mass via currents.[2]",
