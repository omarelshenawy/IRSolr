Jewish doctors and professors were not allowed to treat Aryan (effectively, gentile) patients or teach Aryan pupils, respectively. The Jews were not allowed to use any public transportation, besides the ferry, and were able to shop only from 3â5 pm in Jewish stores. After Kristallnacht (\"The Night of Broken Glass\"), the Jews were fined 1,000,000 marks for damages done by the Nazi troops and SS members.",
