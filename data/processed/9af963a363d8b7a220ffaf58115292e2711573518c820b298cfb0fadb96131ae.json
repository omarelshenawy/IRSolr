				"previous": "then since the transformation is an involution we may express the roots in terms of the four si in exactly the same way. Since we know the value s0 = -a/2, we only need the values for s1, s2 and s3. These are the roots of the polynomial",
				"after": "Substituting the si by their values in term of the xi, this polynomial may be expanded in a polynomial in s whose coefficients are symmetric polynomials in the xi. By the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, these coefficients may be expressed as polynomials in the coefficients of the monic quartic. If, for simplification, we suppose that the quartic is depressed, that is a=0, this results in the polynomial",
