				"after": "Up to 10Â cm (4Â in) in diameter, the cap is convex to flattened in shape with a central umbo (a rounded elevation) and is various shades of cream, yellow and tan. The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch. The cap edge, or margin, is rolled inward in young specimens. The crowded gills are sinuate and white to cream in colour initially, brownish-cream or pinkish brown in maturity, and sometimes with yellow or rust-coloured marks close to the margins.[14] The stem is central (that is, it joins the cap in the centre) and is up to 20Â cm (8Â in) long by 1.5Â cm (1Â in) thick. It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex, sometimes almost bulb-like. The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that run up and down its length. It has a floppy yellow wool-like ring which may develop irregular, jagged edges with time. The flesh is white, and in the stem has a woolly or stringy consistency.[1] Although it has a hot-bitter taste, Armillaria luteobubalina is edible, and cooking removes the bitterness.[15]",
