				"after": "Although most of the watershed is generally closed to the public, the protected area includes forest roads, buildings, three dams and reservoirs, two hydroelectric power stations, and other infrastructure used by government employees who manage the forest and the water supply system. The system includes a concrete dam and spillway, added to the natural outlet of Bull Run Lake. The dam, completed in about 1960, was preceded in 1915 by a timber-and-rockfill structure and later by other measures to increase the lake's storage capacity and to prevent seepage. These measures raised the lake's usable storage from about 2.8Â billion US gallons (11,000,000Â m3) to about 4.3Â billion US gallons (16,000,000Â m3), an increase of about 55Â percent.[59] DamÂ 1, which impounds ReservoirÂ 1, is a concrete arch-gravity dam about 200 feet (61Â m) high,[30] and DamÂ 2, a rockfill structure about 110 feet (34Â m) high, impounds ReservoirÂ 2.[31] Although the two reservoirs combined can hold up to about 17Â billion US gallons (64,000,000Â m3), their total usable storage is only about 10Â billion US gallons (38,000,000Â m3).[60]",
