				"after": "An important current within individualist anarchism is free love.[28] Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women.[28] The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883â1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker[95] but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood's The Word (1872â1890, 1892â1893).[28] Also M. E. Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.[28] Later John William Lloyd, a collaborator of Benjamin TuckerÂ´s periodical Liberty, published in 1931 a sex manual that he called The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love.[96]",
