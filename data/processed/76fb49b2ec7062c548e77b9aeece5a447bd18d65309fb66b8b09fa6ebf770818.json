				"previous": "At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological anti-positivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a resolutely subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human \"social action\"âespecially among \"ideal types\", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.[45] As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as \"historical, invariant, or generalisable\"[46] as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand TÃ¶nnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \"Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft\" (lit. community and society). TÃ¶nnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\"pure sociology\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\"applied sociology\").[47]",
