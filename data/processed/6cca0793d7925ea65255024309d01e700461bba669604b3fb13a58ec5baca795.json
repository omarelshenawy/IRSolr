				"previous": "In 1980, work began on an \"Alternate Close Support\" version of the Alpha Jet, featuring a SAGEM ULISS 81 INS, a Thomson-CSF VE-110 HUD, a TMV630 laser rangefinder in a modified nose and a TRT AHV 9 radio altimeter, with all avionics linked through a digital databus. Initial flight was on 9 April 1982. Cameroon obtained seven (some sources claim 6)[citation needed] and Egypt obtained 15. As with the original Egyptian order for MS1 machines, Dassault provided four such machines under the designation of MS2 and AOI of Egypt assembled the other eleven from knockdown kits.",
				"after": "Abbatare Inc. of Arlington, Washington, under the name of \"Alpha Jets USA\", has begun to import Alpha Jets into the United States and sell them in the civilian market.[9]",
