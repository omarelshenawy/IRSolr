				"previous": "In the Western Zone, Arnold established his headquarters in Salt Lake City. In the winter of 1932â1933, he and many of his pilots had gained winter flying experience flying food-drop missions to aid Indian reservation settlements throughout the American Southwest isolated by blizzards. As a result of this experience and direct supervision, Arnold's zone was the only one in which a pilot was not killed.[10]",
