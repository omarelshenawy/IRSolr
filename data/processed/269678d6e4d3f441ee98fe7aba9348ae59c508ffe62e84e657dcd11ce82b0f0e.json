				"previous": "On 21 December 2010, the A$69Â billion (Â£44Â billion) Future Fund, a sovereign wealth fund established by the Australian government in 2006, agreed to purchase a 17.2-percent stake in Gatwick Airport from GIP for Â£145Â million. This transaction completed GIP's syndication process for the airport, reducing its stake to 42Â percent (although the firm's extra voting rights mean it still controls the airport's board).[21]",
				"after": "The airport has two terminals, North and South. Both have shops and restaurants landside and airside, and all areas are accessible to disabled passengers. There are facilities for baby changing and feeding, and play areas and video games for children; business travellers have specialised lounges. On 31 May 2008, Virgin Holidays opened the V Room, Gatwick's first lounge dedicated to leisure travellers, for use by Virgin Holidays customers flying to Orlando, Las Vegas and the Caribbean on sister airline Virgin Atlantic.[22]",
