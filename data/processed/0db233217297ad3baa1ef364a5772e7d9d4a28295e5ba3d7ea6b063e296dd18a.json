				"after": "Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said that with the track, Ciara \"lucked into the sexiest thing to happen to pop since Timberlake's own FutureSex/LoveSounds,\" calling the song one of the \"biggest anthems of the year.\" Gennoe went on to call the song the \"highlight\" and \"saving grace\" of Fantasy Ride.[11] Nick Levine of Digital Spy said that \"the track itself is nearly as sexy as the promo clip\", commenting \"Ciara purrs, and Timberlake, if you'll pardon the pun, more than rises to the occasion. All in all, 'Love Sex Magic' is pretty much spot on.\"[7] Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald said \"Itâs not quite magic, but it grows on you.\"[9] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Hooking up with Timberlake essentially guarantees a one-way ticket back to chart supremacy, so nice work there, Ciara.\"[12] Medina went on to call the song an early candidate for \"song of the summer.\"[12]",
