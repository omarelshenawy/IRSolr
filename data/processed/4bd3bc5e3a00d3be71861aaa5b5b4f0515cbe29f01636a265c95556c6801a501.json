				"previous": "The tooth was presented at the 45th annual meeting of the Palaeontological Association in 2001, and identified as a dromaeosaur.[4] In 2003 the tooth (MGUH 27218/DK 315) was made the holotype specimen of Dromaeosauroides bornholmensisânamed and described by Christiansen and Bonde. The genus name combines Dromaeosaurus with the Greek -ides (\"in the form of\"), referring to the resemblance between the teeth of the taxa. The specific name refers to Bornholm.[5] Bonde and Christiansen had expected the first Danish dinosaur remains to be teeth of herbivorous dinosaurs such as hypsilophodonts or Iguanodon, and were surprised to find a dromaeosaur tooth instead, since these are rare in Early Cretaceous formations; herbivores would have been more abundant than carnivores.[1][6] Because the dromaeosaur seems to have been large, they expected that resilient bones, such as claws, might be found in the future. The palaeontologists did not expect bones of larger dinosaurs to be discovered in the formation (since these would most likely have been found when the sand was commercially exploited), but hoped the remains of a Mesozoic mammal would be found.[1] The holotype tooth has been illustrated in several books and research articles. It was certified \"DanekrÃ¦\" (\"Danish creature\", according to a 1990 Danish museum law securing important fossils) when its scientific importance was evaluated by the Geological Museum in Copenhagen.[1][2]",
				"after": "In late summer 2008, ranger Jens Kofoed found a second dromaeosaurid tooth.[7] This specimen (DK 559) was found in the same location, and later assigned to D. bornholmensis as well.[2] Kofoed explained that the finds were surprising because people had been unsuccessfully searching for dinosaur remains in Denmark for years, and it was like finding a \"needle in a haystack\".[8] In a press release, the second dromaeosaur tooth was also certified DanekrÃ¦ by the Natural History Museum of Denmark, which compared the animal to the raptors in Jurassic Park, noting that the animals, unlike the film's raptors, would have been feathered.[7]",
