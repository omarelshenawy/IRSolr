				"previous": "The region seems to have been inhabited continuously since 10,000 BC, by various cultures and alternating waves of migration, the details of which are as yet poorly understood. Several sites have been excavated, notably caves such as Cueva del Milodon[16] in Ãltima Esperanza in southern Patagonia, and Tres Arroyos on Tierra del Fuego, that support this date.[11] Hearths, stone scrapers, animal remains dated to 9400â9200 BC have been found east of the Andes.[11]",
				"after": "The Cueva de las Manos is a famous site in Santa Cruz, Argentina. A cave at the foot of a cliff is covered in wall paintings, particularly the negative images of hundreds of hands, believed to date from around 8000 BC.[11]",
