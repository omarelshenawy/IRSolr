Most pupils wear a white tie that is effectively a strip of cloth folded over into a starched, detachable collar, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar (\"Stick-Ups\"). There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see School Prefects and King's Scholars sections.",
