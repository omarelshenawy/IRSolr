				"previous": "The Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are therapy dogs,[27] some work for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs,[26] others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies,[29] and some work as scat-detection dogs, tracking endangered wildlife species.[30]",
				"after": "In a small sample of 11 deceased dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7Â years (maximum 15.9Â yrs).[31] A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41Â years with a standard deviation of 2.36Â years.[32] The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13Â years.[33] There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5Â years, but the record is unverified.[34] Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed.[32] It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class.[32] Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14Â years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.[21]",
