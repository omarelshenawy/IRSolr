				"previous": "There are many development plans in place, including the construction of new government buildings,[243] waterfront redevelopment in Central,[244] and a series of projects in West Kowloon.[245] More high-rise development is set to take place on the other side of Victoria Harbour in Kowloon, as the 1998 closure of the nearby Kai Tak Airport lifted strict height restrictions.[246] The Urban Renewal Authority is highly active in demolishing older areas, including the razing and redevelopment of Kwun Tong town centre, an approach which has been criticised for its impact on the cultural identity of the city and on lower-income residents.",
