				"The Cook Islands were first settled in the 6th century by Polynesian people who migrated from Tahiti,[9] an island 1154Â km to the northeast of Cook Islands.",
				"Spanish ships visited the islands in the 16thÂ century; the first written record of contact with the islands came with the sighting of Pukapuka by Spanish sailor Ãlvaro de MendaÃ±a de Neira in 1595 who called it San Bernardo (Saint Bernard). Pedro Fernandes de QueirÃ³s, a Portuguese captain working for the Spanish crown, made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on Rakahanga in 1606, calling it Gente Hermosa (Beautiful People).[10]"
