				"previous": "An isomorphism is a linear map fÂ : V â W such that there exists an inverse map gÂ : W â V, which is a map such that the two possible compositions f â gÂ : W â W and g â fÂ : V â V are identity maps. Equivalently, f is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective).[25] If there exists an isomorphism between V and W, the two spaces are said to be isomorphic; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in V are, via f, transported to similar ones in W, and vice versa via g.",
				"after": "For example, the \"arrows in the plane\" and \"ordered pairs of numbers\" vector spaces in the introduction are isomorphic: a planar arrow v departing at the origin of some (fixed) coordinate system can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the x- and y-component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair (x, y), the arrow going by x to the right (or to the left, if x is negative), and y up (down, if y is negative) turns back the arrow v.",
