				"The stumps are three vertical posts which support two bails.[1] The stumps and bails are usually made of wood, and together form a wicket at each end of the pitch.",
				"The overall width of each wicket is 9Â inches (22.9Â cm). Each stump is 28Â inches (71.1Â cm) tall with maximum and minimum diameters of 11â2 inches (3.81Â cm) and 13â8 inches (3.49Â cm). They have a spike at one end for inserting into the ground, and the other end has a U-shaped 'through groove' to provide a resting place for the bails.[2] In junior cricket the items have lesser dimensions."
