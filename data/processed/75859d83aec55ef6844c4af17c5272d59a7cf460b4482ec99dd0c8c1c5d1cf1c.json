				"after": "The adult male of the nominate subspecies, S.Â e.Â europaea is 14Â cm (5.5Â in) long with a 22.5â27Â cm (8.9â10.6Â in) wingspan.[10] It weighs 17â28Â g (0.6â1Â oz). It has blue-grey upperparts, a black eye-stripe and whitish throat and underparts. The flanks and lower belly are orange-red, mottled with white on the undertail. The stout bill is dark grey with a paler area on the base of the lower mandible, the iris is dark brown and the legs and feet are pale brown or greyish.[3] Most other members of the S.Â e.Â europaea group differ only in detail from the nominate form, often with respect to the hue of the underparts,[9] but S.Â e.Â arctica is quite distinctive. It is large, pale, has a white forehead and a reduced eye-stripe, and it has more white in the tail and wings than any other subspecies.[11] Nuthatches move on trees with short leaps, and do not use their tails for support. In flight, they have a characteristic appearance, with a pointed head, round wings and a short, square tail. Their flight is fast, with wings closed between beats, and is usually of short duration.[10]",
