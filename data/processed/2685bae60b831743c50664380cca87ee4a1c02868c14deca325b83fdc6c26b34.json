				"after": "Landseer's painting of a red deer stag, Monarch of the Glen, is one of the most notable images of Victorian Scotland.[48] The species, a member of the biological order artiodactyla or \"even-toed ungulates\", is still 400,000 strong, although its existence in the pure form is threatened by hybridisation with introduced sika deer. Very much a hill-dwelling species in Scotland (and so typically smaller in stature than its European forest-loving cousins), it is generally replaced by roe deer in lower-lying land.[49] Although found elsewhere in the UK, no wild populations of Chinese water deer and no or very few Chinese muntjac exist in Scotland. It has isolated populations of feral goats Capra hircus and feral sheep (Ovis aries),[24] such as the herd of 1,000 Soay sheep on St Kilda.[50] Since 1952 a herd of semi-domesticated reindeer have lived in the Cairngorm National Park,[51][52] the species having become extinct in Scotland after it was recorded as having been hunted in Orkney in the 12th century.[53]",
