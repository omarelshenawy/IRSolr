				"previous": "Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[8] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893â1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[20] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige.[21]",
				"after": "Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909â16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916â45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s.[8] John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.[8][22]",
