				"previous": "The square of any positive or negative number is positive, and the square of 0 is 0. Therefore, no negative number can have a real square root. However, it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the complex numbers, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number. This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by i (sometimes j, especially in the context of electricity where \"i\" traditionally represents electric current) and called the imaginary unit, which is defined such that i2 = â1. Using this notation, we can think of i as the square root of â1, but notice that we also have (âi)2 = i2 = â1 and so âi is also a square root of â1. By convention, the principal square root of â1 is i, or more generally, if x is any non-negative number, then the principal square root of âx is",
