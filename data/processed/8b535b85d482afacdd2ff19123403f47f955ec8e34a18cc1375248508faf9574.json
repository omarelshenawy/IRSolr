				"previous": "Across England, many public houses and inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, particularly in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 Ludgate Hill,[69] near the entrance to St Paul's Cathedral in London,[70] was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel Lambert and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby.[19] James Dixon, owner of the Ram Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes Lambert had been wearing when he died and put it on display, renaming the inn the Daniel Lambert.[19]",
				"after": "The term \"Daniel Lambert\" entered common use in English speech and writing, to refer to any fat man.[71] His name continued in this use long after the details of his life had been largely forgotten; in 1852, Charles Dickens remarked that \"Lambert's name is known better than his history\".[72] Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby compares the obese GeorgeÂ IV to Lambert,[73] and William Makepeace Thackeray used the term in Vanity Fair to refer to the obese Joseph Sedley,[74][n 7] and in The Luck of Barry Lyndon to refer to the fat servant Tim.[73] As time progressed, \"Daniel Lambert\" came to mean anything exceptionally large; Herbert Spencer's The Study of Sociology used the phrase \"a Daniel Lambert of learning\",[76][n 8] while Thomas Carlyle referred sarcastically to Oliver Cromwell as \"this big swollen Gambler and gluttonous hapless 'spiritual Daniel Lambert'\".[77] In 1874, The Times, in reviewing the newly translated French comedy La Fiammina by Mario Uchard in which a character is named \"Daniel Lambert\", noted that the name is \"always associated in the English mind with the notion of obesity\",[78] and in 1907, almost 100 years after Lambert's death, the ChÃ¢teau de Chambord was referred to as \"the Daniel Lambert among chÃ¢teaux\".[79] Nellie Lambert Ensall, at the time the heaviest woman in Britain, claimed in 1910 to be Daniel Lambert's great-granddaughter, but her claim is likely to be untrue; Lambert was unmarried and is unlikely to have had any children.[80]",
