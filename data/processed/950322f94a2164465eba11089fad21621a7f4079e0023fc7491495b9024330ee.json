				"previous": "Converting from mpg or to L/100Â km (or vice versa) involves the use of the reciprocal function, which is not distributive. Therefore, the average of two fuel economy numbers gives different values if those units are used, because one of the functions is reciprocal, thus not linear. If two people calculate the fuel economy average of two groups of cars with different units, the group with better fuel economy may be one or the other. However, from the point of energy used as a shared method of measure, the result shall be the same in both the cases.",
				"after": "In parts of Europe, the two standard measuring cycles for \"litre/100 km\" value are \"urban\" traffic with speeds up to 50Â km/h from a cold start, and then \"extra urban\" travel at various speeds up to 120Â km/h which follows the urban test. A combined figure is also quoted showing the total fuel consumed in divided by the total distance traveled in both tests. A reasonably modern European supermini and many mid-size cars, including station wagons, may manage motorway travel at 5 L/100Â km (47 mpg US/56 mpg imp) or 6.5 L/100Â km in city traffic (36 mpg US/43 mpg imp), with carbon dioxide emissions of around 140 g/km.",
