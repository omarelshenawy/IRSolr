				"previous": "The largest aircraft of any kind flying today (2014) is the HAV-304 (LEMV) hybrid airship, with an internal capacity of 38,000 cubic metres and a length of 91 m.[4][5]",
				"after": "The lifting capacity of an aircraft depends on the wing size and its \"loading\", the weight per unit area that the wing can support. Loading is more or less constant for a given level of technology. Thus, as aircraft size increases the lifting capacity increases with the surface area. For a given aerodynamic form, the area in turn increases with the square of the wing span. If structural efficiency can be maintained, the structural weight of the airframe also increases with its surface area and the square of the span. But the internal volume increases with the cube of the span.",
