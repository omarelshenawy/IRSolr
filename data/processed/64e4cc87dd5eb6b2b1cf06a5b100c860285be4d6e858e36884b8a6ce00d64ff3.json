				"after": "The South Koreans were holding positions at the northern end of the Kapyong Valley, having advanced 10 kilometres (6.2Â mi) since relieving the 27th Brigade.[12] However, anticipating a Chinese attack, the divisional commanderâGeneral Chang Do Yongâhad halted his advance at 16:00 and ordered his two forward regimentsâthe 19th and the 2nd Infantry Regimentsâto tie-in and develop defensive positions. Meanwhile, the 7th Infantry Regiment occupied reserve positions immediately behind the forward regiments.[32][33] Suffering a reputation for unreliability in defence the South Koreans had been bolstered by the attachment of the New Zealand guns and a battery of 105-millimetre (4.1Â in) M101 howitzers from the US 213th Field Artillery Battalion.[34][35] Regardless, left with only one hour to halt its advance and step up defences, the forward South Korean units were only able to occupy a series of hill-top positions while leaving the valleys and flanks exposed.[33] Two Chinese divisionsâthe 118th and the 60th Divisionâstruck at 17:00, easily infiltrating through numerous gaps between the badly organised defensive positions.[33] Under pressure all along the front, the defenders gave ground almost immediately and soon broke. Abandoning their weapons, equipment and vehicles, they disintegrated and began to stream south out of the mountains and through the valley, and by 23:00 Chang was forced to admit that he had lost all communication with his units.[36] At 04:00 the decision was made to withdraw the New Zealanders to prevent their loss, however following reports that the South Koreans were making a stand they were ordered back up the valley the next morning with the Middlesex accompanying them as protection. By dusk it was clear that the South Koreans had in fact collapsed, and the guns were withdrawn again.[34][36]",
