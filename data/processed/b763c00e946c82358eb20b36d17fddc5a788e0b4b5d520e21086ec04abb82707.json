				"Under bankruptcy, Eastern launched a \"100 Days\" campaign, in which it promised to \"become a little bit better every day\".",
				"The famous \"Wings of Man\" campaign in the late 1960s was created by advertising agency Young & Rubicam, and restored Eastern's tarnished image until the late 1970s, when former astronaut Frank Borman became president and it was replaced by a new campaign, \"We Have To Earn Our Wings Every Day\". The new campaign, which featured Borman as a spokesperson, was used until the mid-to-late 1980s."
