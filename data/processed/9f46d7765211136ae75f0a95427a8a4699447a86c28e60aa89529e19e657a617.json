				"previous": "The programme was launched the following day[36] off the back of orders for 96 aircraft from five customers. Air France was the first customer for the type, having placed an order for 50 aircraft, split evenly between firm and options, between 16 A320-100s and 34 -200s.[26] However, British Caledonian was the first to place a firm order for seven back in October 1983.[37] Cyprus Airways became the first to place order for V2500-powered A320s in November 1984.[38] Pan Am also selected V2500 when it requested 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985, as did Inex Adria.[37] The most significant order was to come, when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986, later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, powered by CFM56 engines.[39]",
				"after": "The first Airbus A320 was rolled out on 14 February 1987 amid dry ice and laser beams as part of a spectacular unveiling ceremony.[40][41] A number of high-profile figures were present, including the Prince and Princess of Wales.[42] The first flight came on 22 February,[41] during which the aircraft flew for 3 hours 23 minutes.[36] The flight marked the beginning of a flight test programme involving 1,200 airborne hours on 530 flights.[40] European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification was received on 26 February 1988.[40] The first A320 delivery was to Air France on 26 March 1988.[40]",
