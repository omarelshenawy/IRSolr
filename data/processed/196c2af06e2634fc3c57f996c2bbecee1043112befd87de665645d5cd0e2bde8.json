				"previous": "The 1958 Commonwealth Games were hosted by Cardiff. The Games involved 1,130 athletes from 35 national teams competing in 94 events.[186] One of the venues for those GamesâThe Wales Empire Swimming Poolâwas demolished in 1998 to make way for the Millennium Stadium. The GBP32m Cardiff International Pool in Cardiff Bay, opened to the public on 12 January 2008âpart of the GBP1bn International Sports Village (ISV)âis the only Olympic-standard swimming pool in Wales. When complete, the ISV complex will provide Olympic standard facilities for sports including boxing and fencing, gymnastics, judo, white water events (including canoeing and kayaking) and wrestling as well as a snow dome with real snow for skiing and snowboarding, an Arena for public ice skating and ice hockey and an hotel.[187][188] Some of the sports facilities at the ISV will be used as training venues for the London 2012 Olympics.[189]",
				"after": "The Millennium Stadium hosts motorsport events such as the World Rally Championship, as part of Wales Rally GB. The first ever indoor special stages of the World Rally Championship were held at the Millennium Stadium in September 2005 and have been an annual event sincve then.[190] The British Speedway Grand Prix, one of the World Championship events, is held at the Millennium Stadium.[183] While the trackâa temporary, purpose built, shale ovalâis not universally loved, the venue is considered the best of the World Championship's 11 rounds.[191]",
