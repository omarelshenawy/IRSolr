				"previous": "One of the oldest buildings in Herne Bay is the late 18th-century inn, The Ship, which served as the focal point for the small shipping and farming community which first inhabited the town. During this time, passenger and cargo boats regularly ran between Herne Bay and London and boats carrying coal ran from Newcastle. From Herne was easy access by road to the city of Canterbury or to Dover, where further passage by boat could then be obtained across the English Channel to France.[3]",
				"after": "The 1801 census recorded Herne Bay, including Herne, as having a population of 1,232.[4] During the early 19th century, a smugglers' gang operated from the town.[5] The gang were regularly involved in a series of fights with the preventive services until finally being overpowered in the 1820s.[4] In the 1830s, a group of London investors, who recognised Herne Bay's potential as a seaside resort, built a wooden pier and a promenade on the town's seafront. This and the subsequent building of a railway station led to the rapid expansion of the town; between 1831 and 1841 the town's population grew from 1,876 to 3,041.[4] The London businessmen intended to rename the town St Augustine's, but the name was unpopular with residents and the \"Herne Bay\" remained.[6] In 1833, an Act of Parliament established Herne Bay and Herne as separate towns.[7] Local landowner Sir Henry Oxenden donated a piece of ground for the site of the town's first church,[8] Christ Church, which was opened in 1834.[3] In 1837, Mrs Ann Thwaytes, a wealthy lady from London, donated around Â£4,000 to build a 75 feet (23Â m) clock tower on the town's seafront.[8] It is believed to be the first freestanding purpose built clock tower in the world.[3]",
