				"after": "Based on the few fully mature specimens,[3] Deinonychus could reach 3.4 metres (11.2Â ft) in length, with a skull length of 410Â mm (16.1Â in), a hip height of 0.87 metres (2.9Â ft) and a weight of 73Â kg (161Â lb), though there is a higher estimate of 100Â kg (220Â lb).[4][5] The skull was equipped with powerful jaws lined with around seventy curved, blade-like teeth. Studies of the skull have progressed a great deal over the decades. Ostrom reconstructed the partial, imperfectly preserved skulls that he had as triangular, broad, and fairly similar to Allosaurus. Additional Deinonychus skull material and closely related species found with good three-dimensional preservation[6] show that the palate was more vaulted than Ostrom thought, making the snout far narrower, while the jugals flared broadly, giving greater stereoscopic vision. The skull of Deinonychus was different from that of Velociraptor, however, in that it had a more robust skull roof, like that of Dromaeosaurus, and did not have the depressed nasals of Velociraptor.[7] Both the skull and the lower jaw had fenestrae (skull openings) which reduced the weight of the skull. In Deinonychus, the antorbital fenestra, a skull opening between the eye and nostril, was particularly large.[6]",
