				"after": "The aesthetic and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked the sense of grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia â to testify for its past greatness. Sukarno made a point of showing the site to foreign dignitaries. While Suharto regime â realized its important symbolic and economic meanings â diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contains a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and gamelan music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.[89]",
