Some 300Â t (300,000Â kg) of dried whole threads and powder are gleaned yearly,[14] of which 50Â t (50,000Â kg) is top-grade \"coupe\" saffron.[76] Iran answers for around 90â93% of global production and exports much of it.[16] A few of Iran's drier eastern and southeastern provinces, including Fars, Kerman, and those in the Khorasan region, glean the bulk of modern global production. In 2005, the second-ranked Greece produced 5.7Â t (5,700Â kg), while Morocco and Kashmir, tied for third rank, each produced 2.3Â t (2,300Â kg).[16]",
