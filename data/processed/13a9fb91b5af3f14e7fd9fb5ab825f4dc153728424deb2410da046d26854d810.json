It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion.[4][24] Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.[13]",
