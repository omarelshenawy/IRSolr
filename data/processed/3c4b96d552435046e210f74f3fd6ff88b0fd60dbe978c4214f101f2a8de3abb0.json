Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America.[5] Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.Â argyrosperma, C.Â ficifolia, C.Â moschata, and C.Â pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.Â maxima, these events occurred in South America.[8]",
