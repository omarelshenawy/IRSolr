				"previous": "In 2010, the Italian Air Force announced the development of an electronic warfare package for its C-27 fleet under the jamming and electronic defence instrumentation (Jedi) program. One publicised ability of the aircraft is the disruption of radio communications and, in particular, remote detonators commonly used on improvised explosive devices (IEDs).[89] The EC-27 has been compared to the capabilities of the USAF's Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call.[90]",
