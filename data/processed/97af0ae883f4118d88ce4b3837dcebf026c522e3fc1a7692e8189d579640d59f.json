				"previous": "Between 1985 and 1986 further excavations under Niall Sharples were prompted by the hill fort's deteriorating condition, partly caused by the large number of visitors to the site. Under the auspices of English Heritage, repair work and archaeological investigations were undertaken concurrently.[79][80] Techniques such as radiocarbon dating were available to Sharples that were unavailable to Wheeler, allowing the site to be dated.[81] The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1997, giving Maiden Castle protection against unauthorised change; it is now maintained by English Heritage.[1][82] With parking facilities and information boards for visitors, Maiden Castle is open to the public all year round.[30] Today, the site is in the civil parish of Winterborne Monkton at grid reference SY66938848.[1]",
