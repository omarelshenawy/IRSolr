				"previous": "To boost Kentucky's image, give it a consistent reach, and help it \"stand out from the crowd\", former Governor Ernie Fletcher launched a comprehensive branding campaign at some later point in time[when?] with the hope of making the state's $12â14 million advertising budget more effective.[citation needed] The resulting \"Unbridled Spirit\" brand was the result of a $500,000 contract with New West, a Kentucky-based public relations advertising and marketing firm to develop a viable brand and tag line.[99] The Fletcher administration aggressively marketed the brand in both the public and private sectors. Since that time, the \"Welcome to Kentucky\" signs at border areas have an \"Unbridled Spirit\" symbol on them.",
