				"after": "MirÃ³ initially went to business school as well as art school. He began his working career when he was a teenager as a clerk, although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown.[6] His early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists exhibited in Barcelona, was inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul CÃ©zanne. The resemblance of MirÃ³'s work to that of the intermediate generation of the avant-garde has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period.[7]",
