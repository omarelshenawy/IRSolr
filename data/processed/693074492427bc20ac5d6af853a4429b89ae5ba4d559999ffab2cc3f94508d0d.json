It is called the Hoover Historical Center, and is dedicated to the history of the Hoover company in Canton. The museum exhibits include a number of non-Hoover hand-operated vacuum cleaners from before the company started, and displays of Hoover products throughout the company's history. Also on display are some of the munitions the company produced during World War II to help the war effort, and items personal to the Hoover family.",
