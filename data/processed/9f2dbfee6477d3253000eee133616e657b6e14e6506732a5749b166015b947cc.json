				"after": "Spain is one of the world's leading countries in the development and production of renewable energy. In 2010 Spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the United States with a massive power station plant called La Florida, near Alvarado, Badajoz.[117][118] Spain is also Europe's main producer of wind energy. In 2010 its wind turbines generated 42,976 GWh, which accounted for 16.4% of all electrical energy produced in Spain.[119][120][121] On 9 November 2010, wind energy reached an instantaneous historic peak covering 53% of mainland electricity demand[122] and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors.[123] Other renewable energies used in Spain are hydroelectric, biomass and marine (2 power plants under construction).[124]",
