				"previous": "The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the 53Â millionÂ U.S.Â gallons (204,000Â m3) of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177Â underground tanks. As of 1998 about a third of these tanks had leaked waste into the soil and groundwater.[76] As of 2008[update], most of the liquid waste has been transferred to more secure double-shelled tanks; however, 2.8Â millionÂ U.S.Â gallons (10,600Â m3) of liquid waste, together with 27Â millionÂ U.S.Â gallons (100,000Â m3) of salt cake and sludge, remains in the single-shelled tanks.[4] DOE lacks information about the extent to which the 27 double-shell tanks may be susceptible to corrosion. Without determining the extent to which the factors that contributed to the leak in AY-102 were similar to the other 27 double-shell tanks, DOE cannot be sure how long its double-shell tanks can safely store waste.[6] That waste was originally scheduled to be removed by 2018. As of 2008[update], the revised deadline was 2040.[74] Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270Â billionÂ U.S.Â gallons (1Â billionÂ m3) of contaminated groundwater as a result of the leaks.[77] As of 2008[update], 1Â millionÂ U.S.Â gallons (4,000Â m3) of highly[clarification needed] radioactive waste is traveling through the groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule.[4] The site includes 25Â million cubic feet (710,000Â m3) of solid radioactive waste.[77]",
				"after": "Under the Tri-Party Agreement, lower-level hazardous wastes are buried in huge lined pits that will be sealed and monitored with sophisticated instruments for many years. Disposal of plutonium and other high-level wastes is a more difficult problem that continues to be a subject of intense debate. As an example, plutonium has a half-life of 24,100 years, and a decay of ten half-lives is required before a sample is considered to cease its radioactivity.[78][79] In 2011 the Department of Energy started building a vitrification plant to combine the dangerous wastes with glass to render them stable. Bechtel, a San Francisco-based construction and engineering firm, has been hired to construct the vitrification plant. It was originally scheduled to be operational by 2011, with vitrification completed by 2028.[74][80][81] As of 2012, according to a study by the General Accounting Office, there were a number of serious unresolved technical and managerial problems.[82] As of 2013[update] estimated costs were $13.4Â billion with commencement of operations estimated to be in 2022 and about 3 decades of operation.[83]",
