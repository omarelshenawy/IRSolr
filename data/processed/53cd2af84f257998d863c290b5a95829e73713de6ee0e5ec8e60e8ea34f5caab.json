The first replacement entered service at the end of 2007. It plans to convert the -200s into freighter versions to 'develop Transaero's cargo traffic'.[36] In April 2010, Transaero arranged to lease 9 ex-Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 which are to enter the fleet in 2010â2012.[37] In December 2010, Transaero announced that they would increase their deal to 12 Boeing 747-400.[7] Transaero also ordered 4 Boeing 787s on 26 December 2011,[38] confirming this order on 8 April 2012.[39]"
