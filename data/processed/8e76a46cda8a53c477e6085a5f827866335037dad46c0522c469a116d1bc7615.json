				"after": "Santana is a rock band based around guitarist Carlos Santana and founded in the late 1960s. It first came to public attention after performing at the Woodstock Festival in 1969, when the band's Latin rock provided a contrast to other acts on the bill. This initial exposure made its first, eponymous album a hit at the time, followed in the next two years by successful follow-ups Abraxas and Santana III.",
