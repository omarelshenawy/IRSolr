				"after": "Rainbow trout and steelhead are highly regarded game fish. Rainbow trout are a popular target for fly fishers, and several angling methods are used. The use of lures presented via spinning, casting or trolling techniques is common. Rainbow trout can also be caught on various live and dead natural baits. The International Game Fish Association recognizes the world record for rainbow trout as a fish caught on Saskatchewan's Lake Diefenbaker by Sean Konrad on SeptemberÂ 5, 2009. The fish weighed 48Â lb (22Â kg) and was a genetically modified hatchery escapee.[92] Many anglers consider the rainbow trout the hardest-fighting trout species, as this fish is known for leaping when hooked and putting up a powerful struggle.[93] It is considered one of the top five sport fish in North America and the most important game fish west of the Rocky Mountains.[25]",
