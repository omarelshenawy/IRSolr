				"previous": "According to the UNHCR, Uganda hosted over 190,000 refugees in 2013. Most of the latter came from neighbouring countries in the African Great Lakes region, namely Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Sudan.[109]",
				"after": "Around forty different languages are regularly and currently in use in the country. These fall into two main language families: Niger-Congo (Bantu branch) and Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic and Central Sudanic branches). English became the official language of Uganda after independence, and Ugandan English is a local variant dialect. Additionally, all Ugandan schools and universities are required by law to teach in English. Despite this, 72% of Ugandans speak no English, 22% speak at least some English, and 6% speak English fluently.",
