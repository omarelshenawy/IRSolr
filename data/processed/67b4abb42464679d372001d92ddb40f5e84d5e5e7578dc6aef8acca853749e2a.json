				"after": "On SeptemberÂ 16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PS3s, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so.[102][103] Top500's fastest supercomputer at the time was BlueGene/L, at 0.280 petaFLOPS.[104] The following year, on MayÂ 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS,[105] followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on AugustÂ 20[106][107] and SeptemberÂ 28, 2008 respectively.[108] On FebruaryÂ 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS,[109][110] and was the first computing project to meet these five levels.[111][112] In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was IBM's Roadrunner at 1.105 petaFLOPS.[113] On NovemberÂ 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS.[103][114] In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS.[115] Its current performance of 40.2 x86 petaFLOPS and 14.4 native petaFLOPS is given above.",
