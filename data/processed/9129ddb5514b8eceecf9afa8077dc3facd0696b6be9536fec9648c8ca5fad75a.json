				"after": "One of the best-known sauropods, Diplodocus was a very large long-necked quadrupedal animal, with a long, whip-like tail. Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hind limbs, resulting in a largely horizontal posture. The long-necked, long-tailed animal with four sturdy legs has been mechanically compared with a suspension bridge.[6] In fact, Diplodocus is the longest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton.[6] The partial remains of D. hallorum have increased the estimated length, though not as much as previously thought; when first described in 1991, discoverer David Gillette calculated it may have been up to 52Â m (170Â ft) long,[7] making it the longest known dinosaur (excluding those known from exceedingly poor remains, such as Amphicoelias). Some weight estimates ranged as high as 113 tons (125 US short tons). The estimated length was later revised downward to 33 metres (108Â ft)[8] based on findings that show that Gillette had originally misplaced vertebrae 12â19 as vertebrae 20â27. The nearly complete Diplodocus skeleton at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on which estimates of Seismosaurus are based, also was found to have had its 13th tail vertebra come from another dinosaur, throwing size estimates for Seismosaurus further off. While dinosaurs such as Supersaurus were probably longer, fossil remains of these animals are only fragmentary.[9] Modern mass estimates for Diplodocus (exclusive of D. hallorum) have tended to be in the 10 to 16Â tonne (11â17.6Â ton) range: 10Â tonnes (11Â tons);[10] 11.5 tonnes (12.7 tons);[11] 12.7Â tonnes (14Â tons);[12] and 16Â tonnes (17.6Â tons).[13]",
