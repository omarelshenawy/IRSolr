				"after": "The Olympic marmot is the second-rarest North American marmot, behind the critically endangered Vancouver Island marmot.[20][38] Marmots were first sighted in the Olympic Peninsula in the 1880s.[20] In the 1960s, David P. Barash conducted a three-year study of Olympic marmots after which he reported that there was an abundance of marmots in the mountains. In 1989, the total Olympic marmot population was calculated to be only about 2,000, but this low number was due to poor data collection. Other than this population census, little further research was done on the Olympic marmot until the late 1990s, when concerns arose about population status.[17][20]",
