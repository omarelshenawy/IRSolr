				"previous": "The solution of this equation for x in terms of t is found by using its characteristic equation",
				"after": "which can be found by stacking into matrix form a set of equations consisting of the above difference equation and the kâ1 equations giving a k-dimensional system of the first order in the stacked variable vector in terms of its once-lagged value, and taking the characteristic equation of this system's matrix. This equation gives k characteristic roots for use in the solution equation",
