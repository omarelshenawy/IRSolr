				"previous": "An adherent of environmental determinism was the medieval Afro-Arab writer al-Jahiz (776â869), who explained how the environment can determine the physical characteristics of the inhabitants of a certain community. He used his early theory of evolution to explain the origins of different human skin colors, particularly black skin, which he believed to be the result of the environment. He cited a stony region of black basalt in the northern Najd as evidence for his theory.[49]",
