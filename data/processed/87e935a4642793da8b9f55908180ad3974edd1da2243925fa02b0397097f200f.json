It was required to cruise at 300Â mph (260Â knots, 480Â km/h) at 34,000Â feet (10,400Â m) with a combat radius of 5,000Â miles (4,300Â nautical miles, 8,000Â km). The armament was to consist of an unspecified number of 20Â mm cannon and 10,000Â pounds (4,500Â kg) of bombs.[13] On 13 February 1946, the Air Force issued bid invitations for these specifications, with Boeing, Consolidated Aircraft, and Glenn L. Martin Company submitting proposals.[13]",
