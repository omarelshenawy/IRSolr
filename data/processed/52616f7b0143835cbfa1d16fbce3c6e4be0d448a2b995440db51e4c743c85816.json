				"after": "\"4 Minutes\", by American singer-songwriter Madonna (pictured), was released as the lead single of her eleventh studio album Hard Candy (2008), featuring vocals by American singers Justin Timberlake and Timbaland. The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Madonna her 37th top-ten single and breaking the all-time record previously held by Elvis Presley. It also received positive reviews and topped the charts in twenty-one countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. An uptempo dance-pop song with an urban and hip hop style, \"4 Minutes\" incorporates Timbaland's characteristic bhangra beats, with brass, foghorns and cowbells. It was performed by Madonna on the promotional tour for Hard Candy and the 2008â09 Sticky & Sweet Tour. The song received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical at the 2009 ceremony. In the accompanying music video, Madonna and Timberlake are running away from a giant black screen that devours everything in its path, including them, in the end. She cited the song as the inspiration for the documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). (FullÂ article...)",
