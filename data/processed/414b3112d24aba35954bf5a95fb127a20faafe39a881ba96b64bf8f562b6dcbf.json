				"previous": "If the sum of the geometric multiplicities of all eigenvalues is exactly , then has a set of linearly independent eigenvectors. Let be a square matrix whose columns are those eigenvectors, in any order. Then we will have , where is the diagonal matrix such that is the eigenvalue associated to column of . Since the columns of are linearly independent, the matrix is invertible. Premultiplying both sides by we get . By definition, therefore, the matrix is diagonalizable.",
				"after": "If is diagonalizable, the space of all -coordinate vectors can be decomposed into the direct sum of the eigenspaces of . This decomposition is called the eigendecomposition of , and it is preserved under change of coordinates.",
