				"previous": "The Era also lavishly praised Emma Howson as Josephine.[112] The Entr'acte and Limelight commented that the opera was reminiscent of Trial by Jury and Sorcerer but found it diverting and called the music \"very charming. To hear so-called grand opera imitated through the medium of the most trifling lyrics, is funny\".[113][114] The paper praised Grossmith as Sir Joseph, noting with amusement that he was made up to look like portraits of Horatio Nelson, \"and his good introductory song seems levelled at\" W. H. Smith. It opined, further, that \"He Is an Englishman\" is \"an excellent satire on the proposition that a man must necessarily be virtuous to be English\". It found the piece, as a whole, well presented and predicted that it would have a long run.[113]",
				"after": "Similarly, The Illustrated London News concluded that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert's \"caustic humour and quaint satire\". It found that there was \"much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hitsÂ .... Dr. Sullivan's music is as lively as the text to which it is set, with here and there a touch of sentimental expressionÂ .... The piece is well performed throughout.\"[115] The Daily News, The Globe, The Times (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and The Standard concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, \"adds to the reality of the illusion\".[11] The Times also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a \"national musical stage\" with a libretto free from risquÃ© French \"improprieties\" and without the \"aid\" of Italian and German musical models.[116]",
