Terminal B reopened after a $130 million renovation in December 2014, with Delta, United, Southwest, and Spirit as its tenants (with all operations moved in by February 2015).[15] After renovation of Terminal B is complete, Terminal C is expected to close, and is planned to reopen in December 2015; no tenants have been announced so far.
