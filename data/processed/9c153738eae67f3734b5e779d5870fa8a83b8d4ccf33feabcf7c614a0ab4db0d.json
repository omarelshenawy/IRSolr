				"Four ships of the United States Navy, including two battleships, have been named USS Washington in honor of the state. Previous ships had held that name in honor of George Washington.",
				"The state's nickname \"Evergreen\" was proposed in 1890 by Charles T. Conover of Seattle, Washington. The name proved popular as the forests were full of evergreen trees and the abundance of rain keeps the shrubbery and grasses green throughout the year.[95] Although that nickname is widely used by the state, appearing on vehicle license plates for instance, it has not been officially adopted.[96] The publicly funded Evergreen State College in Olympia also takes its name from this nickname."
