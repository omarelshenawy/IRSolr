				"after": "The Rova compound extends to just less than one hectare (approximately two acres), spanning 116 metres (381Â ft) north to south and over 61 metres (200Â ft) from east to west.[16] A barricade of thick wooden posts with sharpened ends surrounded the compound until 1897 when it was replaced with a brick wall on the orders of General Gallieni. Entered via a stone stairway leading to a large north-facing gate built by James Cameron in 1845, this portal is topped by a bronze voromahery (eagle) imported from France by Jean Laborde in 1840.[39] Beyond the gate lies an open dirt courtyard approximately 37 metres (121Â ft) square, with the far end opposite the gate delimited by the northern face and entrance of Manjakamiadana.[16] Over time, the Rova compound has contained several key buildings of political and historical significance, including five palaces, a chapel and nine tombs.[37]",
