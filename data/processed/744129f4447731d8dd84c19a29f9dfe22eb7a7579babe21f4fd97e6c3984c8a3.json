				"after": "The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of Queen Victoria's reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was a long period of prosperity for the British people, as profits gained from the overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home, allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend the beginning of the periodâas defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victoriansâback five years to the passage of the Reform Act 1832.",
