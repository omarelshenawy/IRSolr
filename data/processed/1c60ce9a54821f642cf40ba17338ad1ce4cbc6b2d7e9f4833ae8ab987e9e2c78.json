The collection included prints of the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.[34] The glass photographic plates were bought for Â£6,000 by an unnamed buyer at a London auction held in 2001.[35]",
