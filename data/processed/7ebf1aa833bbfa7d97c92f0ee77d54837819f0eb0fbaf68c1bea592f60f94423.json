				"after": "Squirrels are generally small animals, ranging in size from the African pygmy squirrel at 7â10Â cm (2.8â3.9Â in) in length and just 10Â g (0.35Â oz) in weight, to the Alpine marmot, which is 53â73Â cm (21â29Â in) long and weighs from 5 to 8Â kg (11 to 18Â lb). Squirrels typically have slender bodies with bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is soft and silky, although much thicker in some species than others. The color of squirrels is highly variable betweenâand often even withinâspecies.[5]",
