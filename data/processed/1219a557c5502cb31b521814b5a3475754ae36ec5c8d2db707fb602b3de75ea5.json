				"previous": "The mistle thrush is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight consists of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.[9]",
				"after": "Mistle thrushes breed in the year subsequent to their hatching;[12] they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory.[20] Their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes;[9] although the nest territory is only about 0.6Â ha (1.5Â acres), around 15â17Â ha (37â42Â acres) is used for feeding. Territories are normally reoccupied in subsequent years.[3] Territories are larger in woods than in farmland.[19] The male will attack intruders into its breeding area, including birds of prey and corvids,[9] and sometimes cats or humans.[15] Courtship feeding of the female by her partner has sometimes been observed.[21] Breeding typically commences in mid-March in the south and west of Europe (late February in Britain), but not till early May in Finland.[14] The nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk, although hedges, ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used. The nest site may be up to 20Â m (66Â ft) above the ground, although 2â9Â m (6.5â30Â ft) is more typical. The common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush, the vigilance of the finch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush's nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, coated on the inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help.[3][9][14] Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.[15]",
