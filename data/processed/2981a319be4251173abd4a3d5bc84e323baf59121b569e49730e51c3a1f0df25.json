				"Its headquarters are in the Brewster Building in Long Island City, New York.[42][43]",
				"JetBlue previously had its headquarters in the Forest Hills Tower in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City.[77][78] The previous Forest Hills facility is 6 miles (9.7Â km) from the current office in Long Island City.[79] In the summer of 2001 the airline announced that it wanted to take 74,000 square feet (6,900Â m2) of space in the Forest Hills Tower. By December 2002 the airline announced that it planned to increase its leased space and use contiguous and efficient floor plates. Steven Cuozzo of the New York Post said that the JetBlue plan was \"possibly the largest office lease\" in Queens in 2002. In December 2002 between 600 and 800 JetBlue employees worked at the Forest Hills Tower. Prior to the move to the Forest Hills Tower, the airline headquarters were across the street, at 80â02 Kew Gardens Rd.[78]"
