				"previous": "In order to promote Greek studies, Manutius founded an academy of Hellenists in 1502 called the \"New Academy.\" Its rules were written in Greek, its members were obliged to speak Greek, their names were Hellenized, and their official titles were Greek. Members of the \"New Academy\" included Desiderius Erasmus and the Englishman Thomas Linacre.",
				"after": "When Manutius died in Venice, bequeathing Greek literature as an inalienable possession to the world, he was a poor man. Manutius' successors continued his enthusiasm for Greek literature by printing the first editions of Pausanias, Strabo, Aeschylus, Galen, Hippocrates, and Longinus.",
