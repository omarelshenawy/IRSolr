				"IBM Research is IBM's research and development division. It is the largest industrial research organization in the world, with twelve labs on six continents.[1]",
				"The roots of today's IBM Research began with the 1945 opening of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University.[2] This was the first IBM laboratory devoted to pure science and later expanded into additional IBM Research locations in Westchester County, New York starting in the 1950s,[3][4] including the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1961.[3][4]"
