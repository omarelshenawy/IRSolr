Although Billboard magazine operated under different methodologies for the bulk of Crosby's career, his chart numbers remain astonishing: 396 chart singles, including 41 No.Â 1 hits.[39] If you count the multiple times \"White Christmas\" charted, that would bring that number up to 43 - more than The Beatles and Elvis combined.[39] Crosby had separate charting singles in every calendar year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of \"White Christmas\" extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. It is widely believed (although overlooked) that Crosby is the best selling recording artist ever, with plus or minus 1 billion singles sold.[39][40] Billboard's statistician Joel Whitburn determined Crosby to be America's most successful recording act of the 1930s, and again in the 1940s.",
