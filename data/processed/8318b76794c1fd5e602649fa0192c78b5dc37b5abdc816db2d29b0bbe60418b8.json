				"after": "The St. Paul campus is in the city of Falcon Heights, about 5 miles (8.0Â km) away from the Minneapolis campus. Despite this, all campus buildings have St. Paul street addresses. The College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, including the University of Minnesota Food Industry Center and many other disciplines from social sciences to vocational education are located on this campus. This also includes the College of Continuing Education,[16] College of Veterinary Medicine,[17] and the College of Biological Sciences.[18] The extensive lawns, flowers, trees, woods, and the surrounding University research farm plots creates a greener and quieter campus. It has a grassy mall of its own and can be a bit of a retreat from the more-urban Minneapolis campus. Prominent on this campus is Bailey Hall, the St. Paul campus's only residence hall. There are campus connectors running every 5 minutes on the weekdays when school is in session, and every 20 minutes on weekends, allowing students easy access to both campuses.",
