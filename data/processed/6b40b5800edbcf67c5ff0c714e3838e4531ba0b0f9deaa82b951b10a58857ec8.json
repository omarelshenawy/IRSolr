				"previous": "GB Airways operated a service between Gibraltar and London and other cities for many years. The airline initially flew under the name \"Gibraltar Airways\". In 1989, and in anticipation of service to cities outside the UK, Gibraltar Airways changed its name to GB Airways with the belief that a new name would incur fewer political problems. As a franchise, the airline operated flights in full British Airways livery. In 2007Â GB Airways was purchased by easyJet[84] which began operating flights under their name in April 2008 when British Airways re-introduced flights to Gibraltar under their name. Monarch Airlines operates a daily scheduled service between Gibraltar and Luton and Manchester. The Spanish national airline, Iberia, operated a daily service to Madrid which ceased due to lack of demand. In May 2009 Ãndalus LÃ­neas AÃ©reas opened a Spanish service[85] which also ceased operations in March 2010.[86] An annual return charter flight to Malta is operated by Maltese national airline, Air Malta.",
