For example, the fork-marked lemurs were initially placed in Lemur and then in Microcebus with the mouse lemurs before being placed in their own genus Phaner,[74][75][76][77] and Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major split the Cheirogaleus medius species group of the dwarf lemurs into a separate genus Opolemur, but this was not accepted.[78][77] Genus-level taxonomy was largely stabilized by Schwarz in 1931,[25] but a number of later changes have become accepted:",
