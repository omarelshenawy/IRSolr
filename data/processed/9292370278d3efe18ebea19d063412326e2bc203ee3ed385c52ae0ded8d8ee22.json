				"after": "Breeding takes place during the spring and summer. Following copulation, the female lays eggs on a daily basis over a period of several days. If an egg is lost during this time, she will lay another to replace it. There are normally four or five eggs that are ovoid in shape and pale blue or occasionally white, and they commonly have a glossy appearance.[28] The colour of the eggs seems to have evolved through the relatively good visibility of blue at low light levels.[46] The egg size is 26.5â34.5Â mm (1.04â1.36Â in) in length and 20.0â22.5Â mm (0.79â0.89Â in) in maximum diameter.[14]",
