				"after": "Grand Forks International Airport (GFK, KGFK) is served by Delta Air Lines with several daily round trips to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport; and Allegiant Air, which operates flights a few times a week to Mesa, Arizona (Phoenix-Gateway), Sanford, Florida (Orlando-Sanford) and Las Vegas, Nevada. A new passenger terminal was completed in early 2011, adding additional space to allow more passengers to come through the airport as well as providing the airport with better circulation, a new baggage claim as well as addressing additional security and safety concerns necessary to complete the new terminal project. The airport is a major distribution center for FedEx, which conducts flights daily within the state and northern Minnesota. The airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, due in large measure to the presence of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences of the University of North Dakota.[96]",
