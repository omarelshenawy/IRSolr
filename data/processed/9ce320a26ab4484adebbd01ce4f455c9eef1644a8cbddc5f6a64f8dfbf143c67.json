				"previous": "Lemurs vary greatly in size. They include the smallest primates in the world and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently range in size from about 30Â g (1.1Â oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7â9Â kg (15â20Â lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema).[62][63] When recently extinct species are considered, the size range extended up to that of a gorilla at 160â200Â kg (350â440Â lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.[12][33]",
				"after": "Like all primates, lemurs have five divergent digits with nails (in most cases) on their hands and feet. Most lemurs possess a laterally compressed, elongated nail, called a toilet-claw, on the second toe and use it for scratching and grooming.[53][64] In addition to the toilet-claw, lemurs share a variety of other traits with other strepsirrhine primates, which include a rhinarium (or \"wet nose\"); a fully functional vomeronasal organ, which detects pheromones; a postorbital bar and the lack of postorbital closure (a wall of thin bone behind the eye); orbits (bony sockets that enclose the eye) that are not fully facing forward; left and right mandible (lower jaw) bones that are not fully fused; and a small brain-to-body mass ratio.[20][65]",
