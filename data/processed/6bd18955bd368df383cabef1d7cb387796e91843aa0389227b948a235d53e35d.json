				"previous": "On 17 August 1938, Hitler declared that the SS-VT would have a role in domestic as well as foreign affairs, which transformed this growing armed force into the rival that the army had feared.[21] He decreed that service in the SS-VT qualified to fulfill military service obligations, although service in the SS-TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde or SS-TV would not. Some units of the SS-TV would, in the case of war, be used as reserves for the SS-VT, which did not have its own reserves.[22] For all its training, the SS-VT was untested in combat. This changed in 1938, when two opportunities arose with the Anschluss of Austria in March and the occupation of the Sudetenland in October. A battalion of the Leibstandarte was chosen to accompany the Army troops in occupying Austria, and the three regiments of the SS-VT participated in the occupation of the Sudetenland. In both actions no resistance was met.[20][22]",
			"after": [
				"Himmler's military formations at the outbreak of the war comprised several subgroups which would become the basis of the Waffen-SS.",
				"In August 1939, Hitler placed the Leibstandarte and the SS-VT under the operational control of the Army High Command (OKH). Himmler retained command of the Totenkopfstandarten, for employment behind the advancing combat units in what were euphemistically called \"police and security duties\"."
