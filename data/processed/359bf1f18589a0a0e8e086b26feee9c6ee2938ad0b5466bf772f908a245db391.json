				"previous": "In July 2013, the C-130J became part of a competition in the Peruvian Air Force for a medium transport aircraft. The Super Hercules was a candidate along with the EADS CASA C-295, the Alenia C-27J Spartan, the Antonov An-70, and the upgraded Antonov An-32.[59] The Peruvian Air Force selected the C-27J in November 2013.[60] As of December 2014 the Peruvian Air Force is still considering the C-130J to replace its aging L-100s and to operate alongside its 4 C-27Js currently in order.[citation needed]",
