				"previous": "The Latin name Iuppiter originated as a vocative compound of the Old Latin vocative *Iou and pater (\"father\") and came to replace the Old Latin nominative case *Ious. Jove[105] is a less common English formation based on Iov-, the stem of oblique cases of the Latin name. Linguistic studies identify the form *Iou-pater as deriving from the Indo-European vocative compound *DyÄu-pÉter (meaning \"O Father Sky-god\"; nominative: *DyÄus-pÉtÄr).[106]",
				"after": "Older forms of the deity's name in Rome were Dieus-pater (\"day/sky-father\"), then DiÃ©spiter.[107] The 19th-century philologist Georg Wissowa asserted these names are conceptually- and linguistically-connected to Diovis and Diovis Pater; he compares the analogous formations Vedius-Veiove and fulgur Dium, as opposed to fulgur Summanum (nocturnal lightning bolt) and flamen Dialis (based on Dius, dies).[108] The Ancient later viewed them as entities separate from Jupiter. The terms are similar in etymology and semantics (dies, \"daylight\" and Dius, \"daytime sky\"), but differ linguistically. Wissowa considers the epithet Dianus noteworthy.[109][110] Dieus is the etymological equivalent of ancient Greece's Zeus and of the Teutonics' Ziu (genitive Ziewes). The Indo-European deity is the god from which the names and partially the theology of Jupiter, Zeus and the Indo-Aryan Vedic Dyaus Pita derive or have developed.[111]",
