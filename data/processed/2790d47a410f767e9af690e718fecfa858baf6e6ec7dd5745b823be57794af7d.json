The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side-flow weir with each spillway containing four 100Â ft (30Â m) long and 16Â ft (4.9Â m) high steel drum gates. Each gate weighs 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000Â kg) and can be operated manually or automatically. Gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions. The gates are unable to entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but are able to maintain an extra 16Â ft (4.9Â m) of lake level.[92] Water flowing over the spillways drops dramatically into 600Â ft (180Â m) long, 50Â ft (15Â m) wide spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels, and reentering the main river channel below the dam. This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate 700Â ft (210Â m) elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges. Each spillway's capacity of 200,000Â cuÂ ft/s (5,700Â m3/s) was empirically verified in post construction tests in 1941.[92]",
