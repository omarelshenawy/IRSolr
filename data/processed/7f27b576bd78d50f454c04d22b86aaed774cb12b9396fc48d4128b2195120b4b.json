Some paintings, however, have been attributed to Peake on the basis of the method of inscribing the year and the sitter's age on his documented portrait of a \"military commander\" (1592), which reads: \"M.BY.RO.| PEAKE\" (\"made by Robert Peake\").[27] Art historian Ellis Waterhouse, however, suspected that the letterer may have worked for more than one studio.[28]",
