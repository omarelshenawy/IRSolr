Aeroflot had by the end of 1945 carried 537,000 passengers, compared with 359,000 in 1940.[10]:16 The government made it a priority in the immediate postwar years to expand services from Moscow to the capital of the Union republics, in addition to important industrial centres on the country. To enable this, the government transferred to Aeroflot a large number of Li-2s, and they would become the backbone of the fleet.[10]:17",
