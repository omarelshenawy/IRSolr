				"after": "Soon after the dam was authorized, increasing numbers of unemployed converged on southern Nevada. Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it.[29] A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters' camp. Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families.[30] Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as Ragtown.[31] Once construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932[32] and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934.[33] \"Mongolian\" (Chinese) labor was prevented by the construction contract,[33] while the number of blacks employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.[34]",
