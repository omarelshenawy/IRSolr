				"previous": "Therefore the integral may also be written as",
				"after": "This form suggests that if we can find a function Ï whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of Ï at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related to the study of the level surfaces of Ï. In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.",
