The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.[2] The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \"theatre\" as derived from the Ancient Greek Î¸Î­Î±ÏÏÎ¿Î½ (thÃ©atron, \"a place for viewing\"), itself from Î¸ÎµÎ¬Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹ (theÃ¡omai, \"to see\", \"to watch\", \"to observe\").",
