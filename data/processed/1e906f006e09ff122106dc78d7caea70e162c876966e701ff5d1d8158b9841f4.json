				"previous": "Johnson Creek begins near the unincorporated community of Cottrell, in Clackamas County, Oregon, southeast of Gresham in the foothills of the Cascade Range, and flows generally westward about 25 miles (40Â km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River.[3][5][6] The creek passes through the cities of Gresham, Portland, and Milwaukie and crosses the border between Clackamas County and Multnomah County eight times.[5][6]",
				"after": "For much of its course, the creek flows at almost right angles to the numbered avenues of southeast Portland and its eastern suburbs. As the creek descends, so do the avenue numbers. The creek begins in uplands in Clackamas County east of Southeast 362ndÂ Avenue and flows swiftly to the west for about 5 miles (8Â km), crisscrossing the border between Clackamas County and Multnomah County 5Â times in this upstream stretch, and passing under U.S. RouteÂ 26, the Mount Hood Highway, in Multnomah County at about 20 miles (32Â km) from the mouth. Shortly thereafter, it receives Badger Creek and Sunshine Creek from the left and the North Fork of Johnson Creek from the right.[5][6]",
