				"previous": "Heavily wooded and with abundant parks and water areas, the city has several prominent hills, such as \"Shadow Mountain\" and \"Turkey Mountain\", which create varied terrain, especially in its southern portions. While its central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, the Osage Hills extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape. Holmes Peak, north of the city, is the tallest point in the Tulsa Metro area at 1360Â ft (415Â m)[41] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 186.8 square miles (484Â km2), of which 182.6 square miles (473Â km2) of it is land and 4.2 square miles (11Â km2) of it (2.24%) is water.",
