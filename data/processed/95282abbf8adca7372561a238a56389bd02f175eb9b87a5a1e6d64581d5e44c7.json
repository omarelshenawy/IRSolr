				"after": "Sullivan never married, but the handsome composer[91] had serious love affairs with several women.[n 22] The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845â1882), the daughter of the engineer John Scott Russell. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union to a young composer with uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841â1878). Both relationships had ceased by early 1869.[168]",
