				"previous": "If G and H are Lie groups, then a Lie group homomorphism fÂ : G â H is a smooth group homomorphism. In the case of complex Lie groups, such a homomorphism is required to be a holomorphic map. However, these requirements are a bit stringent; over real or complex numbers, every continuous homomorphism between Lie groups turns out to be (real or complex) analytic.",
