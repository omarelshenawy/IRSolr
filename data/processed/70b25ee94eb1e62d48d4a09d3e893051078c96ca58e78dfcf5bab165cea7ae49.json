				"previous": "In his paper on massâenergy equivalence, Einstein produced EÂ =Â mc2 from his special relativity equations.[125] Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.[126][127]",
				"after": "In a 1905 paper,[128] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.",
