				"previous": "Inglis was involved with the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps (CUOTC), being commissioned a second lieutenant on 24 May 1909.[20] He served with the CUOTC's engineering detachment and noticed that when the unit was deployed on field days with the rest of the force it often had little to do.[7] To remedy this, Inglis designed a reusable steel bridge, with the intention that it could be erected and dismantled by the unit in a single afternoon.[7] An army general who was inspecting the unit noticed his design and offered advice: \"If you're making anything for the army, keep it simpleÂ â no complicated gadgets\".[2][7] Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Inglis volunteered for active service in the British Army and was officially listed as an Assistant Instructor in the School of Military Engineering, with the temporary rank of lieutenant.[21] The army expressed interest in Inglis' bridge design; it was approved for use by a panel of army officers that included the general who had first commented on the design, to whom Inglis said \"I hope, Sir, you will find I have profited by your advice\".[7] The design remained in service with the British Army until the higher-capacity Bailey bridge was introduced during the Second World War.[22][23]",
				"after": "The Inglis Bridge was designed so that all of its components could be moved by manpower alone; moreover, it could be erected with few tools in a short span of timeÂ â a troop of 40 sappers could erect a 60-foot (18Â m) bridge in 12 hours.[23] The design was composed of a series of 15-foot (4.6Â m) Warren truss bays made from tubular steel sections, to a maximum span of six bays (90 feet or 27 metres).[23] The design went through three revisions, with the Mark II replacing the original design's variable-length tubes with identical-length ones and, during the Second World War, the Mark III using higher strength steel but smaller tube diameters, increasing the carrying capacity to 26 long tons (26Â t).[22][23] In addition to his bridge design, during the war's course he developed the similar Inglis Tubular Observation Tower.[10] Inglis received a US Patent for his bridge on 25 April 1916 and for the type of joints used in it on 26 June 1917.[24][25]",
