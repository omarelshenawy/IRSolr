				"after": "In the decades since its liberation, Auschwitz has become a primary symbol of the Holocaust. Historian Timothy D. Snyder attributes this to the camp's high death toll as well as its \"unusual combination of an industrial camp complex and a killing facility\", which left behind far more witnesses than single-purpose killing facilities such as CheÅmno or Treblinka.[191] The United Nations General Assembly has designated January 27, the date of the camp's liberation, as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.[192] In a speech on the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation, German chancellor Helmut Kohl described Auschwitz as the \"darkest and most horrific chapter of German history\".[193]",
