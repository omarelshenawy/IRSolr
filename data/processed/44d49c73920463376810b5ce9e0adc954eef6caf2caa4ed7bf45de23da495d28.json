				"previous": "In 1970, the airline was re-constituted as a regional airline named Lucas Aviation.[2] The re-formed airline's corporate and operational headquarters was at Paris Pontoise Airport,[6] located in Boissy l'Aillerie.[7][8] Lucas Aviation initially traded as Lucas Air Transport and operated regional scheduled services, including a year-round operation linking Deauville with London Gatwick.[6] The name subsequently changed once more to Lucas Aigle Azur.[2]",
				"after": "In May 2001, Groupe GOFAST acquired Lucas Aigle Azur from its previous owners, once again changing the name to Aigle Azur, its original name. The new owner refocused the airline as a mainstream short- to medium-haul scheduled and charter carrier. Aigle Azur began replacing its Boeing 737s with Airbus A320 family aircraft. It has 450 employees as of May 2007.[2] A plane operated by Aigle Azur landed in Baghdad on 31-10-2010 becoming the first flight from a European airline to arrive in the city since a 1990 international embargo on Iraq after 20 years.",
