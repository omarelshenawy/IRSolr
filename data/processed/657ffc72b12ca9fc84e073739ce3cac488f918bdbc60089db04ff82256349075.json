				"previous": "The tammar has 324Â° peripheral vision and 50Â° binocular vision.[5]:312 It can distinguish black/white gratings of different widths and in different light conditions better than most other small mammals, such as rabbits. It is nevertheless not as good as a cat or a human.[16] Tammars appear to have some colour vision: its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones, allowing it to see colour in the blue-green band of the colour spectrum, but not the longer wavelengths of the red-yellow band. Nevertheless, in the band where it can see colour, it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as 20Â nm (2.0Ã10â8Â m) apart.[17] The pinna (ear) of the tammar is mobile, allowing it to track sounds from different parts of its surroundings without moving its head. A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum's sound pressure by 25â30 dB at 5Â kHz. When the pinna moves away from the sound source, the animal's hearing level quickly drops.[18] When born, a tammar's sense of smell is already developed; this allows the newborn to find its mother's pouch by the scent.[19]",
