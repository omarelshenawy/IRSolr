				"previous": "Beagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have become popular family pets, but they are pack animals, and can be prone to separation anxiety.[43] Not all Beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as \"speaking\", \"giving tongue\", or \"opening\") when they catch the scent of potential quarry.[44] They also generally get along well with other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.[45]",
			"after": [
				"The typical longevity of Beagles is 12â15 years,[46] which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size.[47]",
				"Beagles may be prone to epilepsy, but this can often be controlled with medication. Hypothyroidism and a number of types of dwarfism occur in Beagles. Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: \"Funny Puppy\", in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses;[48] Hip dysplasia, common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in Beagles.[49] Beagles are considered a chondrodystrophic breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases.[50]"
