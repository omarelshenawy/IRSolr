				"Bermuda's economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors.[10][11] Bermuda had one of the world's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century[citation needed] and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected by the global recession. It has a subtropical climate.[12] Bermuda is the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather."
