				"previous": "In 1813 the yard of the King's Head coaching inn was widened to create Davey Place,[35] a new street between the market and Back of the Inns, at that time a narrow passageway which ran parallel to Gentleman's Walk behind the coaching inns.[42] (Although the inns no longer remain, Back of the Inns survives as a street name.[43]) In 1820 the Gasolier, Norwich's first gas lamp, was installed in the market outside the entrance to Davey Place.[39] Exchange Street, a new road running north from the northeast corner of the market, was completed in 1828 and a roadway was installed alongside the existing footpath.[42][44] London Street, the main road connecting the market with the older areas of the city around Tombland and the Cathedral was widened in 1856.[42] In 1860 the decrepit fish market adjacent to the Guildhall, by now over 700 years old, was replaced with a new neoclassical building.[45] In 1863 Gentleman's Walk was paved properly with York stone, and in 1874 the cobbles of the marketplace were replaced by timber blocks.[39] Although by this time the market operated on all working days, Sunday trading laws meant it was closed on Sundays. The market space on Sundays was used for public assemblies and gatherings.[46]",
				"after": "Meanwhile, Norwich railway station had opened in 1844.[47] Although many Norwich residents were reluctant to use the railway, and goods carriers initially found it more convenient to continue to collect goods from the coaching inns,[34] as railway usage gradually increased the number of coaches and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion.[44] In 1899 the Angel innârenamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's weddingâfinally closed, and was replaced with George Skipper's Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the Art Nouveau style.[48]",
