				"previous": "Another feature to emerge from the dome was called the \"fin\" or \"slab.\" Approximately half the size of a football field, the large, cooled volcanic rock was being forced upward as quickly as 6Â ft (2Â m) per day.[35][36] In mid-June 2006, the slab was crumbling in frequent rockfalls, although it was still being extruded. The height of the dome was 7,550 feet (2,300Â m), still below the height reached in July 2005 when the whaleback collapsed.",
				"after": "On October 22, 2006, at 3:13Â p.m. PST, a magnitude 3.5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7. The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume 2,000 feet (600Â m) over the western rim of the crater; the ash plume then rapidly dissipated.",
