This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned (in \"syzygy\") exactly, or very closely so, with the Earth in the middle. Hence, a lunar eclipse can only occur the night of a full moon. The type and length of an eclipse depend upon the Moon's location relative to its orbital nodes.",
