				"previous": "A matrix that is not diagonalizable is said to be defective. For defective matrices, the notion of eigenvector can be generalized to generalized eigenvectors, and that of diagonal matrix to a Jordan form matrix. Over an algebraically closed field, any matrix has a Jordan form and therefore admits a basis of generalized eigenvectors, and a decomposition into generalized eigenspaces",
