				"previous": "Throughout the medieval Germanic languages, elf was one of the nouns that was used in personal names, almost invariably as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in Albio- such as Albiorix.",
				"after": "Personal names provide the only evidence for elf in Gothic, which must have had the word *albs (plural *albeis). The most famous such name is Alboin. Old English names in elf- include the cognate of Alboin Ãlfwine ('elf-friend', m.), Ãlfric ('elf-powerful', m.), Ãlfweard (m.) and Ãlfwaru (f.) ('elf-guardian). The only widespread survivor of these in modern English is Alfred (Old English ÃlfrÄd). German examples are Alberich, Alphart and Alphere (father of Walter of Aquitaine)[13][14] and Icelandic examples include Ãlfhildur. It is generally agreed that these names indicate that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture. Other words for supernatural beings in personal names almost all denote pagan gods, suggesting that elves were in a similar category of beings.[15]",
