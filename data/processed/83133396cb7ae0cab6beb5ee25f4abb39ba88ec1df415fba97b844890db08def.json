				"after": "In 2007, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) initiated a program to upgrade the armament of AC-130s. The test program planned for the 25Â mm GAU-12/U and 40Â mm Bofors cannon on the AC-130U gunships to be replaced with two 30Â mm Mk 44 Bushmaster II cannons.[13] In 2007, the Air Force modified four AC-130U gunships as test platforms for the Bushmasters. These were referred to as AC-130U Plus 4 or AC-130U+4. AFSOC, however, canceled its plans to install the new cannons on its fleet of AC-130Us. It has since removed the guns and re-installed the original 40Â mm and 25mm cannons and returned the planes to combat duty.[14] Brigadier General Bradley A. Heithold, AFSOC's director of plans, programs, requirements, and assessments, said on 11 August 2008 that the effort was canceled because of problems with the Bushmaster's accuracy in tests \"at the altitude we were employing it\". There were also schedule considerations that drove the decision, he said.[15]",
