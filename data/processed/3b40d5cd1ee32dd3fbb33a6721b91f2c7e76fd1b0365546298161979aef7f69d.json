				"MÃ²cheno is an Upper German variety spoken in three towns of the Mocheni Valley (German: Fersental, Italian: Valle del Fersina, MÃ²cheno: Bersntol), in Trentino, northeastern Italy.",
				"MÃ²cheno is closely related to Bavarian and is variously classified either as a Southern Bavarian dialect or a separate language of its own. MÃ²cheno speakers reportedly partially understand Bavarian, Cimbrian, or Standard German. However, many essential differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation render it difficult for speakers of standard German to understand."
