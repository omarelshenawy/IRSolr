The highest populations are found from March to August (fall and winter), while the lowest are from October to December (spring).[16] The females lay their eggs late in the afternoon or at nightfall, and locate potential oviposition sites visually.[17] Like the eggs of other Uraniidae, the sunset moth's eggs are domed with projecting ribs.[25] A single egg weighs about 1 milligram (3.5Ã10â5Â oz) and usually has 17 ribs, but sometimes 18 or less often 16. The eggs are usually laid on the lower surface of Omphalea leaves, but occasionally on the upper surface. Eggs are laid in groups of 60 to 110, usually about 80.[16]",
