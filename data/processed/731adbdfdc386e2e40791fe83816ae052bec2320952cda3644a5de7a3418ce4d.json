				"after": "This uses two parallel omnidirectional microphones some distance apart, capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as some level (amplitude) difference informationâespecially if employed in close proximity to the sound source(s). At a distance of about 60Â cm (24Â in), the time delay (time-of-arrival difference) for a signal reaching the first microphone and then the other one from the side is approximately 1.5Â ms (1Â toÂ 2Â ms). If you increase the distance between the microphones, you effectively decrease the pickup angle. At a 70Â cm (28Â in) distance, it is approximately equivalent to the pickup angle of the near-coincident ORTF setup.",
