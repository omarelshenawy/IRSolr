				"after": "Paraceratherium is considered the largest known land mammal that has ever existed, but its exact size is unclear because of the lack of complete specimens. Early estimates of 30 tonnes (66,000Â lb) are now considered exaggerated; it may have been in the range of 15 to 20 tonnes (33,000 to 44,000Â lb) at maximum, and as low as 11 tonnes (24,000Â lb) on average. Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of P. transouralicum because this species is known from the most complete remains.[4] Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements, but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes, so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations, resulting in several weight ranges.[28][29] Its total body length was estimated as 8.70Â m (28.5Â ft) from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936, and 7.40Â m (24.3Â ft) by Vera Gromova in 1959, but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated. The weight of Paraceratherium was approached by some extinct proboscideans, with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii).[28] In spite of the roughly equivalent mass, Paraceratherium was still taller than any proboscidean.[4] Its shoulder height was estimated as 5.25Â m (17.2Â ft) at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory, but 4.8Â m (16Â ft) by Gregory S. Paul in 1997.[30] The neck was estimated at 2 to 2.5Â m (6.6 to 8.2Â ft) long by Michael P. Taylor and Mathew J. Wedel in 2013.[31] The teeth of P. orgosensis (which that species is mainly known from) are 25 percent bigger than those of P. transouralicum, making it the largest known indricothere.[3]",
