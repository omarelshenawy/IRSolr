Many of the original buildings have survived, and as a result, the town centre is protected by Tameside Council as a conservation area.[23][88] As well as being populated by leading high-street names, Ashton has an outdoor market which was established in the medieval period. It is made up of about 180Â stalls, and is open six days a week.[23] The farmers' market, with over 70Â stalls, is the largest in the region, as is the weekday flea market.[89] Ashton Market Hall underwent a Â£15M restoration after it was damaged by fire. The Ashton Renewal Area project has attracted investment in the town centre, encouraging conservation and economic development.[23]",
