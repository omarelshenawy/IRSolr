				"after": "German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level. [217] Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich BÃ¶ll and GÃ¼nter Grass.[218] German-speaking book publishers produce some 700Â million books every year, with about 80,000 titles, nearly 60,000 of them new. Germany comes third in quantity of books published, after the English and Chinese speaking book markets.[219] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years,[220] also the Leipzig Book Fair retains a major position in Europe.[221]",
