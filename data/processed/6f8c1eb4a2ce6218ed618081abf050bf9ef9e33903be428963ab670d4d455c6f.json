				"after": "The first known European reference to Florida is in a 1502 map by Cantino, which maps Florida and aptly describes the unique vegetation rafts in the St. Johns Rivers by originally naming the river the Rio de las Almadias (River of Rafts).[88] Later, in 1513 Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n arrived near Cape Canaveral, and not until 1562 was the north Atlantic coast of the peninsula settled. Early Spanish explorers named the river Rio de Corientes (River of Currents).[28] The St. Johns River became the first place colonized in the region and its first battleground: when French explorer Jean Ribault erected a monument south of the river's mouth to make the French presence known, it alarmed the Spanish who had been exploring the southern and western coast of the peninsula for decades.[89][90] Ribault was detained after he returned to Europe.",
