				"previous": "On August 30, 2011, Boeing confirmed the launch of the 737 new engine variant, called the 737 MAX,[22] with 496 order commitments from five airlines. Its new CFM International LEAP-1B engines are expected to provide a 16% lower fuel burn than the current Airbus A320.[23][24][25] The 737 MAX is to compete with the Airbus A320neo.",
				"after": "The 737-600 is the direct replacement of the 737-500 and competes with the Airbus A318. The Boeing 737-600 did not include winglets as an option.[26] WestJet was to be the Boeing launch customer for the 737-600 winglets, but announced in their Q2 2006 results that they were not going to move ahead with those plans. The 737-600 was launched by Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) in 1995 with the first aircraft delivered on September 18, 1998. A total of 69 -600s have been produced and the final aircraft was delivered to WestJet on September 14, 2006.[1]",
