				"previous": "On 19 August 2014, a People's Republic of China J-11 fighter came within 30 feet of a P-8 around 135 miles east of Hainan Island.[64] The J-11 flew past the P-8's nose and performed a barrel roll at close proximity.[65] A Pentagon spokesperson said the J-11's unit had made close intercepts earlier that year.[66] The U.S. sent a diplomatic note to China about the pattern of behavior by the commander of the Chinese fighter group.[67] China stated that the claims were \"totally groundless\", and that the event's root was U.S. surveillance of China;[68] the U.S. stated it will continue to operate in international airspace and waters.[69]",
