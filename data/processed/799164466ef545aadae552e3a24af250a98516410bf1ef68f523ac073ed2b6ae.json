				"previous": "While the negotiations over the state taking control of burials were ongoing, an alternative proposal was being drawn up by Richard Broun and Richard Sprye.[note 3] Broun and Sprye intended to use the emerging technology of mechanised land transport to provide a final solution to the problem of London's dead.[23] They envisaged buying a single very large tract of land around 23 miles (37Â km) from London in Brookwood near Woking, Surrey, to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis.[1] At this distance, the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards from miasma.[28] In the 18thÂ century this land had been nicknamed \"the Waste of Woking\",[29] and with poor quality gravel soil it was of little use in farming and thus available very cheaply.[30] The London and South Western RailwayÂ (LSWR)âwhich had connected London to Woking in 1838âwould enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply.[23] Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains, each carrying 50â60 bodies, travelling from London to the new Necropolis in the early morning or late at night, and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral.[31] Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day.[32]",
				"after": "Broun calculated that a 1,500-acre (2.3Â sqÂ mi; 6.1Â km2) site would accommodate a total of 5,830,500 individual graves in a single layer.[23] The legislation authorising Brookwood Cemetery did not permit mass graves at the site, and burials were restricted to one family per grave.[23] If the practice of only burying a single family in each grave were abandoned and the traditional practice for pauper burials of ten burials per grave were adopted, the site was capable of accommodating 28,500,000 bodies.[23] Assuming 50,000 deaths per year and presuming that families would often choose to share a grave, Broun calculated that even with the prohibition of mass graves it would take over 350 years to fill a single layer of the cemetery.[35] Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that the railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.[35]",
