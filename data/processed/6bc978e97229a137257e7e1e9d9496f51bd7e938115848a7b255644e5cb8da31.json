Tyrannosaurus ranged from Canada in the north to at least Texas and New Mexico in the south of Western North America. During this time Triceratops was the major herbivore in the northern portion of its range, while the titanosaurian sauropod Alamosaurus \"dominated\" its southern range. Tyrannosaurus remains have been discovered in different ecosystems, including inland and coastal sub-tropical, and semi-arid plains.",
