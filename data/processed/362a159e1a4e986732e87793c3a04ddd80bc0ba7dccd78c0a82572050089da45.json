				"after": "The wealth of Allosaurus fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as eggsâcrushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of Allosaurus.[2] Based on histological analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28Â years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like Tyrannosaurus. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at ageÂ 15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150Â kilograms (330Â lb) per year.[51]",
