				"previous": "The standard symbol for the arcsecond is the double prime (â³) (U+2033), though a double quote (\") (U+0022) is commonly used where only ASCII characters are permitted. One arcsecond is thus written 1â³. It is also abbreviated as arcsec or asec.",
				"after": "In celestial navigation, seconds of arc are rarely used in calculations, the preference usually being for degrees, minutes and decimals of a minute, written for example as 42Â° 25.32â² or 42Â° 25.322â².[2][3] This notation has been carried over into marine GPS receivers, which normally display latitude and longitude in the latter format by default.[4]",
