Foresighted citizens, who wanted the lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph Street and Park Row (11th Street) \"Public GroundâA Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever.\"[223] Grant Park has been \"forever open, clear and free\" since, protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings.[224][225][226][227] In 1839, United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett upon decommissioning the Fort Dearborn reserve, declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue \"Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings\".[222]",
