				"previous": "In terms of phytogeography, Croatia is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region. The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregionsâPannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.[87]",
				"after": "There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.[86] The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s (decade) alone.[86] There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.[86]",
