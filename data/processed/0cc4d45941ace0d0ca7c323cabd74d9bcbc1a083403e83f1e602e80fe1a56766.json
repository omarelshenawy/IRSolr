After much exploration, in January 1503 he established a garrison at the mouth of the BelÃ©n River. On 6 April one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked by QuibÃ­an and the other ships were damaged. Shipworms also damaged the ships in tropical waters.[70]",
