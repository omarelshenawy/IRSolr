				"previous": "It may not immediately be clear why the name \"blackbird\", first recorded in 1486, was applied to this species, but not to one of the various other common black English birds, such as the carrion crow, raven, rook or jackdaw. However, in Old English, and in modern English up to about the 18th century, \"bird\" was used only for smaller or young birds, and larger ones such as crows were called \"fowl\". At that time, the blackbird was therefore the only widespread and conspicuous \"black bird\" in the British Isles.[7] Until about the 17th century, another name for the species was ouzel, ousel or wosel (from Old English osle, cf. German Amsel). Another variant occurs in Act 3 of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, where Bottom refers to \"The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill\". The ouzel usage survived later in poetry, and still occurs as the name of the closely related ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus), and in water ouzel, an alternative name for the unrelated but superficially similar white-throated dipper (Cinclus cinclus).[8]",
				"after": "Two related Asian Turdus thrushes, the white-collared blackbird (T. albocinctus) and the grey-winged blackbird (T. boulboul), are also named blackbirds,[6] and the Somali thrush (T. (olivaceus) ludoviciae) is alternatively known as the Somali blackbird.[9]",
