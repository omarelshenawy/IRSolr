William Wallace was whipped, attacked and had rotten food and waste thrown at him,[34] and the priest Thomas Pilchard was reportedly barely alive by the time he reached the gallows in 1587. Others found themselves admonished by \"zealous and godly men\";[29] it became customary for a preacher to follow the condemned, asking them to repent. According to Samuel Clarke, the Puritan clergyman William Perkins (1558â1602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death \"with tears of joy in his eyesÂ ... as if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul\".[35]",
