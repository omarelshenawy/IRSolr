				"previous": "Harrisburg is home to the Pennsylvania State Capitol. Completed in 1906, the central dome rises to a height of 272 feet (83Â m) and was modeled on that of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, Rome. The building was designed by Joseph Miller Huston and is adorned with sculpture, most notably the two groups, Love and Labor, the Unbroken Law and The Burden of Life, the Broken Law by sculptor George Grey Barnard; murals by Violet Oakley and Edwin Austin Abbey; tile floor by Henry Mercer, which tells the story of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The state capitol is only the third-tallest building of Harrisburg. The five tallest buildings are 333 Market Street with a height of 341 feet (104Â m), Pennsylvania Place with a height of 291 feet (89Â m), the Pennsylvania State Capitol with a height of 272 feet (83Â m), Presbyterian Apartments with a height of 259 feet (79Â m) and the Fulton Bank Building with a height of 255 feet (78Â m).[53]",
