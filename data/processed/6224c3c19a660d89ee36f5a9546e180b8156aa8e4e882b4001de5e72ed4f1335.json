				"previous": "The currency of Gibraltar is the Gibraltar pound, issued by the Government of Gibraltar under the terms of the 1934 Currency Notes Act. These banknotes are legal tender in Gibraltar alongside Bank of England banknotes.[56][57] In a currency board arrangement, these notes are issued against reserves of sterling.[57][58][59] Clearing and settlement of funds is conducted in sterling.[60] Coins in circulation follow British denominations but have separate designs. Unofficially, most retail outlets in Gibraltar accept the Euro, though some payphones and the Royal Gibraltar Post Office, along with all other Government Offices do not.[61]",
				"after": "Gibraltar is one of the most densely populated territories in the world, with a population estimated in 2011 of 29,752,[62] equivalent to approximately 4,959 inhabitants per square kilometre (12,840/sqÂ mi). The growing demand for space is being increasingly met by land reclamation; reclaimed land currently comprises approximately one tenth of the territory's total area.",
