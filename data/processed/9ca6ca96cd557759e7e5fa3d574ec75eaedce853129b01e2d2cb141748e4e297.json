				"after": "Passenger traffic at Warsaw Chopin Airport has increased dramatically since the fall of communism in Poland and the removal of restrictions on Polish citizens' travel abroad. For example, in 1994, five years after Poland's first free post-war elections in 1989, Warsaw's airport served 2,198,008 passengers; however, by 2008, just 14Â years later, the airport served over four times as many passengers, with a total of 9,460,606. This represented a percentage increase in annual passengers flown of around 430.4%. Passenger numbers from 2012 onwards are influenced by Wizzair and Ryanair moving to Modlin Airport from mid-July 2012. Warsaw Chopin Airport was the 40th busiest airport in Europe in 2013.",
