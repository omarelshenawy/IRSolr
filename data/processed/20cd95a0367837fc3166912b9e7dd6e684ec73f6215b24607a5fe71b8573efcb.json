				"previous": "Iberia, CompaÃ±Ã­a AÃ©rea de Transportes was incorporated on 28 June 1927 with a capital investment by the financier Horacio Echevarrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa of 1.1 million pesetas. Flight operations started on 14 December 1927. Within a year, the company was sponsored by the Spanish government to provide postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona. During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, the aviation companies in Spain were combined and became state-controlled as a general interest public utility, coming into effect in early 1928. As a consequence, Iberia was merged into CompaÃ±Ã­a de LÃ­neas AÃ©reas Subvencionadas S.A. (C.L.A.S.S.A.) and ceased activities on 29 May 1929. The name \"Iberia\" continued to be registered by Director-General Daniel de Araoz y ArÃ©jula. As the name \"Iberia\" was still registered, it was used when operations began in nationalist-held territory towards the end of the Spanish Civil War. Following the Civil War, Iberia became a purely domestic airline.",
				"after": "The airline was nationalised on 30 September 1944 and became part of INI. In 1946, Iberia was the first airline to fly between Europe and South America after WWII, using a Douglas DC-4 to operate flights between Madrid and Buenos Aires.[3] By the Pact of Madrid in 1953, visa requirements were eliminated for US visitors to Spain. This stimulated the start of transatlantic flights between Spain and United States the following year. In addition, the amendments made in Montreal to the Convention on International Civil Aviation on 14 June 1954 were liberal to Spain, allowing mass tourism using charter planes.",
