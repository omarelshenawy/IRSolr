				"previous": "In December 2008, Russia moved to expand its military influence in the Middle East when it announced it was giving Lebanon 10 fighter jets, that would have been the most significant upgrade of Lebanon's military since the civil war ended almost two decades before. Russia's defense ministry said it was giving the secondhand MiG-29s to Beirut free of charge. The gift was supposed to be part of a defense cooperation deal that would have seen Moscow train Lebanese military personnel.[118] Based on a Lebanese request, on 29 February 2010, Russia agreed to change the offer to 10 Mi-24 attack helicopters.[119] As of 2014, the deal did not materialize.",
