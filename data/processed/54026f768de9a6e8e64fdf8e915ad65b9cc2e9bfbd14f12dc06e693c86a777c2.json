				"after": "The largest member of its genus,[19] Entoloma sinuatum has an imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp), bearing a cap 6â15Â cm (2Â½â6Â in) wide, though diameters of 25Â cm (10Â in) have been recorded.[26] It is convex to flat, often with a blunt umbo in its centre and wavy margins, ivory white to light grey-brown in colour, and darkening with age. The distant gills are sinuate (notched at their point of attachment to the stipe) to almost free, generally (but not always) yellowish white before darkening to pink and then red. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stipe).[27] When viewed from beneath, a characteristic groove colloquially known as a \"moat\" can be seen in the gill pattern circumnavigating the stalk.[26] The form lacking yellow colour on the gills is rare but widespread, and has been recorded from Austria, France and the Netherlands.[28]",
