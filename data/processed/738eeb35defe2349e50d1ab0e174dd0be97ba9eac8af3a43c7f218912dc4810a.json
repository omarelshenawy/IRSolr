				"previous": "Resembling a brown wooden top, the epigeous (aboveground) fruit body may be up to 6Â cm (2.4Â in) high.[11] The cap, initially convex then more funnel-shaped (infundibuliform) with a depressed centre and rolled rim (hence the common name), may be reddish-, yellowish- or olive-brown in colour and typically 4â12Â cm (1.6â5Â in) wide;[22] the cap diameter does not get larger than 15Â cm (5.9Â in).[23] The cap surface is initially downy and later smooth, becoming sticky when wet. The cap and capÂ margin initially serve to protect the gills of young fruit bodies: this is termed pilangiocarpic development.[24] The narrow brownish yellow gills are decurrent and forked, and can be peeled easily from the flesh (as is the case with the pores of boletes). Gills further down toward the stipe become more irregular and anastomose, and can even resemble the pores of bolete-type fungi. The fungus darkens when bruised and older specimens may have darkish patches. The juicy yellowish flesh has a mild to faintly sour or sharp odor and taste, and has been described as well-flavored upon cooking.[22][25] Of similar colour to the cap, the short stipe can be crooked and tapers toward the base.[26]",
				"after": "The spore print is brown, and the dimensions of the ellipsoid (oval-shaped) spores are 7.5â9 by 5â6Â Î¼m. The hymenium has cystidia both on the gill edge and face (cheilo- and pleurocystidia respectively), which are slender and filament-like, typically measuring 40â65 by 8â10.5Â Î¼m.[27]",
