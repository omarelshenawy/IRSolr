				"after": "With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal faÃ§ade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal faÃ§ade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\"kneeling\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558â70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \"grotto of Moses\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\"Fountain of the Artichoke\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.[9]",
