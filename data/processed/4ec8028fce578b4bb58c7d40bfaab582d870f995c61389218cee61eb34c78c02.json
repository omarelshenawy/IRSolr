				"previous": "The 707-138 was a â120 with a fuselage ten feet shorter than the others, with 5 feet (3 frames) removed ahead and behind the wing, giving increased range. Maximum take off weight was the same 247,000Â lb as the standard version. It was a variant for Qantas, thus had its customer number 38. The seven â138s were delivered to Qantas JuneâSeptember 1959 and first carried passengers that July.",
				"after": "The 707-120B had Pratt & Whitney JT3D-1 turbofan engines, which were quieter, more powerful, and more fuel-efficient, producing 17,000Â lbf (75.6Â kN) each, with the later JT3D-3 version giving 18,000Â lbf (80Â kN). (This thrust did not require water injection, eliminating both the system and the 5000â6000Â lb weight of the water itself.) The â120B had the wing modifications introduced on the 720 and a longer tailplane; a total of 72 were built, 31 for American and 41 for TWA, plus 6 short body â138Bs for Qantas. American had its 23 surviving â123s converted to 123Bs but TWA did not convert its 15 -131s. The only other conversions were Pan American's 5 surviving â121s and one surviving â139, the 3 aircraft delivered to the USAF as â153s and the 7 short body Qantas â138s. The first flight of the â120B was on June 22, 1960 and American carried the first passengers in March 1961; the last delivery was to American in April 1969. Maximum weight was 258,000Â lb (117,025Â kg) for both the long and short body versions.",
