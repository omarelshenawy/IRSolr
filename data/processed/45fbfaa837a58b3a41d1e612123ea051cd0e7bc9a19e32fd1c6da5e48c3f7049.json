				"previous": "Two of the four EPRs under construction (in Finland and France) are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost.[73] Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.[74]",
				"after": "The nuclear power debate is about the controversy[77][78][79][80][81] which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes. The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, when it \"reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies\", in some countries.[82][83]",
