				"after": "Europe, before the introduction of printing, was a manuscript culture, where scribes would hand-copy a few books a day. The invention of the printing press led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in Mainz, Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.[41] As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, Bohemia and Poland.[8] From that time on, it is assumed that \"the printed book was in universal use in Europe\".[8]",
