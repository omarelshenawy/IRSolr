				"after": "The following year, the U.S. formally occupied its portion: a smaller group of eastern islands, one of which surrounds the noted harbor of Pago Pago. After the United States Navy took possession of eastern Samoa on behalf of the United States, the existing coaling station at Pago Pago Bay was expanded into a full naval station, known as United States Naval Station Tutuila under the command of a commandant. The Navy secured a Deed of Cession of Tutuila in 1900 and a Deed of Cession of ManuÊ»a in 1904 on behalf of the U.S. government. The last sovereign of ManuÊ»a, the Tui ManuÊ»a Elisala, signed a Deed of Cession of ManuÊ»a following a series of U.S. Naval trials, known as the \"Trial of the Ipu,\" in Pago Pago, TaÊ»u, and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat.[9] The territory became known as the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila.",
