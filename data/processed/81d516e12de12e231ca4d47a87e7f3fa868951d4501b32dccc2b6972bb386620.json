Board of Education, the Baltimore City board of school commissioners was forced to desegregate the school system, which had been racially divided since the 1860s. As a result, 10 African-American students entered City College in September 1954,[51] comprising 0.5% of the student population. A decade later, in the 1964â65 academic year, African-American students represented 30% of the student population.[6]",
