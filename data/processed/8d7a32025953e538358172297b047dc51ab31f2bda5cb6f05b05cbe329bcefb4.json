				"previous": "While the Bonfires of the 1960s were constructed in five to ten days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule.[3] Construction began in late October with \"Cut\", obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends.[3][8] After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during \"Load\", a process by which the logs were loaded by hand onto flatbed trucks and brought to campus.[8] In early November, crews began \"Stack\", a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape. Near the end of stack, known as \"Push\", students worked around the clock in rotating shifts. The first four of the six stacks were built with the efforts of all safety-trained participants. The day before Bonfire was scheduled to burn, junior redpots would build the fifth stack, and then senior redpots would build the sixth.[8]",
				"after": "During Cut, all logs were felled by hand, with students working in teams to chop down each tree with their axes. The manual labor ensured that participants were invested in each log that went into the Bonfire. Once the trees had fallen, brownpots, the \"executive lumberjacks\", used chainsaws to cut limbs and prepare the logs.[13]",
