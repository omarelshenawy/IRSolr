				"previous": "Macartney had a moderately successful debut. He bowled three wicketless overs in the first innings,[12] before scoring 35 in Australia's reply while batting at No. 7.[11][14] He took one wicket, that of leading English batsman Wilfred Rhodes.[13] With Australia needing 274 runs to win in the second innings, Noble decided that Macartney's first innings effort warranted promotion to act as Trumper's opening partner. He managed to score only nine, but Australia managed to scrape home to seal a two wicket victory.[11][14][15] Macartney's domestic form after his Test debut was sufficient for him to retain his position for the Second Test in Melbourne. Noble persevered with Macartney as Trumper's opening partner and he scored 37 of an 84 run opening partnership in the first innings.[12][16] He returned to the middle order in the second innings to score 54 and took a total of 1/55 as England squared the series with a narrow one wicket victory.[11][12][15]",
				"after": "His most productive batting of the series came in the Third Test in Adelaide, when he scored 75 batting at No. 3 and took two wickets for 66 runs (2/66) in an Australian victory. His batting was largely ineffectual in the last two Tests; he failed to score more than 30 in any innings as he was moved to No. 8 and then back to the opening position in the Fifth Test. Despite his confused role as a batsman, he contributed with the ball in the Fifth Test victory on a pitch amenable to spin,[11][15] taking match figures of 5/66. His first international series had yielded 273 runs at an average of 27.30 and ten wickets at an average of 26.60.[15] He tasted victory, with Australia taking the series 4â0.[17] His highest score of the season was 96 against England in a later match for New South Wales. The hosts were 12 runs short of victory with one wicket in hand when time ran out.[12] Macartney scored 524 runs at 27.58 and took 25 wickets at 28.76 in 12 matches.[12] In spite of his unsettled role in the batting line up, Macartney had performed well-enough as an all-rounder in the following domestic season in 1908â09 to be selected for the 1909 tour of England, his first overseas tour.[11] Macartney took a total of 6/60 in an innings victory over South Australia in the first match of the season. He then scored 100 in the return match,[12] and ended the six matches of the summer with 319 runs at 53.17 and nine wickets at 29.89.[12]",
