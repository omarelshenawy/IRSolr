				"after": "Karol JÃ³zef WojtyÅa was born in the Polish town of Wadowice.[16][17] He was the youngest of three children born to Karol WojtyÅa (1879â1941), an ethnic Pole,[18] and Emilia Kaczorowska (1884â1929), whose mother's maiden surname was Scholz.[19] Emilia, who was a schoolteacher, died in childbirth in 1929[20] when WojtyÅa was eight years old.[21] His elder sister Olga had died before his birth, but he was close to his brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior. Edmund's work as a physician eventually led to his death from scarlet fever, a loss that affected WojtyÅa deeply.[18][21]",
