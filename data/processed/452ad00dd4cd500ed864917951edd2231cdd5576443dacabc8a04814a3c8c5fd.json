				"previous": "As he entered St. Peter's Square to address an audience on 13 May 1981,[193] Pope John Paul II was shot and critically wounded by Mehmet Ali AÄca,[16][78][194] an expert Turkish gunman who was a member of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves.[195] The assassin used a Browning 9Â mm semi-automatic pistol,[196] shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times.[73] John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds.[197] Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal.[197] When he briefly gained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation.[198] The pope stated that Our Lady of FÃ¡tima helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal.[78][194][199]",
