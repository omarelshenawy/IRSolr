				"previous": "Fishing and duck hunting is quite popular in the lake. The most common species caught is the illegally introduced carp.[119] Annual monitoring is carried out to determine fish populations. However, a number of less common species also inhabit the lake, including native Murray cod, western carp gudgeon and silver perch, as well as introduced goldfish, Gambusia, rainbow trout and brown trout. [123]",
				"after": "The lake has been stocked annually with a variety of introduced and native species and over half a million fish have been released since 1981.[124] There have been many changes to the fish populations in the lake as well as stocking practices since it was first filled.[124]",
