They are one of the historical tribes of present-day upper Michigan and Wisconsin; they occupied a territory of about 10 million acres in the period of European colonization.[2] They are believed to have been well-settled in that territory for more than 1,000 years; by some accounts, they are descended from the Old Copper Culture people and other indigenous peoples who have been in this area for 10,000 years.[3]",
