The Panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents of the panhandle region. The westernmost center of the Mississippian culture was Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, which flourished between AD 850 and 1450.[48][49] Spaniard Francisco VÃ¡squez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541,[50] but French explorers claimed the area in the 1700s[51] and it remained under French rule until 1803, when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase.[50]",
