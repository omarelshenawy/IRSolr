				"On November 26, 2012, El Al retired its last 757 after 25 years of service.[81] The last 767-200ER in the fleet was retired on September 22, 2013.",
				"El Al has an all Boeing-made fleet composed of the following aircraft with an average age of 11.1 years (at 11 December 2011). El Al's Boeing customer code is 58. That is, a 777-200ER built for El Al will have the model name of 777-258ER.[79][80]"

				"after": "El Al's historic, superseded livery featured a turquoise/navy blue stripe down the side of the aircraft, and a turquoise tailfin with the flag of Israel at the top. El Al's logo was featured above the front run of windows on each side of the plane in the turquoise/navy scheme.[84] The new livery features a blue stripe with a thick silver border on the bottom that sweeps across the side of the aircraft near the wing, disappears over the top of the plane and reappears at the bottom of the tailfin. The El Al logo is part of the design, although it has been changed slightly since then. Most of El Al's aircraft are named for Israeli cities, such as Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Bet Shemesh, Nazeret, Haifa, and others. The cities names are located near the nose of the plane beneath the cockpit windows[85]",
