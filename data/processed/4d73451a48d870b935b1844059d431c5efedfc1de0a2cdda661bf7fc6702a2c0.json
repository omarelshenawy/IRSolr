				"after": "During the initial pilot conversion course, it became apparent that the AV-8B exhibited flight characteristics that differed from the AV-8A. These differences, as well as the digital cockpit fitted instead of the analog cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training.[35] In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted to the development of a two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986.[35][36][N 2] This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987;[35][37] the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.[36]",
