				"after": "The next day (November 11, 1887) four defendantsâEngel, Fischer, Parsons, and Spiesâwere taken to the gallows in white robes and hoods. They sang the Marseillaise, then the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. Family members including Lucy Parsons, who attempted to see them for the last time, were arrested and searched for bombs (none were found). According to witnesses, in the moments before the men were hanged, Spies shouted, \"The time will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today.\"[72] Witnesses reported that the condemned men did not die immediately when they dropped, but strangled to death slowly, a sight which left the spectators visibly shaken.[72]",
