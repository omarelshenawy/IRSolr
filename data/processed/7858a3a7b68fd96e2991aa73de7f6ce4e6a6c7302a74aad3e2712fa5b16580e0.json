The spectacular unauthorized demonstration of the turbine powered Turbinia at the 1897 Spithead Navy Review, which, significantly, was of torpedo boat size, prompted the Royal Navy to order a prototype turbine powered destroyer, HMSÂ Viper of 1899. This was the first turbine warship of any kind and achieved a remarkable 36 knots (67Â km/h) on sea trials. By 1910 the turbine had been widely adopted by all navies for their faster ships.",
