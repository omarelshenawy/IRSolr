				"after": "In recent decades, China has suffered from severe environmental deterioration and pollution.[130][131] While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favour of rapid economic development.[132] Urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country; the World Bank estimated in 2013 that 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities are located in China.[133] China is the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter.[134] The country also has water problems. Roughly 298Â million Chinese in rural areas do not have access to safe drinking water,[135] and 40% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011.[136] This crisis is compounded by increasingly severe water shortages, particularly in the north-east of the country.[137][138]",
