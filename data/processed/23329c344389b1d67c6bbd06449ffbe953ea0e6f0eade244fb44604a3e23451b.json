In 1965 the Dragon Rapides began to be replaced by light aircraft, mainly Pipers, and a Nord 262 was ordered in 1966.[5] On 19 July 1967, an Air Madagascar DC-4, on a scheduled flight from Antananarivo to Tamatave and Diego Suarez, crashed after take-off from Ivato International Airport, killing 42 people, including Albert Sylla, the Malagasy Foreign Minister.[5][11][12] The airline began scheduled flights to Rome in 1968, and the airline acquired its first Boeing 737-200 in September 1969.[5][13] The aircraft was maintained by South African Airways, and on 15 October, Air Madagascar began flights to Johannesburg, and in December began flights to Dar es Salaam and Nairobi via Majunga. On 14 February 1970, flights to Johannesburg operated via LourenÃ§o Marques, and on 1 November, the 737 replaced the DC-4 on flights to the Comoros.[5]",
