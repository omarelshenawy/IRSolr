				"after": "Telopea speciosissima, the New South Wales waratah, was first described by botanist James Edward Smith in his 1793 book A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland, from \"very fine dried specimens sent by Mr. White\".[10] He gave the species its original binomial name of Embothrium speciosissimum.[10] The specific epithet is derived from the superlative of the Latin word speciosus \"beautiful\" or \"handsome\", hence \"very-\" or \"most beautiful\".[3] Embothrium had been a wastebasket taxon at the time, and Robert Brown suggested the genus Telopea for it in 1809, which was published in 1810.[1] Richard Salisbury had published the name Hylogyne speciosa in 1809, but Brown's name was nomenclaturally conserved.[11]",
