				"previous": "Gould met Darwin and told him that the GalÃ¡pagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a \"wren\" was also in the finch group. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the Beagle, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.[67] The two rheas were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.[68]",
				"after": "By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that \"one species does change into another\" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange Macrauchenia which resembled a giant guanaco. His thoughts on lifespan, asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction developed in his \"B\" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring \"to adapt & alter the race to changing world\" explaining the GalÃ¡pagos tortoises, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which \"It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another\", discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms.[69]",
