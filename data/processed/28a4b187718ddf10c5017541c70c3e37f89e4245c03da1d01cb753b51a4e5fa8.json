				"previous": "The lineup of larger jazz ensembles can vary considerably, depending on the style of jazz being performed. In a 1920s-style dixieland jazz band, a larger ensemble would be formed by adding a banjo player, woodwind instruments, as with the clarinet, or additional horns (saxophones, trumpets, trombones) to one of the smaller groups. In a 1940s-style Swing big band, a larger ensemble is formed by adding \"sections\" of like instruments, such as a saxophone section and a trumpet section, which perform arranged \"horn lines\" to accompany the ensemble. In a 1970s-style jazz fusion ensemble, a larger ensemble is often formed by adding additional percussionists or sometimes a saxophone player would \"double\" or \"triple\" meaning that they would also be proficient at the clarinet, flute or both. Also by the addition of soloing instruments.",
