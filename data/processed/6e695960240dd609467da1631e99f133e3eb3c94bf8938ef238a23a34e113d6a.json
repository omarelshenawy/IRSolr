				"after": "The feathers on the head, neck and breast of the Mauritius blue pigeon were silvery white, long, stiffened and pointed, especially around the neck. A patch of bright red, naked skin surrounded the eyes, and extended across the cheeks to the beak, which was greenish with a dark tip. The plumage of the body was indigo, and the back, scapular feathers and wings were metallic blue. The base of the outer rectrices was partially blackish blue. The tail feathers and tail coverts were maroon. The legs were dark slate-grey. The iris was reddish orange and had an inner yellow ring.[13] The bird was 30 cms (12Â in) in length, the wings were 208Â mm (8.2Â in), the tail was 132Â mm (5.2Â in), the culmen was 25Â mm (1Â in), and the tarsals were 28Â mm (1.10Â in).[5] It was the largest and most robust member of its genus, and the hackles were longer and covered a larger area than in other blue pigeons.[17]",
