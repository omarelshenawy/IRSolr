				"after": "On March 10, 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked VelÃ¡zquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day,[62] although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders.[17][63] However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.[12]",
