				"previous": "In 1895, Parliament gave the Museum Trustees a loan of Â£200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the Museum building in the five surrounding streets â Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street.[46] The Trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the West, North and East sides of the Museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the Museum stands. The architect Sir John James Burnet was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906â14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by King George V and Queen Mary in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.",
