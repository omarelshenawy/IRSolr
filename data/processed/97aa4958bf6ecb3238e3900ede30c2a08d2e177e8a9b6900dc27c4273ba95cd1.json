				"previous": "The airport has three parking facilities: a two-level short-term parking lot directly in front of Concourse E, and two seven-story parking garages (North and South) within the terminal's curvature and connected to the terminal via overhead walkways on Level 3.[16] In the late 1990s, the Dolphin Garage was expanded to better serve the then-new Concourse A; it is expected that the Flamingo Garage will be similarly expanded in the near future to serve the new Concourse J. The two parking garages are connected at their west ends; at the top of this connection are the airport's SIDA and ID Section offices. The single terminal facility is divided into three sections known as the North Terminal, Central Terminal, and South Terminal.",
				"after": "The North Terminal consists of one concourse, Concourse D, a 3,600,000-square-foot (330,000Â m2) linear concourse 1.2 miles (1.9Â km) long with a capacity of 30 million passengers annually. It has one bus station and 45 gates: D1âD12, D14âD17, D19âD25, D29âD33 D37âD40, D42âD51, D53, D55, D60.[17] American operates two Admirals Clubs within the concourse; one located near Gate D30, and another near Gate D15. American Eagle uses Gates D53, D55, and D60.[18]",
