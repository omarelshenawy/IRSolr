				"previous": "The New Guinea campaign (1942â1945) was one of the major military campaigns of World War II. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian, and US servicemen died.[24] After World War II, the two territories were combined into the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, which later was simply referred to as \"Papua New Guinea\".",
				"after": "However, certain statutes[25] continued to have application only in one of the two territories. This territorial difference of law was complicated further by the adjustment of the former boundary among contiguous provinces with respect to road access and language groups. Some of the statutes apply only on one side of a boundary that no longer exists.[citation needed]",
