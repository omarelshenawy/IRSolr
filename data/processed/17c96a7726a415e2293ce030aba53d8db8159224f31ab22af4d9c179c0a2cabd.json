				"previous": "The hall, like the chapel, was largely built by Griffith Powell between 1613 and 1620, and was finally completed soon after his death in 1620.[31] The panelling, three tables and two benches date from Powell's time.[102] It measures 54 by 25 feet (16.5 by 7.6Â m) and is a Grade I listed building.[57][66] The fireplace was set in an enclosed hearth with a large projecting chimney-breast, in contrast to the traditional method of heating the hall, which was by a brazier on an open hearth.[103] A screen was installed in 1634 at a cost of Â£3 1s.[n 14][29] Pevsner noted the screen's \"elaborately decorated columns\" and the dragons along the frieze, and said that it was one of the earliest examples in Oxford of panelling using four \"L\" shapes around a centre.[74][91] Norwich said that the dragons on the screen were \"rather lovable\",[5] and Tyack said that they underlined the Welsh connections of the college:[94] the red dragon is one of the national symbols of Wales. The stone steps from the first quadrangle to the hall were added in 1637.[29] During the 17th century, changes were made to the interior of the hall. Windows painted with various coats of arms were removed and a bay window was added on the west side.[38] Pevsner commented that \"the hall windows themselves are different from all other 17th-century Gothic windows in Oxford except for the exactly contemporary hall bay-window of Exeter\".[3]",
				"after": "In 1741 and 1742, a total of Â£423 17s 4d[n 15] was spent on the hall, which included the cost of covering the oak-beamed roof with plaster and making rooms in the original roof space.[37][38] Writing in 1891, Llewellyn Thomas noted that the plaster roof was added to create attic rooms to increase the accommodation of the lodgings. He expressed the hope that the hall might soon regain its original proportions, following the enlargement of the lodgings a few years previously.[70] This has not happened, and the plaster ceiling remains. However, in 2003, partitions between the rooms were knocked through to convert them into teaching rooms and the renovations enabled the upper part of the hall's hammerbeam roof to be seen from inside the rooms.[104] Pevsner described the 1741 cartouche on the north wall, which contains the college crest, as \"large [and] rich\".[91] Tyack noted the \"lively Rococo plasterwork\" of the flat ceiling.[105] In the early 19th century the east and west sides of the hall were crenellated, and the roof was re-slated.[37] A clock was installed on the external wall of the hall in 1831 by the principal Henry Foulkes.[68] There is a college tradition that students aim a champagne cork at the clock after finishing their final university examinations; hitting it is supposed to mean that the student will obtain a first class honours degree.[106] An extensive fire on 4 December 1913 threatened to destroy the hall before it was brought under control. In the rebuilding work that followed, a gallery was added to the hall, with the balustrade joining the 1634 screen.[96] The hall contains a portrait of ElizabethÂ I, as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors.[107] There are also portraits by court artists of two other monarchs who were college benefactors: Charles I (by Anthony van Dyck) and Charles II (by Sir Peter Lely).[108] It has been said to be \"among the most impressive of all the Oxford college halls\", with its \"fine panelling, austere ceiling, and its notable paintings\".[109]",
