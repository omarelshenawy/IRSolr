				"after": "Only minute traces of technetium occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is due to the fact that technetium's half-life is only 4.2Â millionÂ years. Over a thousand half-lives have passed since the formation on the Earth, so the probability that even one atom of primordial technetium should still exist is essentially zero. However, small amounts do exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1Â nanogram (10â9Â g) of technetium.[15][51][52] Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain an absorption line in their spectrum indicating the presence of technetium.[19][53] These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.",
