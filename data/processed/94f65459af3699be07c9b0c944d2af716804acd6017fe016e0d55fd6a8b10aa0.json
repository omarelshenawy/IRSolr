Originally a pejorative applied to all city-dwellers, it was eventually restricted to Londoners and particularly to the \"Bow-bell Cockneys\":[1] those born within earshot of Bow Bells, the bells of St Mary-le-Bow in the eastern Cheapside district of the City of London. More recently, it is variously used to refer to those in London's East End, or to all working-class Londoners generally.",
