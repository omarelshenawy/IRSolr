				"Data through end of December 2012. Updated on 17 January 2013.[2]",
				"The A340-600HGW (High Gross Weight) version first flew on 18 November 2005[103] and was certified on 14 April 2006.[104] It has an MTOW of 380 tonnes (840,000Â lb) and a range of up to 14,630 kilometres (7,900Â nmi), made possible by strengthened structure, increased fuel capacity, more powerful engines and new manufacturing techniques like laser beam welding. The A340-600HGW is powered by four 60,000Â lbf (270Â kN) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 560 turbofans. Emirates became the launch customer for the -600HGW when it ordered 18 at the 2003 Paris Air Show;[105] but postponed its order indefinitely and later cancelled. Rival Qatar Airways, which placed its order at the same airshow, took delivery of only four aircraft with the first aircraft on 11 September 2006.[106] The airline has since let its purchase options expire in favour of orders for the Boeing 777-300ER.[107]"
