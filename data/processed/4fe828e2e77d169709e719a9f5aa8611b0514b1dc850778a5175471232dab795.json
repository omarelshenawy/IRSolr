				"previous": "In April 1873, the Town of Hanover seized part of the southeast corner of the green to align East and West Wheelock Streets; the town moved the fence thirty feet to the north of its original position. Dartmouth students protested by tearing down and burning the rebuilt fence; the town responded by threatening to reopen Main Street on its previous route from the Green's southwest corner across to the northeast. In an effort to quickly replace the fence and prevent the road from being reopened, College President Asa Dodge Smith convinced students to pay for the new fence.[5][17] In 1893, when the fence's original purpose of keeping out livestock was no longer needed, the College decided to tear it down, to much student and alumni outcry. The class of 1893 restored and sponsored part of the fence as a \"senior fence,\" and today the Senior Fence runs along the parts of the southern and western borders closest to the southwest corner.[18] Only senior students were allowed to sit on it, and underclassmen in violation of this policy were soaked in a nearby watering trough.[3][15]",
				"after": "In 1906, the Board of Trustees voted to officially name the space \"the College Green,\" although at the time the space also went by names such as \"the College Square,\" \"the Common,\" and \"the Campus.\"[19] Aside from minor changes in furnishing, vegetation, and crosspaths,[2] the Green has remained largely unchanged since being cleared.[1]",
