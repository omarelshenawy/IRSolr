They have become rare in Thailand and some other parts of southeast Asia.[11] They are relatively abundant in Hong Kong, where the population increased from 39 to 57 birds between 2002 and 2009.[52] A field study on Kangaroo Island in South Australia showed that nesting pairs in areas of high human disturbance (as defined by clearing of landscape and high human activity) had lower breeding success rates.[53] In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, nests have been vacated as human activities have encroached on the eagles' territories.[54] Elsewhere, the clearing of trees suitable for nesting has seen it largely disappear locally, such as the removal of stands of Casuarina equisetifolia in Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh in India.[55] In India, nest densities of about one per 4.32Â km of coastline have been noted in Sindhudurg and one per 3.57Â km (45 nests along 161Â km) in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.[56][57] They also nest on Netrani Island , where about a 100 birds were noted in 1875 (then known as Pigeon Island) by Allan Octavian Hume who noted that this was perhaps the largest breeding colony of the species.[58] In 2000, the disturbance to the island from torpedo-firing exercises conducted by the Indian navy was noted as a threat.[59] Nearly 100 nests have been noted in 2004 on this island.[60]",
