				"Baseball writer Josh Pahigian wrote that the club has been \"long considered the greatest measure of superior bat handling.\"[18] Reaching 3,000 hits is often described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[19][20][21] All eligible club members, with the exception of Palmeiro and Jeter (who will not be eligible for Hall of Fame induction until 2020), have been elected to the Hall, and since 1962 all club members who have been inducted were elected on the first ballot with the exception of Biggio. Rose was declared permanently ineligible for the Hall of Fame when he was banned from baseball.[22][23] Palmeiro failed to reach the threshold for further Hall of Fame consideration by the BBWAA in 2014.[24]"
