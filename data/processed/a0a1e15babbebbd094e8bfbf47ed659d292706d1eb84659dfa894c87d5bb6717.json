				"previous": "Upper Pine Bottom State Park traces its existence to the early 1920s, when the Pennsylvania Department of Forestry built 31Â campsites on state forest land between 1921Â and 1925. The park was originally established as \"Upper Pine Bottom Class B Public Camp\" and named for the stream that flows through it. Class B camps were on secondary highways and were \"used primarily by hikers, hunters, fishermen, vacationists, and picknickers who desire to go far into the woods and make their stay comfortable\".[12] Each Class B camp had a lean-to shelter for camping, potable water, picnic tables, a fireplace, garbage can, and a latrine. There was no charge to use any of the camps, but stays were limited to two consecutive nights.[28]",
				"after": "During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) set up nine camps in Tiadaghton State Forest. The camps included two near Upper Pine Bottom State Park: CCC Camp S-82-Pa (Waterville, also known as Haneyville) was on Upper Pine Bottom Run about 2.5 miles (4.0Â km) west of the park and operated from May 1933Â to 1941;[29] CCC Camp S-129-Pa (Little Pine) was at the site of nearby Little Pine State Park and operated from 1933Â to 1937.[30][31] The CCC planted large numbers of trees in the state forest, did work in the park, and built a pavilion at the site in 1936.[32] Although the roof of a structure was still visible in the park in a 1959Â aerial photo,[33][b] as of 2009Â there are no pavilions or other buildings in the park.[2] The United States' entry into the Second World War led to the end of the CCC and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942.[34]",
