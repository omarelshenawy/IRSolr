				"after": "The following artists achieved four or more number-one hits during the 2000s. A number of artists had number-one singles on their own as well as part of a collaboration. Madonna, Timbaland and Justin Timberlake's song \"4 Minutes\", for example, is counted for all three artists because they were credited on the cover, while \"Where Is the Love?\" does not count for Timberlake as he did not receive artist credit on that track to avoid overexposure.",
