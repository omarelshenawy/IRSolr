				"previous": "The toothcomb of most lemuriforms includes six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine teeth that are procumbent (tilt forward) in the front of the mouth.[4][15] The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them,[15] but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors.[13] In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors.[16] The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt,[15] and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side.[17] The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline.[18] As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.[15]",
				"after": "The French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville first identified the two lateral teeth of the lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840.[19] Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects.[20] With modified lower canine teeth, the first lower premolars following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth (caniniform)[4][21] and assume their function.[15] These premolars are commonly confused with canines.[22] Normally the true canines in the lower jaw sit in front of the upper canines, and in toothcombed primates, the caniniform premolars rest behind it.[15]",
