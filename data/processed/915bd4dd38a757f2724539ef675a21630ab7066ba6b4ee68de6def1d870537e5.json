				"previous": "On 12 August 1959, BEA signed a Â£28 million contract for 24 de Havilland DH121 Trident Mark 1(C) \"second-generation\" jets plus 12 options, making it the launch customer for the world's first commercial T-tailed rear-engined trijet due to enter service in spring 1964.[36][37] (This version of the Trident was smaller and lighter than de Havilland's original DH121 of 1956.[36][38] At that time BEA's chairman, Anthony Milward, had insisted that a launch order from BEA depended on scaling down the original design, in the belief that the Vickers Vanguard high-capacity turboprops it had ordered the year before would remain competitive against jets on trunk routes as a result of lower operating and seat-mile costs.[7] BEA's insistence on building the Trident smaller with less powerful engines and a lower fuel capacity than originally proposed was also a manifestation of the cautious attitude of the airline's senior management against a backdrop of a [temporary] reduction in its profit margin and slowdown in its growth rate.[39] Meeting BEA's specifications for the Trident involved reducing the length of the aircraft's fuselage, its wingspan and weight and replacing the Rolls-Royce RB141/3 \"Medway\" engines with Rolls-Royce RB163 \"Speys\". Shrinking the original design also reduced seating capacity from 111-130 to 79-90, in mixed- and single-class configuration respectively.[36])",
				"after": "On 7 November 1959, BEA took delivery of its first Comet 4B (G-APMB), nearly two months ahead of the contracted delivery on 1 January 1960. This was followed by the official handover ceremony of the airline's first jet airliner on 16 November.[40]",
