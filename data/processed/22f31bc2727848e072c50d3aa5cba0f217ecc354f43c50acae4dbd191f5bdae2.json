				"The following table shows the history of the D'Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert's lifetime (excluding tours):",
				"As discussed below, Joseph Papp's 1980â83 Pirates ran for nearly two years each on Broadway and in the West End and gave a boost to the opera's popularity. Professional and amateur productions of the opera continue with frequency. For example, the Chicago Lyric Opera and English National Opera each staged the work in 2004,[82] and in 2007, the New York City Opera and Opera Australia both mounted new productions.[83][84] In 2013, Scottish Opera produced a British touring production of The Pirates of Penzance co-produced by the trustees of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Richard Suart played Major-General Stanley and Nicholas Sharratt played Frederic.[85][86]"
