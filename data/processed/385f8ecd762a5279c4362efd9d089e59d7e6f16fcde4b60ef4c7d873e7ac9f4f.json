				"Saint Venantius of Camerino (d. ca. 250) is an Italian saint, and the patron of Camerino. Christian tradition holds that he was a seventeen-year old who was tortured and martyred by beheading at Camerino during the persecutions of Decius. Martyred with him were the priest Porphyrius, Venantius' tutor; and Leontius, bishop of the city.His legend states that, before Venantius was killed, he was scourged, burned with flaming torches, hanged upside-down over a fire, had his teeth knocked out and his jaw broken, thrown to the lions, and tossed over a high cliff. His 11th century Acts state additionally that he managed to briefly escape from Camerino and hide out at Raiano, where a church was later dedicated to him.Venantius was buried outside the city walls of Camerino, where a basilica was built in the fifth century, and later rebuilt many times in succeeding centuries. The cult of Venantius became popular: his image appeared on coins and in litanies; springs near the basilica, which were associated with the saint, were used by lepers and people with ulcers to cure their afflictions. Venantius subsequently replaced Saint Ansovinus as the city's patron saint. Attributes:young man crucified upside-down with smoke coming from his head; young man holding the citadel of Camerino; young man holding the city of Camerino, a palm, and a book; young man with a banner holding a city wall Patronage:Camerino Prayer:"
