				"after": "Van der Weyden worked in the same tradition of portraiture as contemporaries Jan van Eyck[note 4] and Robert Campin.[note 5] In the early to middle 15th century, these three artists were among the first generation of \"Northern Renaissance\" painters, and the first northern Europeans to portray members of the middle and upper classes naturalistically rather than in a medieval Christian idealised form. In earlier Netherlandish art the profile view was the dominant mode of representation for the nobles or clergy worthy of portraiture.[19] In works such as Portrait of a Man in a Turban (1433), Jan van Eyck broke this tradition and used the three-quarter profile of the face which became the standard in Netherlandish art. Here, van der Weyden utilises the same profile, which better allows him to describe the shape of the head and facial features of the sitter.[20] She is shown in half-length, which enables the artist to show her hands crossed at her waist.[21][22]",
