				"after": "\"Ray of Light\" has been featured in the set lists of three Madonna tours â 2001's Drowned World Tour, 2006's Confessions Tour and 2008â09's Sticky & Sweet Tour. She appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1998 and performed \"Ray of Light\" and \"Little Star\".[55] During the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards Madonna started performing \"Shanti/Ashtangi\", sporting black hair and wearing an Indian sari. Lenny Kravitz then appeared playing the guitar, which paved way to \"Ray of Light\". A religious group called the World Vaishnava Association claimed that Madonna offended Hindus with the performance by continuing to wear a Hindi mark on her head while performing the song. A spokesperson for the association stated that the mark is a symbol of chastity, harmony and purity, and is designed to show \"dedication to God\". The representative also said that because Madonna simulated a sexual act and wore a see-through tank top onstage while wearing the mark, she offended both Hindus and Yogis.[56] A spokesperson for Madonna stated that the singer did not understand why the World Vaishnava Association was upset as she had not done anything insulting, and did not wish to insult anyone.[56] However, the vice president of the World Vaishnava Association claimed that \"the Hindu community and Eastern spiritual seekers the world over should be happy for Madonna personally in terms of her genuine interest in enlightened life, and grateful to her for her sincere efforts to attract others to the same\".[57]",
