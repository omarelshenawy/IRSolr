According to the vexillologist Timothy Wilson, the flags depicted flying from the ships are \"the most elaborate source we have for the flags flown on the ships of King Henry VIII, being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together.\"[28] Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers, shown flying from all ships in varying numbers. These feature a Saint George red cross on white ground on the hoist, nearest the flagpole, and a very long tail striped in green and white. They all feature gold paint on the red and green, and silver paint (now oxidized to black) on the white. This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them.[29]",
