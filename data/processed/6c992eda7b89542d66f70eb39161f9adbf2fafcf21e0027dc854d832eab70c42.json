				"previous": "Immediately to the west of the town is Brownhills Common, a 100-acre (0.40Â km2) heathland which once formed part of Cannock Forest (also known as \"Canke Wood\").[32] Although the forest was felled in the 15th and 16th centuries, the spread of heather and the grazing of sheep led to the creation of a huge area of heathland. The area was affected by mine workings but has now returned to a more natural state and lizards and dragonflies may be observed.[33] The area now supports various habitat types, with the heathland mixing with marshy grassland, with scattered scrub and pools.[34] In 1926, when ownership of the Common was transferred to the local Council, a large area of barren land at the eastern end, closest to the town, was landscaped, with new trees planted.[35] Lying south of the Common, Birch Coppice is a large area of predominantly oak and birch woodland, which, although crossed by a now-dismantled railway line, mostly escaped the destruction caused to other wooded areas by mining and other industry.[15]",
				"after": "To the south, Brownhills is separated from the nearby village of Clayhanger by Clayhanger Common, which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and considered \"one of the best wetland sites in the county\".[36] In 2007, a new Â£445,000 bridge was erected across the canal at Brownhills, providing pedestrian, disabled and cycling access to the Common and to the village of Clayhanger beyond.[37] To the east lies the village of Stonnall and a large area of green belt land.[38]",
