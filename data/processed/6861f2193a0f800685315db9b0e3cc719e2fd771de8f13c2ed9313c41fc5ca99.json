				"previous": "Rhodocene exists as [Rh(C5H5)2], a paramagnetic 19-valence electron radical monomer only at or below â196Â Â°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150Â Â°C in the gas phase.[1][3][4] It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. However, at room temperature (25Â Â°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds;[1] instead, rhodocene forms [Rh(C5H5)2]2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure.[32] Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point to the presence of an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms.[4] ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, nÂ >Â 2) with a mirror plane (Ï) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene[3][Note 2] although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned.[32] The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry.[33] The dimerisation is a redox process, the dimer being a rhodium(I) species whilst the monomer has a rhodium(II) metal centre.[Note 3] Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.[34]",
				"after": "This dimerisation process has the overall effect of decreasing the electron count around the rhodium centre from 19 to 18. This occurs because the oxidative coupling of the two cyclopentadienyl ligands produces a new ligand with lower hapticity and which donates fewer electrons to the metal centre. The term hapticity is used to indicate the \"number of carbon (or other) atoms through which [a ligand] binds (n)\"[35] to a metal centre and is symbolised as Î·n. For example, the ethylene ligand in Zeise's salt is bound to the platinum centre through both carbon atoms, and it hence formally has the formula K[PtCl3(Î·2-C2H4)]Â·H2O. The carbonyl ligands in nickel tetracarbonyl are each bound through only a carbon atom and are hence described as monohapto ligands, but Î·1-notations are typically omitted in formulae. The cyclopentadienyl ligands in many metallocene and half-sandwich compounds are pentahapto ligands, hence the formula [Rh(Î·5-C5H5)2] for the rhodocene monomer. In the rhodocene dimer, the coupled cyclopentadienyl ligands are 4-electron tetrahapto donors to each rhodium(I) metal centre, in contrast to the 6-electron[Note 4] pentahapto cyclopentadienyl donors. The increased stability of the 18-valence electron rhodium(I) dimer species as compared to the 19-valence electron rhodium(II) monomer likely explains why the monomer is only detected under extreme conditions.[1][4]",
