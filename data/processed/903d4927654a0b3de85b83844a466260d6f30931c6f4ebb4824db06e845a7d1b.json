				"previous": "Jumbo traveled in luxury when he went on tour every year. He had his own railway boxcar. Barnum called it \"Jumbo's Palace Car\". It was a red and gold boxcar with huge double doors at the center for Jumbo to be able to enter and leave easily. Scotty slept in a bunk in a little room near Jumbo's head. Jumbo would never let Scotty close the door to the little room.[57]",
				"after": "Scotty and Jumbo always shared a bottle of beer before going to bed for the night. It was a little ritual Jumbo loved. One night, Scotty drank the bottle of beer and fell asleep. Jumbo picked him up very carefully and set him down near the empty bottle. Scotty woke up and found the bottle. He \"got the message\". He never forgot to share a bottle of beer with Jumbo again.[57][58]",
