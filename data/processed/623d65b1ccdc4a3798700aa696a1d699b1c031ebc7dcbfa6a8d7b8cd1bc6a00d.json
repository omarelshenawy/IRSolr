				"after": "Telopea oreades occurs in moist forests and temperate rainforests of coastal ranges and tableland escarpments in two disjunct areas of southeastern Australia.[3] The first is centred on East Gippsland in Victoria, from Orbost to the vicinity of Eden across the border in far southeastern New South Wales. There is a more northerly population around the Monga Valley near Braidwood, New South Wales extending to Moss Vale.[3][5] There are unconfirmed reports of the species in the vicinity of Brown Mountain and Glenbog State Forest in southern New South Wales, which lie between the two areas.[15] Plants in Victoria are found at altitudes ranging from 200 metres (660Â ft) in Lind National Park to 1,300 metres (4,300Â ft) on Mount Ellery.[11] Wetter eastern and southern slopes are favoured habitats, and the annual rainfall ranges from 1000 to 2000Â mm (40â80Â in).[15]",
