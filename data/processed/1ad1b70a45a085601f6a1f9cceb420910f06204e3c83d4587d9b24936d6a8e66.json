				"after": "It has been difficult to determine the number of speakers of Scots via census, because many respondents might interpret the question \"Do you speak Scots?\" in different ways. Campaigners for Scots pressed for this question to be included in the 2001 UK National Census. The results from a 1996 trial before the Census, by the General Register Office for Scotland,[56] suggested that there were around 1.5 million speakers of Scots, with 30% of Scots responding \"Yes\" to the question \"Can you speak the Scots language?\", but only 17% responding \"Aye\" to the question \"Can you speak Scots?\".[citation needed] (It was also found that older, working-class people were more likely to answer in the affirmative.) The University of Aberdeen Scots Leid Quorum performed its own research in 1995, cautiously suggesting that there were 2.7 million speakers, though with clarification as to why these figures required context.[57]",
