Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy. In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000Â people and a total of 3,150Â doctors, 5,661Â nurses, 385Â community health workers, 175Â pharmacists and 57Â dentists for a population of 22Â million. 14.6Â percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70Â percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30Â percent originated with international donors and other private sources.[118] The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.[93]",
