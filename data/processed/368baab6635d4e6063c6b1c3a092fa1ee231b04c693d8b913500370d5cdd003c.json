Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be \"identity brands\". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them \"iconic brands\". Examples are: Apple, Nike and Harley Davidson. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.",
