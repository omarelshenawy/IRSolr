				"after": "A total of 12 Type 1101 VC10 were purchased in 1964â65, followed by 17 Type 1151 Super VC10 in 1965â69. The VC10 became an immensely popular aircraft in the BOAC fleet, both with passengers and crew, being particularly praised for its comfort and low cabin noise level. BOAC (and later British Airways) obtained higher load factors with the VC10 than the 707 or any other aircraft of its fleets.[26][27] Operational experience soon resulted in the deletion of the inboard thrust-reversers due to continued tailplane buffeting despite the engine repositioning. One BOAC Super VC10 was lost during the Dawson's Field hijackings in 1970.",
