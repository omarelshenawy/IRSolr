				"previous": "Many countries had both timber and stone castles,[133] however Denmark had few quarries, and as a result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.[134] Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-built counterparts. Brick castles are less common in England than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was chosen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, but the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000Â bricks were used to build the castle, which has been described as \"the finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\".[135] Most Spanish castles were built from stone, whereas castles in Eastern Europe were usually of timber construction.[136]",
