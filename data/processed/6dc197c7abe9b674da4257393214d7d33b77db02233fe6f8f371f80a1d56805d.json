She was born in Bhambla, a small town in Himachal Pradesh. Adamant to build her own career path, she relocated to Delhi at age sixteen, where she briefly became a model. After training under the theatre director Arvind Gaur, she made her film debut in the 2006 thriller Gangster. She received praise for portraying emotionally intense characters in the dramas Woh Lamhe (2006), Life in a... Metro (2007) and Fashion (2008). For the last of these, she won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. Ranaut featured in the successful films Raaz: The Mystery Continues (2009) and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010), though she was criticised for being typecast in neurotic roles. A comic role opposite R. Madhavan in Tanu Weds Manu (2011) was well-received, though this was followed by brief roles in unsuccessful films. She then played a mutant in the science fiction film Krrish 3 (2013), one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films, and won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the comedy-drama Queen (2014).
