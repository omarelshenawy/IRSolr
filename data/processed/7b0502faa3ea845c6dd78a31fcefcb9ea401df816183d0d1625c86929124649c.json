				"previous": "The Test selectors made five changes to the team who had played in the previous Test match. Significantly, Australia's most successful bowler Clarrie Grimmett was replaced by Ward, one of four players making their debut. Bradman's role in Grimmett's omission from the team was controversial and it became a theme that dogged Bradman as Grimmett continued to be prolific in domestic cricket while his successors were ineffectiveâhe was regarded as having finished the veteran bowler's Test career in a political purge.[93]",
				"after": "Australia fell to successive defeats in the opening two Tests,[94] Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, and it seemed that the captaincy was affecting his form.[71] The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.",
