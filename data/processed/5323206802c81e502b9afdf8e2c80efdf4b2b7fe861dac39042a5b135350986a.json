				"previous": "In Japan, not only humpback, minkes, sperm, and many other smaller Odontoceti, but also including critically endangered species such as North Pacific right, western gray, and northern fin have been targets of illegal captures utilizing harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets, and later reports to administrative organs or research institutions as cases of entanglements where fishermen tried their best to save whales. Humpback's meat can also be found on markets even today, and there had been a case in which it was scientifically revealed that humpbacks of unknown quantities with other species were illegally hunted in EEZ of anti-whaling nations such as off Mexico or South Africa, and so on.[67]",
				"after": "The worldwide population is at least 80,000 humpback whales, with 18,000â20,000 in the North Pacific,[68] about 12,000 in the North Atlantic,[69] and over 50,000 in the Southern Hemisphere,[70] down from a prewhaling population of 125,000.[17]",
