They are considered to be \"either those of Augustinian canons, privileged members of their lay household, or of important members of the Dutton family\".[95] Most burials were in stone coffins or in wooden coffins with stone lids, and had been carried out from the late 12thÂ century up to the time of the dissolution.[95] The site of the burial depended on the status of the individual, whether they were clerical or lay, and their degree of importance. Priors, abbots, and high-ranking canons were buried within the church, with those towards the east end of the church being the most important. Other canons were buried in a graveyard outside the church, in an area to the south and east of the chancel. Members of the laity were buried either in the church, towards the west end of the nave or in the north aisle, or outside the church around its west end. It is possible that there was a lay cemetery to the north and west of the church.[94] The addition of the chapels to the north transept, and their expansion, was carried out for the Dutton family,[96] making it their burial chapel,[97] or family mausoleum,[98] and the highest concentration of burials was found in this part of the church.[99] It is considered that the north aisle, built after the priory became an abbey, was added to provide a burial place for members of the laity.[95]",
