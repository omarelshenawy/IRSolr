				"after": "Although five men indicated their intent to seek the chair in 1860 or were proposed in their absence, in the end the two who contested the election were Monier Williams and Max MÃ¼ller. Williams (known later in life as Sir Monier Monier-Williams) was the son of an army officer and was born in India. He studied briefly at Balliol College, Oxford, before training at Haileybury for the civil service in India. The death of his brother in battle in India led to him to return to Oxford to complete his degree. He also studied Sanskrit with Wilson before teaching this and other languages at Haileybury from 1844 until 1858, when it closed following the Indian rebellion.[14] He prepared an EnglishâSanskrit dictionary, at Wilson's prompting, which the East India Company published in 1851; his SanskritâEnglish dictionary was supported by the Secretary of State for India.[15] As the Dutch anthropologist Peter van der Veer has written, Williams \"had an Evangelical zeal\" according with the views that had inspired Boden to establish the chair.[16]",
