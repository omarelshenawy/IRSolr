				"after": "By the late 18th century, Lyme Regis had become a popular seaside resort, especially after 1792 when the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars made travel to the European mainland dangerous for the English gentry, and increasing numbers of wealthy and middle class tourists were arriving there.[11] Even before Mary's time locals supplemented their income by selling what were called \"curios\" to visitors. These were fossils with colourful local names such as \"snake-stones\" (ammonites), \"devil's fingers\" (belemnites), and \"verteberries\" (vertebrae), to which were sometimes attributed medicinal and mystical properties.[12] Fossil collecting was in vogue in the late 18th and early 19th century, at first as a pastime, but gradually transforming into a science as the importance of fossils to geology and biology was understood.",
