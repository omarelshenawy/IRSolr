				"Bombardier was the full turnkey supplier for the completely underground system, including the construction of the civil works, and is operating and maintaining the system",
				"In early 2006, the first driverless transit system in Spain, and the longest airport people mover system in Europe, began transporting passengers between The new terminal (T4) and a new satellite terminal (T4S) at Madrid's Barajas International Airport. Deploying the CITYFLO 550 automatic train control technology, the system is the only mode of transportation for passengers between the two terminals, which are spaced more than two kilometres apart."

				"after": "The Madrid Metro Line connects the airport with city centre station Nuevos Ministerios in the heart of Madrid's financial district. The Barajas Line 8 provides a fast route from the underground stations at Terminal 2 (access to T1 and T3) and Terminal 4 into central Madrid. The metro also provides links to stations on the Spanish railway network. The first ride in the morning leaves from Nuevos Ministerios around 6:05Â am, arriving at Terminals 1-2-3 around 6:20, and at Terminal 4 around 6:25.",
