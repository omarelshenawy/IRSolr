				"Marsh is a suburb of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England that is situated 1.5Â km (1Â mi) west of the town centre.",
				"At the 2001 census the population was recorded as 4,482. It is said that the area is so-called because it was wetland before it was reclaimed. It used to be known as Paddock-with-Marsh. The A640 road between Huddersfield town centre and Junction 23 of the M62 motorway runs through Marsh. This thoroughfare is known as Westbourne Road and is Marsh's main shopping area. One of Huddersfield's private schools, Huddersfield Grammar, is situated on Luck Lane."
