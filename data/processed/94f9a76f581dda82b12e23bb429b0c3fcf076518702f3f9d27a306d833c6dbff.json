As primary contractor, Boeing was to construct the forward fuselage, wings and perform the final assembly. Northrop Grumman was the principal airframe subcontractor and they would supply the center and aft fuselage as well as the principal electronic combat system.[1][5] In 2003, the Navy expected to receive 90 EA-18Gs.[6]",
