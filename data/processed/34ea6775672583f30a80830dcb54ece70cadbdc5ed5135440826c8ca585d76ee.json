				"previous": "Providence is home to an 1,200-acre (4.9Â km2) park system,[105] notably Waterplace Park and Riverwalk, Roger Williams Park, Roger Williams National Memorial, and Prospect Terrace Park, the latter featuring expansive views of the downtown area. As one of the first cities in the country, Providence contains many historic buildings while the East Side neighborhood in particular includes the largest contiguous area of buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the U.S. with many pre-revolutionary houses.[106] The East Side is also home to the First Baptist Church in America, the oldest Baptist church in the Americas, founded by Roger Williams in 1638, as well as the Old State House, which served as the state's capitol from 1762 to 1904.[107] Nearby is Roger Williams National Memorial. Downcity Providence is home to the fourth-largest unsupported dome in the world (the second-largest marble dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome),[108] as well as the Westminster Arcade, which is the oldest enclosed shopping center in the U.S.[109][110]",
				"after": "The main art museum is the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, which has the 20th-largest collection in the country.[111] In addition to the Providence Public Library and the nine branches of the Providence Community Library, the city is home to the Providence AthenÃ¦um, the fourth oldest library in the country.[112] Here, on one of his many visits to Providence, Edgar Allan Poe, met and courted a love interest named Sarah Helen Whitman.[113] Poe was a regular fixture there, as was H. P. Lovecraft (who was born in Providence); both of them influential writers of gothic literature.",
