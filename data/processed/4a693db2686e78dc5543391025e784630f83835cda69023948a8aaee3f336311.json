				"after": "Mrs Smith's Cottage is a mid-19th century Grade II listed building made from early Victorian red bricks.[81] The range, the heart of the house, was in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap â installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s â and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.[82]",
