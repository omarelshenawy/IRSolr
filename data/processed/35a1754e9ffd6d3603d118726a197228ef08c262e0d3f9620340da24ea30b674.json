				"previous": "At MayÂ 1971Â (1971-05), the ALA fleet consisted of two C-46s, five DC-3s, two DC-6Bs and five YS-11A-300s that served a domestic network including Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Formosa, Goya, ParanÃ¡, Paso de los Libres, Posadas, Resistencia, Rosario, Salta, Santa Fe and TucumÃ¡n, plus regional services to Antofagasta and AsunciÃ³n,[13] whereas CATASACI had a fleet that included seven BAC One-Elevens âfour 400s and three 500sâ, one C-46, one DC-6 and three YS-11s.[14] Austral LÃ­neas AÃ©reas was formally established in June that year from the merger of CATASACI and ALA.[8] In practice, operations of the latter airline were absorbed by CATASACI, which was rebranded as Austral LÃ­neas AÃ©reas S.A. after merging. Austral inherited both companies' fleet, consisting of turboprops NAMC YS-11 and jetliners BAC One-Eleven.",
