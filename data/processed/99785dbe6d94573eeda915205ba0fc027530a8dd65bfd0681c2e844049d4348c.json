				"after": "The cultural identity of Dawson Creek rests on its designation as Mile \"0\" of the Alaska Highway. The Mile \"0\" post, depicted in the city flag, is located in the historic downtown area, one block south of the Northern Alberta Railways Park. This four-acre (1.6Â ha), mostly paved park is the gathering point for travellers. The park includes the Dawson Creek Art Gallery, which exhibits work by local artists and craftsmen. The Station Museum, connected to the art gallery, displays artifacts and exhibits associated with the construction of the NAR railway and the Alaska Highway. Other parks in Dawson Creek include the Mile Zero Rotary Park and the Walter Wright Pioneer Village. Annual events in the city include the Dawson Creek Symphonette and Choir performance, the Dawson Creek Art Gallery auction, the Dawson Creek Spring Rodeo, and the Peace Country Blue Grass Festival.[37] The largest event, held annually since 1953, is the Dawson Creek Fall Fair & Exhibition â a five-day professional rodeo, with a parade, fairgrounds, and exhibitions.[38]",
