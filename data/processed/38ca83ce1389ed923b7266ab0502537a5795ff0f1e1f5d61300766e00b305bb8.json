				"after": "The first turnpike road in the area was the latter-day A56 Chester Road between Manchester and Crossford Bridge (on the border between Sale and Stretford). Turnpike trusts collected tolls from road users and used the proceeds to maintain the highway. There was a toll booth on the Sale side of Crossford Bridge. Another section of road between Altrincham and Crossford Bridge was turnpiked in 1765.[131] The commencement of \"swift packet\" services on the newly opened Bridgewater Canal in 1776 made commuting from Sale into Manchester both practical and convenient, with boats travelling at a relatively swift 10Â mph (16Â km/h).[132] However the arrival in 1849 of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway[25] sounded a death-knell for both the canal packet services and turnpike trusts. Many trusts went into terminal decline, mirroring a national trend. By 1888 almost all roads and highways were the responsibility of the local authority.[131] Sale's railway station, originally named Sale Moor,[25] was renamed to Sale in 1856.[133] Three years later Brooklands railway station was opened, followed in 1931 by the opening of Dane Road railway station along with the electrification of the entire line.[134] The line was renovated in the early 1990s and is now part of the Metrolink.[134]",
