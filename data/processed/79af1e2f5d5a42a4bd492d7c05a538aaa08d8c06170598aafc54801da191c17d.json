				"previous": "For the next hour, the Mexican army worked to secure complete control of the Alamo.[113] Many of the remaining defenders were ensconced in the fortified barracks rooms.[114] In the confusion, the Texians had neglected to spike their cannon before retreating. Mexican soldiers turned the cannon towards the barracks.[105] As each door was blown off Mexican soldiers would fire a volley of muskets into the dark room, then charge in for hand-to-hand combat.[114]",
				"after": "Too sick to participate in the battle, Bowie likely died in bed. Eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of his death. Some witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him alive from the room.[115] Others claimed that Bowie shot himself or was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head.[116] According to historian Wallace Chariton, the \"most popular, and probably the most accurate\"[117] version is that Bowie died on his cot, \"back braced against the wall, and using his pistols and his famous knife.\"[116] The first two Mexican soldiers that stormed into the room were shot and killed by Bowie's pistols, and drawing his knife, Bowie killed one or two other soldiers before the rest repeatedly stabbed him with their bayonets.",
