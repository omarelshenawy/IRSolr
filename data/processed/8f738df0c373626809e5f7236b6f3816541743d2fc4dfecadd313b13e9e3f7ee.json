				"after": "The United States has a capitalist mixed economy which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[360] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[361] Its national GDP was about 5% larger at PPP in 2014 than the European Union's, whose population is around 62% higher.[362] However, the US's nominal GDP is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[update], which is about 5% smaller than that of the European Union.[363] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[364] The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[361] The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.[365]",
