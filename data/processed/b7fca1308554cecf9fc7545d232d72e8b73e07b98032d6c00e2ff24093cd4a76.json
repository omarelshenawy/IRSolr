				"The European area of the Netherlands lies between latitudes 50Â° and 54Â° N, and longitudes 3Â° and 8Â° E.",
				"The Netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country, with about 26% of its area[62] and 21% of its population[63] located below sea level, and only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level.[17] The country is for the most part flat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast, up to a height of no more than 321 metres, and some low hill ranges in the central parts. Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation. Since the late 16th century, large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes, canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes."
