				"previous": "On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.[90] Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June and eight days later France surrendered and was soon divided into German and Italian occupation zones,[91] and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet but the British feared the Germans would seize it, so on 3 July, the British attacked it.[92]",
				"after": "On 19 July, Hitler again publicly offered to end the war, saying he had no desire to destroy the British Empire. The United Kingdom rejected this, with Lord Halifax responding \"there was in his speech no suggestion that peace must be based on justice, no word of recognition that the other nations of Europe had any right to selfâdeterminationÂ ...\"[93]",
