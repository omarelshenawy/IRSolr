Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error-correction and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplinesâsuch as information theory, electrical engineering, mathematics, and computer scienceâfor the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction (or detection) of errors in the transmitted data.",
