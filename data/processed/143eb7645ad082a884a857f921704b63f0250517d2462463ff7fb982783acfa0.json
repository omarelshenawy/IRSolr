				"after": "Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Eisenach, Saxe-Eisenach, on 21 March 1685 O.S. (31 March 1685 N.S.). He was the son of Johann Ambrosius Bach, the director of the town musicians, and Maria Elisabeth LÃ¤mmerhirt.[10] He was the eighth child of Johann Ambrosius, (the eldest son in the family was 14 at the time of Bach's birth)[11] who probably taught him violin and the basics of music theory.[12] His uncles were all professional musicians, whose posts included church organists, court chamber musicians, and composers. One uncle, Johann Christoph Bach (1645â93), introduced him to the organ, and an older second cousin, Johann Ludwig Bach (1677â1731), was a well-known composer and violinist. Bach drafted a genealogy around 1735, titled \"Origin of the musical Bach family\".[13]",
