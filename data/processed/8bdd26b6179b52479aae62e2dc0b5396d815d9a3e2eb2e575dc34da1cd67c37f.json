Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). In April 2009, budget cuts lead to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed menâs and womenâs teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and menâs programs in golf and wrestling.[290][291]",
