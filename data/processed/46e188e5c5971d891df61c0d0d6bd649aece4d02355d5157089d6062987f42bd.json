				"after": "The most notorious massacre of Jews in the Soviet Union was at a ravine called Babi Yar outside Kiev, where 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation on 29â30 September 1941.[149] The decision to kill all the Jews in Kiev was made by the military governor (Major-General Friedrich Eberhardt), the Police Commander for Army Group South (SS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Friedrich Jeckeln), and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. A mixture of SS, SD, and Security Police, assisted by Ukrainian police, carried out the killings. Although they did not participate in the killings, men of the 6th Army played a key role in rounding up the Jews of Kiev and transporting them to be shot at Babi Yar.[150]",
