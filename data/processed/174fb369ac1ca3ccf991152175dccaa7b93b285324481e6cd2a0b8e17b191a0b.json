				"after": "The largest of the Australian corvids, the adult forest raven is 50â53Â cm (20â21Â in) in length with a wingspan between 91â113Â cm (36â44Â in) and weight of approximately 650Â g (1.4Â lb). There is no seasonal variation in plumage, which is entirely glossy black with a blue or green sheen visible on the upperparts.[10] The wings are long and broad, with the largest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. It is quite short in Tasmanian populations but longer in northern New South Wales. The beak is a similar shape to that of the little raven, though more massive and heavy-set. The upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles.[15] The mouth and tongue are black, as are the powerful legs and feet. The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long.[16]",
