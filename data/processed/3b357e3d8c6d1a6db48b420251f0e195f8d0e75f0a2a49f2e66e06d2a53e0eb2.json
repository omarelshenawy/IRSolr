				"after": "In 1999, British Airways reported a 50% drop in profits, its worst since privatisation.[168][169] This was compounded by the majority of BA subsidiary companies running at heavy losses as well; the company reacted by selling several.[170] In March 2000, Bob Ayling was removed from his position and, in May, British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. Eddington set about the termination of several investment programs, such as in Olympic Airways,[171] and cutting the workforce, the process being taken still further in response to the slump caused by the 9/11 attacks in 2001.[132][172][173] BA's share price dropped from 760p in May 1997 to only 150p in September 2001, showing how heavily the company had been hit.[174]",
