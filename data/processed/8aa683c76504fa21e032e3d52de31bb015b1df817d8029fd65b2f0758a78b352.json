				"to an acceptable level of approximation. Alternatively, some authors[20] simply require that",
				"In many applications, confidence intervals that have exactly the required confidence level are hard to construct. But practically useful intervals can still be found: the rule for constructing the interval may be accepted as providing a confidence interval at level Î³ if"

				"which is useful if the probabilities are only partially identified, or imprecise.",
				"When applying standard statistical procedures, there will often be standard ways of constructing confidence intervals. These will have been devised so as to meet certain desirable properties, which will hold given that the assumptions on which the procedure rely are true. These desirable properties may be described as: validity, optimality and invariance. Of these \"validity\" is most important, followed closely by \"optimality\". \"Invariance\" may be considered as a property of the method of derivation of a confidence interval rather than of the rule for constructing the interval. In non-standard applications, the same desirable properties would be sought."
