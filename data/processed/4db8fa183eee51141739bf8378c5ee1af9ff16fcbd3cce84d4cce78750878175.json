				"previous": "Lessons depicts a mother teaching her son. Presumably, many of the events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth.[1] Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons for Children of two to three (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part I (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part II (1778); and Lessons for Children of three to four (1779).[2] After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.",
				"after": "Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins, so that children could easily read them; she was more than likely the \"originator\" of this practice, according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, and \"almost certainly [its] popularizer\".[3] In her history of children's literature in The Guardian of Education (1802â1806), Sarah Trimmer noted these innovations, as well as the use of good-quality paper and large spaces between words.[4] While making reading easier, these production changes also made the books too expensive for the children of the poor, therefore Barbauld's books helped to create a distinct aesthetic for the middle-class children's book.[5]",
