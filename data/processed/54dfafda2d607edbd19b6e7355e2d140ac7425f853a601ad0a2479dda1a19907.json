The 737-600 was launched by Scandinavian Airlines in 1995 with the first aircraft delivered on September 18, 1998. The -600 is the only Boeing 737 still in production that does not include winglets as an option.[60] WestJet was to be the Boeing launch customer for the 737-600 with winglets, but announced in its Q2 2006 results that it would not be moving ahead with those plans.",
