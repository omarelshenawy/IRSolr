Throughout the 19th century in France, the main line dividing left and right was between supporters of the French Republic and those of the Monarchy.[5] The June Days Uprising during the Second Republic was an attempt by the left to assert itself after the 1848 Revolution, but only a small portion of the population supported this.",
