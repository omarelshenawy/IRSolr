The formation of the archipelago, which has never been connected to the mainland, began about 11Â million years ago; active vulcanism ceased about 2Â million years ago.[43] Remains of Noronhomys were found in association with remains of various reptiles, birds, and snails, several of which are also restricted to the archipelago,[18] in sand dunes near the northeastern tip of the main island.[44] The age of the deposits is unknown, but is likely late Holocene, at most a few thousand years old.[3]",
