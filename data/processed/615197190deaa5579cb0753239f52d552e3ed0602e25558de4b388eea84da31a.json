				"previous": "Resolving a periodic function into a sum of trigonometric functions forms a Fourier series, a technique much used in physics and engineering.[nb 13][76] The underlying vector space is usually the Hilbert space L2(0, 2Ï), for which the functions sin mx and cos mx (m an integer) form an orthogonal basis.[77] The Fourier expansion of an L2 function f is",
