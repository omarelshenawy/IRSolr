				"previous": "The Douglas XA-26 prototype (AAC Ser. No. 41-19504) first flew on 10 July 1942 at Mines Field, El Segundo, with test pilot Benny Howard at the controls. Flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling, but problems with engine cooling led to cowling changes and elimination of the propeller spinners on production aircraft. Repeated collapses during testing led to strengthening of the nose landing gear.[9]",
				"after": "The A-26 was originally built in two different configurations. The A-26B had a \"solid\" nose, which originally could be equipped with a combination of armament including .50 caliber machine guns, 37mm auto cannon, 20mm or even a 75mm pack howitzer, but normally the solid nose version housed six (or later eight) .50 caliber machine guns, officially termed the \"all-purpose nose\", later commonly known as the \"six-gun nose\" or \"eight-gun nose\". The A-26Cââ'âs \"glass\" nose, officially termed the \"Bombardier nose\", contained a Norden bombsight for medium altitude precision bombing. The A-26C nose section included two fixed M-2 guns, later replaced by underwing gun packs or internal guns in the wings.[10]",
