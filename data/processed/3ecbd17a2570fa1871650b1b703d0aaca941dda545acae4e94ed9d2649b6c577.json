The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument.[98][99] The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720.[100] It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce).[101] Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building.[102] The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century,[103] and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War.[104] Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings.[105] St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870[106] and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost Â£7,273,[39] (Â£590Â thousand today)[107] and the tower cost Â£1,800 (Â£150Â thousand today).[107] The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher.",
