				"after": "English is an Indo-European language, and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.[9] Most closely related to English are the Frisian languages, and English and Frisian form the Anglo-Frisian subgroup within West Germanic. Old Saxon and its descendent Low German languages are also closely related, and sometimes Low German, English, and Frisian are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic or North Sea Germanic languages.[10] Modern English descends from Middle English, which in turn descends from Old English.[11] English and all the Germanic languages descend from Proto-Germanic. Middle English also developed into a number of other English languages, including Scots[12] and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy dialects of Ireland.[13]",
