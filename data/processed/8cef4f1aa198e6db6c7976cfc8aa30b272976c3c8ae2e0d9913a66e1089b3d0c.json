The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss of respect for the Catholic Church.[215][216] The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies.[215] As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries.[215][217] In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness.[215][216] However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.[215][216]",
