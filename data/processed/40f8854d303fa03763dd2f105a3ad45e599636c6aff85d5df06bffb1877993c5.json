				"after": "Throughout the war, the Chetnik movement remained mostly inactive against the occupation forces, and increasingly collaborated with the Axis, eventually losing its international recognition as the Yugoslav resistance force.[6][81][82] After a brief initial period of cooperation, the Partisans and the Chetniks quickly started fighting against each other. Gradually, the Chetniks ended up primarily fighting the Partisans instead of the occupation forces, and started cooperating with the Axis in a struggle to destroy the Partisans, receiving increasing amounts of logistical assistance. MihailoviÄ admitted to a British colonel that the Chetniks' principal enemies were \"the partisans, the Ustasha, the Muslims, the Croats and last the Germans and Italians\" in that order.[83]",
