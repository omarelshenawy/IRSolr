				"previous": "Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752â1833) was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity. He also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. He gave a full treatment of the equation [62] and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss.[63] In his old age, he was the first to prove \"Fermat's last theorem\" for (completing work by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and crediting both him and Sophie Germain).[64]",
				"after": "In his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1798), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777â1855) proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation (congruences) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests.[65] The last section of the Disquisitiones established a link between roots of unity and number theory:",
