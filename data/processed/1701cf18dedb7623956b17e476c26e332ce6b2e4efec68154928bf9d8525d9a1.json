The Metacomet Ridge is described by some sources as a traprock ridge beginning on the Holyoke Range in Belchertown, Massachusetts, and ending at the Hanging Hills in Meriden, Connecticut.[4] A 2004 report conducted for the National Park Service extends that definition to include the entire traprock ridgeline from Greenfield, Massachusetts, to Long Island Sound.[1] The Sierra Club has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as \"The Traprock Ridge\".[5] Geologically and visually, the traprock ridgeline exists as one continuous landscape feature from Belchertown, Massachusetts, to Branford, Connecticut at Long Island Sound, a distance of 71 miles (114Â km), broken only by the river gorges of the Farmington River in northern Connecticut and the Westfield and Connecticut Rivers in Massachusetts.[1][3] Until January 2008, the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) did not recognize Metacomet Ridge, Traprock Ridge or any other name, although several sub-ranges were identified.[6][7] Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as \"the traprock ridge\" or \"the traprock mountains\" or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms.[8] Further complicating the matter is the fact that traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern threeâfourths of the range; an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part of the structure of the ridge; in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another 35 miles (56Â km) through Greenfield to nearly the Vermont border.[8][9] This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it.",
