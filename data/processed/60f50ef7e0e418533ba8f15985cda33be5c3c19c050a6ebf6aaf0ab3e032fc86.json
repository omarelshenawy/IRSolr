				"Fiji covers a total area of some 194,000 square kilometres (75,000Â sqÂ mi) of which around 10% is land.",
				"Fiji is the hub of the South West Pacific, midway between Vanuatu and Tonga. The archipelago is located between 176Â° 53â² east and 178Â° 12â² west. The 180Â° meridian runs through Taveuni but the International Date Line is bent to give uniform time (UTC+12) to all of the Fiji group. With the exception of Rotuma, the Fiji group lies between 15Â° 42â² and 20Â° 02â² south. Rotuma is located 220 nautical miles (410Â km; 250Â mi) north of the group, 360 nautical miles (670Â km; 410Â mi) from Suva, 12Â° 30â² south of the equator."
