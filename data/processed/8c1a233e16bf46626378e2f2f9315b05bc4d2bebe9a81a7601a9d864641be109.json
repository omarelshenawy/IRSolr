They were charged with four countsâconspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanityâin violation of international laws governing warfare.[414] All but three of the defendants were found guilty; twelve were sentenced to death.[415] The victorious Allies outlawed the NSDAP and its subsidiary organisations. The display or use of Nazi symbolism such as flags, swastikas, or greetings, is illegal in Germany and Austria.[416][417]",
