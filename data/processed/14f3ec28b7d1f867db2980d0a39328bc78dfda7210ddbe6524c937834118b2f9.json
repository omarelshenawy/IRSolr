				"previous": "Home Army numbers in 1944 include a cadre of over 10,000â11,000 officers, 7,500 officers-in-training (singular: podchorÄÅ¼y) and 88,000 non-commissioned officers (NCOs).[5] The officer cadre was formed from prewar officers and NCOs, graduates of underground courses, and elite operatives usually parachuted in from the West (the Silent Unseen).[5] The basic organizational unit was the platoon, numbering 35â50 people, with a skeleton unmobilized version of 16â25; in February 1944 the Home Army had 6,287 regular and 2,613 skeleton platoons operational.[5] Such numbers made the Home Army not only the largest Polish resistance movement, but one of the two largest in World War II Europe [a]. Casualties during the war are estimated at about 34,000[29]-100,000,[5] plus some 20,000[29]-50,000[5] after the war (casualties and imprisonment).",
