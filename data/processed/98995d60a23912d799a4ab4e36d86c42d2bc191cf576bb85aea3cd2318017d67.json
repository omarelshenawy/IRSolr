				"after": "The early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces, which had a degree of autonomy.[114] Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways, education, land sales and other policies, government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876.[115] As a result, New Zealand now has no separately represented subnational entities. The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays[116] and sporting rivalries.[117]",
