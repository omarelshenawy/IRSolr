				"after": "Today, the Icelandic horse is represented by associations in 19 countries, with the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations (FEIF) serving as a governing international parent organization.[32] The FEIF was founded on May 25, 1969, with six countries as original members: Austria, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. France and Norway joined in 1971, and Belgium and Sweden in 1975. Later, Finland, Canada, Great Britain, USA, Faroe Islands, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia and Ireland became members, but Ireland subsequently left because of a lack of members. New Zealand has been given the status of \"associate member\" as its membership base is small.[33] In 2000, WorldFengur was established as the official FEIF registry for Icelandic horses.[34] The registry is a web database program that is used as a studbook to track the history and bloodlines of the Icelandic breed.[35] The registry contains information on the pedigree, breeder, owner, offspring, photo, breeding evaluations and assessments, and unique identification of each horse registered. The database was established by the Icelandic government in cooperation with the FEIF.[34] Since its inception, around 300,000 Icelandic horses, living and dead, have been registered worldwide.[35] The Islandpferde-Reiter- und ZÃ¼chterverband is an organization of German riders and breeders of Icelandic horses and the association of all Icelandic horse clubs in Germany.[36]",
