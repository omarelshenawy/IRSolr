				"previous": "All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to the nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus).[54] The root system of the suckering forms of Banksia marginata in Victoria and South Australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root, and an extensive system of thick lateral roots 7.5â15Â cm (3â6Â in) below the surface. During the winter months, segments around 30Â cm (1Â ft) in length develop vegetative buds capable of forming suckers.[55] Clusters of fine proteoid roots up to 15Â cm (6Â in) long arise from these lateral roots.[56]",
				"after": "The response of Banksia marginata to fire is variable. In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions, plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed.[36][38] They are serotinous, storing their seed in old cones, forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire. A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances (generally 8Â m [25Â ft] or less), with those closest to the parent plant faring the best.[57] In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and also eastern south Australia, it grows as a low shrub which suckers (shoots growing from lateral roots) after fire. Plants do not appear to live longer than 25 years;[58][59] after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent.[58] A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of Banksia marginata plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire. There is anecodotal evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region.[60] Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self-select to be more flammable; Banksia marginata tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily, and fire would spread easily through it.[61]",
