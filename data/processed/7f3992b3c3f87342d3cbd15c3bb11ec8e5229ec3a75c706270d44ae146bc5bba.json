				"after": "Ponsford began his working life at the State Savings Bank. On his return from England in 1926, the bank advised him that they might not tolerate so much leave for cricket in the future.[91] Ponsford received a lucrative offer to play for Blackpool Cricket Club, which he was inclined to accept. This news was received with dismay by Australian fans, who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues.[91] To keep Ponsford in Melbourne, The Heraldâa local newspaperâemployed him on the basis that he would remain available for all representative cricket. The new role included writing articles for the paper.[91]",
