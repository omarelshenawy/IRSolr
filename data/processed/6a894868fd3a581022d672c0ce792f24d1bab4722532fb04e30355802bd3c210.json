				"after": "In addition, in some languages both nominativeâaccusative and ergativeâabsolutive systems may be used, split between different grammatical contexts. This is called split ergativity. The split may sometimes be linked to animacy, as in many Australian Aboriginal languages, or to aspect, as in Mayan languages. A few Australian languages, such as Diyari, are split between accusative, ergative, and tripartite alignment, depending on animacy.",
