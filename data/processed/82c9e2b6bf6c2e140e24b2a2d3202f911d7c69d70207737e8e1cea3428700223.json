				"after": "The albatross diet is predominantly cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal,[14] although they will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton.[14] It should be noted that for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.[14]",
