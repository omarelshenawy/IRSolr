It includes an orchard, fruit and vegetable gardens, ornamental borders and a rose walk, as well as the national collection of tree quince (Cydonia oblonga), with 20Â different varieties.[50][176] Close to the walled garden is a GradeÂ II listed ice house, probably dating from the 18thÂ century, which is constructed in brick covered with a mound of earth. The entrance is surrounded by stone walls, from which a tunnel leads to a circular domed chamber.[177]",
