				"These types include condensing, non-condensing, reheat, extraction and induction.",
				"Condensing turbines are most commonly found in electrical power plants. These turbines exhaust steam from a boiler in a partially condensed state, typically of a quality near 90%, at a pressure well below atmospheric to a condenser."
