Its founder was Sayyid `AlÃ­ Muhammad Shirazi, who took the title BÃ¡bâmeaning \"Gate\"âfrom a Shi'i theological term. Unlike other Islamic messianic movements, the BÃ¡bÃ­ movement signalled a break with Islam and attempted to start a new religious system. While the BÃ¡bÃ­ movement was violently opposed and crushed by the clerical and government establishments in the country in the mid-1850s, the BÃ¡bÃ­ movement led to the founding of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith which sees the religion brought by the BÃ¡b as a predecessor to their own religion, and gives a renewed significance to the BÃ¡bÃ­ movement.",
