				"previous": "Some models of the B-24 Liberator had a puttâputt fitted at the front of the aircraft, inside the nose-wheel compartment.[8] Some models of the Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft carried a putt-putt under the cockpit floor.[9]",
				"after": "The first German jet engines built during the Second World War used a mechanical APU starting system designed by the German engineer Norbert Riedel. It consisted of a 10Â hp (7.5Â kW) two-stroke flat engine, hidden in the intake, essentially functioning as a pioneering example of an auxiliary power unit for starting a jet engine. A hole in the extreme nose of the centrebody contained a manual pull-handle which started the piston engine, which in turn rotated the compressor. Two small petrol tanks were fitted in the annular intake. The engine was considered an extreme short stroke (bore / stroke: 70 mm / 35 mm = 2:1) design so it could fit in the hub of the turbine compressor. For reduction it had an integrated planetary gear. It was produced in Victoria in Nuremberg and served as a starter for the jet engines Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003.[10]",
