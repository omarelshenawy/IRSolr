				"previous": "Like the turkey vulture, this vulture is often seen standing in a spread-winged stance.[28] The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.[41]",
				"after": "In natural settings, the black vulture eats mainly carrion.[42] In areas populated by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.[43] The black vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vulturesâthe turkey vulture, the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vultureâ forage by smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. They fly low to the ground to pick up the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.[44] Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy.[41] King vultures and black vultures, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow them to carcasses.[43] It is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.[42]",
