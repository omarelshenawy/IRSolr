				"previous": "Today, most Ivatans are Catholics, like the rest of the country, although some have not converted practice ancestral worship to their anitos.[1] However, there are growing Christian denominations specially in the capital town of Batanes.[2]",
				"after": "The Ivatan's culture have been largely influenced by the climate of Batanes. Exposed to high risks of disruption to their agriculture, Ivatans have adopted strategies in order to live. Traditionally, because of the frequent typhoons and drought, they plant root crops able to cope with the environment. These crops include yam, sweet potato, taro, garlic, ginger and onion, as they ensure higher chances of survival during awry climate conditions.[6] The Ivatan study the behavior of animals, sky color, wind and clouds to predict the weather. The Ivatans usually gather their animals and stay in their houses when they see that the cows take shelter from the payaman (communal pasture) and birds taking refuge in houses or in the ground. A pink sky with an orange hue also heralds a storm.[7] The sea is vital to the Ivatan's way of life.[3] Although abundant only in the month of March to May, they depend on the flying fish (dibang) and dolphinfish (arayu) present on the shores of Batanes.[2] They have a native delicacy called uvod (the pith of the banana stalk) which is served, along with the wine palek, on festive occasions such as weddings.[1]",
