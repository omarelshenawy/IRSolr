In May 2006 the then Communities Minister Malcolm Chisholm launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables.[105] Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly,[106] have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas;[107] as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps.[108]",
