Portland is situated approximately halfway along the UNESCO Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site; the site includes 153 kilometres (95Â mi) of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms.[29] The South West Coast Path runs around the coast; it is the United Kingdom's longest national trail at 1,014 kilometres (630Â mi). Portland is unusual as it is connected to the mainland at Abbotsbury by Chesil Beach, a tombolo which runs 29 kilometres (18Â mi) north-west to West Bay.[30] Portland is sometimes defined incorrectly as a tomboloâin fact Portland is a tied island, and Chesil Beach is the tombolo (a spit joined to land at both ends).[31]",
