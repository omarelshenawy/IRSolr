				"previous": "La Prensa is an Argentine daily newspaper.",
				"after": "Based in Buenos Aires, it was founded on 18 October 1869 by JosÃ© C. Paz. La Prensa ranked among the most widely circulated dailies in Argentina in subsequent decades, earning a reputation for conservatism and support for British interests in Argentina. Following the election of populist leader Juan PerÃ³n, La Prensa declined due to both competition from new dailies (notably ClarÃ­n), as well a to government pressure. This latter development culminated in the paper's April 1951 seizure by the state, and its sale to the CGT labor union.",
