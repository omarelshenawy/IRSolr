				"after": "Crocodilians have had prominent roles in the myths and legends of various cultures around the world and may even have inspired stories of dragons.[128] In Ancient Egyptian religion, Ammit, the demoniac devourer of unworthy souls, and Sobek, the god of power, protection, and fertility, are both represented as having crocodile heads. This reflects the Egyptians' view of the crocodile both as a terrifying predator and an important part of the Nile ecosystem. The crocodile was one of several animals that the Egyptians mummified.[129] Crocodiles were also associated with various water deities by tribes of West Africa.[130] The Leviathan described in the Book of Job may have been based on a crocodile.[131] In Mesoamerica, the Aztecs had a crocodilian god of fertility named Cipactli who protected crops. In Aztec mythology, the sea monster Tlaltecuhtli is sometimes described as merging with a \"great caiman\". The Mayans also associated crocodilians with fertility and death.[132]",
