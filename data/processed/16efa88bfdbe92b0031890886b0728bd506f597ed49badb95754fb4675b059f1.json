				"previous": "Some composers have used fractional beats: for example, the time signature 2Â½ 4 appears in Carlos ChÃ¡vez's Piano Sonata No. 3 (1928) IV, m. 1.",
				"after": "Music educator Carl Orff proposed replacing the lower number of the time signature with an actual note image, as shown at right. This system eliminates the need for compound time signatures (described above), which are confusing to beginners. While this notation has not been adopted by music publishers generally (except in Orff's own compositions), it is used extensively in music education textbooks. Similarly, American composers George Crumb and Joseph Schwantner, among others, have used this system in many of their works.",
