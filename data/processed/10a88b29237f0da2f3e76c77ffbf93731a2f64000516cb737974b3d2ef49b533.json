There is a monument at his birthplace in Niles; 20Â Ohio schools bear his name.[228] Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death.[229] Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley's death that he would be ranked among the great presidents.[230] Statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states; his name has been bestowed on streets, civic organizations, and libraries. Mount McKinley in central Alaska is named for the former president; its summit, at 20,320 feet (6,190Â m), is the highest point in North America. Until its name was changed to Denali National Park, the park in which it is located was known as Mount McKinley National Park.[228]",
