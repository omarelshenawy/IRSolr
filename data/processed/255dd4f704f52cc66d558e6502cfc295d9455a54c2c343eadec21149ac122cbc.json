				"after": "Five smaller buildings stood around the 16 acres (65,000Â m2) block. One was the 22-floor hotel, which opened in 1981 as the Vista Hotel, and in 1995 became the Marriott World Trade Center (3Â WTC) at the southwest corner of the site. Three low-rise buildings (4Â WTC, 5Â WTC, and 6Â WTC) in the same hollow tube design as the towers also stood around the plaza. 6Â World Trade Center, at the northwest corner, housed the United States Customs Service and the U.S. Commodities Exchange. 5Â World Trade Center was located at the northeast corner above the PATH station and 4Â World Trade Center was at the southeast corner. In 1987, a 47-floor office building called 7Â World Trade Center was built north of the block. Beneath the World Trade Center complex was an underground shopping mall, which in turn had connections to various mass transit facilities including the New York City Subway system and the Port Authority's own PATH trains connecting Manhattan to New Jersey.[124]",
