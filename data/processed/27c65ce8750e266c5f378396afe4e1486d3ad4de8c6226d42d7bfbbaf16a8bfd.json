				"after": "The buildings of Nuffield College, one of the colleges of the University of Oxford, are to the west of the city centre of Oxford, England, and stand on the site of the basin of the Oxford Canal. Nuffield College was founded in 1937 after a donation to the University by the car manufacturer Lord Nuffield; he gave land for the college, as well as Â£900,000 (approximately Â£246Â million in present day terms) to build and endow it. The architect Austen Harrison, who had worked in Greece and Palestine, was appointed by the University to design the buildings. His initial design, heavily influenced by Mediterranean architecture, was rejected by Nuffield, who called it \"un-English\"[1] and refused to allow his name to be associated with it. Harrison reworked the plans, aiming for \"something on the lines of Cotswold domestic architecture\",[1] as Nuffield wanted.",
