				"Gustafson's law is another law in computing, closely related to Amdahl's law.[13] It states that the speedup with processors is",
				"is the maximum speed-up with parallelization of the program, with P being the number of processors used. If the sequential portion of a program accounts for 10% of the runtime (), we can get no more than a 10Ã speed-up, regardless of how many processors are added. This puts an upper limit on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units. \"When a task cannot be partitioned because of sequential constraints, the application of more effort has no effect on the schedule. The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.\"[12]"

				"after": "Both Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law assume that the running time of the sequential portion of the program is independent of the number of processors. Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount of work to be done in parallel is also independent of the number of processors, whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount of work to be done in parallel varies linearly with the number of processors.",
