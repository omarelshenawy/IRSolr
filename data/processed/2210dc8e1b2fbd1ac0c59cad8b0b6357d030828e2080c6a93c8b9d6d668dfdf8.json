The German Compsognathus fossil itself most likely came from the Painten Formation of the Kapfelberg locality, specifically dated to the uppermost Kimmeridgian stage (150.8 million years ago);[8] however, alternative possibilities include quarries near Jachenhausen[18] or Goldberg, both from the Tithonian, to which stage Compsognathus has traditionally been dated.[8] Johann A. Wagner discussed the specimen briefly in 1859, when he coined the name Compsognathus longipes,[19] and described it in detail in 1861.[20] In early 1868, Thomas Huxley compared the two species and, following earlier suggestions by Karl Gegenbaur[21] and Edward Drinker Cope,[22] concluded that, apart from its arms and feathers, the Archaeopteryx skeleton was closely similar to Compsognathus, and that the proto-bird was related to the dinosaurs.[23][24] In 1896, Othniel Marsh recognized the fossil as a true member of the Dinosauria.[25] John Ostrom thoroughly redescribed the species in 1978, making it one of the best-known small theropods at that time.[12] The German specimen is on display at the Bayerische Staatsammlung fÃ¼r PalÃ¤ontologie und historische Geologie (Bavarian State Institute for Paleontology and Historical Geology) in Munich, Germany, which bought the fossil from Oberndorfer in 1865.[17]",
