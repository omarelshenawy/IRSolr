				"after": "Madonna performed \"Causing a Commotion\" on the Who's That Girl World Tour of 1987 and the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990. In the Who's That Girl World Tour, \"Causing a Commotion\" was the sixth song of the setlist. Collaborating with Marlene Stewart on the clothes for the tour, Madonna expanded on the idea of bringing her video characters to life and to display a gangster theme for the song. She wore a golden lamÃ© jacket and performed the song while accompanied by two dancers, each holding a gun.[26] Performances of the song on this tour can be found on the Who's That Girl â Live in Japan video, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987,[27] and on the Ciao, Italia! â Live from Italy video, filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.[28] The latter performance was transmitted via satellite to the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards.[29]",
