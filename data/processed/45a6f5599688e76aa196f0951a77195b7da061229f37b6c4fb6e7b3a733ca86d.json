				"previous": "Vitro Uranium Mill was a 128-acre (52Â ha) site located in South Salt Lake, surrounded by the Jordan River, Mill Creek, a small wetland and traversed by the South Vitro Ditch. The site, operational from 1953 to 1964, contained a uranium mill and storage for uranium. In 1989, surface contamination cleanup was completed with tailings, radioactively contaminated soil material, and debris removed from the site.[99] However, 700,000,000 US gallons (2,600,000Â m3) of contaminated shallow ground water still remain, and studies are underway to determine what action should be taken.[100]",
				"after": "The Jordan River Parkway was originally proposed in 1971 as a flood control measure with two reservoirs, restoration of wetlands, shoreline roads for cars, walking trails, and parks.[101][102] By 1986, $18 million had been used to purchase lands around the Jordan River and to construct the Murray Golf Course, several smaller parks and about 4 miles (6.4Â km) of canoe runs and trails.[103] As of 2010, the majority of the 40-mile (64Â km) continuous mixed-use trail has been finished from Utah Lake to the Davis County border.[104] A water trail for canoeing and kayaking is also being constructed, but dams, bridges, weirs and other obstacles hamper the use of the river.[105]",
