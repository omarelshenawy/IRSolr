				"previous": "The FB-111A had new electronics, known as the SAC Mark IIB avionics suite. For the FB-111A the system used an attack radar improved from the F-111A's system, along with components that would be used on the F-111D, including the inertial navigation system, digital computers, and multi-function displays.[118] Armament for the strategic bombing role was the Boeing AGM-69 SRAM (short-range attack missile); two could be carried in the internal weapons bay and four more on the inner underwing pylons. Nuclear gravity bombs were also typical FB armament. Fuel tanks were often carried on the third non-swivelling pylon of each wing. The FB-111A had a total weapon load of 35,500Â lb (16,100Â kg).[117]",
				"after": "Multiple advanced FB-111 strategic bomber designs were proposed by General Dynamics in the 1970s. The first design, referred to as \"FB-111G\" within the company,[119] was a larger aircraft with more powerful engines with more payload and range. The next was a lengthened \"FB-111H\" that featured more powerful General Electric F101 turbofan engines, a 12Â ft 8.5 in longer fuselage and redesigned, fixed intakes. The rear landing gear were moved outward so armament could be carried on the fuselage there. The FB-111H was offered as an alternative to the B-1A in 1975.[119][120] The similar FB-111B/C was offered in 1979 without success.[121]",
