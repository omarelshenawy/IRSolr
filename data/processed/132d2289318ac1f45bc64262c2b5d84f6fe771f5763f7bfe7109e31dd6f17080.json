				"after": "For an instrument whose payment stream is described by f(t), the value V(t) satisfies the inhomogeneous first-order ODE (\"inhomogeneous\" is because one has f rather than 0, and \"first-order\" is because one has first derivatives but no higher derivatives) â this encodes the fact that when any cash flow occurs, the value of the instrument changes by the value of the cash flow (if you receive a Â£10 coupon, the remaining value decreases by exactly Â£10).",
