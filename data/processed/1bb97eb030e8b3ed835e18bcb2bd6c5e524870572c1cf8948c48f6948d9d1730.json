				"after": "The main reason authors make their articles openly accessible is to maximize their research impact.[21] A study in 2001 first reported an open access citation impact advantage,[22] and a growing number of studies[23] have confirmed, with varying degrees of methodological rigor, that an open access article is more likely to be used and cited than one behind subscription barriers.[23] For example, a 2006 study in PLoS Biology found that articles published as immediate open access in PNAS were three times more likely to be cited than non-open access papers, and were also cited more than PNAS articles that were only self-archived.[24] This result has been challenged as an artifact of authors self-selectively paying to publish their higher quality articles in hybrid open access journals,[25] whereas a 2010 study found that the open access citation advantage was equally big whether self-archiving was self-selected or mandated.[26]",
