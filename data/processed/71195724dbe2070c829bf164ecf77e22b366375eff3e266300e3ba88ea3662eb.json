				"previous": "After Japan's defeat, the islands were administered by the United States as part of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; which gave responsibility for defense and foreign affairs to the United States. Four referenda offering integration with Guam or changes to the islands' status were held in 1958, 1961, 1963 and 1969. On each occasion a majority voted in favor of integration with Guam. But this did not happen: Guam rejected integration in a 1969 referendum. The people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the 1970s not to seek independence, but instead to forge closer links with the United States. Negotiations for territorial status began in 1972 and a covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the United States[8] was approved in a 1975 referendum. A new government and constitution came into effect in 1978 after being approved in a 1977 referendum. Like other U.S. territories, the islands do not have representation in the U.S. Senate, but since 2009 are represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by a delegate who may vote in committee but not on the House floor.[9]",
