				"previous": "The house has a two-and-half story central section, which is 48Â feet (14.6Â m) by 43Â feet (13.1Â m), and two one-story wings on the north and south sides that are each 22Â feet (6.7Â m) by 21Â feet (6.4Â m). The first and second floors have a total area of 5,052Â square feet (469Â mÂ²).[62] The north wing was the laboratory and the south wing (which had an attached woodshed) was the summer kitchen. The cellar, first, and second floors of the central section are each divided into four rooms, with a central hall on the first and second floors; the first floor also has an intersecting hall that leads to the laboratory. The attic has three rooms for servants and a larger room for storage.[5] A paint analysis done in 1994 revealed that the house had no wall paper initially and that the walls and woodwork were painted \"a brilliant white\".[63]",
				"after": "The house is a frame structure, covered with white wooden clapboards, anchored to a stone foundation. The Priestleys built their home out of wood, dried in trenches on the site,[2] because no stone or brick was available in the area. Joseph wrote a detailed description of the drying process, concluding: \"A house constructed with such boards I prefer to one of brick and stone\".[64] This may have prompted journalist William Cobbett to caustically label the house a \"shed\" in one of his political tirades against Joseph.[65] The central section of the house has a slate gable roof with a railing-enclosed deck. The house has \"three internal gable end chimneys, one for the main kitchen\", and one each at the north and south ends of the central section.[5]",
