				"previous": "Britain, which had concluded as early as 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat from France, Russia and, increasingly, Germany with a resumption of armored cruiser construction in 1898 with the CressyÂ class. At 21 knots, the Cressys were slower than the newer French cruisers. However, their 6-inch (152Â mm) belt of Krupp steel was expected to keep out armor-piercing shells from a 6-inch (152Â mm) quick-firing gun at likely battle ranges, while their two 9.2-inch (233.7Â mm) and 12 6-inch (152Â mm) guns offered comparable firepower. The 2,500-ton weight of their belt armor was an improvement over the 1809 tons of the otherwise similar DiademÂ class and very similar to that of the CanopusÂ class of battleships. The Cressys were the beginning of a rapid expansion in British cruiser construction. Between 1899 and 1905, seven classes of armored cruisers were either completed or laid down, a total of 35 ships.[20]",
				"after": "Japan, which now received British technical assistance in naval matters and purchased larger vessels from France and Britain, began an armored cruiser program of its own. With the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 and the return under pressure from Russia (in what became known as the \"Triple Intervention\") of the Liaotung peninsula to China, Japan began a 10-year naval build-up program, under the slogan \"Perseverance and determination\" (è¥èªåè, GashinshÅtan) in preparation for further confrontations. The core of this 109-ship build-up was the \"Six-Six Program\" of six battleships and six (eventually eight) armored cruisers comparable to the British Cressy class. The Yakumo followed the basic pattern for these cruisersâon a 9,646 long tons (9,801Â t) displacement, she carried four 7.99-inch (203Â mm) and twelve 6-inch (150Â mm) guns, was protected by a 3.5â6.7-inch (89â170Â mm) main belt, 2.4-inch (61Â mm) armored deck and 5.9-inch (150Â mm) turret armor and steamed at 20.5 knots (23.6Â mph; 38.0Â km/h). They were considered a compromise between cruiser and battleship and were intended to augment capital ship strength in battle squadrons. This practice would persist until World War I.[21][22]",
