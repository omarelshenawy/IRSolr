				"previous": "Figures released in 2013 by Londonâs Poverty Profile â a joint project between New Policy Institute and Trust for London â found Kensington and Chelsea to have the greatest imbalance between high and low earners. The top quarter earn at least Â£41 per hour, three and a half times the level of the lowest quarter at Â£12 per hour or less.[8]",
				"after": "Two of its more notable council leaders were Nicholas Freeman, from 1977 until 1989, and Sir Merrick Cockell who held the position from 2000 to 2013. The Council has 42 Conservative, 9 Labour and 3 Liberal Democrat councillors. The Labour or Liberal councillors have tended to date to have represented areas of the borough with pockets of economic deprivation; some marginal wards in the borough are concentrated towards the north where north Kensington meets Kilburn, Kensal Rise/Green and Ladbroke Grove. All the wards in Holland Park, Notting Hill, Kensington, South Kensington, and Chelsea are termed under the first past the post electoral system safe seats based on their results since the Council's creation in 1965.",
