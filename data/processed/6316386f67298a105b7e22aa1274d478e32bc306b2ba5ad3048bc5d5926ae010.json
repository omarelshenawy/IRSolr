				"previous": "Prevalence figures are based on household surveys known as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), developed by Macro International (now ICF International) and funded mainly by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), which are conducted with financial and technical assistance from UNICEF.[74] These have been carried out in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere roughly every five years, since 1984 and 1995 respectively.[75] The questionnaires ask about issues such as HIV/AIDs, family planning, literacy, domestic violence, nutrition and, in some countries, FGM.[76]",
				"after": "The first survey to include questions about FGM was the 1989â1990 DHS in northern Sudan, and the first publication to estimate FGM prevalence based on DHS data (in seven countries) was by Dara Carr of Macro International in 1997.[77] A UNICEF report based on over 70 of these surveys concluded in 2013 that FGM was concentrated in 27 African countries, Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan,[78] and that 133 million women and girls in those 29 countries had experienced it.[3]",
