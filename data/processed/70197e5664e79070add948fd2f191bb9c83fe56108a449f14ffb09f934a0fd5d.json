				"previous": "In the 1960s and 1970s, American livestock breed enthusiasts, including scientists, farmers, and historians, became increasingly aware of the disappearance of many traditional livestock breeds in the US. This awareness was partially due to difficulties encountered in obtaining heritage breeds for living history sites.[2] This was particularly evident when historians were searching for historically authentic breeds to display at the Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts and were unable to find sheep of the Vermont strain of Merino, as they had gone extinct. As a result, these historians and others decided to attempt preservation of other rare breeds facing extinction.[3] On March 16, 1977, the American Minor Breeds Conservancy was incorporated in Vermont.[4] It was the first United States organization focused on preserving rare breeds of livestock and promoting genetic diversity among livestock breeds,[5][6] and remains the preeminent organization in this field in the United States.[7] A similar organization in Great Britain, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, had been formed in 1973.[8] The organization conducted its first comprehensive survey of American livestock breeds in 1985. Since then, the survey has been repeated every five years, with the status of endangered breeds being monitored in between.[9] The initial survey was called \"the most comprehensive assessment of livestock genetic resources ever conducted in the United States\".[10] In 1986, a fellow organization, Rare Breeds Canada, was formed, and the two bodies have worked together closely to preserve and promote breeds that have populations in the US and Canada.[11] In 1993, the organization changed its name to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy (ALBC).[12] In 2013, the organization again shortened its name to \"The Livestock Conservancy\".[13]",
				"after": "The Livestock Conservancy is headquartered in Pittsboro, North Carolina. Its mission is to protect \"genetic diversity in livestock and poultry species through the conservation and promotion of endangered breeds.\"[14] It organizes and participates in programs to rescue threatened populations, educate the public about rare breeds and genetic diversity, support breeders and breed associations, perform research on endangered breeds and assist gene banks in preserving genetic material.[14] The Conservancy includes among its partners and members the Oklahoma City Zoo, which maintains a \"Children's Zoo\" that holds members of eight rare livestock breeds,[15] and Colonial Williamsburg, which maintains populations of ten rare breeds.[16]",
