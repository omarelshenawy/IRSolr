				"where is the threshold frequency for the metal. The maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron is then",
				"where is the Planck constant and is the frequency of the incident photon. The term is the work function (sometimes denoted , or [11]), which gives the minimum energy required to remove a delocalised electron from the surface of the metal. The work function satisfies"

				"Kinetic energy is positive, so we must have for the photoelectric effect to occur.[12]",
				"The relation between current and applied voltage illustrates the nature of the photoelectric effect. For discussion, a light source illuminates a plate P, and another plate electrode Q collects any emitted electrons. We vary the potential between P and Q and measure the current flowing in the external circuit between the two plates."
