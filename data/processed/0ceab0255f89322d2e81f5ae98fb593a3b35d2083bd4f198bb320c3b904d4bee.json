				"previous": "Diptychs were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid-15th to the early 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame);[136] the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book, allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images.[137] Originating from conventions in Books of Hours, diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces.[138] Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side.[139] They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval \"treasury art\" -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The tracery seen in works such as van der Weyden's Virgin and Child reflects ivory carving of the period.[140] The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the House of Valois-Burgundy,[137] and refined by Hugo van der Goes, Hans Memling and later Jan van Scorel.[139]",
				"after": "Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child,[141] reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion.[142] The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits â often of husbands and their wives[139] â alongside saints or the Virgin and Child.[137] The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer.[137] The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the \"place of honour\" alongside the divine.[143]",
