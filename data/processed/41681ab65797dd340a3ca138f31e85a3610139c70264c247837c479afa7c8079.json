				"previous": "Spanish Town has the oldest cathedral of the British colonies in the Caribbean.[21] The Spanish were forcibly evicted by the English at Ocho Rios in St. Ann. In 1655 the English, led by Sir William Penn and General Robert Venables, took over the last Spanish fort in Jamaica.[22] The name of Montego Bay, the capital of the parish of St. James, was derived from the Spanish name manteca bahÃ­a (or Bay of Lard), alluding to the lard-making industry based on processing the numerous boars in the area.[23]",
				"after": "In 1660, the population of Jamaica was about 4,500 white and 1,500 black,[25] but by as early as the 1670s, black people formed a majority of the population.[26]",
