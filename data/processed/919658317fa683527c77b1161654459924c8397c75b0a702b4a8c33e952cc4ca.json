				"previous": "At 53Â°29â²38â³N 2Â°6â²11â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿53.49389Â°N 2.10306Â°Wï»¿ / 53.49389; -2.10306 (53.4941Â°, â2.1032Â°), and 160 miles (257Â km) north-northwest of London, Ashton-under-Lyne stands on the north bank of the River Tame, about 35 feet (11Â m) above the river.[3] Described in Samuel Lewis's A Topographical Dictionary of England (1848) as situated \"on a gentle declivity\",[3] Ashton-under-Lyne lies on undulating ground by the Pennines, reaching a maximum elevation of about 1,000 feet (305Â m) above sea level. It is 6.2 miles (10.0Â km) east of Manchester city centre, and is bound on all sides by other towns: Audenshaw, Droylsden, Dukinfield, Mossley, Oldham and Stalybridge, with little or no green space between them. Ashton experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles.",
				"after": "Generally the bedrock of the west of the town consists of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies to the west of the town and was originally much larger.[58] The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.",
