				"previous": "The production process included substantial international content, an unprecedented level of global subcontracting for a Boeing jetliner,[38] later exceeded by the 787.[39] International contributors included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (fuselage panels),[40] Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. (center wing section),[40] Hawker de Havilland (elevators), and Aerospace Technologies of Australia (rudder).[41] An agreement between Boeing and the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation, representing Japanese aerospace contractors, made the latter risk-sharing partners for 20Â percent of the entire development program.[38] The initial 777-200 model was launched with propulsion options from three manufacturers, General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce,[42] giving the airlines their choice of engines from competing firms.[43] Each manufacturer agreed to develop an engine in the 77,000Â lbf (340Â kN) and higher thrust class (a measure of jet engine output) for the world's largest twinjet.[42]",
				"after": "To accommodate production of its new airliner, Boeing doubled the size of the Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5Â billion[26] to provide space for two new assembly lines.[28] New production methodologies were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees, giving workers access to upper body sections.[34] Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993.[44] By the start of production, the program had amassed 118 firm orders, with options for 95 more from 10 airlines.[45] Total investment in the program was estimated at over US$4Â billion from Boeing, with an additional US$2Â billion from suppliers.[46]",
