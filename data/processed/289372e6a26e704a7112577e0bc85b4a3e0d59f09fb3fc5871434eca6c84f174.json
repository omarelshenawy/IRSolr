				"after": "Cairo accounts for 11 per cent of Egypt's population and 22 per cent of her economy (PPP). Cairo is also in every respect the centre of Egypt, as it has been almost since its founding in 969 AD. The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of publishing houses and media outlets and nearly all film studios are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fueled rapid construction in the cityâone building in five is less than 15 years old.",
