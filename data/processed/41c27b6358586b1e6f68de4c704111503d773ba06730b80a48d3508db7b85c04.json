This advanced design which was a progression from earlier Monomail (Models 200, 221, 221A) and B-9 bomber designs, combined speed and safety. The Boeing 247 was faster than the U.S. premier fighter aircraft of its day, the Boeing P-12, which was an open-cockpit biplane.[6] Yet its flight envelope included a rather docile 62Â mph (100Â km/h) landing speed which precluded the need for flaps, and pilots learned that at speeds as low as 10Â mph (15Â km/h), the 247 could be taxiied \"tail high\" for ease of ground handling.[7]",
