The first purpose-built passenger Constellation was the more powerful L-649 and L-749 (which had more fuel in the outer wings),[8][pageÂ needed] L-849 (an unbuilt model to use the R-3350 TurboCompound engines adopted for the L-1049 ), L-949 (an unbuilt, high-density seating-cum-freighter type, what would come to be called a \"combi\"),[8] followed by the L-1049 Super Constellation (with longer fuselage), L-1149 (proposal to use Allison turbine engines)[8] and L-1249 (similar to L-1149, built as R7V-2/YC-121F),[8] L-1449 (unbuilt proposal for L1049G, stretched 55Â in (140Â cm), with new wing and turbines)[8] and L-1549 (unbuilt project to stretch L-1449 95Â in (240Â cm)),[8] and L-1649 Starliner (all new wing and L1049G fuselage).[8] Military versions included the C-69 and C-121 for the Army Air Forces/Air Force and the R7O R7V-1 (L-1049B) EC-121 WV-1 (L-749A) WV-2 (L-1049B) (widely known as the Willie Victor) and many variant EC-121 designations for the Navy [14][15]",
