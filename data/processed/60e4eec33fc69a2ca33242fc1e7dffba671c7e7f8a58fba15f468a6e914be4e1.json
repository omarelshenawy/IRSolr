Some 17,000â22,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well.[197] Casualty estimates for immediate deaths vary widely, ranging from 22,000 to 75,000.[198][199][200][201] In the days and months following the explosion, more people died from bomb effects. Because of the presence of undocumented foreign workers, and a number of military personnel in transit, there are great discrepancies in the estimates of total deaths by the end of 1945; a range of 39,000 to 80,000 can be found in various studies.[113][201]",
