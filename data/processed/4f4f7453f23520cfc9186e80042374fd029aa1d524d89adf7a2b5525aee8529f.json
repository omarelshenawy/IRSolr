				"after": "After her obverse design was approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint engraving department six times in order to finalize the designs.[6] Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval.[6] The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese bronze (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core.[3] This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the copper-nickel Susan B. Anthony dollar.[21] The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins.[22] Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies.[22] Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them.[22] Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.[22]",
