				"First, an important note for everyone to remember: A few Wikipedians have gotten together to make some suggestions about how we might organize data in articles about mountains. These are only suggestions, things to give you focus and to get you going, and you shouldn't feel obligated in the least to follow them. But if you do not know what to write or where to begin, following the below guidelines may be helpful. Mainly, we just want you to write articles!"
