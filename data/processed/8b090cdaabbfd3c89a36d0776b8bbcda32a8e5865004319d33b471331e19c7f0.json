These reforms included the replacement of Fred Reid and the limiting of Virgin Group's influence on the airline.[18] Virgin America fought to keep Fred Reid as CEO,[19] However, as part of the DOTâs final approval in May, Reid was allowed to stay on nine months after the airline certification: six months as CEO and three months as a consultant.[20]",
