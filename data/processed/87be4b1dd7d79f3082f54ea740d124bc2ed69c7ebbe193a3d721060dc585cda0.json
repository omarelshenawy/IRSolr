				"previous": "In the mid-1960s the design of the Speedbird was slightly altered, with a slimmer 'body' and larger 'wing', and on the tailfin coloured gold on a navy blue background. Elsewhere the colours used for it were mostly a combination of cyan and white.",
				"after": "In 1974, BOAC was merged with British European Airways and others to form British Airways. As well as the call sign, the speedbird logo was retained unaltered, but returned to the nose section of the aircraft. A prominent Union Flag design now occupied the tailfin.",
