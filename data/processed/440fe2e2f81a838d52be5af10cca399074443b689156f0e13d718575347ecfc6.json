The Soviet Union, and the Polish Communist Government that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future Secretary General of the Polish United Workers' Party, WÅadysÅaw GomuÅka, is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, Roman Zambrowski, said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"[19]",
