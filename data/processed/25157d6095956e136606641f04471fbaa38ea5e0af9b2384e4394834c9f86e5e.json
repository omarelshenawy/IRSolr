				"after": "Tampa International Airport's Landside/Airside terminal was the first of its type in the world.[21] There is a central Landside Terminal where baggage and ticketing functions take place. The Landside Terminal is surrounded by four Airside satellites where airliner embarkment and disembarkment occur. Each Airside is connected to the Landside Terminal via an elevated automated people mover (APM) system which employs 16 Bombardier Innovia APM 100 Shuttle Cars. TPA was the first airport in the world to deploy a fully automated, driver-fewer people mover system and is host to Bombardier Transportation's longest-running APM system. The terminal was originally designed to limit the walking distance between the automobile and airliner to 700 feet (210Â m); today, it has increased to about 1,000 feet (300Â m), due mostly in part to the larger, more modern airside buildings which have replaced the original, smaller structures.",
