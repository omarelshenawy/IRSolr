The poster, which was displayed all over Poland, shows Cooper armed with a folded ballot saying \"Wybory\" (i.e. elections) in his right hand while the Solidarity logo is pinned to his vest above the sheriff's badge. The message at the bottom of the poster reads: \"W samo poÅudnie: 4 czerwca 1989,\" which translates to \"High Noon: 4 June 1989.\"",
