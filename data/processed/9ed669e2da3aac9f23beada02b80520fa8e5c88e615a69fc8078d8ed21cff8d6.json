Michael Rappenglueck of the University of Munich argues that some of the non-figurative dot clusters and dots within some of the figurative images correlate with the constellations of Taurus, the Pleiades and the grouping known as the \"Summer Triangle\".[156] Based on her own study of the astronomical significance of Bronze Age petroglyphs in the VallÃ©e des Merveilles[157] and her extensive survey of other prehistoric cave painting sites in the regionâmost of which appear to have been selected because the interiors are illuminated by the setting sun on the day of the winter solsticeâFrench researcher Chantal JÃ¨gues-Wolkiewiez has further proposed that the gallery of figurative images in the Great Hall represents an extensive star map and that key points on major figures in the group correspond to stars in the main constellations as they appeared in the Paleolithic.[158][159]",
