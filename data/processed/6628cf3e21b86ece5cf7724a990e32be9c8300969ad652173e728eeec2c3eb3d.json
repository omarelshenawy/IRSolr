Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful.[112] Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus.[113] RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.[114]",
