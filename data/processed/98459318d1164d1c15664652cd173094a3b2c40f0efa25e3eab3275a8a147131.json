				"previous": "Among 787 flight systems, a key change from traditional airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air and hydraulic power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps, while completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems (e.g., engine starters or brakes).[182] Boeing says this system extracts 35% less power from the engines, allowing increased thrust and improved fuel economy.[183] The total available on-board electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners;[184] the most notable electrically powered systems include: engine start, pressurization, horizontal stabilizer trim, and wheel brakes.[185] Wing ice protection is another new system; it uses electro-thermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air.[186][187] An active gust alleviation system, similar to the system used on the B-2 bomber, improves ride quality during turbulence.[188][189]",
				"after": "The 787 has a \"fly-by-wire\" control system similar in architecture to that of the Boeing 777.[190] The flight deck features LCD multi-function displays, which use an industry standard Graphical user interface widget toolkit (Cockpit Display System Interfaces to User Systems / ARINC 661).[191] The 787 flight deck includes two head-up displays (HUDs) as a standard feature.[192] The 787 shares a common type rating with the larger 777, allowing qualified pilots to operate both models.[193] Like other Boeing airliners, the 787 uses a yoke instead of a side-stick. Under consideration is future integration of forward looking infrared into the HUD for thermal sensing, allowing pilots to \"see\" through clouds.[6] Lockheed Martin's Orion spacecraft will use a glass cockpit derived from Honeywell International's 787 flight deck systems.[194]",
