				"after": "Muckaty Station, also known as Warlmanpa, is a 2,380-square-kilometre (920Â sqÂ mi) Aboriginal freehold landholding in Australia's Northern Territory, 110 kilometres (68Â mi) north of Tennant Creek, and approximately 800 kilometres (500Â mi) south of Darwin. Originally under traditional Indigenous Australian ownership, the area became a pastoral lease in the late 19thÂ century and for many years operated as a cattle station. It is traversed by the Stuart Highway, built in the 1940s along the route of the service track for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. It is also crossed by a natural gas pipeline built in the mid-1980s, and the AdelaideâDarwin railway, completed in early 2004. Muckaty Station was returned to its Indigenous custodians in 1999.",
