				"previous": "By letters patent of Anne's great-grandfather, George V, the titles of a British prince or princess, and the style Royal Highness, were only to be conferred on children and male-line grandchildren of the sovereign, as well as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. However, on 22 October 1948, her grandfather issued new letters patent granting these honours to any children of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip; otherwise, Anne would have been titled by courtesy as Lady Anne Mountbatten at birth. In this way, the children of the heiress presumptive had a royal and princely status.",
				"after": "As with royal children before her, a governess, Catherine Peebles, was appointed to look after the Princess and was responsible for her early education at Buckingham Palace;[7] Peebles had also served as governess for Anne's older brother, Charles. After the death of George VI and the ascension to the throne of Anne's mother, Anne became titled Her Royal Highness The Princess Anne. However, given her young age at the time, she did not attend her mother's coronation.",
