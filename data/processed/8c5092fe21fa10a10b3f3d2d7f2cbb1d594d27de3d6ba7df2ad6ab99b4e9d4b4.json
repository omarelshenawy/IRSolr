				"after": "The Fifth Element is a 1997 English-language French science fiction film directed and based on a story by Luc Besson. It stars Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, and Milla Jovovich (pictured). In the 23rd century, Korben Dallas (Willis), a taxicab driver and former special forces major, joins forces with a young woman (Jovovich) who falls into his cab, and they set off to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against an impending attack. Besson started writing the story that became The Fifth Element when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas. Filming for the French production took place primarily in London, as suitable locations in France could not be found. It received mainly positive reviews, although it tended to polarise critics. It has been called both the best and worst summer blockbuster of all time. The Fifth Element was a financial success, earning more than $263 million at the box office on a $90 million budget. At the time of its release it was the most expensive European film ever made, and it remained the highest-grossing French film at the box-office until the release of The Intouchables in 2011.
