				"after": "The titles in the series feature a variety of music, but frequently reuse themes. Most of the games open with a piece called \"Prelude\", which has evolved from a simple, 2-voice arpeggio in the early games to a complex, melodic arrangement in recent installments.[23][62][83] Victories in combat are often accompanied by a victory fanfare, a theme that has become one of the most recognized pieces of music in the series. The basic theme that accompanies Chocobo appearances has been rearranged in a different musical style for each installment. A piece called \"Prologue\" (and sometimes \"Final Fantasy\"), originally featured in the first game, is often played during the ending credits.[62] Although leitmotifs are common in the more character-driven installments, theme music is typically reserved for main characters and recurring plot elements.[42]",
