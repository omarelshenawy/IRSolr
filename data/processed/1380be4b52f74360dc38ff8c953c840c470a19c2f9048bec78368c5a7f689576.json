				"after": "By 1904, Brazilâthe largest country in South America in both size and populationâbegan to seriously consider upgrading its navy, which had fallen to third in total tonnage.[7] Soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought an influx of tax revenue,[8][9] used to begin a large naval building plan. The centerpiece of the new navy would be two Minas Geraes-class dreadnoughts built by the United Kingdom.[7] The order for these powerful ships, designed to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the time,[10] shocked Argentina and Chile,[11] causing them to cancel the 1902 armament-limiting pact with immediate effect. Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State, warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race.[12]",
