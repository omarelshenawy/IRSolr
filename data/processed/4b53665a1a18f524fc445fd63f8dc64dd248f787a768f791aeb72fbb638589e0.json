				"On 2 June 2011, the US Navy loaned two C-2A(R) Greyhounds from VRC-40 (USN BuNos 162143 & 162165) to the French Navy. The two aircraft were stationed at Toulon-HyÃ¨res Airport, HyÃ¨res to assist in improving the flow of logistics and supplies to the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle operating in the Mediterranean Sea off Libya in support of the NATO intervention in Libya. After 16 days, both aircraft returned to the US via Shannon Airport, Ireland on 18 June 2011.[9]"
