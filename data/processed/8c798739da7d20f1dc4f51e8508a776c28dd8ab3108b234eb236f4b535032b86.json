				"previous": "Charles A. Coolidge, a protÃ©gÃ© of Henry Hobson Richardson, was the church's architect; he also developed the massing of Richardson's Trinity Church in Boston in 1876.[7] Like Trinity Church, Memorial Church originally had a large central tower with turrets and a twelve-sided spire, but this was lost as a result of the 1906 earthquake.[20] The church's blueprints were prepared by Clinton E. Day of San Francisco, and Charles E. Hodges was the supervising architect for the project. Jane Stanford hired builder John McGilvray, who was responsible for constructing the St. Francis Hotel, the City Hall complex in San Francisco, and much of Stanford University, for the actual construction of Stanford Memorial Church.[8]",
				"after": "Jane Stanford's taste and knowledge of both contemporary and classical art is evident in several aspects of the plan, appearance, and architecture of the church, which \"dazzle the eye yet also produce an atmosphere of quiet contemplation\".[63] On her direction, Coolidge imitated the \"glorious color\"[65] of the European cathedrals, especially those in Italy. Although the iconography in the church is Christian, Stanford was a \"late Victorian progressive\",[63] and chose the art less for its religious themes and more for its \"humanitarian ethics\".[63] She requested that the designs include women, \"to show the uplifting influence of religion for women\";[66] there are many women depicted in the 24 mosaics throughout the church.[66] Art historian Judy Oberhausen reports that Stanford used compendium of biblical illustrations like The Story of the Bible by Charles Foster, which contained 300 illustrations and summarized the events and stories she wished to depict in the church's windows and mosaics.[63]",
