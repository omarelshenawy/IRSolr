In many cultures a mother goddess is also portrayed as a fertility deity. Creation myths in many religions recall a story involving the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. A variety of religious groups, often associated with fundamentalist branches of Protestantism[209] or Islam,[210] assert that their interpretations of these creation myths in sacred texts are literal truth and should be considered alongside or replace conventional scientific accounts of the formation of Earth and the origin and development of life.[211] Such assertions are opposed by the scientific community[212][213] and by other religious groups.[214][215][216] A prominent example is the creationâevolution controversy.",
