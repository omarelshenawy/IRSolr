				"after": "In early January 2013, via his official Twitter account, Timberlake posted a tweet, \"I think I'M READY\", before posting a link to a YouTube video which shows him walking into a studio and explains his absence from releasing new songs.[4] In the minute-long video, a camera follows Timberlake as he walks through a recording studio, while the singer's voice over discusses why it's been so long between albums.[3] In the video, he reveals that he is not interested in releasing something he doesn't love. The video closes with Timberlake entering a recording booth, putting on headphones and saying, \"I'm ready.\"[3] Subsequently, on the singer's official site, a countdown leading up to Monday, January 14 at 12 a.m. ET appeared, and so there was speculation of a new single and album to break Timberlake's hiatus.[3] That timing coincided with a tweet that Power 105.1 radio personality Charlamagne posted, saying, \"Justin, Jay Z Timbaland. New record Monday\".[3]",
