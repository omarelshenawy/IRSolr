				"after": "Mary Watts died in 1938, and was buried alongside George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, which she had herself designed and built in Compton in 1901.[60] Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52Â of the intended 120Â spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs,[61] and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.[62]",
