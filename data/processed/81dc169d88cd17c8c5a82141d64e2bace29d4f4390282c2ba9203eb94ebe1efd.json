				"previous": "Unit pseudoscalars are blades that play important roles in GA. A unit pseudoscalar for a non-degenerate subspace W of V is a blade that is the product of the members of an orthonormal basis for W. It can be shown that if I and Iâ² are both unit pseudoscalars for W, then I = Â±Iâ² and I2 = Â±1.",
				"after": "By the properties of the geometric product, Iâ2 = b1b2b1b2 = âb1b2b2b1 = â1. The resemblance to the imaginary unit is not accidental: the subspace is R-algebra isomorphic to the complex numbers. In this way, a copy of the complex numbers is embedded in the geometric algebra for each 2-dimensional subspace of V on which the quadratic form is definite.",
