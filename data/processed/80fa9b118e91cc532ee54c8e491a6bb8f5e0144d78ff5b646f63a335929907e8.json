				"after": "In 2006, there were 850,000 Muslims.[168] As a result of different determination methods in 2012 this number had dropped to 825,000 (4% of the total Dutch population).[169] Muslim numbers began to rise after the 1960s as the result of immigration. Some migrants from former Dutch colonies, such as Surinam and Indonesia, were Muslim, but migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco, and their children, represent the largest part. During the 1990s, the Netherlands admitted Muslim refugees from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and Afghanistan.[170] Muslims form a diverse group. Social tensions between native Dutch and migrant Muslims began to rise in the early 21st century, with the rise and murder of populist politician Pim Fortuyn by militant animal rights activist Volkert van der Graaf and the murder of Theo van Gogh by Mohammed Bouyeri. There are about 1,500 Ahmadi Muslims in the Netherlands.[171]",
