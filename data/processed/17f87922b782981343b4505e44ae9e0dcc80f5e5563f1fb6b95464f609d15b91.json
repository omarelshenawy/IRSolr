The valley is also crossed by the A37 and they are joined by the A368. Most of the roads in the valley are small single track lanes with little traffic although a bottleneck often occurs within Chew Magna. The \"Chew Valley Explorer\" bus route 672/674 provides access to the villages in the valley.[49] Cyclists can gain access via part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3.",
