				"after": "The Tu-154 was developed to meet Aeroflot's requirement to replace the jet-powered Tu-104, the Antonov An-10 'Ukraine' and the Ilyushin Il-18 turboprops. The requirements called for either a payload capacity of 16â18 tonnes (35,000â40,000Â lb) with a range of 2,850â4,000 kilometres (1,770â2,490Â mi) while cruising at 900Â km/h (560Â mph), or a payload of 5.8 tonnes (13,000Â lb) with a range of 5,800â7,000 kilometres (3,600â4,300Â mi) while cruising at 850Â km/h (530Â mph). A take-off distance of 2,600 metres (8,500Â ft) at maximum take-off weight was also stipulated as a requirement. Conceptually similar to the British Hawker Siddeley Trident, which first flew in 1962, and the American Boeing 727, which first flew in 1963, the medium-range Tu-154 was marketed by Tupolev at the same time as Ilyushin was marketing the long-range Ilyushin Il-62. The Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Industry chose the Tu-154 as it incorporated the latest in Soviet aircraft design and best met Aeroflot's anticipated requirements for the 1970s and 1980s.[5]",
