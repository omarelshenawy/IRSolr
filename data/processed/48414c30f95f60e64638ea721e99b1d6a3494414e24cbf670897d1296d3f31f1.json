				"previous": "The A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace, Alenia and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the AE31X, and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.[68] The former would have had an overall length of 31.3Â m (102Â ft 8Â in), while the AE317 was longer by 3.2Â m (10Â ft 6Â in), at 34.5Â m (113Â ft 2Â in).[69] The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000s;[68][69] with the MTOW of 53.3Â t (118,000Â lb) for the smaller version and 58Â t (128,000Â lb) for the AE317, the thrust requirement were 77.9â84.6Â kN (17,500â19,000Â lbf) and 84.6â91.2Â kN (19,000â20,500Â lbf), respectively.[69] Range was settled at 5,200Â km (2,800Â nmi) and 5,800Â km (3,100Â nmi) for the high gross weights of both variants.[69] Both share a wingspan of 31.0Â m (101Â ft 8Â in)[69] and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family. Costing $2Â billion (â¬1.85 billion) to develop, aircraft production to take place in China.[68]",
				"after": "Simultaneously, Airbus was developing Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed its considerations of designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, after which Airbus officially announced an aircraft of its own, the A318,[70] at that year's Farnborough Airshow.[71] The aircraft is the smallest product of Airbus's product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by 0.79-metre (2Â ft 7Â in) ahead of the wing and 1.6 metres (5Â ft 3Â in) behind.[71] These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.[72] Range was 5,700 kilometres (3,100Â nmi), or 5,950 kilometres (3,210Â nmi) with upcoming Sharklets.[72]",
