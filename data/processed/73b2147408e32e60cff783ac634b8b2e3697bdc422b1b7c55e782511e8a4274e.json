				"previous": "All international arrivals at O'Hare (except for flights from destinations with Customs preclearance) arrive at Terminal 5, as the other terminals do not have Customs facilities. Since a number of carriers that have international flights from O'Hare, like United and American, are based in Terminal 1 or Terminal 3, those airlines will have their aircraft offloaded at Terminal 5 and then, after passengers are offloaded, the plane is towed empty back to a gate at the airline's assigned terminal for boarding. This is done, in part to make connections for passengers transferring from domestic flights to international flights easier, since while Terminals 1, 2, and 3 are connected by an airside corridor, Terminal 5 is not, requiring passengers to exit security, ride the Airport Transit System, then reclear security in either direction.",
