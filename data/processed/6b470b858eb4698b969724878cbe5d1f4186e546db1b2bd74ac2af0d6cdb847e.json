				"previous": "Medical research suggests that some zoophiles only become aroused by a specific species (such as horses), some zoophiles become aroused by multiple species (which may or may not include humans), and some zoophiles are not attracted to humans at all.[2][46]",
				"after": "Instances of this behavior have been found in the Bible.[47] In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian Val Camonica a man is shown about to penetrate an animal. Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief,[48] and so we do not know if this practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary.[49] The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time. Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing.[50] Dr \"Jacobus X\", said to be a nom-de-plume for a French author, said this was clearly \"before any known taboos against sex with animals existed.\"[51] Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titillation of the reader.[52] Masters said that since pre-historic man is prehistoric it goes without saying that we know little of his sexual behaviour,[53] depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist's subjective preoccupations or thoughts.",
