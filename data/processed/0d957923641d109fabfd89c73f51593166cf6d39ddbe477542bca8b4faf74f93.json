				"after": "Octaphenylrhodocene, [(Î·5-C5Ph4H)2Rh], is the first rhodocene derivative to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state as compared to the cobalt(II) state.[16][34] The reduction potential for the [(Î·5-C5Ph4H)2Rh]+ cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is â1.44Â V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands.[16] Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents,[17] and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry.[52] No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.",
