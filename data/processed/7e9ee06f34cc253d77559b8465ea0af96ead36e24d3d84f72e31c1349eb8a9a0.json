Ecosystems regulate the global geophysical cycles of energy, climate, soil nutrients, and water that in turn support and grow natural capital (including the environmental, physiological, cognitive, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of life). Ultimately, every manufactured product in human environments comes from natural systems.[28] Ecosystems are considered common-pool resources because ecosystems do not exclude beneficiaries and they can be depleted or degraded.[57] For example, green space within communities provides sustainable health services that reduces mortality and regulates the spread of vector borne disease.[58] Research shows that people who are more engaged with regular access to natural areas have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease and psychological disorders.[59] These ecological health services are regularly depleted through urban development projects that do not factor in the common-pool value of ecosystems.[60][61]",
