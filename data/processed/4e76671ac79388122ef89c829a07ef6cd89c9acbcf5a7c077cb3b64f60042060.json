				"after": "The keys to the R engine's high power-to-weight ratio were its supercharger design, ability to run at high revolutions due to its structural strength, and the special blends of fuel used. The double-sided supercharger impeller was a new development for Rolls-Royce: running at a ratio of almost 8:1, it could supply intake air at up to 18Â pounds per square inch (psi) (1.24Â bar) above atmospheric pressure, a figure known as \"boost\" and commonly abbreviated as \"+xÂ lb\".[16] By comparison the maximum boost of the earlier Rolls-Royce Kestrel design was +6Â lb (0.4Â bar), this figure not being achieved until 1934.[17] The high boost pressures initially caused the spark plugs to fail on test, and eventually the Lodge type X170 plug was chosen as it proved to be extremely reliable.[8][18]",
