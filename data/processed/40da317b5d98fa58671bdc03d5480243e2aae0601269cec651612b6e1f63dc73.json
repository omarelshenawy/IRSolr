				"previous": "The town's low rainfall and ample sunshine made it popular as a seaside resort, with tourists arriving by steamboat and train.[10] The Sheppey Light Railway opened in 1901, connecting the new Sheerness East station with the rest of the island. However, by 1950, lack of demand led to the railway's closure.[12] The Sheerness and District Tramways, which opened in 1903, only lasted until 1917.[13]",
				"after": "In 1944 the United States cargo ship SSÂ Richard Montgomery ran aground and sank 1 mile (1.6Â km) off the coast of Sheerness, with 3,172 tonnes of explosives on board. Due to the inherent danger and projected expense, the ship and its cargo have never been salvaged; if the wreck were to explode, it would be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions of all time. A 2004 report published in New Scientist warned that an explosion could occur if sea water penetrated the bombs.[14]",
