				"after": "More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\".[96] Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic,[97] pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.[98][99]",
