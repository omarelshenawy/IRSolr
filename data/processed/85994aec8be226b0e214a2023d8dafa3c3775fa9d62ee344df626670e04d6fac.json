An established pair's territory is defended year-round and maintained with little, if any, boundary change from year to year. The pair sit in cover on a branch close to a tree trunk during the day, and usually roost separately from July to October.[6] Roosting owls may be discovered and \"mobbed\" by small birds during the day, but they normally ignore the disturbance.[12]",
