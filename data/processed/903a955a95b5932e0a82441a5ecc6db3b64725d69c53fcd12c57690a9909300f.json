				"previous": "In the late 1960s the British and American governments held talks on producing Harriers in the United States. Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas formed a partnership in 1969 in preparation for American production,[32] but Congressman Mendel Rivers and the House Appropriations Committee held that it would be cheaper to produce the AV-8A on the pre-existing production lines in the United Kingdomâhence all AV-8A Harriers were purchased from Hawker Siddeley.[32] Improved Harrier versions with better sensors and more powerful engines were developed in later years.[33][34][35] The USMC received 102 AV-8A and 8 TAV-8A Harriers between 1971 and 1976.[36]",
