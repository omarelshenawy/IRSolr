				"after": "A mature Sumatran rhino stands about 120â145Â cm (3.94â4.76Â ft) high at the shoulder, has a body length of around 250Â cm (8.2Â ft) and weighs 500â800Â kg (1,100â1,800Â lb),[25] though the largest individuals in zoos have been known to weigh as much as 2,000 kilograms (4,400Â lb).[26] Like the African species, it has two horns. The larger is the nasal horn, typically only 15â25Â cm (5.9â9.8Â in), though the longest recorded specimen was much longer at 81Â cm (32Â in).[25] The posterior horn is much smaller, usually less than 10Â cm (3.9Â in) long, and often little more than a knob. The larger nasal horn is also known as the anterior horn; the smaller posterior horn as the frontal horn.[21] The horns are dark grey or black in color. The males have larger horns than the females, though the species is not otherwise sexually dimorphic. The Sumatran rhino lives an estimated 30â45 years in the wild, while the record time in captivity is a female D. lasiotis which lived for 32 years and 8 months before dying in the London Zoo in 1900.[21]",
