				"previous": "The contemporary \"Great Divergence\" is a term given to a period starting in late 1970s when inequality grew substantially in the United States and to a lesser extent in other countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. The term originated with Nobel laureate, Princeton economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman,[31] and is a reference to the \"Great Compression\", an earlier era in the 1930s and 40s when income became dramatically more equal in the United States and elsewhere.[32]",
