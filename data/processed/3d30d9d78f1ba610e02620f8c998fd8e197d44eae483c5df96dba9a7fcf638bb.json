				"previous": "U.S. Equities Realty was responsible for negotiating contracts with Gehry and all contractors. Walsh Construction and its subcontractors were hired to execute three elements of Gehry's design: the structural steel supporting the stainless steel ribbons, the ribbons themselves and the trellis and associated sound system.[9]",
				"after": "The LeJeune Steel Company of Minneapolis was the subcontractor for the structural steel. The pavilion's concrete walls frame the orchestra shell space, which is 100 feet (30Â m) wide, 50 feet (15Â m) tall and has no support columns.[9] The pavilion's roof rests on a dozen northâsouth trusses supported by eastâwest truss girders.[29] The south side of the orchestra shell space is enclosed by the glass doors of the proscenium, which are about 50 feet (15Â m) tall, 100 feet (30Â m) wide and function like aircraft hangar doors made of glass.[30] They were the largest doors that Glass Solutions of Elmhurst, Illinois, ever produced; the thickness of the glass was a design problem for the steel supports.[30]",
