She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band the Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \"Birthday\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. BjÃ¶rk began her career as a solo artist in 1993. Her first album, Debut, was rooted in electronic dance music, house, jazz and trip-hop, and is widely credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop. Now in the third decade of her solo career, BjÃ¶rk has developed an eclectic musical style that incorporates aspects of dance, rock, jazz, electronic, classical, and avant-garde music.",
