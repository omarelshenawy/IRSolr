One complete aircraft is known to have been retained for exhibition, specifically N102DA, the first 767-200 to operate for Delta Air Lines and the twelfth example built.[186][187] The exhibition aircraft, named \"The Spirit of Delta\" by the employees who helped purchase it in 1982, underwent restoration at the Delta Air Lines Air Transport Heritage Museum in Atlanta, Georgia.[187] The restoration was completed in 2010.[187] Featuring the original delivered interior as well as historical displays, the aircraft is viewable by visitors (self-guided) daily, during the museum's operating hours. [188] Hangar renovations, begun in June 2013, are now complete, and the museum is accessible on a daily basis. [189]",
