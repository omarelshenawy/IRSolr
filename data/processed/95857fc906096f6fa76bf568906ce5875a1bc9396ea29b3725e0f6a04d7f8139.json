				"previous": "The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. DÃ¼rer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden.[5] That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\".[6]",
				"after": "DÃ¼rer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal NiccolÃ² Albergati.[7][8] Von Fircks believes the portrait of DÃ¼rer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\".[7]",
