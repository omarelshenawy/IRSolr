				"after": "On 7 November 1938, Jewish minor Herschel GrÃ¼nspan assassinated Nazi German diplomat Ernst vom Rath in Paris.[74] This incident was used by the Nazis as a pretext to go beyond legal repression to large-scale physical violence against Jewish Germans. What the Nazis claimed to be spontaneous \"public outrage\" was in fact a wave of pogroms instigated by the Nazi Party, and carried out by SA members and affiliates throughout Nazi Germany, at the time consisting of Germany proper, Austria, and Sudetenland.[74] These pogroms became known as Reichskristallnacht (\"the Night of Broken Glass\", literally \"Crystal Night\"), or November pogroms. Jews were attacked and Jewish property was vandalized, over 7,000 Jewish shops and more than 1,200 synagogues (roughly two-thirds of the synagogues in areas under German control) were damaged or destroyed.[75]",
