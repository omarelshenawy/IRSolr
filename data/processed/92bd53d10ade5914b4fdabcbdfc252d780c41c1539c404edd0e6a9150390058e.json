				"previous": "During the 1970s energy crisis, the economic situation for both FlugfÃ©lag and LoftleiÃ°ir worsened. The government of Iceland initiated a new attempt to merge the two airlines, which could be realized in 1973 following lengthy and difficult negotiations.[28] The staff of LoftleiÃ°ir complained that FlugfÃ©lag, although smaller, had gained the upper hand in the united company.[29] A holding company called FlugleiÃ°ir was created, which combined the two companies and began to streamline staff and operations.[30] At the time of the merger, two thirds of the passenger traffic of the airline were international transatlantic crossings, and FlugfÃ©lag's fleet of DC-3s and 727s was enlarged by DC-8s of LoftleiÃ°ir. In 1979, FlugfÃ©lag bought all of LoftleiÃ°ir's assets in FlugleiÃ°ir, and the airline became known by today's Icelandair.",
				"after": "The aircraft fleet of Icelandair remained mainly unchanged until the Boeing 757-200 became the new backbone for transatlantic flights during the 1990s. The domestic Fokker F-27s were replaced by F-50s and Boeing 737s deployed on European routes. The European hub at Luxemburg-Findel Airport had been taken over from LoftleiÃ°ir. Passenger count topped one million in 1995[citation needed] as the company's business grew on a reputation as a \"backpacker airline\", similar to LoftleiÃ°ir, which had been referred to as \"Hippie Airline\" since the late 1960s. In the same year, it was begun to dismantle the Luxemburg hub in favor of today's decentralized European network, linking the largest cities non-stop to ReykjavÃ­k.[31]",
