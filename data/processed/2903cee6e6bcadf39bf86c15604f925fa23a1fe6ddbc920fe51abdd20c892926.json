The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.[69] He based his design on plans of cities such as Paris, Amsterdam, Karlsruhe, and Milan brought from Europe by Thomas Jefferson in 1788.[70] L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined \"grand avenue\" approximately 1 mile (1.6Â km) in length and 400 feet (120Â m) wide in the area that is now the National Mall.[71]",
