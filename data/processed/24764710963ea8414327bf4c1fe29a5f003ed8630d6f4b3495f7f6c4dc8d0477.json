				"previous": "The F-22 had several design changes from the YF-22. The swept-back angle on the wing's leading edge was decreased from 48Â° to 42Â°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and their area decreased by 20%.[26] To improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7 inches (18Â cm), and the engine intakes moved rearward 14 inches (36Â cm). The shapes of the wing and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics.[27][28] Due to increasing weight during development, range and aerodynamic performance were slightly reduced.[29]",
				"after": "The first F-22, an engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) aircraft named Raptor 4001, was unveiled at Marietta, Georgia on 9 April 1997, and first flew on 7 September 1997.[30] In 2006, the Raptor's development team, composed of over 1,000 contractors and the USAF, won the Collier Trophy, American aviation's most prestigious award.[31] The F-22 was in production for 15 years, at a rate of roughly two per month during peak production.[32]",
