				"after": "The flowers are small and appear in large panicles up to 50Â cm (20Â in) in length at the end of new shoots. The individual flowers are yellowish green to reddish in colour, each with five petals and sepals.[4][6] The sepals are cup-shaped, lobed and united while the petals are valvate (i.e. they meet at the edges without overlapping), white and hairy towards the inside.[5][8][9] They appear from mid-April in the south of its range to July in the north. A. altissima is dioecious, with male and female flowers being borne on different individuals. Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the females, making the male flowers more conspicuous. Furthermore, the male plants emit a foul-smelling odour while flowering to attract pollinating insects. Female flowers contain ten (or rarely five through abortion) sterile stamens (stamenoides) with heart-shaped anthers. The pistil is made up of five free carpels (i.e. they are not fused), each containing a single ovule. Their styles are united and slender with star-shaped stigmas.[5][8] The male flowers are similar in appearance, but they of course lack a pistil and the stamens do function, each being topped with a globular anther and a glandular green disc.[5] The seeds borne on the female trees are 5Â mm in diameter and each is encapsulated in a samara that is 2.5Â cm long (1Â in) and 1Â cm (0.39Â in) broad, appearing July though August, but can persist on the tree until the next spring. The samara is large and twisted at the tips, making it spin as it falls, assisting wind dispersal,[4][6] and aiding buoyancy for long-distance dispersal through hydrochory.[10] The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, normally around 30,000 per kilogram (14,000/lb) of tree,[4] and fecundity can be estimated non-destructively through measurements of dbh.[10]",
