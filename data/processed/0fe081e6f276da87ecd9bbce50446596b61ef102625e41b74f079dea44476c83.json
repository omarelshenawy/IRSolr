				"Concerning the general behavior patterns of raccoons, Gehrt points out that \"typically you'll find 10 to 15 percent that will do the opposite\"[117] of what is expected.",
				"The shape and size of a raccoon's home range varies depending on age, sex, and habitat, with adults claiming areas more than twice as large as juveniles.[112] While the size of home ranges in the inhospitable habitat of North Dakota's prairies lie between 7 and 50Â km2 (3 and 20Â sqÂ mi) for males and between 2 and 16Â km2 (1 and 6Â sqÂ mi) for females, the average size in a marsh at Lake Erie was 0.5Â km2 (0.19Â sqÂ mi).[113] Irrespective of whether the home ranges of adjacent groups overlap, they are most likely not actively defended outside the mating season if food supplies are sufficient.[114] Odor marks on prominent spots are assumed to establish home ranges and identify individuals.[115] Urine and feces left at shared raccoon latrines may provide additional information about feeding grounds, since raccoons were observed to meet there later for collective eating, sleeping and playing.[116]"

				"after": "Though usually nocturnal, the raccoon is sometimes active in daylight to take advantage of available food sources.[118] Its diet consists of about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant material and 27% vertebrates.[119] Since its diet consists of such a variety of different foods, Zeveloff argues the raccoon \"may well be one of the world's most omnivorous animals\".[120] While its diet in spring and early summer consists mostly of insects, worms, and other animals already available early in the year, it prefers fruits and nuts, such as acorns and walnuts, which emerge in late summer and autumn, and represent a rich calorie source for building up fat needed for winter.[121] Contrary to popular belief, raccoons eat active or large prey, such as birds and mammals, only occasionally, since they prefer prey that is easier to catch, specifically fish, amphibians and bird eggs.[122] When food is plentiful, raccoons can develop strong individual preferences for specific foods.[123] In the northern parts of their range, raccoons go into a winter rest, reducing their activity drastically as long as a permanent snow cover makes searching for food impossible.[124]",
