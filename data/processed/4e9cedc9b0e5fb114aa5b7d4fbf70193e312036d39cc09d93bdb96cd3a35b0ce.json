				"after": "The Bull Run watershed drains 139 square miles (360Â km2),[5] most of which is in the Mount Hood National Forest in Multnomah and Clackamas counties in northwest Oregon. The confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers at Dodge Park, about 20 miles (32Â km) east of downtown Portland,[16] marks the watershed's western (downstream) end, while on the east it borders Hood River County, and at Hiyo Mountain it is about 6 miles (9.7Â km) northwest of Mount Hood in the Cascade Range.[10] It is a sub-watershed of the Lower ColumbiaâSandy Watershed. Elevations within the watershed range from 4,750 feet (1,450Â m) at Buck Peak on the watershed's northeastern boundary to 243 feet (74Â m) at the mouth of the Bull Run River.[3][16]",
