				"previous": "In 1947, the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor. In 1948, Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n became the first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico.",
				"after": "A bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island. The Senate at the time was controlled by the PPD, and was presided over by Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n.[57] The bill, also known as the Gag Law (Ley de la Mordaza in Spanish), was approved by the legislature on May 21, 1948. It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a patriotic tune, to talk of independence, or to fight for the liberation of the island.",
