				"after": "As Speer had instructed, Wolters set up a small office in the North German town of HÃ¶xter with LÃ¼bke, who knew the town's mayor.[6][24] The new office was soon commissioned to rebuild a bridge which had been destroyed, contrary to Speer's instructions to preserve infrastructure.[24] Later in 1945, the office was dissolved, and Wolters returned to his hometown of Coesfeld where he had been commissioned to rebuild the ruined city.[24] LÃ¼bke instead turned to politics, rising quickly through the political ranks of postwar Germany. In 1959, LÃ¼bke became President of the Federal Republic of Germany, a position in which he served almost ten years before he resigned over questions about what he may have known about forced labor while working in Speer's department.[25]",
