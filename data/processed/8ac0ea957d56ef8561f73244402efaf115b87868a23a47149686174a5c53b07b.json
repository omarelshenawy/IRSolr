				"after": "When the territory of Yorkshire began to take shape as a result of the invasion of the Danish vikings, they instituted a monarchy based at the settlement of JÃ³rvÃ­k, York.[190] The reign of the Viking kings came to an end with the last king Eric Bloodaxe dying in battle in 954 after the invasion and conquest by the Kingdom of England from the south. JÃ³rvÃ­k was the last of the independent kingdoms to be taken to form part of the Kingdom of England and thus the local monarchal title became defunct.[191]",
