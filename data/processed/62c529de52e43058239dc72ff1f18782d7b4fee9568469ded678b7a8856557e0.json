On the spirit tablets that were displayed there, the temple name was followed by the honorific name, as in \"Shizu Zhang huangdi\" for the Shunzhi Emperor and \"Taizong Wen huangdi\" for Hong Taiji. As dynastic founder, Nurhaci (\"Taizu\") became the focal ancestor in the main hall of the temple.[41] The earlier paternal ancestors of the Qing imperial line were worshiped in a back hall.[41] Historical records like the Veritable Records (traditional Chinese: å¯¦é; simplified Chinese: å®å½; pinyin: ShÃ­lÃ¹), which were compiled at the end of each reign, retrospectively referred to emperors by their temple names.",
