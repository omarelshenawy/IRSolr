				"previous": "Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27,[195] and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day;[196] he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action.[197] The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana,[198] officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.",
				"after": "On August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it \"an incident of national significance\",[199] triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans.[200] The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was \"not enough\".[201]",
