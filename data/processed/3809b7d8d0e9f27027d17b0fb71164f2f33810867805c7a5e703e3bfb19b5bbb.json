				"previous": "Ryder's career as an Australia team selector was unusual. As Test captain, he was on the selection panel for the 1930 Ashes tour of England, but was out-voted for a place on the team, and the captaincy passed to Bill Woodfull. In 1946, he was made a selector again and held the post for 23 years, forming a long association with Sir Donald Bradman and Chappie Dwyer.",
			"after": [
				"The medal for the outstanding player of the season in Melbourne Premier Cricket is named in his honour, and was first presented in 1973â74.",
				"He remains the only Test cricketer to be run out in both innings of his debut Test match.[1] Ryder was also the first Australian to complete a Test Career of more than 20 innings with a batting average over 50.00."
