				"after": "The cattle egret nests in colonies, which are often, but not always, found around bodies of water.[21] The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises and cormorants. The breeding season varies within South Asia.[7] Nesting in northern India begins with the onset of monsoons in May.[39] The breeding season in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season.[40] The North American breeding season lasts from April to October.[21] In the Seychelles, the breeding season of the subspecies B.i. seychellarum is April to October.[41]",
