				"previous": "Not long after the purchase of the second McDonnell Douglas aircraft, Dynamic Airways announced a three-year partnership flying for Hoda Air Services in South Korea. The deal, which included a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 supported by a full crew, was the airline's first in Asia. The airline continued to expand when its first 767 entered service and the second was delivered, which was according to the airline available for 'ACMI wet lease, full charter and corporate shuttle programs for private and government organisations'.[3]",
				"after": "In March 2012, Direct Air temporarily suspended its operations and cancelled all charter flights, Direct Air subsequently filing for bankruptcy. It ceased operations completely shortly after, having been found to have racked up millions in debts. The MD-88 was returned to Dynamic Airways as a result. The third Boeing 767 was delivered to Dynamic Airways on March 6.[4] This 767 entered operations in early 2013.[citation needed]",
