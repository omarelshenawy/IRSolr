It was published by the founder of the Church, Joseph Smith, Jr., in March 1830 in Palmyra, New York, USA. Its purpose, as stated on its title page, \"is to show the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord has done for their fathers\" and to convince \"Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself to all nations.\"",
