				"after": "He used a wood molding, \"12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick\" as a ramp with a straight, smooth, polished groove to study rolling balls (\"a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball\"). He lined the groove with \"parchment, also smooth and polished as possible\". He inclined the ramp at various angles, effectively slowing down the acceleration enough so that he could measure the elapsed time. He would let the ball roll a known distance down the ramp, and used a water clock to measure the time taken to move the known distance; this clock was",
