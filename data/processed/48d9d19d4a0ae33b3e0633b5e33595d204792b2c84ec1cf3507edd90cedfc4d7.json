				"after": "New membership in the alliance has been largely from Eastern Europe and the Balkans, including former members of the Warsaw Pact. Their accession to the alliance is governed with individual Membership Action Plans, and will require approval by each current member. NATO currently has three candidate countries that are in the process of joining the alliance: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and the Republic of Macedonia.[112] Though Macedonia completed its requirements for membership at the same time as Croatia and Albania, NATO's most recent members, its accession was blocked by Greece pending a resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute.[113] In order to support each other in the process, new and potential members in that region formed the Adriatic Charter in 2003.[114] Georgia is also an aspiring member, and was promised \"future membership\" during the 2008 summit in Bucharest,[115] although, in 2014, US President Barack Obama said the country was not \"currently on a path\" to membership.[116]",
