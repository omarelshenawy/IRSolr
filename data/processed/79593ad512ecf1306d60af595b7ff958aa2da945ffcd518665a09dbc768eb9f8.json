				"previous": "The Origin of Species was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the \"working men\" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.[142] Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time[III] and became a key fixture of popular culture.[IV] Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862 Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism.[125]",
