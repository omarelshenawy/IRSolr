				"after": "The general design of Oliver typewriters remained mostly unchanged throughout the company's history.[10] The Olivers are \"down strike\" typewriters, meaning the typebars strike the platen (also known as the roller) from above, rather than from below (\"up strike\") or from the front (\"front strike\"). Unlike the \"up strike\" method, which prints text out of sight on the underside of the platen, the \"down strike\" is a \"visible print\" design, meaning the full page is visible to the typist as the text is being entered. The relatively greater striking power of the \"down strike\" design led Olivers to be preferred for specialty uses such as stencil cutting or \"manifolding\" (copying using carbon paper).[14] The \"front strike\" method, a competing \"visible print\" design, was patented around the same time (1889â91), but an effective machine that did not interfere with the typistâs line of sight was not available until 1897 when, roughly three years after the introduction of the Oliver No. 1, the Underwood No. 1 appeared on the market.[15]",
