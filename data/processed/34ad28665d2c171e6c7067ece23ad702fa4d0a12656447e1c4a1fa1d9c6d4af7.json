As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of ZÃ¼rich, with his dissertation entitled, \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.\"[1][45] That same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world.",
