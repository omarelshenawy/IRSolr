				"previous": "Mariano Moreno was the son of poor parents, Manuel Moreno y Argumosa and Ana Maria Valle, he had fourteen siblings. He studied at Colegio Grande de San Carlos, but without living in it, as his family could not afford the price.[1] He graduated with an honor diploma.[2] He met influential people within the literary field, who helped him to continue his studies at the University of Chuquisaca, even when his father could not afford the cost.[3] This was the only big university in South America at the time. He studied the books of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and other European philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. He studied English and French languages as well, to understand authors from Britain and France.[4] This allowed him to work as a translator, and he spent several years working with Rousseau's The Social Contract. Moreno was convinced that society could be changed by the power of intelligence and reason.[5]",
				"after": "He also studied philosophical texts of the Spanish Enlightenment under the tutelage of the priest Terrazas, and aspired to implement the new ideas in his country. He wrote a thesis with strong criticism of the native slavery at the mines of PotosÃ­, influenced by the Spanish jurist Juan de Solorzano Pereira,[6] the foremost publisher of Indian Law, and Victoria Villalva, fiscal of the Audiencia of Charcas and defender of the indigenous cause.[7]",
