				"after": "German planners had in November 1939 called for \"the complete destruction\" of all Poles.[349] \"All Poles\", Heinrich Himmler swore, \"will disappear from the world\".[350] The Polish state under German occupation was to be cleared of ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists.[351] Of the Poles, by 1952 only about threeâfour million of them were to be left in the former Poland, and only to serve as slaves for German settlers. They were to be forbidden to marry, the existing ban on any medical help to Poles in Germany would be extended, and eventually Poles would cease to exist. On 22 August 1939, just over a week before the onset of war, Hitler declared that \"the object of the war is ... physically to destroy the enemy. That is why I have prepared, for the moment only in the East, my 'Death's Head' formations with orders to kill without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we obtain the living space we need.\"[352] Nazi planners decided against a genocide of ethnic Poles on the same scale as against ethnic Jews; it could not proceed in the short term since \"such a solution to the Polish question would represent a burden to the German people into the distant future, and everywhere rob us of all understanding, not least in that neighbouring peoples would have to reckon at some appropriate time, with a similar fate\".[353]",
