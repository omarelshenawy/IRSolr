Genetic analysis of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra-pair copulation[58] and there is little evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure.[78] Some pairs do separate in the first few months, but almost all pairings of over six months' duration are lifelong, ending only when a partner dies.[59] Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.[59]",
