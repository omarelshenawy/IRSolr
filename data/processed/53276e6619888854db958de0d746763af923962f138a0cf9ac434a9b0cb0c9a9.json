				"previous": "Northern triptychs[E] and polyptychs were popular across Europe from the late 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 1500s. During the 1400s they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for liturgical settings.[127] The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.[F][28]",
				"after": "Polyptychs were produced by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels.[129] The Ghent Altarpiece, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.[G][129]",
