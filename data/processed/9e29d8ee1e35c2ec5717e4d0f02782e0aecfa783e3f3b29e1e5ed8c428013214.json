Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25Â million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.",
