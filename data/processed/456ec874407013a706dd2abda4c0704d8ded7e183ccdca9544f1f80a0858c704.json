				"after": "In 1892, Fuller travelled to the Cape of Good Hope \"to convalesce\", although from what illness or injury, her biographer Joan Kerr does not say.[notes 3] While there, she was a guest of her uncle Sir Thomas Ekins Fuller, a member of the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, and through him she met Cecil Rhodes, the Colony's Prime Minister, who commissioned her to paint a landscape showing his home.[4][12][13] Two years later, she travelled on to England and France, where she remained for a decade.[4] In the 1890s, Australian artists studying abroad favoured Paris over London, and Fuller was no exception. Other Australians studying in France around that time included Agnes Goodsir, Margaret Preston, James Quinn, and Hugh Ramsay.[14] Fuller studied first at the AcadÃ©mie Julian, where her teachers included William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and later, RaphaÃ«l Collin, one of whose studios she managed for a time.[4][15] Many of the French art schools had only recently opened their doors to women, and those at AcadÃ©mie Julian experienced poor, overcrowded conditions and contempt from the (mostly male) teachers.[16] Despite this, Fuller's skills developed, and contemporary critics commented favourably on the influence of the French training.[17][18]",
