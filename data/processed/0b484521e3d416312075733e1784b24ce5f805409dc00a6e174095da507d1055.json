				"after": "The forest contains four areas of pristine wildernesses that have remained largely untouched by human activities such as mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses.[35] Additionally, a small portion of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, 1,400,000 acres (570,000Â ha), constituting 56Â percent of the forest is designated wilderness.[60][37] The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.[61]",
