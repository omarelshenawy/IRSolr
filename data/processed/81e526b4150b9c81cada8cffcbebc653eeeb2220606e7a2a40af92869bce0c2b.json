				"previous": "The reforms created political factions in the court. Wang Anshi's \"New Policies Group\" (Xin Fa), also known as the \"Reformers\", were opposed by the ministers in the \"Conservative\" faction led by the historian and Chancellor Sima Guang (1019â1086).[24] As one faction supplanted another in the majority position of the court ministers, it would demote rival officials and exile them to govern remote frontier regions of the empire.[23] One of the prominent victims of the political rivalry, the famous poet and statesman Su Shi (1037â1101), was jailed and eventually exiled for criticizing Wang's reforms.[23]",
				"after": "While the central Song court remained politically divided and focused upon its internal affairs, alarming new events to the north in the Liao state finally came to its attention. The Jurchen, a subject tribe of the Liao, rebelled against them and formed their own state, the Jin dynasty (1115â1234).[25] The Song official Tong Guan (1054â1126) advised Emperor Huizong (1100â1125) to form an alliance with the Jurchens, and the joint military campaign under this Alliance Conducted at Sea toppled and completely conquered the Liao dynasty by 1125.",
