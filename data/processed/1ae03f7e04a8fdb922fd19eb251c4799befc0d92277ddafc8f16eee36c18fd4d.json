A high school exclusively for girls was established in 1881 and later converted into the Maharani's Women's College.[32] The Industrial School, the first institute for technical education in the city, was established in 1892; this was followed by the Chamarajendra Technical Institute in 1913.[28]:601 While the modern system of education was making inroads, colleges such as the Mysore Sanskrit college, established in 1876, continued to provide Vedic education.[28]:595",
