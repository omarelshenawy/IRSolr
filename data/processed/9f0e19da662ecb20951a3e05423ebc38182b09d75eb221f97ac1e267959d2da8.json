				"previous": "The municipal government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City CouncilÂ â Miejska Rada NarodowaÂ â governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the system of city administration has been changed several timesÂ â also as the result of the reform which restored powiats, cancelled in 1975. Finally, according the Warsaw Act, the city is divided into 18 districts and forms one city powiat with a unified municipal government.[88]",
				"after": "The basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (gmina).[89] A city is also a communeÂ â but with the city charter.[89] Both cities and communes are governed by a mayorÂ â but in the communes the mayor is vogt (wÃ³jt in Polish), however in the citiesÂ â burmistrz. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial divisionÂ â counties or powiats. An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina). In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki. Such cities are for example Lublin, KrakÃ³w, GdaÅsk, PoznaÅ. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlementsÂ â like already mentioned car registration. For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district UrsynÃ³wÂ â its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from UrsynÃ³w). But for instance the districts in KrakÃ³w do not have entitlements of powiat, so the registration numbers in KrakÃ³w are of the same type for all districts.",
