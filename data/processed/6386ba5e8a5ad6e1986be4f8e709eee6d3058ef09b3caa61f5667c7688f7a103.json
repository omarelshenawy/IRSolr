				"previous": "On 20 June 2008, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) agreed to extend South African Airways' sponsorship of the organisation another 3 and a half years. This sponsorship extension succeeds two years of co-operation that \"have seen a successful partnership blossom between SAA and the ATP\".[57] The deal is worth $20Â million, and runs until the end of 2012. On the same day it was announced that a new ATP World Tour tournament would be held in South Africa in 2009. In 2010, the company sought to recover $4Â million from then-CEO Khaya Ngqula, for allegedly spending the money on his friends and awarding business deals with organisations and individual in which he had an interest. Among them are ATP and professional golfer Ãngel Cabrera.[58]",
				"after": "In February 2010, the airline appointed Siza Mzimela as its first female CEO. This came after \"an extensive and thorough process to find a suitable candidate\" for Khaya Ngqula,[59] who was accused for mismanagement, and has therefore quit. Mzimela was previously CEO of SAA's domestic partner airline, South African Express (SA Express). She took over the position from Chris Smyth on 1 April that year,[60] who has been acting CEO ever since Khaya Ngqula left since March 2009.[61][62]",
