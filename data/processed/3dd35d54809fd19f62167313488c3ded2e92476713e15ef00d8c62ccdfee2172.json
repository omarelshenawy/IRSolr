				"previous": "Maryland has an area of 12,406.68 square miles (32,133.2Â km2) and is comparable in overall area with the European country of Belgium (11,787 square miles (30,530Â km2)).[17] It is the 42nd largest and 9th smallest state and is closest in size to the state of Hawaii (10,930.98 square miles (28,311.1Â km2)), the next smallest state. The next largest state, its neighbor West Virginia, is almost twice the size of Maryland (24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8Â km2)).",
				"after": "Maryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname America in Miniature.[18] It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the mountains to the west.",
