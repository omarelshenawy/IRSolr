				"previous": "By the later half of the 2nd century BC it belonged to the Romans, who included it in their province of Africa, and gave it the name of \"Regio Syrtica\". Around the beginning of the 3rd century AD, it became known as the Regio Tripolitana, meaning \"region of the three cities\", namely Oea (i.e., modern Tripoli), Sabratha and Leptis Magna. It was probably raised to the rank of a separate province by Septimius Severus, who was a native of Leptis Magna.",
				"after": "In spite of centuries of Roman habitation, the only visible Roman remains, apart from scattered columns and capitals (usually integrated in later buildings), is the Arch of Marcus Aurelius from the 2nd century AD. The fact that Tripoli has been continuously inhabited, unlike e.g., Sabratha and Leptis Magna, has meant that the inhabitants have either quarried material from older buildings (destroying them in the process), or built on top of them, burying them beneath the streets, where they remain largely unexcavated.",
