				"previous": "The United States Geographical Survey (USGS) states that the geographic center of North America is \"6Â miles [10Â km] west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota\" at about 48Â°10â²N 100Â°10â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿48.167Â°N 100.167Â°Wï»¿ / 48.167; -100.167, about 24 kilometres (15Â mi) from Rugby, North Dakota. The USGS further states that \"No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 States, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.\" Nonetheless, there is a 4.6-metre (15Â ft) field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located 1,650Â km (1,030Â mi) from the nearest coastline, between Allen and Kyle, South Dakota at 43Â°22â²N 101Â°58â²Wï»¿ / ï»¿43.36Â°N 101.97Â°Wï»¿ / 43.36; -101.97ï»¿ (Pole of Inaccessibility North America).[51]",
				"after": "Geologically, Canada is one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era.[52] Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.[52] Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,[53] making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[54] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.",
