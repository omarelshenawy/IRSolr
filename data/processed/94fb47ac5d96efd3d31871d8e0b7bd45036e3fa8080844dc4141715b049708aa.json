				"previous": "In May 2014, Pratt & Whitney discovered conflicting documentation about the origin of titanium material used in some of its engines, including the F135. The company assessed that the uncertainty did not pose a risk to safety of flight but suspended engine deliveries as a result in May 2014. Bogdan supported Pratt's actions and said the problem was now with A&P Alloys, the supplier. The US Defense Contract Management Agency wrote in June 2014 that Pratt & Whitneyâs \"continued poor management of suppliers is a primary driver for the increased potential problem notifications.\" A&P Alloys stated that it has not been given access to the parts to do its own testing but stood behind its product. Tracy Miner, an attorney with Boston-based Demeo LLP representing A&P Alloys said, \"it is blatantly unfair to destroy A&Pâs business without allowing A&P access to the materials in question\".[25][26][27]",
				"after": "The F-135, a mixed-flow afterburning turbofan, was derived from the F-119 engine but was given a new fan and LP turbine.[28]",
