				"previous": "Government restrictions on overseas travel and the introduction of exchange controls in 1951 caused a severe contraction of the travel market, resulting in the collapse of numerous small independent airlines in the UK. The industry's grave situation necessitated drastic cutbacks at East Anglian to ensure its survival. All commercial activities other than pleasure flying ceased and only two full-time employees remained on the company's payroll â Jones himself and an office boy. While Jones drove his passengers to and from Southend Airport, the boy was left in charge of a kiosk on Southend's seafront selling tickets.[29][31]",
				"after": "Following a gradual pickup in demand, East Anglian brought back into service aircraft that had been laid up during the slump, re-hired laid-off employees and, in 1953, obtained a lease on the grass airfield at Ipswich Airport as a secondary base for its charter operations and a future feeder point on its scheduled network. During that period, East Anglian concluded a new \"associate\" agreement with BEA, which led to the award of its first long-term scheduled licence[nb 2] on the SouthendâOstend route. Additional scheduled services were launched from Southend and Portsmouth to Paris as well as from Portsmouth to Jersey while some SouthendâJersey services featured additional stops in Rochester, Shoreham and Guernsey. A SouthendâRotterdam link followed in 1956.[31][32]",
