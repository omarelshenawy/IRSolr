				"after": "On May 22, 2012, the Yahoo! Finance website reported that Facebook's lead underwriters, Morgan Stanley (MS), JP Morgan (JPM), and Goldman Sachs (GS), cut their earnings forecasts for the company in the middle of the IPO process.[63] The stock had begun its freefall by this time, closing at 34.03 on May 21 and 31.00 on May 22. A \"circuit breaker\" was used in an attempt to slow down the stock price's decline.[64] Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Chairman Rick Ketchum, called for a review of the circumstances surrounding the IPO.[65]",
