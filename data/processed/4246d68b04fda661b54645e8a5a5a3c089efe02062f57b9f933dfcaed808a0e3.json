He was seen as a national hero who had ended the war with Japan. There were, however, no parades or testimonial dinners for him or any of the other Enola Gay crewmen, although Tibbets later received an invitation from President Harry S. Truman to visit the White House.[50] The 509th Composite Group was not awarded an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award until 1999.[51]",
