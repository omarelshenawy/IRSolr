				"after": "The Green Book attracted sponsorship from a number of businesses, including the African American newspapers Call and Post of Cleveland, Ohio, and the Louisville Leader of Louisville, Kentucky.[30] Standard Oil (later Esso) was also a sponsor, owing to the efforts of James \"Billboard\" Jackson, a pioneering African American Esso sales representative.[24] Esso's \"race group\", part of its marketing division, promoted the Green Book as enabling Esso's black customers to \"go further with less anxiety\". By contrast, Shell gas stations were known to refuse black customers.[31] The 1949 edition included an Esso endorsement message that told readers: \"As representatives of the Esso Standard Oil Co., we are pleased to recommend the Green Book for your travel convenience. Keep one on hand each year and when you are planning your trips, let Esso Touring Service supply you with maps and complete routings, and for real 'Happy Motoring'Â â use Esso Products and Esso Service wherever you find the Esso sign.\"[16]",
