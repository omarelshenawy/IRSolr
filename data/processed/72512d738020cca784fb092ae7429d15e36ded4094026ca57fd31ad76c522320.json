InterstateÂ 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the District to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway. A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.[194] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395, both terminate shortly after entering the city.",
