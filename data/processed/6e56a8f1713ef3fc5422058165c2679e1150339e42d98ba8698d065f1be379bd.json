				"previous": "Several more species were named around 1900, including Nycticebus menagensis (originally Lemur menagensis) by Richard Lydekker in 1893[34] and Nycticebus pygmaeus by John James Lewis Bonhote in 1907.[35] However, in 1939 Reginald Innes Pocock consolidated all slow lorises into a single species, N.Â coucang,[36] and in his influential 1953 book Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy, primatologist William Charles Osman Hill also followed this course.[37] In 1971 Colin Groves recognized the pygmy slow loris (N.Â pygmaeus) as a separate species,[38] and divided N.Â coucang into four subspecies,[39] while in 2001 Groves opined there were three species (N.Â coucang, N.Â pygmaeus, and N.Â bengalensis), and that N.Â coucang had three subspecies (Nycticebus coucang coucang, N.Â c.Â menagensis, and N.Â c.Â javanicus).[40]",
				"after": "In 2006, the Bornean slow loris was elevated to the species level (as Nycticebus menagensis) based on molecular analysis of DNA sequences of the D-loop and the cytochromeÂ b gene.[42] In 2008, Groves and Ibnu Maryanto confirmed the promotion of the fifth species, the Javan slow loris, to species status, a move that had been suggested in previous studies from 2000. They based their decision on an analysis of cranial morphology and characteristics of pelage.[43] Species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology, such as size, fur color, and head markings.[44]",
