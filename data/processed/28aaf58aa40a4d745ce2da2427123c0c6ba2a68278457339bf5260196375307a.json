				"after": "A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga received 97,847 visitors in 2011.[37] Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 ariary for foreigners and 400 ariary for locals),[28] which is largely used to pay for the preservation of the site.[1] The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city.[1] Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history.[50] Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings.[14] Tourism has been negatively affected at the site as a consequence of the 2009 Malagasy political crisis;[50] management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.[10]",
