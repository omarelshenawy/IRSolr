				"previous": "In addition to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, such as the painting of banners and stage scenery.[15] Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peakeâs work is not recorded there, it seems as if De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter.[6] However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.[16]",
				"after": "In 1610, Peake was described as \"painter to Prince Henry\",[10] the sixteen-year-old prince who was gathering around him a significant cultural salon. Peake commissioned a translation of Books I-V of Sebastiano Serlioâs Architettura, which he dedicated to the prince in 1611.[5] Scholars have deduced from payments made to Peake that his position as painter to Prince Henry led to his appointment as serjeant-painter to the king.[10] The payments were listed by the Prince's household officer Sir David Murray as disbursements from the Privy Purse to \"Mr Peck\". On 14 October 1608, Peake was paid Â£7 for \"pictures made by His Highnessâ command\"; and on 14 July 1609, he was paid Â£3 \"for a picture of His Highness which was given in exchange for the Kingâs picture\". At about the same time, Isaac Oliver was paid Â£5.10s.0d. for each of three miniatures of the prince. Murrayâs accounts reveal, however, that the prince was paying more for tennis balls than for any picture.[17]",
