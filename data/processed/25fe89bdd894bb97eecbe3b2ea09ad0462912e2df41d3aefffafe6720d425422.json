When it felt that, it started so violently that both Thor's fists went smack against the gunwale. Then Thor got angry, assumed all his godly strength, and dug his heels so sturdily that his feet went right through the bottom of the boat and he braced them on the sea bed.\" (Jansson's translation).[57] The Altuna Runestone has also included the foot that went through the planks.[58]",
