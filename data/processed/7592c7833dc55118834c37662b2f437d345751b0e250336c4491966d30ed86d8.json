Most applications are limited to the use of \"first generation\" passive nanomaterials which includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen, cosmetics, surface coatings,[45] and some food products; Carbon allotropes used to produce gecko tape; silver in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances; zinc oxide in sunscreens and cosmetics, surface coatings, paints and outdoor furniture varnishes; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.[12]",
