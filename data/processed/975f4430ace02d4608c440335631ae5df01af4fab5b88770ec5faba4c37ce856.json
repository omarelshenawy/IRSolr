				"previous": "This rotation of the planet gears can in turn drive the annulus (not depicted in diagram), in a corresponding ratio. If the annulus has Na teeth, then the annulus will rotate by Np/Na turns for each turn of the planet gears. For instance, if the annulus has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of the annulus. Extending this case from the one above:",
				"after": "So, with the planetary carrier locked, one turn of the sun gear results in turns of the annulus.",
