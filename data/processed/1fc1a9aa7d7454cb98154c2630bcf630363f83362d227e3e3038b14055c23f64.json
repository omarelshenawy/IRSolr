				"Often a PDE can be reduced to a simpler form with a known solution by a suitable change of variables. For example the BlackâScholes PDE",
				"If the domain is finite or periodic, an infinite sum of solutions such as a Fourier series is appropriate, but an integral of solutions such as a Fourier integral is generally required for infinite domains. The solution for a point source for the heat equation given above is an example for use of a Fourier integral."
