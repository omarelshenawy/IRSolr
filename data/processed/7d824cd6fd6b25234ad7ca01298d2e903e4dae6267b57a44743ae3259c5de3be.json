Chaco's suspected role as a regional center of pilgrimage, where priestly elites staged the ritual smashing of potsâwhich over time built up at least one hillock composed solely of shardsâis thought to underscore this pattern. Two whorl-shaped etchings near the top of Fajada Butte compose the \"Sun Dagger\" petroglyph, itself tucked behind the eponymous rock panels of the \"Three-Slab Site\". They are symbolically focal.[75][9]",
