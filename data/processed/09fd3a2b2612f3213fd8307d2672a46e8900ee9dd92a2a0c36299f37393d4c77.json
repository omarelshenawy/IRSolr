				"after": "California Chrome shipped on May 12 to Baltimore to run in the 2014 Preakness Stakes on May 17. On the plane were the other two Derby competitors to enter the Preakness: Ride On Curlin and General a Rod. Once on the ground, their van had a police escort from the airport to Pimlico Race Course.[119] When California Chrome arrived at Pimlico, the management at that track welcomed him with two saddlecloths for his workouts, one with the \"Califorina\" misspelling and the other with the correct spelling;[104] Just as at Churchill Downs, the colt exercised on the Pimlico track but had no timed workouts.[120][121] Delgado compared the long and narrow Pimlico oval favorably to their home track at Los Alamitos.[122] Sherman did not like that the horse had to race again with only a two-week break, but was confident because California Chrome had gained back weight he had lost running the Derby, plus another 35 pounds (16Â kg).[120]",
