				"previous": "Alchemy used a set of mostly standardized symbols, many of which were ligatures: ð (AR, for aqua regia), ð (S inside a V, for aqua vitae), ð« (MB, for a marian bath or double boiler), ð¬ (VB, for a vapor bath), and ð (aaa, for amalgam).",
				"after": "Digraphs, such as ll in Spanish or Welsh, are not ligatures in the general case as the two letters are displayed as separate glyphs: although written together, when they are joined in handwriting or italic fonts the base form of the letters is not changed and the individual glyphs remain separate. Like some ligatures discussed above, these digraphs may or may not be considered individual letters in their respective languages. Until the 1994 spelling reform, the digraphs ch and ll were considered separate letters in Spanish for collation purposes.",
