				"after": "Saffron was detailed in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal.[15] Documentation of saffron's use over the span of 4,000 years in the treatment of some 90 illnesses has been uncovered.[39] Saffron-based pigments have indeed been found in 50,000 year-old depictions of prehistoric places in northwest Iran.[40][41] The Sumerians later used wild-growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions.[42] Saffron was an article of long-distance trade before the Minoan palace culture's 2nd millennium BC peak. Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') in Derbena, Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles,[40] ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes.[43] Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Non-Persians also feared the Persians' usage of saffron as a drugging agent and aphrodisiac.[44] During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths as a curative for battle wounds. Alexander's troops imitated the practice from the Persians and brought saffron-bathing to Greece.[45]",
