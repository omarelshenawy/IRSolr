				"after": "In 1755, following the Battle of Lake George, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, the governor of the French Province of Canada, sent his cousin Michel Chartier de LotbiniÃ¨re to design and construct a fortification at this militarily important site, which the French called Fort Carillon.[9] The name \"Carillon\" has variously been attributed to the name of a former French officer, Philippe de Carrion du Fresnoy, who established a trading post at the site in the late 17th century,[10] or (more commonly) to the sounds made by the La Chute River, which were said to resemble the chiming bells of a carillon.[11] Construction on the star-shaped fort, which LotbiniÃ¨re based on designs of the renowned French military engineer Vauban, began in October 1755 and then proceeded slowly during the warmer-weather months of 1756 and 1757, using troops stationed at nearby Fort St. FrÃ©dÃ©ric and from Canada.[12][13]",
