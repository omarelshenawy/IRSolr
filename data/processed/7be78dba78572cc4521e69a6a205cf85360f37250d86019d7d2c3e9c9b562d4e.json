				"after": "One of the most widespread groups of mammals, rodents can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals that have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat).[3] Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts. Some species such as tree squirrels and New World porcupines are arboreal, while some, such as gophers and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others dwell on the surface of the ground but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semi-aquatic,[1] but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea.[20] Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas.[21]",
