				"after": "An airfoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.[13][14][15][16] The air flow changes direction as it passes the airfoil following a path that is curved downward, and the overall result is that a reaction force is generated opposite to the directional change.[17][18] In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.[20][21][23][24][25][26][27]",
