These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, Zouche's brother, but in the end he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens' sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in the Munich gallery, Alte Pinakothek.[54]",
