				"previous": "When Vladivostok Air celebrated its 15th anniversary as an open joint stock company on 20 January 2009, it had transformed from a regional carrier into the largest company in the Russian Far East and East Siberia.[7] Passenger numbers increased to over 900,000 annually because of fleet expansion and modernisation. June 2009 saw the introduction of the first long-haul Airbus A330-300 service, connecting Vladivostok and Moscow, with more A320's and A330's expected to join the fleet between October 2009 and the summer of 2010. Orders for four Antonov An-148 with two options were placed at the 2009 MAKS Airshow.[8]",
				"after": "On 28 April 2009, Vladivostok Air received the Wings of Russia 2008 award in the category of \"Airline of the YearÂ â Passengers Choice\".[9][10] Vladivostok Air also announced its earnings on 15 July, showing that, despite the recession, passenger traffic had increased by an incredible 36.6%, while passenger capacity was 28.8% higher in the first six months of 2009 than in the first six months of 2008, with the load factor increasing by 9.5%. Vladivostok Air's income was an astounding 38.1% higher for the same period of time in 2009 than in 2008, attributed to fleet network optimization, transition to more fuel efficient aircraft, and to the takeover of Dalavia's Khabarovsk hub.[11]",
