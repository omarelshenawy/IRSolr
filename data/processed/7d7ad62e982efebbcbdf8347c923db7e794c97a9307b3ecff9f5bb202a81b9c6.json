				"previous": "Octagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing.[233] It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan.[233] The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom.[233] The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of Eight Banners.[234] When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells.[233] Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer.[233]",
				"after": "\"Zidishu\" is the main libretto of octagonal drum and can be traced back to a type of traditional folk music called \"Manchu Rhythm\".[235] Although Zidishu was not created by Chinese people, it still contains many themes from Chinese stories,[236] such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, Legend of the White Snake and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio.[236] Additionally, there are many works that depict the lives of Bannermen. Aisin Gioro Yigeng, who was pen named \"HelÃ¼\" and wrote the sigh of old imperial bodyguard, is the representative author.[237] Zidishu involves two acts of singing, which are called dongcheng and xicheng.[238]",
