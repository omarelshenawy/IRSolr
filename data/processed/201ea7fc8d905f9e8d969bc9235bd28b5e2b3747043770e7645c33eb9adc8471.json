				"after": "The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in 1979â80. At age 51, Howe played all 80 games for the Whalers, scoring 15 goals to bring his NHL career total to 801. He entered his second retirement as the league's all-time scoring leader with 1,850 points.[22] Howe's final season was also the last for the Atlanta Flames. The team averaged an attendance of only 9,800 fans per game and lost over $2Â million in 1979â80.[59] They were sold for a record $16Â million, and relocated north to become the Calgary Flames in 1980â81.[60] Two years later, the Rockies were sold for $30Â million, and left Denver to become the New Jersey Devils for the 1982â83 season.[61]",
