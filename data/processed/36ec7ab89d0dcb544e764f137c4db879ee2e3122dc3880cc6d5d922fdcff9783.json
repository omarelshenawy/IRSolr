				"after": "The term avionics was coined by journalist Philip J. Klass as a portmanteau of aviation electronics.[1][2] Many modern avionics have their origins in World WarÂ II wartime developments. For example, autopilot systems that are prolific today were started to help bomber planes fly steadily enough to hit precision targets from high altitudes.[3] Famously, radar was developed in the UK, Germany, and the United States during the same period.[4] Modern avionics is a substantial portion of military aircraft spending. Aircraft like the Fâ15E and the now retired Fâ14 have roughly 20 percent of their budget spent on avionics. Most modern helicopters now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics.[citation needed]",
