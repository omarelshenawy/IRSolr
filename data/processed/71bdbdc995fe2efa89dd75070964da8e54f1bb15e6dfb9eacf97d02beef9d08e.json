If we assume by contradiction that aÂ := p(z0) â  0, then, expanding p(z) in powers of z â z0 we can write",
				"after": "When r is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for |p(z)| is strictly smaller than |a|, in contradiction to the definition of z0. (Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction Î¸0 such that if one approaches z0 from that direction one can obtain values p(z) smaller in absolute value than |p(z0)|.)",
