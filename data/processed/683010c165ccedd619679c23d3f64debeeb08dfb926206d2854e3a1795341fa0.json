The social context within which narcotic trafficking, storage, transportation, and repacking systems exist in Ghana and the state's location along the Gulf of Guinea within the Atlantic OceanÂ â only a few degrees north of the EquatorÂ â makes Ghana an attractive country for the narcotics business.[85][86]",
