				"previous": "As an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least a point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test if a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.",

				"During the last 20 years of 20th century, various algorithms have been introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity .",
				"Among these algorithms which solve a sub problem of the problems solved by GrÃ¶bner bases, one may cite testing if an affine variety is empty and solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions. Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries FaugÃ¨re's F4 and F5 algorithms have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity (probably because the evaluation of the complexity of GrÃ¶bner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has be done only in few special cases)."
