				"previous": "The party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of World WarÂ I. In 1918, a league called the Freien Arbeiterausschuss fÃ¼r einen guten Frieden (Free Workers' Committee for a good Peace)[27] was created in Bremen, Germany. On 7 March 1918, Anton Drexler, an avid German nationalist, formed a branch of this league in Munich called the \"Committee of Independent Workmen\".[28] Drexler was a local locksmith in Munich who had been a member of the militarist Fatherland Party[29] during World War I, and was bitterly opposed to the armistice of November 1918 and the revolutionary upheavals that followed. Drexler followed the typical views of militant nationalists of the day, such as opposing the Treaty of Versailles, having antisemitic, anti-monarchist and anti-Marxist views, as well as believing in the superiority of Germans whom nationalists claimed to be part of the Aryan \"master race\" (Herrenvolk), but he also accused international capitalism of being a Jewish-dominated movement and denounced capitalists for war profiteering in World War I.[30] Drexler saw the situation of political violence and instability in Germany as the result of the new Weimar Republic being out-of-touch with the masses, especially the lower classes.[30] Drexler emphasized the need for a synthesis of vÃ¶lkisch nationalism with a form of economic socialism, in order to create a popular nationalist-oriented workers' movement that could challenge the rise of Communism and internationalist politics.[31] These were all well-known themes popular with various Weimar paramilitary groups such as the Freikorps.",
				"after": "Though very small, Drexler's movement did receive attention and support from some influential figures. Supporter Dietrich Eckhart brought military figure Count Felix Graf von Bothmer, a prominent supporter of the concept of \"national socialism\", to address the movement.[32] Later in 1918, Karl Harrer (a journalist and member of the Thule Society), along with Drexler and several others formed the Politischer Arbeiterzirkel (Political Workers' Circle).[27] The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and racism directed against the Jews.[27] In December 1918, Drexler decided a new political party should be formed based on the political principles which he endorsed by combining his Committee of Independent Workmen with the Political Workers' Circle.[27][33]",
