				"after": "Since inception, Air India has been witnessing continuous growth in revenue passenger kilometres. Prior to the jet age in the 1960s, Air India flew mostly unscheduled flights and saw low numbers of traffic. As the airline introduced more scheduled flights, there was a small upward trend during the 60s. During the 70s, Air India introduced the Boeing 747, which carried more passengers over longer distances. During the period, RPKs rose to over 5000. As newer, more efficient aircraft like the Airbus A300, Airbus A310, the Airbus A320 and newer versions of the Boeing 747 were introduced, Air India quickly expanded its network and by the year 2000, it crossed the 10000 mark. Air India continued expanding its services by taking the delivery of different variants of the Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 777 aircraft. Air India introduced non-stop flights to North America, Europe and eastern Asia. Around the time of the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, air travel in India was gaining popularity, and by 2010, the traffic tripled to over 30000 RPKs.[76][77]",
