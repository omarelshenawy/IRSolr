				"after": "To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have cancellous bone in place of medullary cavities. This strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis.[77] Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front.[78] Since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy. Elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs, as the ulna and radius are fixed in pronation; the \"palm\" of the manus faces backward.[77] The pronator quadratus and the pronator teres are either reduced or absent.[79] The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or \"cushion pads\" beneath the manus or pes, which distribute the weight of the animal.[78] They appear to have a sesamoid, an extra \"toe\" similar in placement to a giant panda's extra \"thumb\", that also helps in weight distribution.[80] As many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.[13]",
