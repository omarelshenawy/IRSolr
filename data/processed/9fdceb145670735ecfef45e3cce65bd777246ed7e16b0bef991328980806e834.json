				"previous": "Financial problems and a reduction in tourism led to Norfolk Island's administration appealing to the Australian federal government for assistance in 2010. In return, the islanders were to pay income tax for the first time but would be eligible for greater welfare benefits.[11] However, by May 2013 agreement had not been reached and islanders were having to leave to find work and welfare.[12] An agreement was finally signed in March, 2015 to replace the self-government with a local council.[13]",
