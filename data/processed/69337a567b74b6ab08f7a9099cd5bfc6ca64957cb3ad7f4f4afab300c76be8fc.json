				"after": "Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene,[1] a braided river system called the \"Ancestral Rogue River\" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved.[2] For about 2.1 million years,[1] the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone.[2][3][4] Between 10 and 20 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley.[3] Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about 690 feet (210Â m) of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.[5]",
