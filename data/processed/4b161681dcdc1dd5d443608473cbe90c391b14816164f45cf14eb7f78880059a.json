				"after": "A Paleolithic culture around 30,000Â BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000Â BC (the start of the JÅmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture, who include ancestors of both the contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people,[19][20] characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[21] Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the JÅmon.[22] The Yayoi period, starting around 500Â BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming,[23] a new style of pottery,[24] and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.[25]",
