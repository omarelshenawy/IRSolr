				"previous": "The sea appears in human culture in contradictory ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous.[6](p10) It has its place in mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music.[288] The Ancients personified it, believing it to be under the control of a being who needed to be appeased. It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible,[289] Scylla in Greek mythology,[290] Isonade in Japanese mythology,[291] and the kraken of late Norse mythology.[292][293](pp206â208) The sea is especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the Sea of Galilee.",
				"after": "The sea, its life, and its ships have been depicted in art ranging from the simple drawings on the walls of caves outside Les Eyzies, France, to the early Christian ichthys to the Dutch Hendrik Vroom to Hokusai's ukiyo-e to seascapes by Winslow Homer. During the Golden Age of the Netherlands, artists such as Jan Porcellis, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son, and Ludolf Bakhuizen celebrated the sea and the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess.[294][295]",
