				"previous": "His big break came in 2000 when he won the Breeders' Cup Distaff aboard Spain; and in 2002, he won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes atop War Emblem.[2] Between 2000 and 2006 he averaged 193 wins a year and twice finished third in total earnings among jockeys.[2] However, his career entered a slump until he decided to refocus. As he explained, \"One day, I woke up and I said âThis is not how Iâm going to end up my career.\" He hired a new agent in January 2013, Brian Beach, and with a change in motivation[6] went on to obtain his 3,000th career win, aboard Flashy Delight, on May 31, 2013, at Betfair Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California.[7] After winning the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes on California Chrome, in June 2014 Espinoza traveled to Britain to win the Windsor Castle Stakes at the Royal Ascot meeting on the Wesley A. Ward-trained colt Hootenanny.[8]",
				"after": "Espinoza became the first jockey in history to get three opportunities to win the Triple Crown[1] and earned back-to-back wins with California Chrome and American Pharoah in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.",
