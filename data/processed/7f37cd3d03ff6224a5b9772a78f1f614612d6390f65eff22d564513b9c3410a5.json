				"previous": "Many of the numerous human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as they engage in a wide range of activities: some appear to enjoy sensory pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly at one with nature. In the middle of the background, a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the eroticism of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of spiritual transition or a playground of corruption.[36]",
				"after": "On the right-hand side of the foreground stand a group of three fair and one black-skinned figures. The fair-skinned figures, two males and one female, are covered from head to foot in light-brown body hair. Scholars generally agree that these hirsute figures represent wild or primeval humanity but disagree on the symbolism of their inclusion. Art historian Patrik ReuterswÃ¤rd, for example, posits that they may be seen as \"the noble savage\" who represents \"an imagined alternative to our civilized life\", imbuing the panel with \"a more clear-cut primitivistic note\".[38] Writer Peter Glum, in contrast, sees the figures as intrinsically connected with whoredom and lust.[39]",
