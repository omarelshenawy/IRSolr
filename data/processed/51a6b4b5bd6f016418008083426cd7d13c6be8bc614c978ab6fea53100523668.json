				"previous": "Efforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.[38]",
				"after": "Arms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.[36][38] In this way the Home Army was able to procure submachine guns (copies of British Stens, indigenous BÅyskawicas and KIS), pistols (Vis), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and Filipinka and SidolÃ³wka hand grenades).[36] Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort. The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.[36]",
