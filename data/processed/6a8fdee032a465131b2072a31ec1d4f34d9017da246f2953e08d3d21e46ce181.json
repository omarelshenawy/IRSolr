				"previous": "Only humans are recognized as persons and protected in law by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[b] The legal status of NHPs, on the other hand, is the subject of much debate, with organizations such as the Great Ape Project (GAP) campaigning to award at least some of them legal rights.[151] In June 2008, Spain became the first country in the world to recognize the rights of some NHPs, when its parliament's cross-party environmental committee urged the country to comply with GAP's recommendations, which are that chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gorillas are not be used for animal experiments.[152][153]",
				"after": "Many species of NHP are kept as pets by humans, the Allied Effort to Save Other Primates (AESOP) estimates that around 15,000 NHPs live as exotic pets in the United States.[154] The expanding Chinese middle class has increased demand for NHPs as exotic pets in recent years.[155] Although NHP import for the pet trade was banned in the U.S. in 1975, smuggling still occurs along the United States â Mexico border, with prices ranging from US$3000 for monkeys to $30,000 for apes.[156]",
