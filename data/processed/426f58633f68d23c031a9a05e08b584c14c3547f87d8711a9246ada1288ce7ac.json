				"Although it is illegal in some states,[37] capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the United States.[38]",
				"Capybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America.[35] The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas, while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein.[6] In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously gave a special dispensation that allows for its consumption while other meats are generally forbidden.[36]"
