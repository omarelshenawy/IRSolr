British historian Antony Beevor wrote in his history of the Civil War that Franco's ensuing \"white terror\" resulted in the deaths of 200,000 people and that the \"red terror\" killed 38,000.[219] Julius Ruiz contends that, \"Although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone, with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain\".[220]",
