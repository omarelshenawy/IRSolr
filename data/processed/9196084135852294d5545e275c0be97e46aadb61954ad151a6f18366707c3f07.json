				"previous": "In order to be free from suffering and stress, Theravadins believe that the defilements need to be permanently uprooted. Initially the defilements are restrained through mindfulness to prevent them from taking over mental and bodily action. They are then uprooted through internal investigation, analysis, experience and understanding of their true nature by using Jhana. This process needs to be repeated for each and every defilement. The practice will then lead the meditator to realize Nirvana.",
				"after": "The samatha meditation in TheravÄda is usually involved with the concepts of Kammaá¹­á¹­hÄna which literally stands for \"place of work\"; in this context, it is the \"place\" or object of concentration (PÄli: Ärammana) where the mind is at work. In samatha meditation, the mind is set at work concentrated on one particular entity. There are forty (40) such classic objects (entities) used in samatha meditation, which are termed Kammaá¹­á¹­hÄna. By acquiring a Kammaá¹­á¹­hÄna and practising samatha meditation, one would be able to attain certain elevated states of awareness and skill of the mind called Jhana. Practising samatha has samadhi (concentration) as its ultimate goal.",
