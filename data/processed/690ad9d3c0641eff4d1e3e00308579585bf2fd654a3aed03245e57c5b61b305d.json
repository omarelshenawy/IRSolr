				"previous": "Yttrium in the Solar System was created through stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly by the s-process (â72%), but also by the r-process (â28%).[23] The r-process consists of rapid neutron capture of lighter elements during supernova explosions. The s-process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars.[24]",
				"after": "Yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the nuclear fission of uranium occurring in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In terms of nuclear waste management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are 91Y and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51Â days and 64Â hours, respectively.[25] Though 90Y has the short half-life, it exists in secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (90Sr) with a half-life of 29Â years.[4]",
