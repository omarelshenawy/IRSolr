				"after": "Detroit was founded in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac as a fort, and its original name was Fort Ponchartrain du Detroit. The name was later shortened to Detroit during the French and Indian War. After the United States became a nation and Michigan Territory was established, Detroit became the capital of Michigan from 1805 to 1847. During the War of 1812, Detroit fell to the British in the Siege of Detroit, only to be returned after the war ended. Almost a century after this, the automobile industry expanded around Detroit, making it the automobile capital of the world.",
