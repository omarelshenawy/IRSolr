Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[17][18] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[19] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The developers initially considered \"10958\" as a short code, but later changed it to \"40404\" for \"ease of use and memorability.\"[20] Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST): \"just setting up my twttr\".[1] Dorsey has explained the origin of the \"Twitter\" title:",
