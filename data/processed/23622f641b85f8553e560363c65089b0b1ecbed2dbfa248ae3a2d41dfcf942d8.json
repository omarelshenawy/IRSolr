				"Kalitta Air operates a large repair facility at Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport in Iosco County, Michigan, United States.",
				"In 1997, AIA merged with Kitty Hawk Inc. and Conrad Kalitta resigned to start Kalitta Leasing for buying, selling and leasing large aircraft. In AprilÂ 2000 Kitty Hawk International (the former AIA) ceased operations. Kalitta decided to rescue it and the new airline, Kalitta Air, began operations in NovemberÂ 2000, using the operating certificate and assets of the former airline."

				"after": "The TV program Mythbusters featured one of Kalitta's BoeingÂ 747s (tail number N700CK) in EpisodeÂ 90: \"Supersized Mythsâ, that originally aired on NovemberÂ 14,Â 2007. In this myth the build team revisited the myth of \"Jet Taxi\", the story of a taxi that got stuck behind a jet taking off resulting in the taxi flipping over due to the jet blast. This myth was found to be confirmed, in that a jet could flip a taxi as well as a school bus and a light aircraft. Mythbusters featured another KalittaÂ AirÂ 747 in the Episode \"Storm Chasing Myths\" that originally aired on OctoberÂ 13,Â 2010.",
