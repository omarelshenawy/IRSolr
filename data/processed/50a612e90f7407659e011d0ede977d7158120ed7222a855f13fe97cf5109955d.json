				"previous": "Lumley engaged Michael Balfe to conduct the orchestra[39] and entered negotiations with Felix Mendelssohn for a new opera. Jenny Lind had made her English dÃ©but on 4 May 1847 in the role of Alice in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable, in the presence of the Royal family and the composer Felix Mendelssohn. Such was the press of people around the theatre that many \"arrived at last with dresses crushed and torn, and coats hanging in shreds, having suffered bruises and blows in the struggle\".[40] She performed for a number of acclaimed seasons at the theatre, interspersed with national tours, becoming known as the Swedish Nightingale.[40] The secession of the orchestra to Covent Garden was a blow, and the theatre closed in 1852, re-opening in 1856, when a fire closed its rival.[5] After the reopening, Lumley presented two more British premiÃ¨res of Verdi operas: La traviata in 1856 and Luisa Miller in 1858.[37]",
				"after": "From the early 1830s until the late 1840s, Her Majesty's Theatre played host to the heyday of the era of the romantic ballet, in which the ballet company, known as the Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre, was the most renowned troupe in Europe aside from the Ballet du ThÃ©Ã¢tre de l'AcadÃ©mie Royale de Musique. The great ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at the theatre in 1830. Lumley engaged him as Premier MaÃ®tre de Ballet (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842.[41] Among the works of ballet that he staged were Ondine, ou La NaÃ¯ade (1843), La Esmeralda (1844), and Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement Pas de Quatre (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant (1847) and Electra (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting).[41] Arthur Saint-LÃ©on staged such works as La VivandiÃ¨re (1844), Le Violin du Diable (1849), and Le Jugement de PÃ¢ris (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to Pas de Quatre.[41]",
