				"after": "Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies, and \"new economy\" Internet and technology companies, service, design and clean technology companies. The city's gross metropolitan product was $231Â billion in 2010, making it the 11th largest metropolitan economy in the United States.[113][114] The Port of Seattle, which also operates SeattleâTacoma International Airport, is a major gateway for trade with Asia and cruises to Alaska, and is the 8th largest port in the United States in terms of container capacity.[115] Though it was affected by the Great Recession, Seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy, and remains a hotbed for start-up businesses, especially in green building and clean technologies: it was ranked as America's No.Â 1 \"smarter city\" based on its government policies and green economy.[116] February 2010, the city government committed Seattle to becoming North America's first \"climate neutral\" city, with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.[117]",
