				"previous": "Saavedra increased his resistance to Moreno's proposals after the victory at the Battle of Suipacha, considering that the revolution had defeated its enemies and should relax its severity in consequence.[100] The Regiment of Patricians hosted a banquet celebration at the barracks, restricting attendance to the military and supporters of Saavedra. Moreno was not allowed to pass by the guards at the door, which generated a small incident.[101] That same night, Officer Atanasio Duarte, who was drunk, gave a crown of sugar to Saavedra's wife and saluted Saavedra as if he was the new king or emperor of the Americas.[102] The next day, when Moreno heard about the incident, he wrote the \"Honours Suppression decree\", which suppressed the ceremony usually reserved for the president of the Junta and inherited privileges of the office of viceroy.[102] Duarte was exiled, and Moreno's act was justified by stating that \"An inhabitant of Buenos Aires neither drunk nor asleep should be expressed against the freedom of his country\".[103] Saavedra signed the decree without complaint, but Gregorio Funes felt that the Patricians resented Moreno because of this.[104]",
				"after": "The conflicts between Moreno and Saavedra generated international reactions. Lord Strangford complained about the later actions of the Junta, such as the execution of Liniers, which were seen as more violent than the initial ones.[105] Brazil was also concerned because many copies of the Gazeta were being distributed at Rio Grande do Sul, influencing their slaves with libertarian ideas.[106][107] The Brazilian government sent Carlos JosÃ© Guezzi to Buenos Aires, with the purpose of mediating in the conflict with the royalists at Montevideo and to ratify the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to rule as regent.[106] He met Saavedra in his first interview, in July, and got a positive impression of him. Saavedra said that if Carlota's rights were confirmed by the Spanish monarchy, Buenos Aires would support her, even if it meant they had to stand against the other provinces.[108] The following month he requested a representative for the Court of Brazil, offered Carlota's mediation with Montevideo,[109] and pointed out that Brazil had forces near the frontier, awaiting orders to attack the revolution.[110] This time, Moreno resisted. Moreno rejected sending a representative,[111] and told him that the Junta did not work for the interests of Brazil, but for those of the United Provinces.[112] He rejected the mediation as well, considering that no mediation was possible under a military threat.[113] Guezzi was immediately sent back to Rio de Janeiro on the first available ship.[114] He described Moreno as \"the Robespierre of the day\",[107] and accused the Junta of attempting to build a republic.[107]",
