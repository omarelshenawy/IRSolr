				"Selenium shows borderline metalloid or nonmetal behaviour.[437][n 44]",
				"Its most stable form, the grey trigonal allotrope, is sometimes called \"metallic\" selenium because its electrical conductivity is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the red monoclinic form.[440] The metallic character of selenium is further shown by its lustre,[441] and its crystalline structure, which is thought to include weakly \"metallic\" interchain bonding.[442] Selenium can be drawn into thin threads when molten and viscous.[443] It shows reluctance to acquire \"the high positive oxidation numbers characteristic of nonmetals\".[444] It can form cyclic polycations (such as Se2+ 8) when dissolved in oleums[445] (an attribute it shares with sulfur and tellurium), and a hydrolysed cationic salt in the form of trihydroxoselenium (IV) perchlorate [Se(OH)3]+Â·ClOâ 4.[446]"
