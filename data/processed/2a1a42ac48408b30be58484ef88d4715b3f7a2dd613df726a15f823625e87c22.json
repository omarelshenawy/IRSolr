The outlines of the story are told in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, though the annals represent a West Saxon point of view.[73] On the day of Egbert's succession to the kingdom of Wessex, in 802, a Mercian ealdorman from the province of the Hwicce had crossed the border at Kempsford, with the intention of mounting a raid into northern Wiltshire; the Mercian force was met by the local ealdorman, \"and the people of Wiltshire had the victory\".[74] In 829 Egbert went on, the chronicler reports, to conquer \"the kingdom of the Mercians and everything south of the Humber\".[75] It was at this point that the chronicler chose to attach Egbert's name to Bede's list of seven overlords, adding that \"he was the eighth king who was Bretwalda\".[76] Simon Keynes suggests Egbert's foundation of a 'bipartite' kingdom is crucial as it stretched across southern England, and the created a working alliance between the West Saxon dynasty and the rulers of the Mercians.[77] In 860 the eastern and western parts of the southern kingdom were united by agreement between the surviving sons of King Ãthelwulf, though the union was not maintained without some opposition from within the dynasty; and in the late 870s King Alfred gained the submission of the Mercians under their ruler Ãthelred, who in other circumstances might have been styled a king, but who under the Alfredian regime was regarded as the 'ealdorman' of his people.",
