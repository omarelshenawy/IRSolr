				"previous": "The 310 series (the Model 318) also saw transatlantic service with Cubana de AviaciÃ³n starting in 1958, in spite of the Cuban Revolution the airline had a special accord with British aircraft manufacturers to maintain this model of aircraft.[51] In 1975 Cuban Britannias were used to transport hundreds of soldiers of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces to Angola in Operation Carlota, a proxy war.[52] Cubana de AviaciÃ³n continued using various Britannias until March 1990.[53]",
				"after": "Most aircraft were built by Bristol at Filton but 30 were built at Belfast by Short Brothers and Harland.[54][55] Due to the extended development instead of a projected production of 180 Britannias, only 80 were sold.[26] The negative experience with the development of the Britannia caused BOAC to be more cautious towards other British-made aircraft such as the Vickers VC-10.[56] Throughout the Britannia's lifespan, the engine icing condition remained a \"continual potential hazard\" that flight crews ultimately learned to manage with a \"high-lo\" flight regime that minimized the danger,[57] although the problems of the Britannia can mainly be linked to that of a manufacturer undertaking an innovative airframe design matched to an unproven engine, a design syndrome that remained particularly daunting. Squadron Leader David Berry who had 5,000 hours on the type characterised his experiences as flying \"Beauty and the Beast.\"[58] A more fitting epitaph was recently proffered by the editors of Aeroplane as the \"100 Great British Aircraft\" (2008) were analysed with the Bristol Britannia counted among the \"greats\".[59]",
