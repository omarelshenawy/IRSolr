				"previous": "By AprilÂ 1960Â (1960-04), the fleet included seven DC-3s, four Doves, and a Viscount 831.[14] The latter aircraft was used to resume operations to Asmara in DecemberÂ 1960Â (1960-12).[10] Aimed at replacing the DC-3s and the Doves in domestic and regional routes,[8]:91[15] the airline acquired three Fokker F27s in October that year;[10] these were delivered in early 1962,[16] with the first of them being deployed on domestic routes, making Sudan Airways the first African airline in operating the type.[10] Also in 1962, two Comet 4Cs were bought in May,[11] intended as a replacement of the Viscount service;[17] Sudan Airways had considered the acquisition of two jets for deployment on the â³Blue Nileâ³ route since the frequency on the service was increased to twice weekly in 1961.[10] The airline took delivery of the first Comet in NovemberÂ 1962Â (1962-11),[13] and the second aircraft of the type was delivered a month later.[10] Comets commenced flying the â³Blue Nileâ³ service in JanuaryÂ 1963Â (1963-01); that year, the frequency was again increased to operate three times a week. The â³Blue Nileâ³ service first served Frankfurt in MayÂ 1963Â (1963-05).[10] Also in 1963, a fourth Friendship was ordered.[18] In 1967, the company became a corporation run on a commercial basis;[19]:770 also, three Twin Otters were ordered as a replacement for the DC-3s.[10] The first of these aircraft joined the fleet in 1968;[19]:770 the second aircraft of the type delivered to the company was the 100th produced by de Havilland Canada.[20]",
				"after": "By MarchÂ 1970Â (1970-03), the route network totalled 12,872 miles (20,715Â km), with international destinations including Aden, Addis Ababa, Asmara, Athens, Beirut, Cairo, Entebbe, Fort Lamy, Jeddah, London, Nairobi and Rome. At this time, the fleet was composed of two Comet 4Cs, three DC-3s, four F-27s and three Twin Otters.[22] The last passenger DC-3 left the fleet in 1971.[23] In 1972, the Comets were put on sale and were replaced by two Boeing 707s leased from British Midland.[10][21][24] Sudan Airways ordered two Boeing 707-320Cs in 1973, for delivery in June and JulyÂ 1974Â (1974-07).[21] Pending delivery of two Boeing 737-200Cs ordered a year earlier,[25] the two Boeing 707-320Cs were part of the fleet by MarchÂ 1975Â (1975-03), along with five F-27s, three Twin Otters, and a single DC-3.[26]",
