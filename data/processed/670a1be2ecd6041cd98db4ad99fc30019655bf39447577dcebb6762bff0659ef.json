IalÃ¡ returned as the candidate for the PRS, claiming to be the legitimate president of the country, but the election was won by former president JoÃ£o Bernardo Vieira, deposed in the 1999 coup. Vieira beat Malam Bacai SanhÃ¡ in a runoff election. SanhÃ¡ initially refused to concede, claiming that tampering and electoral fraud occurred in two constituencies including the capital, Bissau.[23]",
