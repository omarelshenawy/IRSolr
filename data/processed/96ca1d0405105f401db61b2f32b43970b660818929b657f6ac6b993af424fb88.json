(For example, the first group is taught at a second grade level.)[86] Students are grouped within their class to allow each of them work at the level of their ability, and they may work several years beyond their current level if they can do so.[87] Students may join older groups to study subjects, which they are exceptionally advanced; however, age groups are usually kept together \"for social and emotional values\".[86] All middle school students complete a high school level honors course in mathematics in either algebra or geometry.[88]",
