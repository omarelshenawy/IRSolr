Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skillsâsuch as learning better storytelling techniques, for example, or learning how to effectively use humor as a communication toolâas well as continuous research in their topic area of focus.",
