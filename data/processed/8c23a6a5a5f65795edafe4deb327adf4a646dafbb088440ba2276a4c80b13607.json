				"previous": "The active constituents of this species are water soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies A.Â muscaria.[67] Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol.[68] According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.[69][70]",
				"after": "Muscarine, discovered in 1869,[71] was long thought to be the active hallucinogenic agent in A.Â muscaria. Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in Amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi[72] such as Inocybe erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa. The level of muscarine in A.Â muscaria is too low to play a role in the symptoms of poisoning.[73]",
