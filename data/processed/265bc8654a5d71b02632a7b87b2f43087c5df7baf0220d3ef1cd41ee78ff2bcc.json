				"after": "As with many Southern California rivers, the Santa Ana is heavily polluted and used. The main stem above Seven Oaks Dam is free flowing, as are many of its upper tributaries. Once the river enters the Inland Empire basin, however, much of its flow is diverted for municipal and agricultural water use. Most of the flow in the river below the city of San Bernardino consists of effluent from 45 wastewater treatment plants and dry season urban runoff, which is collected behind Prado Dam.[64] Any flow that makes it downstream to Orange County is diverted by another pair of dams into approximately 1,100 acres (4.5Â km2) of groundwater recharge basins, providing approximately 218,000 acre feet (269,000,000Â m3) of municipal water for the county every year, or one-third of its water supply.[65] Downstream of that dam, the river gathers further urban runoff before finally making it into the Pacific.[16] The Santa Ana River is included on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) list of \"304 (l) 'toxic hot spots' list of impaired waterways.\"[64]",
