				"after": "The sea appears in human culture in contradictory ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous.[6](p10) It has its place in mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music.[288] The Ancients personified it, believing it to be under the control of a being who needed to be appeased. It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible,[289] Scylla in Greek mythology,[290] Isonade in Japanese mythology,[291] and the kraken of late Norse mythology.[292][293](pp206â208) The sea is especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the Sea of Galilee.",
