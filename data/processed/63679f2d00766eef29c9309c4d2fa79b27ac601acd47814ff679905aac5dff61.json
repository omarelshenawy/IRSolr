				"previous": "Other magistracies in the Republic include tribunes, quaestors, aediles, praetors and censors.[31] The magistracies were originally restricted to patricians, but were later opened to common people, or plebeians.[32] Republican voting assemblies included the comitia centuriata (centuriate assembly), which voted on matters of war and peace and elected men to the most important offices, and the comitia tributa (tribal assembly), which elected less important offices.[33]",
				"after": "In the 4th century BC Rome had come under attack by the Gauls, now extending their power in the Italian peninsula beyond the Po Valley and through Etruria. On 16 July 390Â BC, a Gallic army under the leadership of a tribal chieftain named Brennus, met the Romans on the banks of the small Allia River just ten miles north of Rome. Brennus defeated the Romans, and the Gauls marched directly to Rome. Most Romans had fled the city, but some barricaded themselves upon the Capitoline Hill for a last stand. The Gauls looted and burned the city, then laid siege to the Capitoline Hill. The siege lasted seven months, the Gauls then agreed to give the Romans peace in exchange for 1,000 pounds (450Â kg) of gold.[34] (According to later legend, the Roman supervising the weighing noticed that the Gauls were using false scales. The Romans then took up arms and defeated the Gauls; their victorious general Camillus remarked \"With iron, not with gold, Rome buys her freedom.\")[35]",
