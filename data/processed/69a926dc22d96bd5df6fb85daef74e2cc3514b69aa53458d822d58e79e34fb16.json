				"previous": "Some companies provide web-based timesheet software or services that provide a means to track time for payroll, billing and project management. One of the major uses of timesheets in a project management environment is comparing planned costs versus actual costs,[1] as well as measuring employee performance, and identifying problematic tasks. This knowledge can drive corporate strategy as users stop performing or reassign unprofitable work.",
				"after": "Factory workers often have a \"time card\" and \"punch in\" by inserting their card into an automatic timestamp machine (called a time clock or bundy clock) when starting and ending their work shift.",
