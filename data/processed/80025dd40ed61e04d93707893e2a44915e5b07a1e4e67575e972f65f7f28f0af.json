				"after": "Michel Wibault, the French aircraft designer, had the idea to use vectored thrust for vertical take-off aircraft. This thrust came from four centrifugal compressors driven by a Bristol Orion turboprop, the exhaust from each could be directed by rotating the outlets.[4] Gordon Lewis initially planned an engine with two thrust vectors, driven by the compressor, with forward thrust from a conventional rear exhaust in his initial BE.52 design. The BE.52 design was built around a Bristol Siddeley Orpheus which through a shaft drove the first three stages of a Bristol Olympus engine which had inlet and outlets separate of those of the Orpheus. Work was overseen by Bristol Siddeley's Technical Director Stanley Hooker.",
