				"after": "The Edwards Committee was formed in 1967 to look at the future of British aviation. Its report (British Air Transport in the Seventies) published in May 1969 made a number of recommendations. One of them was that a \"second force\" airline should be formed from Britain's independent (not government-controlled) operators to expand the UK's airline capacity on short- and long-haul routes. This private airline would get preference to be the second licenced British operator on a given route. In exchange for routes from the state corporations the corporations were expected to gain presence on the second force's board.[1] Two British independents were specifically mentioned - Caledonian and BUA.[2] At the government's instigation Caledonian - a 10-year-old profitable charter operator - took over the older but financially troubled British United Airways. The resulting company was initially known as \"Caledonian/BUA\" before becoming \"British Caledonian Airways\".[3]",
