				"after": "During Roman times, there were many variations on the letter \"A\". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" mediums. For perishable surfaces, what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes, a cursive style was used. Due to the \"perishable\" nature of the surfaces, these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental. This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule. There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive. The known variants include the early semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.[5]",
