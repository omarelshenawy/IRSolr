				"previous": "In 1864, the leading members of the Manchester Cricket Club organised a meeting for the purpose of forming a club to represent the county; 13Â clubs were represented at the meeting and, on 12 January 1864, Lancashire County Cricket Club was created. The club was committed to playing matches in different parts of the county to \"introduceÂ ... cricket into every part of Lancashire\".[4]",
				"after": "The new clubâs first county match was played in 1865 at Old Trafford against Middlesex; Lancashire won the match by 62Â runs, although Middlesex bowler V. E. Walker took all ten wickets in Lancashireâs second innings. The early Lancashire side was reliant upon amateurs, which led to problems; although they were happy to play at Old Trafford, they were less willing to travel to away fixtures. During the early 1870s, the team was dominated by Monkey Hornbyâs batting. The teamâs standard of cricket improved with the arrival of two professional players, Dick Barlow and Alex Watson. The impact of Barlow and Hornby was such that their batting partnership was immortalised in the poem At Lordâs by Francis Thompson. The team was further enhanced by A. G. SteelÂ â an amateur considered second only to W. G. Grace as the countryâs best all rounderÂ â Johnny BriggsÂ â a professional from Sutton-in-Ashfield and the only player to score 10,000Â runs and take 1,000Â wickets for LancashireÂ â and wicket-keeper Dick PillingÂ â who in 1891 was rated by Wisden as the second-best wicket-keeper in the world behind Jack Blackham. As Lancashireâs consistency improved, so did their support: in 1878, 28,000 over three days watched Lancashire play Gloucestershire.[5]",
