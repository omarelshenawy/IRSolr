				"after": "The horseâhoarse merger (alternative name: northâforce merger) is the merger of the vowels /É/ and /o/ before historic /r/, making pairs of words like horse/hoarse, for/four, war/wore, or/oar, morning/mourning etc. homophones. This merger occurs in most varieties of English. In accents that have the merger horse and hoarse are both pronounced [hÉË(É¹)s], but in accents that do not have the merger hoarse is pronounced differently, usually [hoÉ¹s] in rhotic and [hoÉs] or the like in non-rhotic accents. Non-merging accents include Scottish English, Hiberno-English, the Boston accent, Southern American English, African American Vernacular English, most varieties of Caribbean English, and Indian English.[26][27]",
