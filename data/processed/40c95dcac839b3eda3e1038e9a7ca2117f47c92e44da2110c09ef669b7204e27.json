				"after": "The first recorded use of the term aviator (aviateur in French) was in 1887, as a variation of \"aviation\", from the Latin avis (meaning bird), coined in 1863 by G. de la Landelle in Aviation Ou Navigation AÃ©rienne (\"Aviation or Air Navigation\"). The term aviatrix (aviatrice in French), now archaic, was formerly used for a female aviator. These terms were used more in the early days of aviation, when airplanes were extremely rare, and connoted bravery and adventure. For example, a 1905 reference work described the Wright brothers' first airplane: \"The weight, including the body of the aviator, is a little more than 700 pounds\".[1]",
