				"after": "In 2012 the emperor penguin was uplisted from a species of least concern to near threatened by the IUCN.[1][43] Along with nine other species of penguin, it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US Endangered Species Act. The primary causes for an increased risk of species endangerment are declining food availability, due to the effects of climate change and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations. Other reasons for the species's placement on the Endangered Species Act's list include disease, habitat destruction, and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans. Of particular concern is the impact of tourism.[44] One study concluded that emperor penguin chicks in a crÃ¨che become more apprehensive following helicopter approach to 1,000Â m (3,281Â ft).[45]",
