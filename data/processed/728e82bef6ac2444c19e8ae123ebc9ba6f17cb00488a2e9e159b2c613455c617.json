				"after": "Following a long period of uneventful development flying trials and the fitting of a modified Proteus 765 series engine that greatly reduced breakdowns, a full Certificate of Airworthiness was awarded at the end of 1955.[27] The first two Model 102s were delivered to BOAC on 30 December 1955 for crew training.[37] The Model 102 began scheduled service on 1 February 1957 with a BOAC flight from London to Johannesburg,[38] flights to Sydney following in March and to Tokyo in July. By August 1957, the first 15 Model 102 aircraft had been delivered to BOAC.[39] The last 10 aircraft of the order were built as Series 300 aircraft for transatlantic flights.[39] In April 1959, a Model 102 Britannia was leased by BOAC to Ghana Airways for flights between Accra and London, and several more Britannias were purchased by the airline in the early 1960s.[40] The Model 102 was eventually made available to other BOAC associates, including Cathay Pacific, Central Africa, East African, Nigeria and Malayan airlines.[41]",
