				"previous": "The second season of Hannah Montana premiered on April 23, 2007, and ran until October 12, 2008.[49] Shortly afterwards, Cyrus signed a four-album deal with Disney-owned Hollywood Records.[50] The double-disc record Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus was released on June 26, 2007;[51] the first disc served as the soundtrack to the second season of Hannah Montana, while the second acted as Cyrus's debut studio album. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 326,000 copies.[52] It was later certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[53] The project spawned Cyrus's debut single as herself, \"See You Again\", which became her first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[54] It was eventually certified Platinum in the country, making it her first single to be RIAA certified.[55] The track also had success in countries such as Australia and Canada, where it also peaked inside of the Top 10.[56][57] The follow-up single \"Start All Over\" was released in early 2008; it failed to match the success of its predecessor, debuting and peaking at number 68 on the Hot 100.[58][59] Numerous songs from the Hannah Montana portion of the album charted worldwide following its release.[60]",
				"after": "During the fall of 2007, the Best of Both Worlds Tour was launched to promote the joint album. With the Jonas Brothers, Aly & AJ, and Everlife as her opening acts, Cyrus toured from October 17, 2007, to January 31, 2008, with stops in the United States and Canada.[61] Tickets sold out in minutes and were scalped for up to $2,500 and an average of $214, well above their $26â$65 face value.[62] A Ticketmaster official commented that \"there [hadn't] been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis.\"[63] Upon the conclusion of the tour in January 2008, Walt Disney Pictures released Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, a 3D concert film of the tour, on February 1, 2008, for what was expected to be a one-week run. The film earned over $31 million[64] at the box office and an average of $42,000 per theater, twice the expected total, convincing Disney executives to extend the release for an indefinite run.[65] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records on April 15, 2008.[66]",
