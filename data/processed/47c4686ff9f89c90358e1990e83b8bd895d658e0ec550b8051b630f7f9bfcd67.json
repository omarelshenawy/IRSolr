The Cobra Ball monitors missile-associated signals and tracks missiles during boost and re-entry phases to provide reconnaissance for treaty verification and theater ballistic missile proliferation. The aircraft are extensively modified C-135Bs.[4] The right wing and engines are traditionally painted black on Cobra Ball aircraft.[18]",
