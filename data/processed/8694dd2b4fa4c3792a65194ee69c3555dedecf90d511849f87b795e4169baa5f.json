				"after": "The existence of witches and demonic forces was taken for granted by the American colonistsâwitchcraft was considered the work of the Devil.[14][15][16] Strange behaviors supposedly identified witches to the colonists.[17] As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the Jamestown colony, a grand jury sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witchâshe had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record of the outcome is extant.[18] Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience the type of mass hysteria evidenced by the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials in 1692â1693, where 19Â people were executed on allegations of sorcery, several years before the first accusations against Sherwood.[13] Ecclesiastical influence in Virginian courts was much less than in those of New EnglandâVirginia's clergy participated little in witchcraft accusations and trials, unlike their New England counterparts.[19] New England's Puritans had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, scattered over a large area.[20]",
