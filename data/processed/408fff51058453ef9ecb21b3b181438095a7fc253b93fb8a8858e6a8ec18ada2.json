				"previous": "Citing the need to also protect scenery and provide for public enjoyment, railroads and local businesses urged the creation of a national park in hopes of increased tourism. On MarchÂ 2, 1899, President William McKinley established Mount Rainier National Park as America's fifth national park. Congress dedicated the new park \"for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\"[55] andÂ \"... for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition.\"[56]",
				"after": "In 1998, the United States Geological Survey began putting together the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System to assist in the emergency evacuation of the Puyallup River valley in the event of a catastrophic debris flow. It is now run by the Pierce County Department of Emergency Management. Tacoma, at the mouth of the Puyallup, is only 37Â mi (60Â km) west of Rainier, and moderately sized towns such as Puyallup and Orting are only 27 and 20Â mi (43 and 32Â km) away, respectively.[57]",
