Recent missile types provide a much greater ability to pursue a target regardless of the launch orientation, called \"High Off-Boresight\" capability. Sensors use combined radio frequency and infra red (SAIRST) to continually track nearby aircraft while the pilot's helmet-mounted display system (HMDS) displays and selects targets; the helmet system replaces the display-suite-mounted head-up display used in earlier fighters.[342]",
