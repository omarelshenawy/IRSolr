				"previous": "In the meantime, Miller earned the further ire of his CO by flying unauthorised leisure flights. Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work.[142] Thus, the CO ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire. With one functional engine, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded.[108] The plane broke apart and caught fire, but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later.[108][143][144]",
				"after": "The next day, Miller headed to Lord's to play for the RAAF against the South of England. Chasing 208, Miller scored an unbeaten 78 in 95 minutes, but rain washed out the match.[132][145] In the first innings of Third Victory Test at Lord's,[146] when finally called upon to bowl, Miller measured out a run-up[147][148] and removed John Dewes, Donald Carr and Hutton, all bowled. He ended with 3/44.[147][148][149] Miller was rewarded with the new ball in the second innings. He removed Dewes, Edrich and Dick Pollard to end with 3/42.[150] This left Australia a target of 225. Miller saw Australia to the target, unbeaten on 71.[139][147][148][150][151] In the Fourth Test, again at Lord's, Miller scored 118 in the first innings,[147][152][153][154] before an unbeaten 25 in the second innings ensured a draw.[147][155] The tremendous public reception of the Victory Tests resulted in a fifth match being added to the schedule.[156]",
