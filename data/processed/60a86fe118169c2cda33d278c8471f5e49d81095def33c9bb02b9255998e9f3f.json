				"after": "Although there were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan after the end of World WarÂ II, South Korea and Japan signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties. There is heavy anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea because of a number of unsettled Japanese-Korean disputes, many of which stem from the period of Japanese occupation after the Japanese annexation of Korea. During World WarÂ II, more than 100,000 Koreans served in the Imperial Japanese Army.[110][111] Korean women were forced to the war front to serve the Imperial Japanese Army as sexual slaves, called comfort women.[112][113][114][115]",
