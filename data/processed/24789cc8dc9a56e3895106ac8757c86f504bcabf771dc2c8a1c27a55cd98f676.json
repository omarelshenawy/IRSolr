The cat is believed to mate throughout the year in the wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful.[41] Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity.[42] Female estrus is 6â17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization.[41] Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship.",
