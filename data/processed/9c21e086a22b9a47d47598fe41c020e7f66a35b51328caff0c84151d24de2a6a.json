				"after": "The rapid collapse of porbeagle stocks on both sides of the North Atlantic is often cited as archetypal of the \"boom and bust\" pattern of most shark fisheries. Factors including a small litter size, long maturation time, and the capture of multiple age classes all contribute to this shark's susceptibility to overfishing.[50] The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the porbeagle globally as Vulnerable,[1] Endangered in the western North Atlantic (including the Baltic),[47][51] and Critically Endangered in the eastern North Atlantic[46] and Mediterranean Sea.[52]",
