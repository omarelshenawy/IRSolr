				"When a maximum of Pâf occurs at xi, then",
				"To prove this is true in general, suppose P is a polynomial of degree N having the property described, that is, it gives rise to an error function that has NÂ +Â 2 extrema, of alternating signs and equal magnitudes. The red graph to the right shows what this error function might look like for NÂ =Â 4. Suppose Q(x) (whose error function is shown in blue to the right) is another N-degree polynomial that is a better approximation to f than P. In particular, Q is closer to f than P for each value xi where an extreme of Pâf occurs, so"

				"And when a minimum of Pâf occurs at xi, then",
				"So, as can be seen in the graph, [P(x)Â âÂ f(x)]Â âÂ [Q(x)Â âÂ f(x)] must alternate in sign for the NÂ +Â 2 values of xi. But [P(x)Â âÂ f(x)]Â âÂ [Q(x)Â âÂ f(x)] reduces to P(x)Â âÂ Q(x) which is a polynomial of degree N. This function changes sign at least N+1 times so, by the Intermediate value theorem, it has N+1 zeroes, which is impossible for a polynomial of degree N."
