				"after": "Panama has a tropical climate. Temperatures are uniformly highâas is the relative humidityâand there is little seasonal variation. Diurnal ranges are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be 24Â Â°C (75.2Â Â°F) and the afternoon maximum 30Â Â°C (86.0Â Â°F). The temperature seldom exceeds 32Â Â°C (89.6Â Â°F) for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the Cordillera de Talamanca in western Panama.",
