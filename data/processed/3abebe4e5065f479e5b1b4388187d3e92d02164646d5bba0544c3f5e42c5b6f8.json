				"after": "In 1886, Lord Hawke became full-time captain of the Yorkshire team. One of his first actions, with the support of the Yorkshire committee, was to sack Peate early in the 1887 season.[23] At the time, many professional cricketers drank heavily and the Yorkshire team had many players who liked alcohol.[notes 1][24] Peate had been the chief offender for some years, and while he remained Yorkshire's leading left-arm spinner, his disruptive influence and disregard for authority was having a negative influence on the team. The historian Mick Pope suggests that Hawke may have felt able to act as he knew that Peel was available as a replacement.[23] With Peate unavailable, Peel began to play a leading role.[8] In the 1887 season, a year in which good weather produced conditions generally in favour of batsmen,[9] he took 85 wickets at an average of 17.32.[7] He also improved his record with the bat, scoring 835 runs at 25.30.[11] According to his Wisden obituary, he recorded at least two match-winning performances that season: against Kent he took five for 14 and scored 43 runs in a low-scoring game; in the match against Leicestershire he took eleven wickets for 51.[notes 2][8] Twice in 1887, Peel appeared for the professional Players in their prestigious match against the Gentlemen, the first time he had been selected for the team.[5] He played regularly for them until 1897.[8]",
