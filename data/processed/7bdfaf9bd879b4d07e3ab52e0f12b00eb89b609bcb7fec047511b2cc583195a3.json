				"previous": "The Raft of the Medusa was first shown at the 1819 Paris Salon, under the generic title ScÃ¨ne de Naufrage (Scene of Shipwreck), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers.[27] GÃ©ricault's Raft was the star at the Salon of 1819: \"It strikes and attracts all eyes\" (Le Journal de Paris). Louis XVIII visited the Salon three days before the opening, and reportedly said \"Monsieur, vous venez de faire un naufrage qui n'en est pas un pour vous\",[46] freely translated as \"Monsieur GÃ©ricault, your shipwreck is certainly no disaster\".[47] Critics were divided: the horror and \"terribilitÃ \" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a \"pile of corpses,\" whose realism they considered a far cry from the \"ideal beauty\" incarnated by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea (which triumphed the same year). GÃ©ricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of GÃ©ricault, was categorical: \"Monsieur GÃ©ricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.\" The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal who praised its political theme, its liberal position (the advancement of the \"negro\", the critique of ultra-royalism), and its modernity. For French historian Jules Michelet, \"our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa\".[3]",
				"after": "The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 individual paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. The contemporary critic Frank Anderson Trapp suggested that the volume of work shown and the sheer scale of the event indicates the ambition behind the exhibition. Trapp notes that the fact that \"100 grandiose history paintings [were included] in itself proclaimed a munificent government patronage\", for aside from a few affluent competitors like GÃ©ricault, only those favoured by a major commission could afford the outlay of time, energy and money necessary for undertakings of this kind.[7]",
