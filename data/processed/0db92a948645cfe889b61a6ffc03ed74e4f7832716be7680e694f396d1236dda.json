				"previous": "Nintendo has stated that the official plural form is \"Wii systems\" or \"Wii consoles.\"[36] The Nintendo Style Guide refers to the console as \"simply Wii, not Nintendo Wii\",[37] making it the first home console Nintendo has marketed outside Japan without the company name in its trademark.[38]",
				"after": "On September 14, 2006 Nintendo announced release information for Japan, North and South America, Oceania, Asia and Europe including dates, prices, and projected unit-distribution figures. It was announced that the majority of the 2006 shipments would be allotted to the Americas, and 33 titles would be available at its launch.[39] The Wii was launched in the United States on November 19, 2006 for $249.99,[2] and was later launched in the United Kingdom on December 8, 2006 for Â£179.[3] The United Kingdom experienced a widespread shortage of Wii units in many High-Street and online stores, and was unable to fulfill all pre-orders at its release.[40] The Wii was launched in South Korea on April 26, 2008[41] and Taiwan on July 12, 2008.[42]",
