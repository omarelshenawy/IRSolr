In the United States, the forefather of project management is Henry Gantt, called the father of planning and control techniques, who is famously known for his use of the \"bar\" chart as a project management tool, for being an associate of Frederick Winslow Taylor's theories of scientific management, and for his study of the work and management of Navy ship building. His work is the forerunner to many modern project management tools including the work breakdown structure (WBS) and resource allocation.",
