				"after": "The 767-200ER was the first extended-range model and entered service with El Al in 1984.[41] The type's increased range is due to an additional center fuel tank and a higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of up to 395,000 pounds (179,000Â kg).[40][42] The type was originally offered with the same engines as the 767-200, while more powerful Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and General Electric CF6 engines later became available.[40] The 767-200ER was the first 767 to complete a non-stop transatlantic journey, and broke the flying distance record for a twinjet airliner on April 17, 1988 with an Air Mauritius flight from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Port Louis, Mauritius, covering a distance of 8,727 nautical miles (16,162Â km).[3] The 767-200ER has been acquired by international operators seeking smaller wide-body aircraft for long-haul routes such as New York to Beijing.[3][42] Deliveries of the type totaled 121 with no unfilled orders.[1] As of July 2014, 42 examples of passenger and freighter conversion versions were in airline service.[121] The type's competitors included the Airbus A300-600R and the A310-300.[46]",
