				"previous": "In the early 1960s, the fleet of Aeronaves de MÃ©xico (AeromÃ©xico) included Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-6, and Bristol Britannia aircraft. Starting in 1961, \"Aeronaves\" began replacing its piston-engined planes with new jets. The first jet-engined aircraft were a pair of Douglas DC-8's. The planes were used on routes within Mexico and to New York City. Between 1962 and 1963, Aeronaves de MÃ©xico (AeromÃ©xico) took over AerovÃ­as Guest Mexico the second airline, and they were merged under the name Aeronaves de MÃ©xico. Later in the 1960s, more DC-8's were added and service to Europe was resumed, operated by two Comet-4C aircraft dry-leased by AerovÃ­as Guest prior to the merger.",
				"after": "The 1970s brought dramatic changes for AeromÃ©xico. In 1970, under a government plan, Mexican domestic airlines were nationalized into an integrated air transport system under the control of Aeronaves de MÃ©xico. The system included eight smaller carriers, although these were later disbanded.[11] During the early-1970s, the remaining Douglas DC-6 and Bristol Britannia aircraft were retired. A new color scheme (orange and black) was introduced and the airline changed its name from \"Aeronaves de MÃ©xico\" to its current, shortened version of AeromÃ©xico in February 1972.",
