The Old High German documents from the area of Bavaria are identified as Altbairisch (\"Old Bavarian\"), even though at this early date there are no distinctive features that would divide it from Alemannic. The dialectal separation of Upper German into East Upper German (Bavarian) and West Upper German (Alemannic) becomes more tangible in the Middle High German period, from about the 12th century.",
