				"previous": "Domery then enlisted with the French Revolutionary Army,[7] and shocked his new comrades with his unusual eating habits and voracious appetite.[2] Granted double rations, and using his pay to buy additional food whenever possible,[2] he nonetheless remained voraciously hungry; while based in an army camp near Paris, Domery ate 174 cats in a single year, leaving only the skins and bones, and ate 4 to 5 pounds (1.8 to 2.3Â kg) of grass each day if other food was unavailable.[2][10]",
				"after": "He preferred raw meat to cooked; while his favourite dish was a raw bullock's liver, he would eat any available meat.[3] While in service on board the French frigate Hoche,[11] a sailor's leg was shot off by cannon fire, and Domery grabbed the severed limb and began to eat it until a crew member wrestled it from him and threw it into the sea.[10][12][note 3]",
