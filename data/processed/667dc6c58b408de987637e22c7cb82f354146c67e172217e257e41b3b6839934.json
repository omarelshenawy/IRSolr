				"Panama's wildlife holds the most diversity of all the countries in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as North American wildlife.",
				"The highest point in the country is the VolcÃ¡n BarÃº, which rises to 3,475 metres (11,401Â ft). A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia where Colombian guerrilla and drug dealers are operating with hostage-taking. This and forest protection movements create a break in the Pan-American Highway, which otherwise forms a complete road from Alaska to Patagonia."
