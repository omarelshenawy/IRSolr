				"after": "In August 1915, the Munich medallist and sculptor Karl X. Goetz (1875â1950), who had produced a series of propagandist and satirical medals as a running commentary on the war, privately struck a small run of medals as a limited-circulation satirical attack (fewer than 500 were struck) on the Cunard Line for trying to continue business as usual during wartime. Goetz blamed both the British government and the Cunard Line for allowing the Lusitania to sail despite the German embassy's warnings.[63] Popular demand led to many unauthorised copies being made.",
