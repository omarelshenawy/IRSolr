W. Julian argued to the contrary, that continued production of the dollar had little to do with trade with the Orient (where goods were paid for in silver), suggesting instead that the coins were sent to the West for use there.[36] However, although the Mint's Engraving Department sent dies for the dollar to the San Francisco facility repeatedly from 1858 on, the California mint used them only once before 1870, striking 20,000 dollars in 1859, a year in which 255,700 were struck at Philadelphia and 360,000 at New Orleans. Production at New Orleans was disrupted after 1860 by the Civil War; it did not strike silver dollars again until 1879, after the end of the Seated Liberty series.[24][37][38] After the outbreak of the war in 1861, inflationary greenbacks were introduced, and precious-metal coins vanished from circulation.[39][40] In April 1863, new Mint Director James Pollock argued that the silver dollar be eliminated, noting in a letter that the coin \"no longer enters into our monetary system. The few pieces made are for Asiatic and other foreign trade and are not seen in circulation.\"[39]",
