				"after": "Because the islands of Hawaii are distant from other land habitats, life is thought to have arrived there by wind, waves (i.e. by ocean currents) and wings (i.e. birds, insects, and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers). This isolation, in combination with the diverse environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates, and arid shorelines), produced an array of endemic flora and fauna. Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state.[48] One endemic plant, Brighamia, now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct.[49] The two species of BrighamiaâB. rockii and B. insignisâare represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants. To ensure these plants set seed, biologists rappel down 3,000-foot (910Â m) cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas.[50]",
