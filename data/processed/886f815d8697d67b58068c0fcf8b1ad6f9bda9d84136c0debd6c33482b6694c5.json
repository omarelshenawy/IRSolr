				"after": "The mild seas that surround Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per yearÂ â this is far below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost.[44][48] Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year;[49] almost all winters have one day or less with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it almost never settles on the groundâcoastal areas in South West England such as Portland experience the mildest winters in the UK.[50] Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year,[51][D] and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9b.[52][E]",
