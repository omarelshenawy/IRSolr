				"previous": "ANA's earliest ancestor was Nippon Helicopter and Aeroplane (æ¥æ¬ããªã³ãã¿ã¼è¼¸é, Nippon HerikoputÄ YusÅ?), an airline company founded on 27 December 1952.[8] Nippon Helicopter was the source of what would later be ANA's IATA airline code, NH.[9]",
				"after": "NH began helicopter services in February 1953. On 15 December 1953, it operated its first cargo flight between Osaka and Tokyo using a de Havilland Dove, JA5008.[8] This was the first scheduled flight flown by a Japanese pilot in postwar Japan. Passenger service on the same route began on 1 February 1954, and was upgraded to a de Havilland Heron in March.[10] In 1955, Douglas DC-3s began flying for NH as well,[8] by which time the airline's route network extended from northern KyÅ«shÅ« to Sapporo.",
