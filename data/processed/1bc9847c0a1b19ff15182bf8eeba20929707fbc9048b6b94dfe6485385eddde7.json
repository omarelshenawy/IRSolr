				"after": "MIT's School of Architecture, now the School of Architecture and Planning, was the first in the United States,[109] and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings.[110][111] The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the \"Maclaurin buildings\" after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete, a first for a non-industrial â much less university â building in the US.[112] Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s,[112] and features the Pantheon-esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where commencement is held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers.[b] The imposing Building 7 atrium along Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus.[94]",
