				"previous": "In the February 1991 edition of Electronic Learning, Robert McCarthy wrote: \"Teachers, educational administrators and software developers are enthusiastic about the new, lower cost Apple Macintosh computers\".[27] Steve Taffe, manager of instructional strategy at MECC, a developer and publisher of educational software, explained his excitement about the Classic: \"[it] is terrific â both because it's a Mac and because of that low price. Everyone can now afford a Macintosh.\"[27] Scholastic, an education software developer, was also confident of Apple's ability to compete with MS-DOS machines, stating: \"They are just as cost-effective and as powerful as MS-DOS computers, but the Apples will have a superior comfort-level.\"[27] Sue Talley, Apple's manager of strategic planning in education, said of the Classic: \"we see it going into applications where you need a fair number of powerful stations, but where color is not a big issue.\"[27] Talley mentioned that it was most suited for writing labs and other basic productivity uses.[27] Many schools decided not to buy Classics because of the lack of a color monitor, an option which the higher priced Macintosh LC had.[27]",
