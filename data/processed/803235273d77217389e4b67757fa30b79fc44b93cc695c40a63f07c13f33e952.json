				"after": "Badminton is a sport for two or four people. In this way, either the game consists of one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players. Badminton was considered an Olympic sport since 1989. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net.The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back before it hits the floor. Also the aim is for the shuttlecock not to land outside the court. Every time this is done, the player or pair gets one point, if they were serving. If the other team was serving, the first team gets to serve. The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a game. The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets. In both singles and doubles, there is a change of service when the server loses a point. In doubles, the first team to serve has one player serve. All other times, both players on the team serve.",
