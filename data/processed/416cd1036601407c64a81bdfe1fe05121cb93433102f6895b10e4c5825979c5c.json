She sang the song by pairing up with the fictional animated band Gorillaz.[77] The band appeared on the stage via a three dimensional technique which projected their holograms on the stage.[77] They performed their song \"Feel Good Inc.\" while rappers De La Soul made a guest appearance.[78] Madonna then appeared on the stage and started performing the song while interchanging places with the hologram figures of the band.[79] She was later joined by her own group of dancers and the performance was finished on the main stage rather than the virtual screen.[78] Another performance of \"Hung Up\" came on April 30, 2006 during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.[80]",
