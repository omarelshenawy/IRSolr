				"previous": "Early flight trials, however, showed the qualities of a turboprop, resulting in a February 1949 order from the Ministry of Supply for a prototype of a stretched version with more powerful engines, the Type 700.[13] Meanwhile, the first prototype Type 630 was awarded a restricted Certificate of Airworthiness on 15 September 1949,[14] followed by a full certificate on 27 July 1950, which allowed the aircraft to be placed into service with BEA on 29 July to familiarise the pilots and ground crew with the new aircraft. It flew scheduled flights between London and Paris, and London and Edinburgh for a month.[15] The 29 July flight between Northolt and Paris â Le Bourget Airport with 14 paying passengers was the first scheduled airline flight by any turbine-powered aircraft.[16]",
				"after": "The second prototype Viscount, the Type 663 testbed, had two Rolls-Royce Tay turbojet engines and first flew in RAF markings as VX217 at Wisley on 15 March 1950.[17] It was demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September and was later used in the development of powered controls for the Valiant bomber.[14] It later saw use as a test bed by Boulton Paul Ltd for the development of electronic flight control systems.[18][19]",
