				"after": "A bachelor, Marshall left virtually all of his $1.5Â million estate (equivalent to $25 million today) to three causes dear to him: socialism, civil liberties and wilderness preservation.[14] Three trusts were established in his will. The first, focused on education related to \"the theory of production for use and not for profit\", received half of his estate; the second, aimed at \"safeguarding and advancement of the cause of civil liberties\", received one-quarter of his estate; and the third supported \"preservation of the wilderness conditions in outdoor America\", establishing what became the Robert Marshall Wilderness Fund. Trustees of the latter trust included Robert Sterling Yard, Bob Marshall's brother George, Irving Clark, Olaus Murie and Bill Zimmerman, early leaders of The Wilderness Society.[70] He left money to only one individual: $10,000 (equivalent to $167,541 today) to his old friend and guide, Herb Clark.[3]",
