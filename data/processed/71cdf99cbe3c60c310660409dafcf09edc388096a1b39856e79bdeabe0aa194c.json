A vertical armor bulkhead was fitted inside the main turrets, and the secondary battery of 4.7Â in (120Â mm) guns was reduced from 22 to 12; five guns in casemates were removed from each side. A few modern AA guns were fitted: two 3\"/50 caliber guns from Bethlehem Steel were added on the aft superstructure, 37Â mm (1.5Â in) guns were added near each turret, and 3-pounder guns were removed from the tops of turrets.[49]",
