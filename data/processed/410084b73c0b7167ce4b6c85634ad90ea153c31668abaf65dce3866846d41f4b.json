				"after": "By 1975, Applewhite and Nettles had taken the names \"Bo\" and \"Peep\".[51] They had about 70Â followers and saw themselves as shepherds tending a flock.[75] Applewhite believed that complete separation from Earthly desires was a prerequisite of ascension to the Next Level and emphasized passages in the New Testament in which Jesus spoke about forsaking worldly attachments.[76] Members were consequently instructed to renounce friends, family, media, drugs, alcohol, jewelry, facial hair, and sexuality.[51] Furthermore, they were required to adopt biblical names. Applewhite and Nettles soon told them to adopt two-syllable names that ended in \"ody\" and had three consonants in the first syllable,[77] such as Rkkody, Jmmody, and Lvvody;[78] Applewhite stated that these names emphasized that his followers were spiritual children.[77] Applewhite, Nettles, and their followers lived what religious scholar James Lewis describes as a \"quasi-nomadic lifestyle.\"[25] They usually stayed at remote campgrounds and did not speak about their beliefs.[79] Applewhite and Nettles ceased having public meetings in April 1975,[41] and spent little time teaching doctrine to their converts.[80] The leaders also had little contact with their dispersed followers, many of whom renounced their allegiance.[51]",
