				"previous": "French colonial rule began in 1896 and introduced a number of innovations to local cuisines. Certain new food names derived from the French languageâthen the dominant language of the state[33]âbecame widespread. Baguettes were popularized among cosmopolitan urbanites, as were a variety of French pastries and desserts such as cream horns, mille-feuille, croissants and chocolat chaud (hot chocolate). The French also introduced foie gras, now produced locally,[34] and popularized a dish known in the highlands as composÃ©: a cold macaroni salad mixed with blanched vegetables based on the French macÃ©doine de lÃ©gumes.[35] The French established plantations for the cultivation of a variety of cash crops, including not only those already exploited in the 19thÂ century, but new foreign fruits, vegetables and livestock, with varying degrees of success. Tea, coffee, vanilla, coconut oil and spices became successful exports.[36] Coconut became a regular ingredient in coastal cuisine, and vanilla began to be used in sauces for poultry and seafood dishes.[37]",
				"after": "Although a handful of Chinese settlers had arrived in Madagascar towards the end of the reign of Queen Ranavalona III, the first major influx of Chinese migrants followed an announcement by General Joseph Gallieni, first governor general of the colony of Madagascar, requesting 3,000Â Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and Toamasina.[38] Chinese migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities, including riz cantonais (Chinese fried rice), soupe chinoise (Chinese-style noodle soup), misao (fried noodles), pao (hum bao)[39] and nems (fried egg rolls).[40]",
