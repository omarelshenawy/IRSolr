Test matches are played between national representative teams with \"Test status\", as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which often lasts up to five days. It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance.[1][2][3] The origin of the name Test stems from the long, gruelling match being a \"test\" of the relative strength of the two sides.[4]",
