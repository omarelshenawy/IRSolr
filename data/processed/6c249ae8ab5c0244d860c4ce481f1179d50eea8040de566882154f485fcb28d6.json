				"previous": "AeroRepÃºblica started operations in June 1993, with Boeing 727-100 aircraft painted with the yellow, blue, and red colors of the flag of Colombia, initially flying from BogotÃ¡ to cities of the Colombian coast, such as Santa Marta, Cartagena, and San AndrÃ©s. Service to Santa Marta was especially successful, gaining honorable mention by the mayor of the city, and the government of Magdalena.",
				"after": "AeroRepÃºblica continued to expand domestically, reaching to new cities, such as Cali, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla, MonterÃ­a, and Leticia, among others. Just as in Santa Marta, in Leticia, AeroRepÃºblica's arrival resulted in a drop in airline prices that was very important at the time.[citation needed] Alongside all this, the airline changed its aging and obsolete fleet of 727-100 aircraft for second-hand McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-30 ex-charter aircraft from Continental Airlines and Alitalia.",
