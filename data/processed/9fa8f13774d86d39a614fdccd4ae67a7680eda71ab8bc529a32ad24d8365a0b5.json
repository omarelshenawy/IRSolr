				"after": "The castle, still unfinished at the time of Thomas' execution, and its lands, remained as crown property until it was bestowed on Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, Earl Thomas' brother, in 1327.[1][9] In turn, it passed to Henry's son, the fourth earl, who became the first Duke of Lancaster. At the time of the duke's death in 1361, his constable was Ingram Fauconer, who received an annual life stipend of Â£10, a further Â£5 going to his wife. Henry's heiress was Blanche, wife of John of Gaunt.[7][b] Duke John confirmed Fauconer's pension when he came into possession of the Lancastrian lands.[7]",
