The district of Wythenshawe is to the southeast. Sale is in the Mersey Valley, about 100 feet (30Â m) above sea level on generally flat ground. The River Mersey, which runs just north of the town,[2] is prone to flooding during heavy rains, so the Sale Water Park, close to the town's northern boundary, acts as an emergency flood basin.[46] The man-made, and thus more controllable, Bridgewater Canal runs through the centre of the town.",
