				"After 1781, without a Jewish community using and looking after the synagogue on St. Eustatius, it gradually fell into ruin.",
				"The synagogue building, known as Honen Dalim, (She who is charitable to the Poor) was constructed in 1737. Permission for building the synagogue came from the Dutch West India Company, with additional funding support from the Jewish community on CuraÃ§ao. Permission was conditional on the fact that the Jewish house of worship would be sited where \"the exercise of their (Jewish) religious duties would not molest those of the Gentiles\".[13] The building is located off a small lane called Synagogue Path, away from the main street. The synagogue attested to the wealth of the Jews of St. Eustatius and their influence on the island.[14]"
