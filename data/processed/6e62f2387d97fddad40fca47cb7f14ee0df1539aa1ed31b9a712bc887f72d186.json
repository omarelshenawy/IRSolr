				"previous": "While Hannah was working on increasing the size of M.S.C.'s student body, he also expanded the school from a regional college to a nationally recognized research university. When the University of Chicago eliminated varsity football and withdrew from the Western Conference (now the Big Ten) in 1946, Hannah lobbied hard to take its place. The Big Ten finally admitted M.S.C. in 1949. After joining the conference, head football coach Clarence L. \"Biggie\" Munn led the Spartan football team to the Rose Bowl in the 1953â54 season, beating UCLA 28â20.[38] Successor coach Hugh \"Duffy\" Daugherty lead the football team to a second Rose Bowl where it again defeated UCLA, 17â14.[39]",
				"after": "On the school's centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan officially made the school a university. M.S.C. thus became Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science. The State of Michigan did not allow the university to remove its \"agriculture\" moniker until the ratification of the Michigan Constitution of 1964. With this enactment, the university's governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the Michigan State University Board of Trustees.[40] Since 1964, the school has been known simply as Michigan State University.",
