				"previous": "Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae,[32] Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae.[15] Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World,[33] but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria.[34] Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review.[15] Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax may turn out to be large examples of Allosaurus.[10] Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.[5][15]",
				"after": "The discovery and early study of Allosaurus is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the Bone Wars of the late 19th century. The first described fossil in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden in 1869. It came from Middle Park, near Granby, Colorado, probably from Morrison Formation rocks. The locals had identified such bones as \"petrified horse hoofs\". Hayden sent his specimen to Joseph Leidy, who identified it as half of a tail vertebra, and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus Poekilopleuron as Poicilopleuron [sic] valens.[35] He later decided it deserved its own genus, Antrodemus.[36]",
