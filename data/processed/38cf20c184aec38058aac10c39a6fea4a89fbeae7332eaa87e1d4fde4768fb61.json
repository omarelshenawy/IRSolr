A cease-fire proposal was announced by the Egyptian government on 14 July, backed by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas;[205] the Israeli government accepted it and temporarily stopped hostilities on the morning of 15 July, but Hamas rejected it in \"its current form\", citing the fact Hamas has not been consulted in the formation of the ceasefire and it omitted many of their demands.[206][207] By 16 July, the death toll within Gaza had surpassed 200 people.[208]",
