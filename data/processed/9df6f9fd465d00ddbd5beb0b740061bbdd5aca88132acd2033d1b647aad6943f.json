				"Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE) reported the first name for the vicinity as Treva.",
				"The name Hamburg comes from the first permanent building on the site, a castle which the Emperor Charlemagne ordered constructed in AD 808. It rose on rocky terrain in a marsh between the River Alster and the River Elbe as a defence against Slavic incursion, and acquired the name Hammaburg, burg meaning castle or fort. The origin of the Hamma term remains uncertain,[11] as does the exact location of the castle.[12]"
