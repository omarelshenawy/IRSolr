The flocks may contain up to 100 birds in winter.[3] During the breeding season, the ibises regularly forage up to 15Â km (10Â mi) from the colony, and, although steppe not in current cultivation is preferred for feeding, they will also use fallow ground, and occasionally even actively cultivated fields.[23]",
