It also became part of Kibbor hundred.[citation needed] Around this same time the Herbert family became the most powerful family in the area.[31] In 1538, Henry VIII closed the Dominican and Franciscan friaries in Cardiff, the remains of which were used as building materials.[32] A writer around this period described Cardiff: \"The River Taff runs under the walls of his honours castle and from the north part of the town to the south part where there is a fair quay and a safe harbour for shipping.\"[32]",
