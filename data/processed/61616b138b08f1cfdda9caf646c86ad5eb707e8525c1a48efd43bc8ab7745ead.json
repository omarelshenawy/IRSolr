Each of the next six decades saw a 15 percent increase in population, reaching 3.4Â million in 1960. Growth then slowed, rising 11 percent to 3.8Â million in 1970, and an average of 9 percent over the next three decades to 4.9Â million in the 2000 Census.[53] The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Minnesota was 5,379,139 on July 1, 2012, a 1.4 percent increase since the 2010 United States Census.[54] The rate of population change, and age and gender distributions, approximate the national average. Minnesota's center of population is in Hennepin County.[55]",
