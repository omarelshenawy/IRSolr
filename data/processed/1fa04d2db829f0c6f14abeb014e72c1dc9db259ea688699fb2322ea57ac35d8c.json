				"after": "The Alpine chough is socially monogamous, showing high partner fidelity in summer and winter and from year to year.[28] Nesting typically starts in early May, and is non-colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.[4] The bulky nests are composed of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair, and may be constructed on ledges, in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in an abandoned building. The clutch is 3â5 glossy whitish eggs, averaging 33.9 by 24.9 millimetres (1.33Â in ÃÂ 0.98Â in) in size,[29] which are tinged with buff, cream or light-green and marked with small brown blotches;[4] they are incubated by the female for 14â21 days before hatching.[13] The chicks hatch with a dense covering of natal down, in contrast to those of the red-billed chough which are almost naked,[30] and fledge in a further 29â31 days from hatching.[13] The young birds are fed by both parents, and may also be fed by other adults when they have fledged and joined the flock.[4] Breeding is possible in the high mountains because chough eggs have relatively fewer pores than those of lowland species, and lose less water by evaporation at low atmospheric pressure.[31] The embryos of bird species that breed at high altitude also have haemoglobin with a genetically determined high affinity for oxygen.[32]",
