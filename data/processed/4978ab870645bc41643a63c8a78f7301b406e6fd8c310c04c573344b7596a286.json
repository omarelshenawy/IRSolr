Bengali and English are the primary languages of instruction; Urdu and Hindi are also used, particularly in central Kolkata.[185][186] Schools in Kolkata follow the \"10+2+3\" plan. After completing their secondary education, students typically enroll in schools that have a higher secondary facility and are affiliated with the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, the ICSE, or the CBSE.[185] They usually choose a focus on liberal arts, business, or science. Vocational programs are also available.[185]",
