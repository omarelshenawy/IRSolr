				"previous": "Despite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that the new winglets will not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits.[78] Instead, on 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.[79]",
				"after": "On 15 November 2009, Airbus announced future additions of Sharklets[80] to A320s beginning in 2012 with Air New Zealand.[81] These Airbus winglets, which are 2.4 metres (7Â ft 10Â in) tall and weigh 200 kilograms (440Â lb),[82] would reduce fuel burn by 4% and offer increases in payload of 500Â kg (1,100Â lb), or range by 110Â nmi (204Â km) at the original payload.[83] This corresponds to an annual CO2 reduction of around 700Â t (690 long tons) per aircraft,[80] saving operators US$220,000 per aircraft per year.[84] The Sharklets are to be manufactured and distributed by Korean Air Aerospace Division.[85]",
