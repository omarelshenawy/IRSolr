				"after": "The NAMC YS-11 was an important aircraft for All Nippon Airways, although most of them were used under the name of ANK, or Air Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways. The final YS-11 in operation was retired in 2006.[71] A number of YS-11s are in museums, or otherwise scrapped or taken apart. After a final retirement process through September 2006, all YS-11s were grounded, obligated to retire, unless privately owned and were privately restored. The YS-11 was a big part of All Nippon Airways from the 1970s to the early 1990s, when it was used on domestic operations.[71]",
