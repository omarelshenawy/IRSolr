It is located in the U.S. state of Washington between Puget Sound and Lake Washington, about 96 miles (155 km) south of the United StatesâCanadian border in King County, of which it is the county seat. Seattle was first settled by Europeans on November 14, 1851, by Arthur A. Denny and his crew, which would subsequently become known as the Denny party. Early settlements in the area were called New York, Alki and Duwamps; in 1853 at the suggestion of Doc Maynard the main settlement was named Seattle, after Sealth, chief of two local tribes. As of 2010[update], the city had an estimated population of 608,660 and an estimated metropolitan area population of approximately 3.3 million. Seattle is the hub for the Greater Puget Sound region. Its official nickname is the Emerald City, the result of a contest by a civic-minded association in the early 1980s to designate a pleasant nickname for the city; the name alludes to the lush evergreen trees in the surrounding area. It is also referred to informally as the Gateway to Alaska, Queen City, and Jet City, due to the local influence of Boeing. (Seattle-area band QueensrÃ¿che also wrote a song called \"Jet City Woman\".) Seattle residents are known as Seattleites.",
