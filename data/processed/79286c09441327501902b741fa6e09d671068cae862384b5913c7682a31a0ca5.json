				"previous": "His lake design was at the heart of the city and consisted of a Central Basin in the shape of circular segment, a West and East Basin, which were both approximately circular, and a West and East Lake, which were much larger and irregularly shaped, at either side of the system.[10] The East Lake was supposed to be 6 metres (20Â ft) higher than the remaining components.[11] Griffin's proposal was \"the grandest scheme submitted, yet it had an appealing simplicity and clarity.[4]",
				"after": "The lakes were deliberately designed so that their orientation was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra.[3][12] The lakes stretched from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hillâthe future location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern sideânorth northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place).[13] This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.[12]",
