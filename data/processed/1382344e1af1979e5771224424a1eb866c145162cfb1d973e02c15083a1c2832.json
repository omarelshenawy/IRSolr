				"after": "Cougars are slender and agile members of the cat family. They are the fourth-largest cat;[40] adults stand about 60 to 90Â cm (24 to 35Â in) tall at the shoulders.[41] Adult males are around 2.4Â m (7.9Â ft) long nose-to-tail and females average 2.05Â m (6.7Â ft), with overall ranges between 1.5 to 2.75Â m (4.9 to 9.0Â ft) nose to tail suggested for the species in general.[42][43] Of this length, 63 to 95Â cm (25 to 37Â in) is comprised by the tail.[44] Males typically weigh 53 to 100Â kg (115 to 220Â lb), averaging 62Â kg (137Â lb). Females typically weigh between 29 and 64Â kg (64 and 141Â lb), averaging 42Â kg (93Â lb).[44][45][46] Cougar size is smallest close to the equator, and larger towards the poles.[3] The largest recorded cougar, shot in 1901, weighed 105.2Â kg (232Â lb); claims of 125.2Â kg (276Â lb) and 118Â kg (260Â lb) have been reported, though they were most likely exaggerated.[47] On average, adult male cougars in British Columbia weigh 56.7Â kg (125Â lb) and adult females 45.4Â kg (100Â lb), though several male cougars in British Columbia weighed between 86.4 and 95.5Â kg (190 to 210Â lb).[48]",
