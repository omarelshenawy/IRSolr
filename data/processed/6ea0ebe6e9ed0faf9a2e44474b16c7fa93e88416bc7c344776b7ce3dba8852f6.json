				"previous": "Hundreds of replicas of the Statue of Liberty are displayed worldwide.[165] A smaller version of the statue, one-fourth the height of the original, was given by the American community in Paris to that city. It now stands on the Ãle aux Cygnes, facing west toward her larger sister.[165] A replica 30 feet (9.1Â m) tall stood atop the Liberty Warehouse on West 64thÂ Street in Manhattan for many years;[165] it now resides at the Brooklyn Museum.[166] In a patriotic tribute, the Boy Scouts of America, as part of their Strengthen the Arm of Liberty campaign in 1949â1952, donated about two hundred replicas of the statue, made of stamped copper and 100 inches (2,500Â mm) in height, to states and municipalities across the United States.[167] Though not a true replica, the statue known as the Goddess of Democracy temporarily erected during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 was similarly inspired by French democratic traditionsâthe sculptors took care to avoid a direct imitation of the Statue of Liberty.[168] Among other recreations of New York City structures, a replica of the statue is part of the exterior of the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.[169]",
