				"previous": "Following the end of World War II, Dr. Sighard F. Hoerner was a pioneer researcher in the field, having written a technical paper published in 1952[7] that called for drooped wingtips whose pointed rear tips focused the resulting wingtip vortex away from the upper wing surface. Drooped wingtips are often called \"Hoerner tips\" in his honor. Gliders and light aircraft have made use of Hoerner tips for many years.[8][9]",
