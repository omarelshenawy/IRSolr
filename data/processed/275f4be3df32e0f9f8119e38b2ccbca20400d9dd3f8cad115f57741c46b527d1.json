				"previous": "The front face of each tower is animated with a continuous, dynamic exhibit of lights and electronic images.[1] Although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of landscapes such as waterfalls, most intriguing are the display of faces of Chicago residents. About 1,000Â faces of Chicagoans are shown in a random rotation,[2] the order determined using a Barco show controller.[3] Each face is displayed for five minutes, with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit. As a result, no more than 12 faces appear per hour during the summer. However, during the winter a version without the final one minute of puckering is shown, so the video segments then are only four minutes each.[10][19] The video pattern also includes a three-minute water scene every half-hour and a 30-second fade-to-black every 15 minutes. If all the faces were shown consecutively, instead of randomly, they would each appear about once every eight days.[10] A June 2007 article in the Chicago Sun-Times reported that many of the subjects who had their images digitized for the project had yet to either see their own images or hear of anyone who had seen them.[10]",
				"after": "The spouting water from the faces of the towers appears to be flowing from the displayed subject's mouth from a 6-inch (150Â mm) nozzle located in the center of each interior face 12 feet (3.7Â m) above the reflecting pool.[19] Images are shown daily year-round, while the water feature only operates from May 1 to approximately October 31,[4] weather permitting.[32] The park is open to the public daily from 6Â a.m. to 11Â p.m.[51]",
