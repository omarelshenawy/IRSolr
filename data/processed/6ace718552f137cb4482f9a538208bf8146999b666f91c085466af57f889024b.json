				"previous": "Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic CO2 cycle, reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants (7001100000000000000â 10Â ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 500-7016284018400000000â 900Â myr.[70] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, so animal life will become extinct within several million more years.[75] After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared[71] and the mean global temperature will reach 7002343150000000000â 70Â Â°C[75] (7002343150000000000â 158Â Â°F). Earth is expected to be effectively habitable for about another 7016157788000000000â 500Â myr from that point,[70] although this may be extended up to 7016725824800000000â 2.3Â byr if the nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.[72] Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[76]",
				"after": "The Sun, as part of its evolution, will become a red giant in about 7017157788000000000â 5Â byr. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1Â AU (150,000,000Â km), which is about 250 times its present radius.[73][77] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7Â AU (250,000,000Â km) from the Sun, when the star reaches its maximum radius. The planet was, therefore, initially expected to escape envelopment by the expanded Sun's sparse outer atmosphere, though most, if not all, remaining life would have been destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).[73] A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the red giant Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[77] After that, the Sun's core will collapse into a white dwarf, as its outer layers are ejected into space as a planetary nebula. The matter that once made up Earth will be released into interstellar space, where it may one day become incorporated into a new generation of planets and other celestial bodies.",
