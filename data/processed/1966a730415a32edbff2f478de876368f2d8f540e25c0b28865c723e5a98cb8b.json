				"after": "The voiced velar stop is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is â¨É¡â©, and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is g. Strictly, the IPA symbol is the so-called single-story G , though the double-story G is considered an acceptable alternative. The Unicode character \"Latin small letter G\" (U+0067) renders as either a single-story G or a double-story G depending on font, while the character \"Latin small letter script G\" (U+0261) is always a single-story G, but is generally available only in fonts with the IPA Extensions character block.",
