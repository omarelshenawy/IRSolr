				"previous": "The Lower Danube region experienced a period of stability after the establishment of the Avar Empire.[194] Archaeological sites in Moldavia, Oltenia and Wallachia became characterized by the growing popularity of hand-made vessels with finger impressions[195] and by a decline in detectable cemeteries.[196] Ananias of Shirak, a 7th-century Armenian geographer described the \"large country of Dacia\" as inhabited by Slavs who formed \"twenty-five tribes\".[197][198][199]",
				"after": "Villages of sunken huts with stone ovens[152] appeared in Transylvania around 600.[200][201][202] Their network was expanding along the rivers MureÅ, Olt and SomeÅ.[200][201] The so-called \"MediaÅ group\" of cremation or mixed cemeteries emerged in this period near salt mines.[203] The Hungarian and the Romanian vocabulary of salt mining was taken from Slavic, suggesting that Slavs were employed in the mines for centuries.[204][205] BistriÅ£a (\"swift\"), Crasna (\"nice\" or \"red\"), Sibiu (\"dogwood\"), and many other rivers and settlements with names of Slavic origin also evidence the presence of Slavs in Transylvania.[206][207]",
