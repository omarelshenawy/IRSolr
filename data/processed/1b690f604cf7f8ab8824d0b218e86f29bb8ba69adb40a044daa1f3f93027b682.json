				"previous": "On the right-hand side, is the energyâmomentum tensor. All tensors are written in abstract index notation.[30] Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for planetary orbits (or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics), the proportionality constant can be fixed as Îº = 8ÏG/c4, with G the gravitational constant and c the speed of light.[31] When there is no matter present, so that the energyâmomentum tensor vanishes, the results are the vacuum Einstein equations,",
				"after": "There are alternatives to general relativity built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations. Examples are BransâDicke theory, teleparallelism, and EinsteinâCartan theory.[32]",
