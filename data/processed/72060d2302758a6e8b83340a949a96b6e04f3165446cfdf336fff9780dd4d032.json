				"after": "The California condor was described by English naturalist George Shaw in 1797 as Vultur californianus. It was originally classified in the same genus as the Andean condor (V. gryphus), but, due to the Andean condor's slightly different markings, slightly longer wings, and tendency to kill small animals to eat,[6] the California condor has now been placed in its own monotypic genus. The generic name Gymnogyps is derived from the Greek gymnos/Î³ÏÎ¼Î½Î¿Ï \"naked\" or \"bare\", and gyps/Î³ÏÏ \"vulture\",[7] while the specific name californianus comes from its location in California. The word condor itself is derived from the Quechua word kuntur.[8]",
