				"previous": "The university's campus spans 8,547 acres (34.59Â km2) on three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in Beaufort. Duke's main campusâdesigned largely by African American architect Julian Abeleâincorporates Gothic architecture with the 210-foot (64Â m) Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation. The forest environs surrounding parts of the campus belie the University's proximity to downtown Durham. Construction projects have updated both the freshmen-populated Georgian-style East Campus and the main Gothic-style West Campus, as well as the adjacent Medical Center over the past five years.",
