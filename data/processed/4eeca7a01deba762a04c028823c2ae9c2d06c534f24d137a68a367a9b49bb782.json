				"previous": "This alcid typically fed in shoaling waters which were shallower than those frequented by other alcids,[45] although after the breeding season they had been sighted up to 500 kilometres (310Â mi) from land.[45] They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks.[45] Their main food was fish, usually 12 to 20 centimetres (4.7 to 7.9Â in) in length and weighing 40 to 50 grams (1.4 to 1.8Â oz), but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. The bird could on average dive up to 75 metres (246Â ft) for its prey with the maximum dive depth being estimated at 130 metres (430Â ft); however, to conserve energy, most dives were shallower.[45] Its ability to dive this deeply reduced competition with other alcid species. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favored prey.[46] Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, crustaceans, and sand lance.[44][45] The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adult auks.[36][42]",
				"after": "Historical descriptions of the great auk's breeding behaviour are somewhat unreliable.[47] Great auks began pairing in early and mid May.[48] They are believed to have mated for life, although some theorize that auks could have mated outside of their pair, a trait seen in the Razorbill.[31][42] Once paired, they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies, where they likely copulated.[21][31] Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads, showing off their white eye patch, bill markings, and yellow mouth.[31] These colonies were extremely crowded and dense, with some estimates stating that there was a nesting auk for every 1 square metre (11Â sqÂ ft) of land.[31] These colonies were very social.[31] When the colonies included other species of alcid, the great auks were dominant due to their size.[31]",
