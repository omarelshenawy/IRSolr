				"after": "When the team began play in 1976, Culverhouse initially picked team colors of red, green, orange and white. However, the shade of green was too close to that used by the Miami Dolphins. A medium shade of \"Florida Orange\" was substituted for green. Home uniforms included orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in redâthe now-infamous \"Creamsicle\" uniforms. Road white jerseys originally had orange numerals outlined in red, but these colors were reversed for year two and beyond. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.",
