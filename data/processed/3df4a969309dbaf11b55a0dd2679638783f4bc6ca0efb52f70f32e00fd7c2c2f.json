The urban area stretches mostly along a narrow strip of coastline. The MÃ¡laga metropolitan area includes additional municipalities located mostly in the mountains area north of the coast and also some on the coast: CÃ¡rtama, Pizarra, CoÃ­n, Monda, OjÃ©n, AlhaurÃ­n el Grande and Estepona on west; Casabermeja on north; TotalÃ¡n, Algarrobo, Torrox and VÃ©lez-MÃ¡laga eastward from MÃ¡laga.",

In some usages the metropolitan area includes other municipalities to which MÃ¡laga's public transportation network extends, at least since the establishment of the Consorcio de Transporte Metropolitano del Ãrea de MÃ¡laga (en: Consortium of Transportation of MÃ¡laga Metropolitan Area). Together about 1.3 million (max. 1.6 million[9]) people live in the MÃ¡laga metropolitan area and the number grows every year as all the municipalities and cities of the area record an annual increase in population.",
