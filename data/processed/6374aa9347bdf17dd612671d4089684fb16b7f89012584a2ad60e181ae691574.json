				"previous": "Domesday recorded an early church at Snitterley, but its location is unknown, and it may not have been the present site of St Nicholas.[4] There are scheduled monument and Grade II listed ruins of a medieval building in the salt marshes north of the present town described as \"Blakeney Chapel\", but, despite the name, it now seems likely that this was a domestic dwelling rather than a religious edifice.[5][6][7] Another possible chapel site east of the Glaven was shown on an 1835 map, but there is no documentation to support that identification.[8]",
				"after": "The nearby Carmelite friary had its own church by 1321, built on land donated by tenants of William de Roos, \"that the Carmelite friars, by the King's license, and that of Sir William Roos, might inhabit therein for ever, and might build a chapel\". The friars were also given 100 marks to build their church, in return for which they undertook \"to pray for the good estate of the said Sir William Roos and his Lady MaudÂ ... and to have and to hold that lord and lady, and their heirs, for their principal founders\".[9]",
