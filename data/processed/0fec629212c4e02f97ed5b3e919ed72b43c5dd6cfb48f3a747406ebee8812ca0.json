The aircraft, first re-engined with an Armstrong Siddeley Leopard radial engine and then later with a Rolls-Royce Buzzard and nicknamed the \"Flying Boxcar\" in Canada,[3][4] could lift approximately three tons and had a maximum weight of 7Â tonnes (8Â tons). It was used to supply mining and other operations in remote areas with equipment too big and heavy for other aircraft then in use. The Ju 52/1m was able to land on wheels, skis or floats.[5]",
