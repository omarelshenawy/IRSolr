				"previous": "Several Lockheed 12s were used as technology testbeds. The U.S. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) bought two, adding a center vertical fin to each of them to improve their stability. One of the NACA Lockheed 12s was used to test \"hot-wing\" deicing technology, in which hot exhaust air from the engines was ducted through the wing's leading edge to prevent ice accumulation.[16][17]",
				"after": "Three other Lockheed 12s were used to test tricycle landing gear.[18] These had their normal landing gear replaced by a non-retracting version with a large nosewheel and with the main wheels shifted further back on the engine nacelles.[18] (The tailwheel from the normal conventional gear was retained.[18]) The gear was non-retractable because there wasn't room within the structure to stow it in retracted position.[13] Streamlined fairings were placed on the gear to reduce drag.One of the tricycle gear Lockheed 12s went to the U.S. Navy as the XJO-3 and performed carrier landing tests on the USSÂ Lexington to study the suitability of a twin-engined tricycle-gear aircraft for carrier operations.[17][18] Another went to the U.S. Army as the C-40B, and still another was retained by Lockheed for its own testing; both of these were eventually converted back to the normal landing gear configuration.[17][18]",
