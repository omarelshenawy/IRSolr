				"previous": "Tabitha and Napoleon spent the beginning of 2012 apart. While Tabitha was choreographing Madonna's halftime performance for Super Bowl XLVI,[80] Napoleon was shooting more scenes for COBU 3D and scouting for the seventh season of America's Best Dance Crew. Although they never returned to America's Best Dance Crew as supervising choreographers, Napoleon continued to serve as a talent scoutâan extra role he had on the show since its inception.[81] In February, Balitang America named Napoleon \"The Filipino Champion\" in its ongoing series called \"The Filipino Champions: Mga Pinoy na Maipagmamalaki\" (The Filipino Champions: Filipinos' Pride).[82] After the superbowl, Tabitha worked with Madonna again. She choreographed her music video \"Girl Gone Wild\" which featured all-male Ukrainian dance troupe Kazaky.[83] On August 10, 2012, Tabitha gave birth to son, London Riley D'umo.[84] During the last months of the year, Tabitha and Napoleon continued to work with K-pop artists. They choreographed the music videos \"Humanoids\" by TVXQ and \"I Got A Boy\" by Girls' Generation.[85] TVXQ, Girls' Generation, and BoA are all signed to S. M. Entertainment.",
				"after": "In May 2013âtwo years after the premiere of MÃS.I.C.âthe JabbaWockeeZ debuted a new stage show at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino called PRiSM, a backronym for Painting Reality in a Spectrum of Movement.[86] Like their previous show, this one was also directed by Tabitha and Napoleon. The previous month, Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed the music video \"Puttin' on the Ritz\" by Herb Alpert, a jazz musician and co-founder of A&M Records. The music video is a three-minute uninterrupted long take with cameo appearances by musicians Hussain Jiffry, Bill Cantos, Michael Shapiroand, and Lani Hall.[87] On June 25, 2013, they recreated the video on SYTYCD as the opening routine for season ten's Top 20 performance episode. Yahoo! Music called the performance \"absolutely epic\".[88] Like the video, it was also shot in one take and several people made cameo appearances including Sean Cheesman, Travis Wall, Chris Scott, Nigel Lythgoe, Mary Murphy, Jason Gilkison, Herb Alpert, Lani Hall, and Tabitha and Napoleon themselves.[89] According to Alpert's official website \"... the song and choreography from the music video will be featured in the Zumba Fitness: World Party video game.\"[87]",
