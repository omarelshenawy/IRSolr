				"previous": "After mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months,[82] and normal labor takes one to three hours.[83] Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs.[1][84] During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs,[85] small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.[16][25]",
				"after": "Ovine obstetrics can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding.[86] In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs.[25] After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb.[25] Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth.[25] In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or that are rejected by the ewe require aid to live, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.[87]",
