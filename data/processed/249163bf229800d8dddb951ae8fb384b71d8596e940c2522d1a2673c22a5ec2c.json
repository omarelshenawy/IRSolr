				"previous": "The eggs hatch after 53 to 60Â days of incubation by both parents. Chicks are born with their eyes open and sometimes can take up to a week to leave the shell completely.[21] The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest.[19] Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.",
				"after": "In modern times, a wide variety of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), combined with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens,[45] lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot),[46] DDT poisoning,[47] electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets.[48] The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents.[49]",
