				"previous": "The Sunda slow loris has dark rings around its large eyes,[28] a white nose with a whitish strip that extends to the forehead and a dark stripe that stretches from the back of the head along the spine.[29][30] Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside.[8][30] The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head.[31] It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast.[31] The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris.[31] Local color variations are known to occur.[8]",
				"after": "It measures between 27 and 38 centimetres (11 and 15Â in) and weighs 599 and 685 grams (21.1 and 24.2Â oz).[32][33][34][35] Unlike the Bengal slow loris, the Sunda slow loris does not show sexual dimorphism by weight.[34] The vestigial tail,[36] hidden beneath the fur, is reduced to a stump.[35] It has a toothcomb, six forward-facing teeth on the bottom jaw, which includes the lower incisors and the canine teeth. The structure is generally used for grooming in other strepsirhine primates, but lorises also use it to scrape off gum when foraging.[37] It has a shortened second digit, and the hands have a strong grip.[35] Like other lorises, it excretes a strong-smelling liquid from glands beneath its arms which is used in communication.[38]",
