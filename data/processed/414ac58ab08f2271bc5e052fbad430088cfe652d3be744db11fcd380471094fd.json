				"previous": "is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces Xi, indexed by , and the canonical projections piÂ : X â Xi, the product topology on X is defined as the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections pi are continuous. The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.",
				"after": "The product topology on X is the topology generated by sets of the form piâ1(U), where i is in I and U is an open subset of Xi. In other words, the sets {piâ1(U)} form a subbase for the topology on X. A subset of X is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) union of intersections of finitely many sets of the form piâ1(U). The piâ1(U) are sometimes called open cylinders, and their intersections are cylinder sets.",
