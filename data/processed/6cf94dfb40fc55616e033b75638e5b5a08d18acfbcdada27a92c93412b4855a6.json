The only cancellations that occurred in the yard after the war were the cancellation of the Lexington-class battlecruiser USSÂ LexingtonÂ (CC-1). This was offset by the construction of two cruisers, which were delivered in due time. Additionally, the yard finished building the multiple orders that it received for the S-class submarine, as well as orders for two other submarines.[1]",
