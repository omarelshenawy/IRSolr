				"after": "Although the EncyclopÃ©die was Diderot's monumental piece, he was the author of many other works that sowed nearly every field of intellectual interest with new and creative ideas. He wrote sentimental plays, Le Fils naturel (1757) and Le PÃ¨re de famille (1758), accompanying them with essays on theatrical theory and practice, including \"Les Entretiens sur Le Fils Naturel\" (Conversations on The Natural Son), in which he announced the principles of a new drama: the 'serious genre', a realistic midpoint between comedy and tragedy that stood in opposition to the stilted conventions of the classical French stage. His art criticism was also highly influential. Diderot's Essais sur la peinture was described by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, as \"a magnificent work, which speaks even more helpfully to the poet than to the painter, though to the painter too it is as a blazing torch.\"",
