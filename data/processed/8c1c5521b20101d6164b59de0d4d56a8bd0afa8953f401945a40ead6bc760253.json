				"previous": "Nez Perce is a misnomer given by the interpreter of the Lewis and Clark Expedition at the time they first encountered the Nez Perce in 1805.[citation needed] It was a French term meaning \"pierced nose.\" This is an inaccurate description of the tribe. They did not practice nose piercing or wearing ornaments. The \"pierced nose\" tribe lived on and around the lower Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest and are commonly called the Chinook tribe by historians and anthropologists. The Chinook relied heavily upon salmon, as did the Nez Perce. The peoples shared fishing and trading sites but the Chinook were much more hierarchical in their social arrangements.[citation needed]",
