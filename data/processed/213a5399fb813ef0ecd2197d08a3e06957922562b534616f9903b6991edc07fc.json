By the early 1850s, Manglis had been a relatively well-organized Russian colony.[22] The old cathedral was also restored from 1851 to 1857.[23] The population, with an overwhelming Slavic majority, was up to 3,000 in 1892.[24] By the early 1890s, Manglis had also acquired a spa status, where the people of Tiflis (Tbilisi) could escape the city's summer heat.[25]",
