Based on a 'Tactical Air Support Aircraft' ASR markedly similar to that for the Marut,[13] HAL completed design studies in 1975, but the project fell through due to inability to procure the selected \"proven engine\" from a foreign manufacturer and the IAF's requirement for an air superiority fighter with secondary air support and interdiction capability remained unfulfilled.[14]",
