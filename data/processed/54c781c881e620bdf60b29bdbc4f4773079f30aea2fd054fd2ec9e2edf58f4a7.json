				"previous": "In 2008, the Air Force announced that it would replace the MC-130P fleet with a new aircraft based on the C-130J airframe. The MC-130J Commando II has the capability to complete missions faster and more efficiently than its Combat Talon and Combat Shadow counterparts. Recapitalization is a stated priority of Lt. Gen. Donald C. Wurster, commander of Air Force Special Operations Command.[68]",
