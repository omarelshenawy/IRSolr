A slide is for use only on land as a means of escape, although it has sufficient buoyancy to allow passengers to hold on to a lanyard running the length of it and use it as a buoyancy aid. A slide/raft is an evacuation slide that can be used both as a means of escape in a land evacuation and as a life raft in a landing on water. Slide/rafts usually feature an erectable canopy, outer compartments to hold passengers and survival packs containing items such as leak stoppers, paddles and flares.",
