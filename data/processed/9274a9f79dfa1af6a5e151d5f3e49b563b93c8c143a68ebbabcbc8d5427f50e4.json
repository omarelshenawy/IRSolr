It was consequently part of a twin monument and they had been positioned about 2â3 m apart on both sides of a locally important road, where they had marked a ford. Both stones had lost their upper parts and the present height of the runestone is 1.52Â m (5Â ft 0Â in) (of which 1.33Â m (4Â ft 4Â in) is above ground) and it is 0.55Â m (1Â ft 10Â in) wide.[108] It is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp.[109]",
