				"after": "After World War II, the growing demand for electricity sparked interest in constructing another power plant supported by the Grand Coulee Dam.[58] One obstacle to an additional power plant was the great seasonality of the Columbia River's streamflow. Today the flow is closely managedâthere is almost no seasonality. Historically, about 75% of the river's annual flow occurred between April and September.[59] During low flow periods, the river's discharge was between 50,000Â cuÂ ft/s (1,400Â m3/s) and 80,000Â cuÂ ft/s (2,300Â m3/s) while maximum spring runoff flows were around 500,000Â cuÂ ft/s (14,000Â m3/s). Only nine out of the dam's eighteen generators could run year-round. The remaining nine operated for less than six months a year.[60] In 1952, Congress authorized $125,000 for Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on the Third Powerplant which was completed in 1953 and recommended two locations. Nine identical 108Â MW generators were recommended, but as matters stood, they would be able to operate only in periods of high water.[58]",
