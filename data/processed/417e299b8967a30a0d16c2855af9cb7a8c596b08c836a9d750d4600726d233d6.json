				"previous": "The basidia of G.Â quadrifidum have a basal clamp connection, or they narrow into a hyphal part that ends at a clamp. When they are young, they are more or less ellipsoid to club-shaped, but in age they often become more or less bottle-shaped, ampullaceous or sometimes almost lecythiform, among other shapes; when mature they measure 14â21 x 4.5â7Â Âµm (excluding the hyphal part). The hyphal part is less than 1â6 x 1â2Â Âµm. The sterigmata (thin projections of the basidia that attach the to spore) are 4â6Â Âµm long and mostly 1â1.5Â Âµm thick. The hyphae located immediately underneath the basidia are thin-walled, 1â2Â Âµm wide, provided with clamps and densely branched. The hyphae of the tramal plates are roughly parallel, thin-walled, 1â2Â Âµm wide, and provided with clamps which may be dilated.[18]",
				"after": "The spores in mass are dark brown when mature. They are spherical, covered with \"warts\" or verrucae, and measure 5â6Â Âµm in diameter (including ornamentation).[nb 2] The spores often contain a drop of oil. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the verrucae to be up to 0.8Â Âµm long, conical to columnar processes with rounded to almost flattened tips. The apiculus (the part of a spore which attaches to the sterigmata at the end of a basidium) is distinct with radiating ridge-like processes. The young spore is first broadly egg-shaped before becoming roughly spherical in maturity.[18]",
