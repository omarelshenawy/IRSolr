By 2002, New York City's crime rate was similar to that of Provo, Utah and was ranked 197th in crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000.[343] Members of the NYPD are frequently referred to by politicians, the media, and their own police cars by the nickname, New York's Finest.",
