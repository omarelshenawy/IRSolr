				"previous": "Amateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) number in the millions.[212] Many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species. Bird feeding has grown into a multimillion dollar industry; for example, an estimated 75% of households in Britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter.[213]",
				"after": "Birds play prominent and diverse roles in folklore, religion, and popular culture. In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs;[214] or as the rooster(cock) serves as a tangible vessel of Christ as in the gospel of âMatthew, Mark and Luke in the New Testament with Christ speaking through the cock;[215] or as attendants, as in the case of Hugin and Munin, two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin.[216] In several civilizations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the \"auspex\" (from which the word \"auspicious\" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.[217] They may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: ××Ö¹× Ö¸×, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves.[218] Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India.[219] Some birds have also been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the MÄori's legendary PouÄkai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans.[220]",
