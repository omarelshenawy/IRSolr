However, some seabirds, particularly, the albatrosses and gulls, have broken into popular consciousness. The albatrosses have been described as \"the most legendary of birds\",[64] and have a variety of myths and legends associated with them, and today it is widely considered unlucky to harm them, although the notion that sailors believed that is a myth[65] that derives from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem, \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", in which a sailor is punished for killing an albatross by having to wear its corpse around his neck.",
