				"previous": "When being grown for seed, cabbages must be isolated from other B.Â oleracea subspecies, including the wild varieties, by 0.8 to 1.6Â km (0.5 to 1Â mi) to prevent cross-pollination. Other Brassica species, such as B.Â rapa, B.Â juncea, B.Â nigra, B.Â napus and Raphanus sativus, do not readily cross-pollinate.[63]",
