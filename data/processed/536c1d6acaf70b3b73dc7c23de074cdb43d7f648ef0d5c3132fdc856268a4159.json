				"previous": "In the wake of the Pig-faced Lady scare of 1814â15, exhibits on the subject of pig-faced women became popular at fairs. William Wilde records that a print of The Wonderful Mrs Atkinson was a popular exhibit at an early 19thÂ century Irish fair,[59] while larger fairs included exhibits of pig-faced women moulded in papier-mÃ¢chÃ© or wax.[36] There is some evidence that a living pig-faced woman was exhibited at Bartholomew Fair in 1828, and possibly also in previous years.[60] (The pig-faced woman exhibited in Wakefield in 1828â29, recalled by George Lloyd in 1861, may have been the same one shown at Bartholomew Fair in 1828.[60]) At an 1843 fair in Hyde Park, \"Madam Steevens, the Wonderful Pig-faced Lady\" was exhibited, and would grunt to give replies to questions from the audience.[60]",
				"after": "The pig-faced women exhibited at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it large amounts of strong beer, and then shave it.[60] Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would be attached to the bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.[33]",
