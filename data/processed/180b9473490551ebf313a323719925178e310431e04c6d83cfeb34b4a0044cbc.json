				"after": "Business class is a much more significant upgrade from economy class for long haul flights, in contrast to a regional or domestic flight where business class offers a few advantages over economy class. The innovations in business class seating, incorporating features previously only found in First class (see below), has narrowed the comfort and amenities gap with First class. These advances and added features, as well as the late 2000s recession, have caused some airlines to removed or not install First class seating from their aircraft (as First class seats are usually double the price of business class but can take up more than twice the room), leaving business class the most expensive seats on such planes.[1]",
