				"after": "The church had much stained glass in 1622 that disappeared during the Reformation. The current eleven coloured glass windows on the north, west and south sides of the church were erected in 1879 by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, each being named for its donor; the scenes depicted tell the story of Jesus from the Annunciation to the Last Supper.[6][20] The stained glass in the chancel and the Hasting Chapel was erected in 1924, and most was once in the castle,[21] although the earliest glass is a German, Swiss and Flemish work possibly originally from Farleigh Hungerford.[17] The chancel's east window contains arms of RichardÂ I and EdwardÂ I and the south window includes \"The Magi bearing gifts\" and the arms of Catherine Parr. The Hastings Chapel south window has several panels from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and one which could possibly be as old as the thirteenth century. The chapel's east window also has some high quality work, including \"The Last Supper\". The large west window in the tower is plain glass, as is the clerestory.[21]",
