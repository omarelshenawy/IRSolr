				"after": "Females mature sexually at age 5â6. Annually thereafter they bear one pup, usually in late February. The fertilized egg grows into a spherical embryo that implants in the uterus only after 3 or so months, to allow birth to take place while sufficient pack ice is available. Newborn pups weight around 11 kilograms (24Â lb) and are 80â85 centimetres (31â33Â in) long. After birth, the mother only feeds that pup. During the 12-day nursing period, the mother does not eat, losing up to 3 kilograms (6.6Â lb) per day. All three populations are hunted commercially, mainly by Canada, Norway, Russia and Greenland.",
