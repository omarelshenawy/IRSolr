				"previous": "South of the present-day Withins reservoir is a possible location for a Hengi-form Tumulus.[11] The town also has Roman associations; a Roman road passes through the town, along the border between Radcliffe and Bury on a south-east to north-west route.[12] It allowed easy travel between the Roman forts at Manchester (Mamucium) and Ribchester (Bremetennacum).[13] The approximate route was through Higher Lane in nearby Whitefield, through Dales Lane and across the Irwell over Radcliffe E'es through the site of the former East Lancashire Paper Mill. The route passes up Croft Lane, over Cross Lane and over the route of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal under the 10Â 3/4Â milestone. It then crosses Bury and Bolton Road, and heads through Higher Spen Moor.[14]",
				"after": "Other than placenames, little information about the area survives from the Dark Ages. Radcliffe was likely moorland and swamps.[7]",
