				"previous": "During this period, KertÃ©sz produced a number of new books. He was able to recover some of the negatives he had left in France decades before.[4][7][8][9]",
				"after": "Despite his successes, KertÃ©sz still felt unrecognised as a photographer. His last years were spent travelling to various locations around the globe for his exhibitions, especially Japan, and rekindling friendships with other artists. To deal with the loss of his wife in 1977, KertÃ©sz fell back on his new network of friends, often visiting them to talk. By this time, he was said to have learned basic English and talked in what his friends called \"KertÃ©szian\", a mixture of Hungarian, English and French.[4][9]",
