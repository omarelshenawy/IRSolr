				"after": "Until the 1970s, aviation had been a traditionally male occupation in the United States. Commerce Department regulations virtually required pilots to have flown in the military to acquire sufficient flight hours, and until the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force and Navy barred women from flying,[20] thus also preventing them from moving into commercial piloting.[citation needed] Despite women being trained by the U.S. Army Air Forces and flying every advanced military aircraft the U.S. built during World War II (including every bomber, pursuit plane, and the first jet) as Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), this program was disbanded in December 1944. At that time, commercial jobs were not generally available to women, though these highly trained women flew as instructors and pilots for flying services throughout the United States. Women eventually began to enter U.S. major commercial aviation in the 1970s and 1980s, with 1973 seeing the first female pilot at a major U.S. airline, American Airlines, and 1986 seeing the first female captain at a major U.S. airline.[21] In the 1970s, women were again, for the first time since WWII, permitted to fly in the United States Armed Forces, beginning with the Navy and the Army in 1974, and then the Air Force in 1976.[22]",
