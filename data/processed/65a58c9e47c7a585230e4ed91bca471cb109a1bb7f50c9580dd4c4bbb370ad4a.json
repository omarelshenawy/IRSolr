				"previous": "When prosperity returned with World War II, agitation began to end the Commission, and reinstate responsible government.[65] But, the British government created the National Convention in 1946, reflecting efforts in self-determination among European nationalities that followed WWII. The Convention, made of up representatives from throughout the country, was formally tasked to advise on the future of Newfoundland. Chaired by Judge Cyril J. Fox, it consisted of 45 elected members from across the province.",
				"after": "Several motions were made by Joey Smallwood (a member of the convention who later was elected as the first premier of Newfoundland[66]) to examine joining Canada by sending a delegation to Ottawa.[66] The first motion was defeated, although the Convention later decided to send delegations to both London and Ottawa to explore alternatives.[67][68] In January 1948, the National Convention voted against putting Confederation onto the referendum 29 to 16; but, this vote was overruled by the British, which controlled the National Convention and the subsequent referendum.[62]:145 Those who supported Confederation were extremely disappointed with the recommendations of the National Convention and organized a petition which more than 50,000 Newfoundlanders signed demanding that Confederation with Canada be placed before the people in the upcoming referendum. As most historians agree, the British government keenly wanted Confederation on the ballot and they made sure that it was.[69]",
