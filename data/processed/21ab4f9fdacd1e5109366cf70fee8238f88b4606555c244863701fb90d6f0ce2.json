				"previous": "If the feature is enabled, users can customize their stylesheets and configure client-side JavaScript to be executed with every pageview. On Wikipedia, this has led to a large number of additional tools and helpers developed through the wiki and shared among users. For instance, Lupin's navigation popups is a custom JavaScript tool that shows previews of articles when the user hovers over links, and also provides shortcuts for common maintenance tasks.[71] Another example is wikEd, a full-featured MediaWiki-integrated text editor that provides syntax highlighting and search and replace functions.[38]",
				"after": "The entire MediaWiki user interface can be edited through the wiki itself by users with the necessary permissions (typically called \"administrators\"). This is done through a special namespace with the prefix \"MediaWiki:\", where each page title identifies a particular user interface message. Using an extension,[72] it is also possible for a user to create personal scripts, and to choose whether certain sitewide scripts should apply to him by toggling the appropriate options in the user preferences page.",
