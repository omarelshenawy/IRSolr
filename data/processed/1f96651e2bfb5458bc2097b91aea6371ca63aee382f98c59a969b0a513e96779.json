				"previous": "One of the lahars virtually erased the small town of Armero in Tolima, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived.[35] The second lahar, which descended through the valley of ChinchinÃ¡ River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of ChinchinÃ¡, in the department of Caldas.[37] In total, over 23,000 people were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured.[35] More than 5,000 homes were destroyed.[35] The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount PelÃ©e,[38] and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history.[39] It is also the deadliest known lahar,[8] and Colombia's worst natural disaster.[40]",
				"after": "The loss of life during the 1985 eruption was due partly to the fact that scientists did not know precisely when the eruption would occur, and the authorities would not take costly preventative measures without clear warnings of imminent danger.[41] Because the volcano's last substantial eruption occurred 140 years ago, it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented; locals even called it the \"Sleeping Lion\".[26] Hazard maps showing Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation, with Armero's mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening.[42] Another factor was the storm that hit that evening, causing electrical outages and hindering communications. Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero, but failed to make radio contact.[43]",
