By the Chongde period, Manchus had developed their own well-trained wrestlers[219] and, a century later, in the Qianlong period, they surpassed Mongol wreslers.[220] The Qing court established the \"Shan Pu Battalion\" and chose 200 fine wrestlers divided into three levels. Manchu wrestling moves can be found in today's Chinese wrestling, Shuai jiao, which is its most important part.[221] Among many branches, Beijing wrestling adopted most Manchu wrestling moves.[222]",
