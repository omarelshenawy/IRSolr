				"previous": "Burges was born on 2 December 1827,[1] the son of Alfred Burges (1796â1886), a wealthy civil engineer. Alfred made a considerable fortune, some Â£113,000 (Â£10,740,280 in 2015 adjusted for inflation)[2] at his death,[3] enabling his son to devote his life to the study and practice of architecture without requiring that he actually earn a living.[4]",
				"after": "Burges entered King's College School, London, in 1839 to study engineering, his contemporaries there including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti.[5] He left in 1844 to join the office of Edward Blore,[5][6] surveyor to Westminster Abbey. Blore was an established architect, having worked for both William IV and Queen Victoria, and had made his reputation as a proponent of the Gothic Revival. In 1848 or 1849, Burges moved to the offices of Matthew Digby Wyatt.[7][8] Wyatt was as prominent an architect as Blore, evidenced by his leading role in the direction of The Great Exhibition in 1851. Burges's work with Wyatt, particularly on the Medieval Court for this exhibition, was influential on the subsequent course of his career.[9] During this period, he also worked on drawings of medieval metalwork for Wyatt's book, Metalwork, published in 1852,[10] and assisted Henry Clutton with illustrations for his works.[7]",
