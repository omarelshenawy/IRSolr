				"previous": "Morgan describes the organ as ringing with \"'incredible clarity' and 'dark color'\".[91] It is able to \"reproduce the sound of Baroque music as authentically as possible\".[90] In 2005 Morgan performed the complete organ works of Dieterich Buxtehude during a series of recitals, eight hours in all, to celebrate the organ's 20th anniversary. During the 2009â2010 season, Morgan commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Fisk-Nanney organ and his 10th year at Stanford in a concert series of the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach, which took 18 hours to complete.[91]",
				"after": "The side chapel houses the Katherine Potter-Brinegar organ, a one-manual Renaissance-style instrument built by Paul Fritts and modeled after the work of the 17th-century German organbuilder Esias Compenius.[90] Built in 1995, it \"further enhances\"[90] the diversity of the church's musical capacity. It has eight stops, of which three are reeds. The majority of its pipework is made of wood. The organ can be moved easily to different locations in the building with the aid of hidden retractable wheels.[90]",
