				"after": "The main airport in Essex is London Stansted Airport, serving destinations in Europe, North Africa and Asia.[10] The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government formed in May 2010 has agreed not to allow a further runway until a set time period[when?], so curtailing the operator's ambitions for expansion. London Southend Airport, once one of Britain's busiest airports, opened a new runway extension, terminal building and railway station in March 2012.[11] The station is on the Shenfield to Southend Line, with a direct link to the capital. Southend offers scheduled flights to Ireland, the Channel Islands and multiple destinations in Europe. Essex has several smaller airfields, some of which owe their origins to military bases built during World War I or World War II, giving pleasure flights or flying lessons; examples include Clacton Airfield, Earls Colne Airfield, and Stapleford Aerodrome.",
