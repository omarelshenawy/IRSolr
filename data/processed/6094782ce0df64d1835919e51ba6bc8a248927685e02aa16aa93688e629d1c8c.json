				"after": "Often considered Santana's greatest album, it drew widespread acclaim for its mixture of Latin influences with familiar rock themes such as overdriven electric guitar, organ and heavy drums. The album also demonstrates Santana's stylistic versatility, including tracks such as \"Samba Pa Ti\" (a classic slow-burning, seductive piece)[1] and \"Incident at Neshabur\", both being instrumentals. The latter has several rhythm and time signature changes consistent with its jazz feel. Latin percussion â congas, bongos and timbales, as well as a conventional rock drum setup, make this Santana's first foray into true Latin rhythm. In 2003, the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.",
