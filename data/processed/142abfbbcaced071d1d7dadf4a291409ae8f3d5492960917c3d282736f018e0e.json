				"after": "The type specimen of Thescelosaurus (USNMÂ 7757) was discovered in 1891 by paleontologists John Bell Hatcher and William H. Utterback, from beds of the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of Niobrara County (at the time part of Converse County), Wyoming, USA. The skeleton, however, remained in its shipping crates for years until Charles W. Gilmore of the Smithsonian Institution' National Museum of Natural History had it prepared and described it in a short paper in 1913, naming it T. neglectus (neglectus: \"neglected\"). At the time, he thought it was related to Camptosaurus.[32] He provided a detailed monograph in 1915, describing the well-preserved skeleton.[10] The type specimen was found largely in natural articulation and was missing only the head and neck, which were lost due to erosion.[10] The name comes from the surprise Gilmore felt at finding such a good specimen that had been unattended to for so long. He considered it to be a light, agile creature, and assigned it to the Hypsilophodontidae, a family of small bipedal dinosaurs.[10]",
