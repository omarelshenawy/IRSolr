The smallest is a P. mongoliensis hatchling conserved in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), which is only 11 to 13Â centimeters (4â5Â inches) long, with a skull 2.8Â centimeters (1Â in) in length. Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only 4.6Â centimeters (1.8Â inches) long. Both specimens are from Mongolia.[19] Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately the same age as the larger AMNH specimen.[20]",
