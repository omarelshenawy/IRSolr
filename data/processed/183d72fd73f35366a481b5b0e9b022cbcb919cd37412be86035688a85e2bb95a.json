He followed this with his best figures with the ball, capturing 4/38 in the England second innings, helping Australia to a nine wicket victory.[12] In the Second Test, Giffen made a \"golden duck\", dismissed first ball without scoring but took 4/89 in England's only innings; the English won the Test by an innings and 27Â runs.[13] Giffen was promoted to open the batting for the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where he made 41 and 7 England won the Test by 69Â runs, winning the first Ashes series 2â1.[14][15]",

The Australians lost the three Test series one Test to nil, but had the best of the two drawn matches.[16] In the Second Test at Lord's, Giffen top-scored in the first innings, making 63Â runs;. England won the Test by an innings and 5Â runs.[17] Giffen took 81Â wickets in England at an average of 19.60,[18] however he \"tended to be expensive\".[16] His best batting performance for the tour was 118 against Lancashire; a match in which he also took a \"hat-trick\".[19]",
