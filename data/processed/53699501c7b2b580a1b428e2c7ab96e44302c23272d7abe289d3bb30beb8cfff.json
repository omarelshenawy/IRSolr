				"previous": "Primates are among the most social of animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups.[87] Richard Wrangham stated that social systems of non-human primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups.[88] He proposed four categories:",
				"after": "Other systems are known to occur as well. For example, with howler monkeys both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity, resulting in groups in which neither the males nor females are typically related.[75] Some prosimians, colobine monkeys and callitrichid monkeys use this system.[55]",
