Cley Eye had been farmed since the earliest human habitation, and was 28Â ha (70Â acres) in extent in 1651, but is much reduced by coastal erosion.[11][12] The Eye and its Saxon barn were accessed by an ancient causeway, passable at low tide.[12] A 1588 map showed \"Black Joy Forte\" in the same area, which may have been intended as a defence against the Spanish Armada, but was never completed.[3][13] On the other side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as \"Blakeney Chapel\", which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century. Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function. Nearly a third of the mostly 14th-to-16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent,[14][15] reflecting the Glaven ports' importance in international trade at this time.[16][17]",
