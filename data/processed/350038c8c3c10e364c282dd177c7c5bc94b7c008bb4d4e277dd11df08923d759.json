				"after": "Exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power, which is obtained by extracting additional power (up to that necessary to drive the compressor) from turbine expansion. Owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system, the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low.[3][4][5] Consequently, the exhaust jet produces (typically) less than 10% of the total thrust,[citation needed][6] and turboprops can have bypass ratios up to 50-100[7][8][9] although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans.[10]",
