				"after": "The Model A had 16 kB of user RAM, while the Model B had 32 kB. A feature that the Micro shared with other 6502 computers such as the Apple and the early Commodore models was that the RAM was clocked twice as fast as the CPU (4 MHz),[6][26] with alternating access given to the CPU and the video display circuits.[22] This gave the BBC Micro a fully unified memory address structure without speed penalties. Most competing microcomputers with memory-mapped display incurred CPU speed penalties depending on the actions of the video circuits (e.g. the Amstrad CPC and to a lesser extent the ZX Spectrum) or kept video memory completely separate from the CPU address pool (e.g. the MSX).",
