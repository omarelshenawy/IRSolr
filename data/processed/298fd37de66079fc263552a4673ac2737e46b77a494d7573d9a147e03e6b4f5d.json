				"previous": "Basalts of the Columbia River Basalt Group, from eruptions in eastern Oregon, flowed across large parts of the northern half of the basin about 15Â million years ago.[19] They covered the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills), most of the Tualatin Valley, and the slopes of hills further south, with up to 1,000 feet (300Â m) of lava.[21] Later depositions covered the basalt with up to 1,000 feet (300Â m) of silt in the Portland and Tualatin basins.[22] During the Pleistocene, beginning roughly 2.5Â million years ago, volcanic activity in the Cascades combined with a cool, moist climate to produce further heavy sedimentation across the basin; braided rivers created alluvial fans spreading down from the east.[19]",
				"after": "Between about 15,500 and 13,000Â years ago, the Missoula Floodsâa series of large outpourings originating at Glacial Lake Missoula in Montanaâswept down the Columbia River and backfilled the Willamette watershed.[19] Each flood produced \"discharges that exceeded the annual discharge of all the present-day rivers of the world combined\".[15] Filling the Willamette basin to depths of 400 feet (120Â m) in the Portland region, each flood created a temporary lake, Lake Allison, that stretched from Lake Oswego to near Eugene.[24] The ancestral Tualatin Valley, part of the Willamette basin, flooded as well; water depths ranged from 200 feet (61Â m) at Lake Oswego to 100 feet (30Â m) as far upstream (west) as Forest Grove.[24] Flood deposits of silt and clay, ranging in thickness from 115 feet (35Â m) in the north to about 15 feet (4.6Â m) in the south, settled from this muddy water to form today's valley floor.[19] The floods carried Montana icebergs well into the basin, where they melted and dropped glacial erratics on the land's surface. These rocks, composed of granite and other materials common to central Montana but not to the Willamette Valley, include more than 40Â boulders, each at least 3 feet (0.9Â m) in diameter.[25] Before being partly chipped away and removed, the largest of these originally weighed about 160 short tons (150Â t).[25]",
