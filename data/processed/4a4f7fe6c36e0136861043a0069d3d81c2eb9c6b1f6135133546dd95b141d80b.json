				"after": "All plants and animals that live in and around Craters of the Moon are under great environmental stress due to constant dry winds and heat-absorbing black lavas that tend to quickly sap water from living things. Summer soil temperatures often exceed 150Â Â°F (66Â Â°C) and plant cover is generally less than 5% on cinder cones and about 15% over the entire monument.[32] Adaptation is therefore necessary for survival in this semi-arid harsh climate.",
