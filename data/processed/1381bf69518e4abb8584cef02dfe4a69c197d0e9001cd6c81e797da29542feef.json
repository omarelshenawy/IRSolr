In 1604, he was appointed picture maker to the heir to the throne, Prince Henry; and in 1607, serjeant-painter to King James I â a post he shared with John De Critz.[1] Peake is often called \"the elder\", to distinguish him from his son, the painter and print seller William Peake (c. 1580â1639) and from his grandson, Sir Robert Peake (c. 1605â67), who followed his father into the family print-selling business.[2]",
