By the second half of 1942 an increasing number of foreigners, many of whom were not volunteers, began entering the ranks.[48] The 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen was recruited from Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) drafted under threat of punishment by the local German leadership[48] from Croatia, Serbia, Hungary, and Romania and used for anti-partisan operations in the Balkans.[40][49] Himmler approved the introduction of formal compulsory service for the Volksdeutsche in German occupied Serbia.[48] Another new division was formed at the same time, when the SS Cavalry Brigade was used as the cadre in the formation of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer.[40]",
