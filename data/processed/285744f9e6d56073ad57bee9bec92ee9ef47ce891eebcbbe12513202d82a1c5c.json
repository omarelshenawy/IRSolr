				"previous": "During the Interregnum, however, squatters had occupied Windsor Castle. As a result, the \"King's house was a wreck; the fanatic, the pilferer, and the squatter, having been at workÂ ... Paupers had squatted in many of the towers and cabinets\".[149] Shortly after returning to England, Charles appointed Prince Rupert, one of his few surviving close relatives, to be the Constable of Windsor Castle in 1668.[150] Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle's defences, repairing the Round Tower and reconstructing the real tennis court.[151] Charles attempted to restock Windsor Great Park with deer brought over from Germany, but the herds never recovered their pre-war size.[144] Rupert created apartments for himself in the Round Tower, decorated with an \"extraordinary\" number of weapons and armour, with his inner chambers \"hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures\".[152]",
				"after": "Charles was heavily influenced by the works of Louis XIV of France, imitating French design at his palace at Winchester and the Royal Hospital at Chelsea.[153] At Windsor, Charles created \"the most extravagantly Baroque interiors ever executed in England\".[153] Much of the building work was paid for out of increased royal revenues from Ireland during the 1670s.[154] French court etiquette at the time required a substantial number of enfiladed rooms to satisfy court protocol; the demand for space forced May to expand out into the North Terrace, rebuilding and widening it in the process.[155] This new building was called the Star Building, because Charles II placed a huge gilt Garter star on the side of it.[155] May took down and rebuilt the walls of Edward III's hall and chapel, incorporating larger windows but retaining the height and dimensions of the medieval building.[155] Although Windsor Castle was now big enough to hold the entire court, it was not built with chambers for the King's Council, as would be found in Whitehall.[156] Instead Charles took advantage of the good road links emerging around Windsor to hold his council meetings at Hampton Court when he was staying at the castle.[156] The result became an \"exemplar\" for royal buildings for the next twenty-five years.[157] The result of May's work showed a medievalist leaning; although sometimes criticised for its \"dullness\", May's reconstruction was both sympathetic to the existing castle and a deliberate attempt to create a slightly austere 17th-century version of a \"neo-Norman\" castle.[158]",
