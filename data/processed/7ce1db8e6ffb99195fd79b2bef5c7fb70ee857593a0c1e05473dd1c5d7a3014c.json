				"The board of trustees has ultimate authority of all the businesses and affairs of the Foundation. It is composed of ten members:",
				"Three permanent entities support the board on its mission and responsibilities: an executive director, namely Lila Tretikov, which leads and oversees the operational arm of the foundation; an advisory board composed of individuals selected by the board itself that advise the board on different matters; and standing committees to which the board delegates certain matters while retaining ultimate authority. The board has also at times created other orthodox entities to support itself, such as executive secretaries and ad-hoc committees established for specific tasks."
