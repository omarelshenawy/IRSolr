				"previous": "where c(r) is the circle centered at 0 with radius r oriented counterclockwise; then the argument principle says that this number is the number N of zeros of p(z) in the open ball centered at 0 with radius r, which, since rÂ >Â R, is the total number of zeros of p(z). On the other hand, the integral of n/z along c(r) divided by 2Ïi is equal to n. But the difference between the two numbers is",
				"after": "The numerator of the rational expression being integrated has degree at most nÂ âÂ 1 and the degree of the denominator is nÂ +Â 1. Therefore, the number above tends to 0 as r â +â. But the number is also equal to NÂ âÂ n and so NÂ =Â n.",
