The forest was up to 85Â percent hemlock and white pine; hardwoods made up the rest of the forest.[55] The area was inhabited by a large number of animal species, many of which have vanished by the end of the 20th century. A herd of 12,000Â American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, bobcats and foxes; all are locally extinct except for the last three as of 2007. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they had to sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.[6]",
