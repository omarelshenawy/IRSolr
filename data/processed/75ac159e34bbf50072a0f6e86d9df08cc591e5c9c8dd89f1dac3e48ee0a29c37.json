Consequently, relatively few buildings survive from its earlier history and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments.[201] Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.",
