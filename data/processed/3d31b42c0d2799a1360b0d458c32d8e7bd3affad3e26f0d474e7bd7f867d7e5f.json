These included the Kalapuya, the Chinook, and the Clackamas.[35] The territory of the Clackamas encompassed the northeastern portion of the basin, including the Clackamas River (with which their name is shared). Although it is unclear exactly when, the territory of the Chinook once extended across the northern part of the watershed, through the Columbia River valley. Indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley were further divided into groups including the Yamhill, Atfalati (Tualatin), Molala, Santiam, Chuchsney-Tufti, Muddy Creek, Long Tom, Yoncalla, Siuslaw, Calapooia, Chepenafa and Luckiamute, many of which were part of the larger Kalapuya group.[4][35] The name Willamette is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation of the name of a Clackamas Native American village.[1] However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar,[36] so the name may also be derived from Kalapuya dialects.[37]",
