				"previous": "The ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of statistical mechanics and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems. Koopman approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of functional analysis. An observable a is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height). The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function ÏÂ t. This introduces an operator UÂ t, the transfer operator,",
				"after": "By studying the spectral properties of the linear operator U it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties ofÂ Î¦Â t. In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving Î¦Â t gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involvingÂ U.",
