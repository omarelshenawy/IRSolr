				"Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors, the eating of strawberries and cream by the spectators, and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain."

				"The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as 'The All England Croquet Club'. Its first ground was off Worple Road, Wimbledon.[7]",
				"In 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so earlier and originally given the name SphairistikÃ¨ was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed 'The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club' and signaled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net."
