				"after": "A bearing compass is a magnetic compass mounted in such a way that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the lubber line of the bearing compass.[64] A surveyor's compass is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a hand compass fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the prismatic compass.[65] Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the BÃ©zard compass consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it.[66][67] This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.[66][68]",
