				"after": "\"City of Angels\" was first performed at special concerts, dubbed as Church of Mars, in May 2013, shortly before the release of the album.[78] It later became a signature part of the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour which followed. During the tour's first three legs, the song was usually performed with musicians playing taiko drums.[79] The set's video screen displayed shots from the song's music video, which were accompanied by the stage's LED video curtains. Fans and critics responded favorably to the song in a live setting. Curtis Sindrey, writing for the Aesthetic Magazine Toronto, opined that the band \"turned up the energy\" with tracks like \"City of Angels\".[80] Ben Jolley from the Nottingham Post found it \"inspirational,\" while Jay Cridlin of the Tampa Bay Times called it \"epic.\"[81][82] Thirty Seconds to Mars performed \"City of Angels\" at multiple major festivals, including Rock Werchter, Pinkpop, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, which saw the band playing as headline act.[83]",
