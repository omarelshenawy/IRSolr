				"previous": "On November 13, 1997, voters changed the name of the county from Dade to Miami-Dade to acknowledge the international name recognition of Miami.[14] Voters were acting pursuant to home rule powers granted to Dade County, including the ability to change the name of the county without the consent of the Florida Legislature.[15] The change in name also addressed a source of public dissatisfaction with the name \"Dade\" which was chosen to honor of Francis L. Dade, who had been killed in the Dade Massacre in the 1830s. The Dade Massacre did not occur in South Florida, but rather, in the West Central part of the state, in present day Sumter County, Florida, near Bushnell. There is also a Dade City, Florida, which is closer to the site of the massacre.",
