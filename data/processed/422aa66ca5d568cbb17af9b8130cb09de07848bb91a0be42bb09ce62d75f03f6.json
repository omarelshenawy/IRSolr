				"previous": "A dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a sigma-algebra, the quadruplet (X, Î£, Î¼, Ï). Here, X is a set, and Î£ is a sigma-algebra on X, so that the pair (X, Î£) is a measurable space. Î¼ is a finite measure on the sigma-algebra, so that the triplet (X, Î£, Î¼) is a probability space. A map Ï: X â X is said to be Î£-measurable if and only if, for every Ï â Î£, one has . A map Ï is said to preserve the measure if and only if, for every Ï â Î£, one has . Combining the above, a map Ï is said to be a measure-preserving transformation of X , if it is a map from X to itself, it is Î£-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The quadruple (X, Î£, Î¼, Ï), for such a Ï, is then defined to be a dynamical system.",
