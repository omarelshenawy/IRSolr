				"previous": "The Southern Uplands are a range of hills almost 200 kilometres (124Â mi) long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second fault line (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from Girvan to Dunbar.[152][153][154] The geological foundations largely comprise Silurian deposits laid down some 4â500Â million years ago. The high point of the Southern Uplands is Merrick with an elevation of 843Â m (2,766Â ft).[20][155][156][157] The Southern Uplands is home to the UK's highest village, Wanlockhead (430Â m or 1,411Â ft above sea level).[154]",
				"after": "The climate of Scotland is temperate and oceanic, and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as Labrador, southern Scandinavia, the Moscow region in Russia, and the Kamchatka Peninsula on the opposite side of Eurasia. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the coldest ever UK temperature of â27.2Â Â°C (â17.0Â Â°F) recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, on 11 February 1895.[158] Winter maxima average 6Â Â°C (42.8Â Â°F) in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging 18Â Â°C (64.4Â Â°F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.9Â Â°C (91.2Â Â°F) at Greycrook, Scottish Borders on 9 August 2003.[159]",
