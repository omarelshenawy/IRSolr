				"after": "Despite its recognized toxicity, Gyromitra esculenta is marketed and consumed in several countries or states in Europe and North America. It was previously consumed in Germany, with fungi picked in and exported from Poland; more recently, however, Germany and Switzerland discouraged consumption by prohibiting its sale.[16][58] Similarly in Sweden, the Swedish National Food Administration warns it is not fit for human consumption,[60] and restricts purchase of fresh mushrooms to restaurants alone.[61] The mushroom is still highly regarded and consumed in Bulgaria, being sold in markets and picked for export there.[62] In some countries such as Spain, especially in the eastern Pyrenees, they are traditionally considered a delicacy, and many people report consuming them for many years with no ill effects.[63] Despite this, the false morel is listed as hazardous in official mushroom lists published by the Catalan Government[12] and sale to the public is prohibited throughout Spain.[64] Outside of Europe, Gyromitra esculenta is consumed in the Great Lakes region and some western states in the United States.[65]",
