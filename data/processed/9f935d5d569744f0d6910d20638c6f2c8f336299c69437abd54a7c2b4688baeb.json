On 19 March 1972, a Douglas DC-9-32 carrying Yugoslav registration YU-AHR crashed into the Shamsam Mountains, 4 miles (6.4Â km) southwest of Aden, killing all 30 occupants on board. On 16 June, an Ilyushin Il-62 (SU-ARN) was involved in a landing accident with no reported fatalities. In July, eight Tupolev Tu-154s were ordered for US$60Â million, with three of them slated for delivery in JulyÂ 1973Â (1973-07), three in NovemberÂ 1973Â (1973-11) and two in MarchÂ 1974Â (1974-03).[37] Prior to firming the transaction up EgyptAir had also considered the Boeing 727, but financing for these US-manufactured aircraft could not be arranged.[38] Under the terms of the contract, light maintenance was to be performed in Egypt, whereas airframe and engine overhauling was to be undertaken in the Soviet Union.[39] In JulyÂ 1972Â (1972-07), the acquisition of four Boeing 707-320Cs valued at US$40Â million was announced. At this time, the airline had four Boeing 707s already in operation. The handover of the new aircraft had been arranged for March, May, June and SeptemberÂ 1973Â (1973-09).[37] On 5 December 1972, one of the four 707s already in the fleet (SU-AOW) crashed near Cairo while on a training flight. The crew of six perished in the accident. Reports indicating the airframe had been shot down were denied by the Egyptian government.[40] An Ilyushin Il-18, registration SU-AOY, was involved in a deadly accident near Nicosia on 29 January 1973 when it crashed into mountainous terrain, killing all 37 occupants on board.[41] Delivery of the four new Boeing 707s took place during the year, with two more 707-320Cs being ordered in September. In October the three Il-62s were returned to Aeroflot because of elevated operational costs and technical issues.[37] Also that month,[37] the first Tu-154 entered the fleet and was used for pilot training.[39] From Moscow, the handover of the Tu-154s was made through London-Heathrow, where these aircraft were fitted with British-made seats.[39]",
