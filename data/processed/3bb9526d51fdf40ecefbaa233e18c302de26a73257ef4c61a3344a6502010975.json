				"previous": "By mintages, the key dates in this series are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been extensively melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate.[1] For example, although more than nine million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979â1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, second only to the 1953-S in price in that grade.[25]",
