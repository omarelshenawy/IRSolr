				"previous": "A comment following repeated \"sanitisation\" of a page on an organisation: it must be very very discouraging to spend lots of time carefully constructing a page that presents a topic you're involved with with enough fulsome phantasy praise, deletion of awkward actual facts (e.g., list of activities of a multi-billion organisation claiming humanitarian aims containing only \"free haircut for those who attend promotional meetings\"). In one such case the user had sandbox edit history spanning 4 hours (maybe 4 hours + of time invested). When the edit of the article was committed it was reverted in the same minute by ClueBot NG. Apart from a nice anecdote, the serious point is that CBNG may seriously discourage people making complex edits to push a POV. Pol098 (talk) 10:22, 10 March 2015 (UTC)",
