				"Airliners must have space on board to store baggage that will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.",
				"Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called \"cargo bins\", \"holds\", or occasionally \"pits\". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as cargo decks on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft. Despite what is seen in many movies, access doors between passenger cabins and baggage holds are rare in modern airliners.[citation needed]"
