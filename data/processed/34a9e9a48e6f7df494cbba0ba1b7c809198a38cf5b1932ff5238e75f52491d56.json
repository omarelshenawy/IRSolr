				"after": "Neville Cardus was born on 3 April 1888 in Rusholme, Manchester. Throughout his childhood and young adulthood he was known as \"Fred\".[1] There has been confusion over his birth date; some sources give it as 2 April 1889,[n 1] and Cardus himself hosted a dinner party on 2 April 1959 believing this to be his 70th birthday.[6] His birth certificate, however, confirms the earlier date.[7] Neville's mother was Ada Cardus, one of several daughters of Robert and Ann Cardus of 4Â Summer Place, Rusholme. On 14 July 1888, when the baby was three months old, Ada left her parents' home and married John Frederick Newsome, a blacksmith. Apart from their shared forenames, there is no evidence that Newsome was Neville's father, who is described in Cardus's autobiographical works as a violinist in an orchestra. The Newsome marriage was short-lived, and within a few years Ada and Neville had returned to her parents' home in Summer Place.[4]",
