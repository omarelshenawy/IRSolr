				"previous": "Huntington did not present any evidence that Latin Americans see themselves as foreign in comparison to other Western cultures, or even a probably existing Western point of view of Latin Americans as foreigners in relation to Europeans and their direct descendants (though hardly for reasons other than the mixed-race descent pervasive among them, as, just like in its ruling colonial powers, both the Renaissance and the Enlightenment were strongly felt in the region). With the Latin American racial whitening policies, reflecting a still living regional tendency to the preference of imitating or prizing not only North American and European appearance, but also fashion, cultural taste and items, political values and even lexicon or given names (known as mentalidade de colonizado, \"colonized mentality\", in Portuguese)[citation needed], it seems more ludicrous that the reality is most often quite the reverse, i.e., that Latin Americans, especially those from Brazil and the Southern Cone, would be readily phobic about being otherized by Westerners and put in the same category as their often ridiculed or disparaged worker classes and rural people, or poorer neighboring and close cultural relative nations, and thus, as a consequence, also phobic to being seen as collectively very \"different\" or \"especial\" in general.",
				"after": "According to Huntington, Turkey, whose political leadership has systematically tried to Westernize the country since the 1920s, is his chief example of a \"torn country\" that is attempting to join Western civilization. The country's elite started the Westernization efforts, beginning with Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, who took power as first president of the modern Turkish nation-state in 1923, imposed western institutions and dress, embraced the Latin alphabet, joined NATO, and are seeking to join the European Union. It should also be noted, however, that the integration of Turkey with the West can be traced back to the 18th century, during which the Ottoman Empire was actively engaged in Westernization.[35]",
