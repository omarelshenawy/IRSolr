				"previous": "The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic StarÄevo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC.[20] There are several StarÄevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of StarÄevo. The StarÄevo culture was succeeded by the VinÄa culture (5500â4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier StarÄevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region (VinÄa-Belo Brdo). The VinÄa culture is known for its very large settlements, some of the largest in prehistoric Europe;[21] anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of VinÄa; the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe;[22] and the VinÄa symbols.",
