				"previous": "Today, stealing the 'T' is prohibited and is officially punishable with expulsion, although this has not happened in practice. After a Georgia Tech visitor was accidentally killed while climbing the Alexander Memorial Coliseum in 1999,[60] Institute President G. Wayne Clough banned stealing of the 'T' and the climbing of any Institute building, due to the risk of fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building.[49] Clough also expressed concern over the \"incredibly expensive liability litigation\" Georgia Tech could face in the event of an accident.[44] To discourage climbing, security features such as pressure-sensitive roof tiling, fiber optic cabling running throughout the letters, and an audible alarm have been added to the 'T' to help prevent its theft.[61]",
				"after": "In 2011, the Georgia Tech Student Government Association (SGA) launched a \"Keep the 'T' in Tech\" campaign to discourage thefts of 'T's from signage around the campus. The week-long campaign took place from September 26â30 and included an online petition to be published in The Technique, an open forum for discussing the issue, an amnesty day for returning stolen 'T's, and \"Live the True Tradition,\" an evening event focused on the tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower.[58]",
