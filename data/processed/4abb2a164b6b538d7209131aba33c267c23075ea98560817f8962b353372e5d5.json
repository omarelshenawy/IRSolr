				"previous": "Some land in Ship Street to the west of the college was leased from Exeter College in 1590, and further construction work took place after Powell was appointed principal in 1613.[15][27] Powell raised money from donors in Oxford, London, and Wales, collecting Â£838 12s 2d[n 2] in what has been described as \"an elaborate fundraising scheme\",[28] with efforts to attract donations from old members of the college.[28][29] Ann Lloyd, the widow of Griffith Lloyd (principal from 1572 to 1586) gave Â£100.[n 3][29] Richard Parry, the Bishop of St Asaph, gave Â£66 13s 4d out of the total from Welsh clergy of Â£78 7s 4d.[n 4][29] The old Great White Hall buildings were demolished around 1620 and replaced, and a kitchen and buttery were constructed.[29][30] Work also started on building the hall and the chapel under Powell; both were completed after his death in 1620.[31] Sir Eubule Thelwall, who became principal in 1621, raised Â£465 15s 6d[n 5] from donors, including Sir Julius Caesar, the Master of the Rolls, and Edward Littleton, the Recorder of London.[29] This was used for \"the perfecting of the Quadrangle of the building and furnishing of the library\".[29] The college then had a complete quadrangle of buildings, save for a gap between the chapel and the hall that would later be filled by the principal's lodgings, built by Thelwall at his own expense; the library (later demolished) was outside the quadrangle, to the west of the north end of the lodgings.[29][31]",
				"after": "The walls of the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone.[32] The remaining parts of the 17th-century walls are dressed with Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist.[33] Areas of Headington stone can be seen in the first quadrangle on the wall of the hall.[34] It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well:[35] the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and comes off.[36] Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.[34]",
