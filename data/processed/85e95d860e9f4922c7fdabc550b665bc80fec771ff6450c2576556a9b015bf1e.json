				"previous": "Seedlings have obovate cotyledons 1â1.4Â cm (0.4â0.6Â in) long by 1â1.5Â cm (0.4â0.6Â in) wide, and the leaves which develop immediately afterward are crowded and very hairy. They have serrate margins.[3] Evidence of thickening to form a future lignotuber, as well as minute buds, has been detected from the bases of seedlings at five months of age.[12]",
				"after": "The common name of firewood banksia was a result of its quick-burning properties.[13] Other names recorded include Menzies banksia,[14] firewheel banksia, port wine banksia, flame banksia, and in the cut flower industry, strawberry banksia and raspberry frost banksia.[15] The Beeloo Whadjuk Noongar people of the Perth region knew it as the Mungyt.[16] Despite its variation across its range, George noted that B.Â menziesii was a clearly defined species, and no formal division into subspecies was warranted.[3]",
