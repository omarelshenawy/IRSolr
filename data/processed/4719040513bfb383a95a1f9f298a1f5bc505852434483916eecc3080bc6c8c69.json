				"previous": "The widow of one of the seven \"martyrs\" read a statement after the march that listed the opposition's demands; the most important demands were the resignation of the forty-year-long government headed by the king's uncle and the implementation of a constitutional monarchy. Other demands included the immediate commencement of an \"impartial\" investigation into the deaths, the neutralization of the state media and the release of the remaining \"political\" prisoners.[18][30] Analysts stated that the large size of the protest pressured the government to concede to the protesters' demands.[20] Al Jazeera English said that \"unless they offered deep reforms, the Khalifas will likely fall\".[31]",
