				"after": "Technetium-99m (\"m\" indicates that this is a metastable nuclear isomer) is used in radioactive isotope medical tests, for example as the radioactive part of a radioactive tracer that medical equipment can detect in the human body.[15] It is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140Â keV gamma rays, and its half-life is 6.01Â hours (meaning that about 94% of it decays to technetium-99 in 24Â hours).[21] The chemistry of technetium allows it to be bound to a variety of non-radioactive compounds. It is the entire compound that determines how it is metabolized. Therefore a single radioactive isotope can be used for a multitude of diagnostic tests. There are more than 50 commonly used radiopharmaceuticals based on technetium-99m for imaging and functional studies of the brain, myocardium, thyroid, lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood, and tumors.[81]",
