				"after": "The announcement that Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin would be awarded the prize led to a public outcry.[10] Quadriga board members Cem Ãzdemir of the German Green Party, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia, and Heidelberg University history professor Edgar Wolfrum stepped down in protest.[11] Former recipients Olafur Eliasson and VÃ¡clav Havel decided to return their awards.[12][13] The New York Times commented that from the volume of outcry the ranks of people feeling Putin, a former East Germany-assigned KGB agent and later chief,[14][15] had rolled back democracy and human rights in Russia are apparently quite large.[10] The organisers decided not to make any awards in 2011 as a result of the controversy.[14] They released a statement on 16 July 2011 saying they acted \"in light of the growing and unbearable pressure and the danger of further escalation\" and that they deeply regretted hearing news of Havel's decision.[10] The awards ceremony scheduled for that October was therefore cancelled.[10][15][16][17]",
