				"At Southeast 21stÂ Avenue, it receives Crystal Springs Creek, which enters on the right. This tributary, 2.7 miles (4.3Â km) long, begins on the Reed College campus, flows under the Blue Bridge in Reed Canyon, through the Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden, and generally south to Johnson Creek. From its confluence with Crystal Springs Creek, Johnson Creek flows south about 1 mile (1.6Â km), crossing the county border for the eighth and final time. After re-entering Clackamas County, it passes the USGS gauge station at Milwaukie, 0.7 miles (1.1Â km) from the mouth. Shortly thereafter, Johnson Creek empties into the Willamette River 18.5 miles (29.8Â km) above its confluence with the Columbia River, which in turn flows about another 100 miles (160Â km) to the Pacific Ocean at Astoria.[5][6]"
