				"after": "The Bread-Winners, one of the first novels to take an anti-labor perspective, was published anonymously in 1883 (published editions did not bear Hay's name until 1916) and he may have tried to disguise his writing style.[210] The book examines two conflicts: between capital and labor, and between the nouveau riche and old money. In writing it, Hay was influenced by the labor unrest of the 1870s, that affected him personally, as corporations belonging to Stone, his father-in-law, were among those struck,[211] at a time when Hay had been left in charge in Stone's absence. According to historian Scott Dalrymple, \"in response, Hay proceeded to write an indictment of organized labor so scathing, so vehement, that he dared not attach his name to it.\"[212]",
