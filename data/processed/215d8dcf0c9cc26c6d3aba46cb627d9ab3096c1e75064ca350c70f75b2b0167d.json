				"previous": "Music was always present at the Hogg household, and Ima began learning to play the piano at age three.[23] Although her younger brothers attended public school, Ima was enrolled at a private school and received private music lessons.[37] In 1899, she entered the University of Texas at Austin (UT),[38] where her favorite courses were German, Old English, and psychology.[39] She later remarked that \"No freshman was ever more immature, more unprepared, more frightened than I.\"[38] She joined the female social club known as the Valentine Club, and helped to inaugurate the first sorority on the UT campus, Pi Beta Phi. After two years at the university, she moved to New York City to study piano and music theory at the National Conservatory of Music.[38]",
				"after": "Near the turn of the 20th century, Hogg's father began speculating in oil. He purchased 4,100 acres (17Â km2) of land near West Columbia in 1901, land that had been part of the Varner plantation.[40] After two years of study in New York City, Ima Hogg returned to Texas, dividing her time between the plantation and Houston, where her father had a law practice.[41] Under her supervision, the house was later remodeled and a portico was added to what had been the back of the house; she made this the new front entrance, orienting the house away from Varner Creek.[42]",
