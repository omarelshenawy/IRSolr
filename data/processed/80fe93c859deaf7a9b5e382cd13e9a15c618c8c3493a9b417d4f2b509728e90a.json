				"previous": "Wang Mang preserved these central government monopolies. When Eastern Han began, they were once again repealed, the industries given to local commandery governments and private entrepreneurs.[64] Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75â88 AD) briefly reintroduced the central government monopolies on salt and iron from 85 to 88 AD, but abolished them in the last year of his reign. After Emperor Zhang, the Han never returned the salt and iron industries to government ownership.[65] The Han first learned how to get salt from the ocean but eventually figured out a way to drill salt from the ground",
