				"after": "As no complete dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, is hard to determine.[2] Illustrations and written accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598â1662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance.[35] According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws.[36] The bird was sexually dimorphic: males were larger and had proportionally longer beaks. The beak was up to 23 centimetres (9.1Â in) in length and had a hooked point.[37]",
