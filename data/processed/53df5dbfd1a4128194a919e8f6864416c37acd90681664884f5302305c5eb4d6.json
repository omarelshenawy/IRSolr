				"previous": "Brunei Darussalam and the United Kingdom agreed to allow more air services between the countries on 23 November 2007, enhancing the two countries' co-operation in the aviation sector.[36] The agreement comes into action with immediate effect. This came off the back of the latest tourism figures of 3,459 European holiday visitor arrivals from JanuaryâAugust 2007,[36] according to Brunei Tourism. The agreement enhances air services and co-operation between the two countries, allowing for the tourism industries and commerce of the two countries to prosper. The U.K. is considered an important gateway for European tourists coming to Brunei. Royal Brunei Airlines operates daily flights between Brunei and London via Dubai. From then on, Royal Brunei Airlines is permitted to serve daily flights on routes between Bandar Seri Begawan and London without any restrictions regarding aircraft type and seat capacity with the end of the previous arrangement. RBA is also allowed to launch four services per week on routes to Manchester if decided at a later date.",
