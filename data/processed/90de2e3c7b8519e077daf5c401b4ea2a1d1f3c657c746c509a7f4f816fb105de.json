				"previous": "In 1943, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a Fascist administration.[32] Shortly thereafter, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. RenÃ© Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside Paris, thence he was then transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed.[33] Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the OpÃ©ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland.[34] In August 1944, the Germans executed RenÃ© Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.",
				"after": "Rainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.[35]",
