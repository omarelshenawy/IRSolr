				"after": "Evidence of Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang å ) did not leave behind detailed records of their work.[252] Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.[253] Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing.[254] The inventions of the artisan-engineer Ding Huan (ä¸ç·©) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital.[255] Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings.[256] Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.[257]",
