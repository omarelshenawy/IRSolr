				"After the arrival of Europeans and Americans, the population of Hawaii fell dramatically until an influx of primarily Asian settlers arrived as migrant laborers at the end of the 19thÂ century.[81]",
				"The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Hawaii was 1,419,561 on July 1, 2014; an increase of 4.36% since the 2010 United States Census.[3] As of 2014[update], Hawaii had an estimated population of 1,419,561; an increase of 15,507 from the previous year and an increase of 59,260 (4.36%) since 2010. This includes a natural increase of 48,111 (96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,068; migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,112 people. The center of population of Hawaii is located between the two islands of OÊ»ahu and MolokaÊ»i. Large mnumbers of Native Hawaiians have moved to Las Vegas, which has been the \"ninth island\" of Hawaii.[82][83]"
