				"previous": "The panels of Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are painted on light Sundeala boards, a material Bacon was using at the time as an inexpensive alternative to canvas.[14] Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, due in part to the low level of oil in the paint, which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board.[7] The pallid flesh tones of the figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.[7]",
				"after": "The art critic Hugh Davies has suggested that of the three figures, that on the left most closely resembles a human form, and that it might represent a mourner at the cross.[16] Seated on a table-like structure, this limbless creature has an elongated neck, heavily rounded shoulders, and a thick mop of dark hair.[7] Like its sister objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.[7] The central figure's mouth is positioned directly on its neck, rather than on a distinct face.[17] It bares its teeth as if in a snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandageâa device likely drawn from Matthias GrÃ¼newald's Mocking of Christ.[18] This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating from the base of the pedestal.",
