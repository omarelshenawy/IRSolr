				"previous": "Let X be a random sample from a probability distribution with statistical parameters Î¸, which is a quantity to be estimated, and Ï, representing quantities that are not of immediate interest. A confidence interval for the parameter Î¸, with confidence level or confidence coefficient Î³, is an interval with random endpoints (u(X),Â v(X)), determined by the pair of random variables u(X) and v(X), with the property:",
				"after": "The quantities Ï in which there is no immediate interest are called nuisance parameters, as statistical theory still needs to find some way to deal with them. The number Î³, with typical values close to but not greater than 1, is sometimes given in the form 1Â âÂ Î± (or as a percentage 100%Â·(1Â âÂ Î±)), where Î± is a small non-negative number, close to 0.",
