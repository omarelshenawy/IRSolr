				"previous": "During the Edo period, the chÅnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while BashÅ revivified the poetic tradition of the KokinshÅ« with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.[208] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume SÅseki and Mori Ågai were the first \"modern\" novelists of Japan, followed by RyÅ«nosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirÅ Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authorsâYasunari Kawabata (1968) and KenzaburÅ Åe (1994).[205]",
				"after": "Japanese cuisine is based on combining staple foods, typically Japanese rice or noodles, with a soup and okazuÂ â dishes made from fish, vegetable, tofu and the likeÂ â to add flavor to the staple food. In the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously not been widely used in Japan were introduced. Japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food,[209] quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. The Michelin Guide has awarded restaurants in Japan more Michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.[210]",
