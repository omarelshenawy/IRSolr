				"after": "The first Islamist terrorist attack on the World Trade Center occurred on February 26, 1993, at 12:17Â p.m. A Ryder truck filled with 1,500 pounds (680Â kg) of explosives, planted by Ramzi Yousef, detonated in the underground garage of the North Tower.[22] The blast opened a 100Â foot (30Â m) hole through five sublevels with the greatest damage occurring on levels B1 and B2 and significant structural damage on level B3.[136] Six people were killed and 50,000 other workers and visitors were left gasping for air within the 110 story towers. Many people inside the North Tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that contained no emergency lighting, some taking two hours or more to reach safety.[137][138]",
