				"after": "The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country.[123] In 1915, publisher ShÅzaburÅ Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\"new prints\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.[124] Prominent artists included GoyÅ Hashiguchi, called the \"Utamaro of the TaishÅ period\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui ItÅ, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women;[125] and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes.[126] Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860â1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as GoyÅ and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.[127]",
