In a 2003 study of Wikipedia as a community, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in wiki software create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that a \"creative construction\" approach encourages participation.[6] A paper written by Andrea Forte and Amy Bruckman in 2005, called \"Why Do People Write for Wikipedia? Incentives to Contribute to Open-Content Publishing\", discussed the possible motivations of Wikipedia contributors. It applied Latour and Woolgar's concept of the cycle of credit to Wikipedia contributors, suggesting that the reason that people write for Wikipedia is to gain recognition within the community.[7]",
