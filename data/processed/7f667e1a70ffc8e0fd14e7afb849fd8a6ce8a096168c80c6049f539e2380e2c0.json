				"previous": "In 1997, SAA introduced its new image and livery, dropping the Springbok emblem, and the old national colours of orange, white and blue. The new livery was based upon the new national flag, with a sun motiff. The airline's name on its aircraft was changed to South African, with the Afrikaans name Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens dropped. As a symbol of the new rainbow nation, one of SAA's 747-300s, named Ndizani (registration ZS-SAJ), was painted in bright colours.[33] Since Ndizani was withdrawn from service, there have been calls to paint another SAA aircraft in these striking colours. This special-liveried 747-300 helped transport South African Olympic athletes to Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.[34] The airline started online ticket sales and formed an alliance with SA Airlink and SA Express.",
				"after": "In 1998, services to Buenos Aires were restored[citation needed], while services to Copenhagen Airport were stopped. A new airline president and CEO, Coleman Andrews, was appointed. The arrival of the American saw a very comprehensive and somewhat controversial overhaul of the airline, changing the management of SAA. Mr Andrews was brought in by Transnet, the state-owned parent company, to remedy the problems of dwindling passengers, which Transnet's own market research had revealed was caused by \"failure to fly on time, unfriendly and minimally trained staff, poor food and SAA fares being 12â25% above its competitors\".[36] He was credited with rescuing World Airways from the brink of bankruptcy earlier in the decade.[29] During his first 18 months (out of 3-year) as CEO, South African Airway's market value increased fivefold.[37]",
