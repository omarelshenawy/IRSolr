				"In addition to the capital four other cities have been designated districts (in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing features. These are Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta and Buenaventura. Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other (for example in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low population (for example Amazonas, VaupÃ©s and Vichada), special administrative divisions are employed, such as \"department corregimientos\", which are a hybrid of a municipality and a corregimiento.[137][138]"
