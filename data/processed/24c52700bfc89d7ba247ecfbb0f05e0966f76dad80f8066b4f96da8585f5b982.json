				"previous": "The obverse of Saint-Gaudens's final design shows a female figure of Liberty, who also represents victory. Saint-Gaudens based his design on the female figure he had designed in creating New York City's monument to General William Tecumseh Sherman,[19] but the sculptor's ultimate inspiration was the Nike of Samothrace.[20] The figure for the Sherman monument was modeled by Henrietta Anderson, one of the artist's favorite subjects.[19] On the coin, Liberty holds a torch in one hand, representing enlightenment; an olive branch in the other, a symbol of peace.[21] She strides across a rocky outcrop; behind her are the United States Capitol and the rays of the sun. The figure is surrounded by 46Â stars, one for each of the states in 1907. The reverse is a side view of a flying eagle, seen slightly from below, with a rising sun and its rays behind it, complementing the obverse design.[19] The edge bears the lettering \"E Pluribus Unum\".[c] Saint-Gaudens felt he could not place a third line of text on the reverse without unbalancing the composition, and the obverse lacked room for the motto, so it was placed on the edge.[22]",
