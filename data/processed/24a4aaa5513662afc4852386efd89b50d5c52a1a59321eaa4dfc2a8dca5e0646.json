				"Before World War II, international naval treaties of 1922, 1930 and 1936 limited the size of capital ships including carriers.",
				"Since World War II, aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size. The large, modern NimitzÂ class of US carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War IIâera USSÂ Enterprise, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the sameâa consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years. Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political, economic, and military impact if a carrier is lost, or even used in conflict."
