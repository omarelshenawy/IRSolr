				"after": "Tropical Storm Barry was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle during August 2001. The third tropical cyclone and second named storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 24 and tracked westward. The wave entered the Caribbean on July 29 and spawned a low pressure area that organized into Tropical Storm Barry on August 3. After fluctuations in intensity and track, the system attained peak winds of 70Â mph (110Â km/h) in the Gulf of Mexico, and headed northward before moving ashore on the Gulf Coast.",
