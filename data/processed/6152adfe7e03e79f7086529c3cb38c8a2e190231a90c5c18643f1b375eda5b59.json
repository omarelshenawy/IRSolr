				"previous": "In the Horn of Africa, Afro-Asiatic-speaking groups predominate. Ethiopian and Eritrean groups like the Amhara and Tigrayans (collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic. In southern Ethiopia and Eritrea, Nilotic peoples related to those in South Sudan are also found, while Bantu and Khoisan ethnic minorities inhabit parts of southern Somalia.",
				"after": "Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[20] Decolonisation during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of European-descended settlers out of AfricaÂ â especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[21] Kenya, Congo,[22] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[23] By the end of 1977, more than one million Portuguese were thought to have returned from Africa.[24] Nevertheless, White Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and RÃ©union.[25] The African country with the largest White African population is South Africa.[26] The Afrikaners, the British diaspora and the Coloureds are the largest European-descended groups in Africa today.",
