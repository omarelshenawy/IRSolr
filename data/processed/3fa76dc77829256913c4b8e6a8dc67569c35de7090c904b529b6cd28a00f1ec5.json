They are considered a form of insect caviar and can sell for as much as US$40 per pound ($90/kg) because they are seasonal and hard to find. In the Colombian department of Santander, hormigas culonas (roughly interpreted as \"large-bottomed ants\") Atta laevigata are toasted alive and eaten.[166]",
