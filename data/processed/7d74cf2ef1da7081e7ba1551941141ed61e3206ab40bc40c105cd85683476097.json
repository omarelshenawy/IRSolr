The song shot to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in its sixth week on the chart, displacing SinÃ©ad O'Connor's four-week run in the top spot with \"Nothing Compares 2 U\". The song also reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, remaining there for two weeks. On June 28, 1990, \"Vogue\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of two million copies of the physical single across United States.[26] To date, it remains Madonna's best-selling physical single in the country.
