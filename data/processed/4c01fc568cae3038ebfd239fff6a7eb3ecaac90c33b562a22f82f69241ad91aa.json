				"previous": "An important addition to the Warner Bros. staff in this period was Ed Thrasher who moved from Columbia Records in 1964 to become Warner-Reprise head art director. Among his design credits for the Warner family of labels were The Jimi Hendrix Experienceâs Are You Experienced, Van Morrisonâs Astral Weeks, the Grateful Deadâs Anthem of the Sun, the Doobie Brothersâ Toulouse Street, Tiny Timâs God Bless Tiny Tim and Joni Mitchell's Clouds, which started a trend for musicians to create the art for their own records. In 1973, when Frank Sinatra emerged from retirement with his comeback album, Thrasher shot candid photographs for the cover and also devised the album title Olâ Blue Eyes Is Back, which was widely used to promote Sinatraâs return to recording and touring. Besides his work on album covers, Thrasher art-directed many of Warner Bros. ads and posters from 1964 to 1979.[25]",
				"after": "In 1964, Warner Bros. successfully negotiated with French label Disques Vogue and Warner Bros.' British distributor Pye Records for the rights to distribute Petula Clark's recordings in the US. Clark soon scored a #1 US hit with \"Downtown\" and she enjoyed consistent chart success in the USA over the next four years with hits such as \"My Love\", \"I Know A Place\", \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\", \"This Is My Song\" and \"Don't Sleep In The Subway\". Warner also released other Pye artists in the U.S. market such as The Kinks.",
