Completion of the partial hull needed to launch Minas Geraes was delayed by a five-month strike to 10 September 1908. SÃ£o Paulo followed on 19 April 1909.[85] Both were christened in front of large crowds by the wife of Francisco RÃ©gis de Oliveira, the Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom.[86] After fitting-out, the period after a warship's launch where it is completed, Minas Geraes was put through multiple trials of the speed, endurance, efficiency, and weaponry of the ship in September, including what was at that time the heaviest broadside ever fired off a warship, Minas Geraes was completed and handed over to Brazil on 5 January 1910.[87] The trials proved that the blast from the class' superfiring upper turrets would not injure crewmen in the lower turrets. The ship itself managed to reach 21.432 knots (24.664Â mph; 39.692Â km/h) on an indicated horsepower (ihp) of 27,212.[88] SÃ£o Paulo followed its classmate in July, after its own trials at the end of May, where the ship reached 21.623 knots (24.883Â mph; 40.046Â km/h) at 28,645Â ihp.[89]",
