				"after": "The flight data recorder was damaged to the point of being unreadable, so only the cockpit voice recorder was usable. Pradit Hoprasatsuk, the head of the Air Safety Division of the Thailand Department of Aviation, stated that, \"the attempt to determine why the reverser came on was hampered by the loss of the flight data recorder, which was destroyed in the crash\".[13] Upon hearing of the crash, Niki Lauda traveled to Thailand. He examined the wreckage and concluded that the largest fragment was about 5 metres (16Â ft) by 2 metres (6.6Â ft), \"about half the size of the largest piece in the Lockerbie crash\".[14] In Thailand Niki Lauda attended a funeral for 23 unidentified passengers, and then traveled to Seattle to meet with Boeing.",
