				"previous": "The Great Depression brought little work to the yard, with the exception of the completion of USSÂ QuincyÂ (CA-39) and USSÂ VincennesÂ (CA-44). USSÂ WaspÂ (CV-7) was built from 1936 to 1940, in addition to a handful of destroyers. Employment in the yard dropped drastically during this time, from 4,900 in 1931 to 812 two years later.[1]",
				"after": "The Naval Act of 1938 brought increased shipbuilding to the yard, as it mandated a 20% increase in the strength of the nation's Navy.[15] This brought an expansion of business to the yard, with 17,000 employees working in December 1941 and 32,000 in 1943, including 1,200 women. Payroll reached $110Â million (equivalent to $1.5Â billion in today's dollars)[2] around this time, and contracts amounted to around $700Â million (equivalent to $9.54Â billion in today's dollars).[2][1]",
