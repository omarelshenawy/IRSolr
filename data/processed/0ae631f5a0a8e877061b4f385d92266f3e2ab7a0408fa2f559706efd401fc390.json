				"previous": "Many tribal people in Africa, Brazil and India rely on hunting for food and have become victims of the fallout from poaching.[26] In the Indian Kanha Tiger Reserve, they are prevented from hunting, and were illegally evicted from their lands following the creation of nature reserves aimed to protect animals.[27] Tribal people are often falsely accused of contributing to the decline of wildlife. In India for example, they bear the brunt of anti-tiger poaching measures,[28] despite the main reason for the tiger population crash in the 20th century being due to hunting by European colonists and Indian royalties.[29] Tribal people have shaped landscapes and managed animal populations for millennia.[30]",
