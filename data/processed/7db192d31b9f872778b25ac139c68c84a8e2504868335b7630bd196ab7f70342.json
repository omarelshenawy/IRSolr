				"after": "Until the end of the 19th century Stretford was a largely agricultural village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000Â workers;[67] housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land.[68] Trafford Park is still a very significant source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people.[45] As at the 2001 UK census, 0.3% of Stretford's working population was employed in agriculture.[69]",
