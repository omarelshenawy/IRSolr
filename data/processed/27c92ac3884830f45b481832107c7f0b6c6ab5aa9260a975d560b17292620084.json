				"Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon (now called an airship) continued sporadically throughout the 19th century.",
				"The first powered, controlled, sustained lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place on 24 September 1852 when Henri Giffard flew 15 miles (24Â km) in France with the Giffard dirigible, a non-rigid airship filled with hydrogen and powered by a 3 horsepower (2.2Â kW) steam engine driving a 3 bladed propeller, travelling 27 kilometres (17Â mi) from Paris to Trappes. This was the world's first passenger-carrying airship."
