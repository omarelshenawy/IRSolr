The short, wide skull has a relatively short nasal passage. In width, the skull measures 19Â mm (0.75Â in) across the nasal passages, 30.5Â mm (1.20Â in) across the mastoids and 36.5Â mm (1.44Â in) at the zygomatic arches.[6] The external auditory meatus is broad and open, although the auditory bullae are confined.[37]",
