				"previous": "Only one major road, the National Highway 44 (NH-44), connects Tripura to the rest of India.[80] Starting at Sabroom in southern Tripura, it heads north to the capital Agartala, turns east and then north-east to enter the state of Assam. Locally known as \"Assam Road\", the NH-44 is often called the lifeline of Tripura.[80] However, the highway is single lane and of poor quality; often landslides, rains or other disruptions on the highway cut the state off from its neighbours.[32]:73[71]:44 Another National Highway, NH 44A, connects the town Manu in South Tripura district with Aizawl, Mizoram.[31] The Tripura Road Transport Corporation is the government agency overlooking public transport on road. A hilly and land-locked state, Tripura is dependent mostly on roads for transport.[80] The total length of roads in the state is 16,931Â km (10,520Â mi) of which national highways constitute 448Â km (278Â mi) and state highways 689Â km (428Â mi), as of 2009â10.[80] Residents in rural areas frequently use waterways as a mode of transport.[81]:140",
				"after": "Agartala Airport, located 12.5Â km (6.7 nautical miles) northwest of Agartala at Singerbhil, is the second busiest airport in north east India after Guwahati. There are direct flight connections to Kolkata, Imphal, Delhi, Silchar, Aizwal, Guwahati, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The major airlines are Air India, Jet Airways (Operating Codeshare and Konnect Flights), Indigo Airlines and Spicejet. Passenger helicopter services are available between the capital and major towns (Kailashahar, Dharmanagar) as well as to more remote areas such as Kanchanpur and Gandacherra.[80]",
