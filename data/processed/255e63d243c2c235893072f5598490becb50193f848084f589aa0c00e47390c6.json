In common parlance however, Secunderabad is seldom used these days outside the twin cities. The city of Secunderabad which was once said to be modern compared to its twin during the Nizam rule, has grown tremendously over the years to catch up with the metropolis of Hyderabad. The cities present different fusion of cultures with Secunderabad having developed under direct British rule until 1948, and the city of Hyderabad, as the capital of a princely state. It was founded in the 18th century as a cantonment, and has a large army and Air force presence to this date. Today, the Secunderabad Cantonment is the largest among the 62 cantonments in India.
