				"after": "The PlutoâCharon system is noteworthy for being one of the Solar System's few binary systems, defined as those whose barycenter lies above the primary's surface (617 Patroclus is a smaller example, the Sun and Jupiter the only larger one).[112] This and the large size of Charon relative to Pluto have led some astronomers to call it a dwarf double planet.[113] The system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is tidally locked to the other: Charon always presents the same face to Pluto, and Pluto always presents the same face to Charon: from any position on either body, the other is always at the same position in the sky, or always obscured.[114] This also means that the rotation period of each is equal to the time it takes the entire system to rotate around its common center of gravity.[70] Just as Pluto revolves on its side relative to the orbital plane, so the PlutoâCharon system does also.[71] In 2007, observations by the Gemini Observatory of patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on the surface of Charon suggested the presence of active cryo-geysers.[115]",
