				"previous": "On 20 August 1963, a QB-47 veered off course on its landing approach at Eglin Air Force Base and crash landed on a stretch of road that ran parallel to the runway. The QB-47 that crashed was used for Bomarc Missile Program tests, which normally operated from Eglin Air Force Base Auxiliary Field Number Three (Duke Field), approximately 15 miles (24Â km) north of the main base. Two cars were crushed by the crash landing, killing two occupants who both worked for the Honeywell Corporation at the time, a firm which had just completed flight tests on an inertia guidance sub-system for the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar project at the base, and injuring a third. Both vehicles were destroyed by fire.[46]",
