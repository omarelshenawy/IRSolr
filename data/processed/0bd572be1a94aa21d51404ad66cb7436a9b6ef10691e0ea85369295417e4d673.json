				"previous": "Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) became one of the largest transportation systems in the world, combining ships and railways operating from Canada. In 1891, the CPR shipping division began its first Pacific operation. In 1903, CPR began its first Atlantic service because of the rising migration of Europeans to western Canada, as the result of free land offered by the Canadian government.",
				"after": "Since the 1830s, passenger liners had unofficially been competing for the honour of making the fastest North Atlantic crossing. This honour came to be known as the Blue Riband; in 1897, Germany took the award with a series of new ocean liners, starting with SSÂ Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. In 1905, the British Cunard Line fitted RMSÂ Carmania, with steam turbines, which then outperformed its nearly-identical sister, RMSÂ Caronia, which was powered by quadruple-expansion steam engines. At the time, these were the largest ships in the Cunard fleet, and the use of the different propulsion methods in otherwise similar ships allowed the company to evaluate the merits of both.[13] The engines in the Carmania were successful and, consequently, in 1907, Cunard introduced the much larger RMSÂ Lusitania and RMSÂ Mauretania, both powered by steam turbines. Mauretania won the Blue Riband and held it for an astonishing 20 years.[14]",
