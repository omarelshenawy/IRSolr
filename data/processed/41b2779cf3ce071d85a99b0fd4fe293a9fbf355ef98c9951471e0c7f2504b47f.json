				"previous": "Let be a set of basis vectors that span an n-dimensional vector space. From geometric algebra, we interpret the pseudoscalar to be the signed volume of the n-parallelotope subtended by these basis vectors. If the basis vectors are orthonormal, then this is the unit pseudoscalar.",
				"after": "Even more generally, we may consider a new set of vectors proportional to the k basis vectors, where each of the is a component that scales one of the basis vectors. We are free to choose components as infinitesimally small as we wish as long as they remain nonzero. Since the outer product of these terms can be interpreted as a k-volume, a natural way to define a measure is",
