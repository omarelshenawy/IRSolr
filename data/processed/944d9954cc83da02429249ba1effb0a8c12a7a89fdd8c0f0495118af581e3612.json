				"previous": "Although there is evidence that Richard Cantillon wrote a wide variety of manuscripts, only his Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En GÃ©nÃ©ral (abbreviated Essai) survives.[6][32] Written in 1730,[33] it was published in French in 1755,[34] and was translated into English by Henry Higgs in 1932.[35] Although there is evidence which suggests that Essai had tremendous influence on the early development of economic science, Cantillon's treatise was largely neglected during the 19th century.[5] In the late 19th century, it was \"rediscovered\" by William Stanley Jevons, who considered it the \"cradle of political economy\".[4] Since then, Cantillon's Essai has received growing attention. Essai is considered the first complete treatise on economic theory,[36] and Cantillon has been called the \"father of enterprise economics\".[6][37]",
				"after": "One of the greatest influences on Cantillon's writing was English economist William Petty and his 1662 tract Treatise on Taxes.[39] Although Petty provided much of the groundwork for Cantillon's Essai,[38] Anthony Brewer argues that Petty's influence has been overstated.[40] Apart from Petty, other possible influences on Cantillon include John Locke,[41] Cicero, Livy, Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Charles Davenant, Edmond Halley, Isaac Newton, SÃ©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and Jean Boisard.[3] Cantillon's involvement in John Law's speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight on the relationship between increases in the supply of money, price, and production.[42]",
