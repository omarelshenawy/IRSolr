With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts.[15] The current design of euro banknotes has the word euro written in both the Latin and Greek (ÎÏÏÏ) alphabets; the Cyrillic spelling (EÐ²ÑÐ¾) was already added to the new Europa series of bank notes started in 2013 (see Linguistic issues concerning the euro).",
