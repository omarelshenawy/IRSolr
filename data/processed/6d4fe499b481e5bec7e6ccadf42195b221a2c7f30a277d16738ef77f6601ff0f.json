				"previous": "Ko-Ko discovers Katisha mourning her loss (\"Alone, and yet alive\") and throws himself on her mercy. He begs for her hand in marriage, saying that he has long harboured a passion for her. Katisha initially rebuffs him, but is soon moved by his story of a bird who died of heartbreak (\"Tit-willow\"). She agrees (\"There is beauty in the bellow of the blast\") and, once the ceremony is performed (by Pooh-Bah, the Registrar), begs mercy for him and his \"accomplices\" from the Mikado. Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum then re-appear, sparking Katisha's fury. The Mikado is astonished that Nanki-Poo is alive, when the account of his execution had been given with such \"affecting particulars\". Ko-Ko explains that when a royal command for an execution is given, the victim is, legally speaking, as good as dead, \"and if he is dead, why not say so?\"[n 3] The Mikado deems that \"Nothing could possibly be more satisfactory\", and so Titipu celebrates (\"For he's gone and married Yum-Yum\").",
