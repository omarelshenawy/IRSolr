				"after": "In 1927 Laguna Beach became the first city to be incorporated in the Aliso Creek watershed and the second in Orange County. At this time, prior to the 1930s, aside from some farming and ranching practices, the watershed was largely unpopulated.[4] At the end of that decade, the watershed still remained less than 1Â percent developed. Up to the 1960s and 1970s, barely 15Â percent of the watershed was developed, but by 1990, after doubling its rate in the past two decades, the watershed was roughly 60Â percent developed.[4] The cities of Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel were incorporated in 1988 and 1989, respectively. By the end of the 20thÂ century, more than 70Â percent of the watershed was developed.[4] The newest city in the watershed, Aliso Viejo, was incorporated in 2001.",
