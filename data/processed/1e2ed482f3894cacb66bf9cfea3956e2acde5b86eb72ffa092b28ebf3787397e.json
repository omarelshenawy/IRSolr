				"previous": "The original Model 525 CitationJet was developed as a replacement for the Citation and Citation I, being launched in 1989.[1] Basically an all new aircraft, the CitationJet used a modified version of the Citation's forward fuselage, but with a new supercritical laminar flow wing, and a new T-tail configured tailplane. It is powered by two Williams FJ44 turbofans, and features EFIS avionics and single pilot certification. The CitationJet's fuselage is 11 inches (27Â cm) shorter than the Citation I's, but has a lowered center aisle for increased cabin height. The CitationJet's first flight was on April 29, 1991, with its first delivery on March 30, 1993.[1]",
