				"previous": "Material assigned to Plateosaurus has been found at over 50 localities in Germany (mainly along the Neckar and Pegnitz river valleys), Switzerland (Frick) and France.[17] Three localities are of special importance, because they yielded specimens in large numbers and of unusually good quality: near Halberstadt in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany; Trossingen in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany; and Frick.[12] Between the 1910s and 1930s, excavations in a clay pit in Saxony-Anhalt revealed between 39 and 50 skeletons that belonged to Plateosaurus, along with teeth and a small number of bones of the theropod Liliensternus, and two skeletons and some fragments of the turtle Proganochelys.[12] Some of the plateosaur material was assigned to P.Â longiceps, a species described by palaeontologist Otto Jaekel in 1914[18] but now considered a junior synonym of P.Â engelhardti. Most of the material found its way to the Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde in Berlin, where much of it was destroyed during World War II.[17] The Halberstadt quarry today is covered by a housing development.[17]",
				"after": "The second major German locality with P.Â engelhardti finds, a quarry in Trossingen in the Black Forest, was worked repeatedly in the 20th century.[17] Between 1911 and 1932, excavations during six field seasons led by German palaeontologists Eberhard Fraas (1911â1912), Friedrich von Huene (1921â23),[2][19] and finally Reinhold Seemann (1932) revealed a total of 35 complete or partially complete skeletons of Plateosaurus, as well as fragmentary remains of approximately 70 more individuals.[17] The large number of specimens from Swabia had already caused German palaeontologist Friedrich August von Quenstedt to nickname the animal SchwÃ¤bischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm or Swabian dragon).[B] Much of the Trossingen material was destroyed in 1944, when the Naturaliensammlung in Stuttgart (predecessor to the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (SMNS)) burnt to the ground after an Allied bombing raid. Luckily, however, a 2011 study by SMNS curator Rainer Schoch found that, at least from the finds of Seemann's 1932 excavation, \"the scientifically most valuable material is still available\".[C]",
