This event was commemorated by the construction in 1730 of the obelisk,[5] 80 feet (24Â m) in height, standing on the highest point in the park. It is located over half a mile to the south and on axis with the centre of the house. An avenue of trees stretches over a mile south of the obelisk. Thousands of trees were planted on what had been windswept land; by 1770 the park covered 1,500 acres (6.1Â km2). Other garden buildings designed by Kent are, near the far end of the avenue the Triumphal Arch, designed in 1739 but only completed in 1752 and the domed doric temple (1730â35) in the woods near the obelisk. Above the main entrance to the house within the Marble Hall is this inscription:",
