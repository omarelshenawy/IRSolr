The Romans occupied Portland, reputedly calling it Vindelis.[4][5] The Viking pirates' first raid on England occurred in Portland in 787 AD, as recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.[6] They were Northmen from Hordaland (the district around Hardanger fjord in west Norway). In 1539 King Henry VIII ordered the construction of Portland Castle for defence against attacks by the French; the castle cost Â£4,964.[7] It is one of the best preserved castles from this period, and is opened to the public by the custodians English Heritage.[8]",
