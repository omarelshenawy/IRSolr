Healthy stream-side vegetation that reduces siltation is typical of healthy cutthroat trout habitat and beaver ponds may provide refuge during periods of drought and over winter.[44][45] Most populations stay in fresh water throughout their lives and are known as nonmigratory, stream-resident or riverine populations.[13] The coastal cutthroat trout (O. c. clarkii) is the only cutthroat trout subspecies to coevolve through its entire range with the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus). Portions of the westslope cutthroat trout's (O. c. lewisi) range overlap with the Columbia River redband trout (O. m. gairdneri), but the majority of its native range is in headwater tributary streams above major waterfalls and other barriers to upstream migration.[46] At least three subspecies are confined to isolated basins in the Great Basin and can tolerate saline or alkaline water.[47]",
