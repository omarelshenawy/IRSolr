				"Fradique Melo de Menezes (born March 21, 1942) has been the President of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe since 2001. SÃ£o TomÃ©an people just call him Fradique.",
				"Fradique de Menezes was born on the then Portuguese colony of SÃ£o TomÃ© in 1942, the son of a Portuguese man and a local woman. He attended high school in Portugal, and then studied Education and Psychology at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). Menezes is a successful businessman. He was foreign minister of SÃ£o Tome and PrÃ­ncipe from 1986 until 1987. He was elected President in July 2001 with about 55.2% of the vote, defeating Manuel Pinto da Costa, who received about 40%.[1] Menezes took office on September 3, 2001.[2] His eligibility as a candidate was questioned, since he also held Portuguese citizenship, but he renounced this and his candidacy was approved.[3] On July 16, 2003, while he was away in Nigeria, there was a military coup d'etat led by Fernando Pereira, but Menezes would be later restored back to power on July 23, 2003, following an agreement.[4]"
