The terminal, designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum,[42] is divided into a main terminal (housing gates A1âA12) and a satellite building (housing gates A13âA22). The main terminal and the satellite building are connected through an underground walkway.[43] Terminal A was originally intended to be entirely occupied by Delta, however, Delta returned 11 of the gates to Massport for financial reasons. Terminal A features a Delta airline lounge (Delta Sky Club) on the third floor of the satellite building.[44]",
