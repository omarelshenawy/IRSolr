				"after": "The 747 has proven to be a very popular freighter, carrying around half of the world's air freight.[92] To maintain this position, Boeing designed a freight variant of the 747-8, named the 747-8 Freighter or 747-8F. The company launched the freighter version on November 14, 2005.[93] The 747-8F is the initial model to enter service. As on the 747-400F, the upper deck is shorter than passenger models; the 18-foot-3Â 1â2-inch (5.575Â m) stretch is just before and just aft of the wing. With a 975,000Â lb (442,000Â kg) maximum take-off weight, it is to have a total payload capability of 308,000Â lb (140,000Â kg) and a range of 4,390Â nmi (8,130Â km).[94] Four extra pallet spaces were created on the main deck, with either two extra containers and two extra pallets, or three extra pallets, on the lower deck.[20] The 747-8F is expected to achieve a 16% lower ton-mile operating cost than the 747-400F and offer a slightly greater range.[95]",
