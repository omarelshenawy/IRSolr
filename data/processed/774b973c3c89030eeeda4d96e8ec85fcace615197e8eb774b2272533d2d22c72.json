				"previous": "In 1913, the Daily Mail newspaper put up a Â£10,000 prize for the first non-stop aerial crossing of the Atlantic which was soon \"enhanced by a further sum\" from the Women's Aerial League of Great Britain.",
				"after": "American businessman Rodman Wanamaker became determined that the prize should go to an American aircraft and commissioned the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company to design and build an aircraft capable of making the flight. Curtiss' development of the Flying Fish flying boat in 1913 brought him into contact with John Cyril Porte, a retired Royal Navy Lieutenant, aircraft designer and test pilot who was to become an influential British aviation pioneer. Recognising that many of the early accidents were attributable to a poor understanding of handling while in contact with the water, the pair's efforts went into developing practical hull designs to make the transatlantic crossing possible.[6]",
