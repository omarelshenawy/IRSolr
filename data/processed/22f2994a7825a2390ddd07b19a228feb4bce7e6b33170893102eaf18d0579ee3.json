Its original intended name was the \"International Music Hall\"[24] but this was changed to reflect the name of its neighbor, \"Radio City,\" as the new NBC Studios in the RCA Building were known. RCA was one of the complex's first and most important tenants and the entire Center itself was sometimes referred to as \"Radio City.\"",
