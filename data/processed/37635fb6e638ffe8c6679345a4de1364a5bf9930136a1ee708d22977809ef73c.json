Due to the rink's rounded corners, the total skating surface is 15,910 square feet (1,478Â m2),[30][31] which critic Blair Kamin called \"amply sized\".[11] For comparison, this is a considerably larger skating surface than the Rockefeller Center rink in New York City, which is 120 by 60 feet (37 by 18Â m).[32]",
