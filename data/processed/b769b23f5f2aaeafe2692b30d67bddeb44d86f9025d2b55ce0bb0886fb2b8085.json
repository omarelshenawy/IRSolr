				"after": "The European nightjar is crepuscular and nocturnal. During the day it rests on the ground, often in a partly shaded location, or perches motionless lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch. The cryptic plumage makes it difficult to see in the daytime, and birds on the ground, if they are not already in shade, will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow.[3][18] If it feels threatened, the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed, flying only when the intruder is 2â5Â m (7â16Â ft) away. It may call or wing clap as it goes, and land as far as 40Â m (130Â ft) from where it was flushed. In the wintering area it often roosts on the ground but also uses tree branches up to 20Â m (66Â ft) high. Roost sites at both the breeding and wintering grounds are used regularly if they are undisturbed, sometimes for weeks at a time.[19]",
