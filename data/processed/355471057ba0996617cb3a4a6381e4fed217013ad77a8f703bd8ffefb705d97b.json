				"after": "Many of the sunfish's various names allude to its flattened shape. Its specific name, mola, is Latin for \"millstone\", which the fish resembles because of its grey color, rough texture, and rounded body. Its common English name, sunfish, refers to the animal's habit of sunbathing at the surface of the water. The Dutch-, Portuguese-, French-, Catalan-, Spanish-, Italian-, Russian-, Greek- and German-language names, respectively maanvis, peixe lua, poisson lune, peix lluna, pez luna, pesce luna, ÑÑÐ±Ð°-Ð»ÑÐ½Ð°, ÏÎµÎ³Î³Î±ÏÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¿ and Mondfisch, mean \"moon fish\", in reference to its rounded shape. In German, the fish is also known as Schwimmender Kopf, or \"swimming head\". In Polish, it is named samogÅÃ³w, meaning \"head alone\", because it has no true tail. The Chinese translation of its academic name is fan-che yu ç¿»è»é­, meaning \"toppled wheel fish\". The ocean sunfish has various superseded binomial synonyms, and was originally classified in the pufferfish genus, as Tetraodon mola.[4][5] It is now placed in its own genus, Mola, with two species: Mola mola and Mola ramsayi. The ocean sunfish, Mola mola, is the type species of the genus.[6]",
