				"after": "According to architectural historian Willis L. Hall, the church's 20 large stained glass windows \"are as much a feature of the church as the mosaics\".[74] The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1863â1928) and fabricated by J&R Lamb Studios, his father's firm in New York City, took three years to complete,[9] and eight months to install at Stanford.[82] Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in \"the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work\".[83] The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest enterprise of its kind at the time, and the project is considered one of the best examples of Lamb's work.[70] Stanford chose the life of Christ for the windows' theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as Shields and DorÃ©. Her personal touch is shown in one of the nave windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a child into Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of Leland Stanford, Jr.,[9] the Stanfords' only child and the university's namesake, who died in 1884 of typhoid shortly before his 16th birthday.",
