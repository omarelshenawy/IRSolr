				"previous": "In the FTSE indices, share prices are weighted by market capitalisation, so that the larger companies make more of a difference to the index than smaller companies. The basic formula for these indices is:[11]",
				"after": "The Free float Adjustment factor represents the percentage of all issued shares that are readily available for trading. The factor is then rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%. To find the free-float capitalisation of a company, first find its market cap (number of shares x share price) then multiply by its free-float factor. Free-float capitalisation, therefore, does not include restricted stocks, such as those held by company insiders.",
