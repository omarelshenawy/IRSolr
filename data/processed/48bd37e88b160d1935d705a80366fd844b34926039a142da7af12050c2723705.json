				"after": "Love is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as racism, social alienation, death, world hunger, and spirituality. She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but Time magazine wrote: \"If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificialâNutraSweet soul. But her life has passion and conflict,\" applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material.[255] Jim Faber of the New York Daily News, made similar comments, \"For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.\"[256] While reviewing Music Box, Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with \"sustained passion\", while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes \"too overwhelmed to put her passion into words.\"[257] In 2001, The Village Voice wrote in regards to what they considered Carey's \"centerless ballads\", writing, \"Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [Diane] Warren ballads [.....] it's largely because of [Blige] that the new R&B demands a greater range of emotional expression, smarter poetry, more from-the-gut testifying, and less [sic] unnecessary notes than the squeaky-clean and just plain squeaky Mariah era. Nowadays it's the Christina Aguileras and Jessica Simpsons who awkwardly oversing, while the women with roof-raising lung power keep it in check when tune or lyric demands.\"[258]",
