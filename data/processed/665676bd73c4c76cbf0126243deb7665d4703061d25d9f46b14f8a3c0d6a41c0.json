				"previous": "In 1810âthe same year the Supreme Court moved into the lower floorâthe Senate moved into the second-story chamber. For the next 49 years, the Senate used the chamber until the completion of the north wing extension in 1859, when they moved to their present-day chamber. At its height, 64 senators met in the chamber.[1]",
				"after": "Many noted events that occurred in the chamber. Among them are the passage of the 1820 Missouri Compromise, the 1830 WebsterâHayne debate, and the Webster-Clay-Calhoun debates over the Compromise of 1850.[1] In 1856, Representative Preston Brooks beat Senator Charles Sumner nearly to death with a cane in the chamber. The attack occurred three days after Sumner, a strident abolitionist, attacked pro-slavery politicians, including Brooks' relative Senator Andrew Butler, in a speech. Brooks attacked Sumner as a matter of honor, beating him with a cane and injuring him so badly that he was absent from the Senate for nearly three years as he recovered.",
