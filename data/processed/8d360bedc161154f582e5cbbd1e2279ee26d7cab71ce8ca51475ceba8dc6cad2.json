				"previous": "In late 2010, simulated icing tests were performed on the MSN1 flight test aircraft using devices installed on the leading edges of the wing.[44] These revealed an aerodynamic issue causing buffeting of the horizontal tail, necessitating a six-week retrofit to install anti-icing equipment fed with engine bleed air;[44] production aircraft are to be similarly fitted.[44] Winter tests were done in Kiruna, Sweden during February 2011.[45]",
				"after": "By April 2011, a total of 1,400 flight hours over 450 flights had been achieved.[46] In May 2011 the A400M's EPI TP400-D6 engine received certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).[47] In May 2011, the A400M fleet had totaled 1,600 hours over 500 flights; by September 2011, the total increased to 2,100 hours and 684 flights.[48]",
