				"previous": "In the 20th century, Chew Stoke expanded slightly with the influx of residents from the Chew Valley Lake area. These new residents were moved to Chew Stoke when the lake was created in the 1950s.[2] In World War II, 42 children and three teachers, who had been evacuated from Avenmore school in London, were accommodated in the village.[5] On 10 July 1968, torrential rainfall, with 175 millimetres (7Â in) falling in 18 hours on Chew Stoke, double the area's average rainfall for the whole of July,[10] led to widespread flooding in the Chew Valley, and water reached the first floor of many buildings.[5] The damage in Chew Stoke was not as severe as in some of the surrounding villages, such as Pensford; however, fears that the Chew Valley Lake dam would be breached caused considerable anxiety.[10][11]",
				"after": "On 4 February 2001, Princess Anne opened the Rural Housing Trust development at Salway Close. Each year, over a weekend in September (usually the first), a \"Harvest Home\" is held with horse and pet shows, bands, a funfair, and other entertainments. The Harvest Home was cancelled in 1997 as a mark of respect following the death of Princess Diana in the previous week. The Radford's factory site, where refrigeration equipment was formerly manufactured, was identified as a brownfield site suitable for residential development in the 2002 Draft Local Plan of Bath and North East Somerset.[12] That plan has generated controversy about balancing land use to meet residential, social, and employment needs.[13]",
