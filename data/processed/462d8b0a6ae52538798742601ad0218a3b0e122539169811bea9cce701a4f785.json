				"after": "An EP (short for extended play) is a musical recording that contains more music than a single, but is usually too short to qualify as a full studio album or LP. The term EP originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) records and LP records,[1] but it is now applied to mid-length compact discs and music downloads as well. Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post said, \"EPsâoriginally extended-play 'single' releases that are shorter than traditional albumsâhave long been popular with punk and indie bands.\"[2] In the United Kingdom, the Official Chart Company defines a boundary between EP and album classification at 25 minutes of length or four tracks (not counting alternative versions of featured songs, if present).[3][4]",
