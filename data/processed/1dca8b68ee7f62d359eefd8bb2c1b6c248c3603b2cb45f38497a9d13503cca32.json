According to local myth, the area known as Kedu Plain is a Javanese \"sacred\" place and has been dubbed \"the garden of Java\" due to its high agricultural fertility.[18] During the restoration in the early 20th century, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, Pawon and Mendut, are positioned along a straight line.[19] A ritual relationship between the three temples must have existed, although the exact ritual process is unknown.[13]",
