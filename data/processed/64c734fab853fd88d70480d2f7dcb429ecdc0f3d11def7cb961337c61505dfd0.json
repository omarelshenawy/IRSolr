				"previous": "During the 1990s in Argentina, there appeared a stirnerist publication called El Ãnico: publicacion periÃ³dica de pensamiento individualista.[270][271][272]",
				"after": "Philosopher Murray Bookchin criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to democracy and its embrace of \"lifestylism\" at the expense of class struggle.[273] Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only negative liberty and rejects the idea of positive liberty.[274] Philosopher Albert Meltzer proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism, and that it \"is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'.\" He claimed that Benjamin Tucker's acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the \"employer's 'freedom'\") is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as \"no government.\"[275]",
