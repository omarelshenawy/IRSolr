				"previous": "Piracyâboth illicit in ancient Cilicia and China and state-supported among the Cretans, Vikings, Japanese, English, and Berbers[218]âhas remained a problem into the present day, given the expense involved in securely protecting every merchant vessel or in policing extensive coastlines.[219]",
				"after": "In the ancient world, in addition to Salamis, major naval engagements included the Battle of Actium, which permitted the establishment of Augustus's empire. In the modern era, important naval battles include the English victories against the Armada in 1588 and at Trafalgar in 1805,[220] which broke the threats of invasion by the superior land forces of the Spanish and French empires.",
