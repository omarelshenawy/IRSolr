				"previous": "The same day the British attacked Saint-Venant, forcing the SS-VT Division to retreat, the first time an SS unit had been forced to withdraw and relinquish ground.[29] On 26 May the German advance resumed. On 27 May the Deutschland regiment reached the allied defensive line on the Leie River at Merville. They forced a bridgehead across the river and waited for the SS Totenkopf Division to arrive to cover their flank. What arrived first was a unit of British tanks, which penetrated their positions. The SS-VT managed to hold on against the British tank force, which got to within 15 feet of commander Felix Steiner's position. Only the arrival of the Totenkopf PanzerjÃ¤ger platoon saved the Deutschland from being destroyed.[32]",
				"after": "At the same time, on 27 May another unit from the Totenkopf, the 14 Company, was involved in the Le Paradis massacre, where 99 men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment were machine gunned, with survivors finished off with bayonets.[20][33]",
