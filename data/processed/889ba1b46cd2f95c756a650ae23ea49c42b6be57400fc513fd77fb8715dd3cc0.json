There are 5.5Â million acres (22,000Â kmÂ²) in the Chippewa and Superior National Forests. The Superior National Forest in the northeast contains the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which encompasses over a million acres (4,000Â kmÂ²) and a thousand lakes. To its west is Voyageurs National Park. The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MNRRA), is a 72-mile-long (116Â km) corridor along the Mississippi River through the MinneapolisâSt. Paul Metropolitan Area connecting a variety of sites of historic, cultural, and geologic interest.[33]",
