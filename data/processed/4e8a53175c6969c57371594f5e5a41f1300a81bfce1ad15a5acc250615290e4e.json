				"At standard temperature and pressure, oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas with the molecular formula O 2.",
				"In this dioxygen, the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other. The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a bond order of two. More specifically, with reference to the molecular orbital diagram at right, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or Aufbau, filling of orbitals, and the resulting:"
