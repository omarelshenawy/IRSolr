				"after": "Like most other starlings, the hoopoe starling was omnivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongueâlong, slender, sharp, and frayedâmay have been able to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak. De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of \"Pseudobuxus\" (possibly Eugenia buxifolia, a bush with sweet, orange berries). He noted that the bird weighed 4 ounces (110Â g), and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on RÃ©union, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities. Its song was described as a \"bright and cheerful whistle\" and \"clear notes\", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings.[4]",
