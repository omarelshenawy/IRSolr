				"In Las Meninas, the king and queen are supposedly \"outside\" the painting, yet their reflection in the back wall mirror also places them \"inside\" the pictorial space.[50]",
				"Snyder proposes it is \"a mirror of majesty\" or an allusion to the mirror for princes. While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes \"it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character\" [51] Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that VelÃ¡zquez's portrait is \"the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princessâa mirror of the princess\" [52]"
