The earliest known European reference to the durian is the record of NiccolÃ² Da Conti, who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century.[44] Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti's travels: \"They (people of Sumatra) have a green fruit which they call durian, as big as a watermelon. Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, with a combination of flavours.\"[45] The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in ColÃ³quios dos simples e drogas da India published in 1563. In 1741, Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius.[9] During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the soursop (Annona muricata), for both of these species had thorny green fruit.[46] It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda, meaning Dutch durian.[47] In the 18th century, Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.[46]",
