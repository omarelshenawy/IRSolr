				"after": "The Australian magpie was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1802 as Coracias tibicen, the type collected in the Port Jackson region. Its specific epithet derived from the Latin tibicen \"flute-player\" or \"piper\" in reference to the bird's melodious call.[3][4] An early recorded vernacular name is Piping Roller, written on a painting by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter,[5] sometime between 1788 and 1792.[6] Tarra-won-nang,[5] or djarrawunang, wibung, and marriyang were names used by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin.[7] Booroogong and garoogong were Wiradjuri words, and carrak was a Jardwadjali term from Victoria.[8] Among the Kamilaroi, it is burrugaabu,[9] galalu, or guluu.[10] It was known as Warndurla among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara.[11] Other names used include piping crow-shrike, piper, maggie, flute-bird and organ-bird.[4] The term bell-magpie was proposed to help distinguish it from the European magpie but failed to gain wide acceptance.[12]",
