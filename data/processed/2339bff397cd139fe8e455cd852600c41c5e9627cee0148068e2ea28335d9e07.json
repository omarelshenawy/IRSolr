				"previous": "In January 1703, shortly after graduating from St. Michael's and being turned down for the post of organist at Sangerhausen,[21] Bach was appointed court musician in the chapel of Duke Johann ErnstÂ III in Weimar.[22] His role there is unclear, but likely included menial, non-musical duties. During his seven-month tenure at Weimar, his reputation as a keyboardist spread so much that he was invited to inspect the new organ, and give the inaugural recital, at St. Boniface's Church in Arnstadt, located about 30 kilometres (19Â mi) southwest of Weimar.[23] In August 1703, he became the organist at St. Boniface's, with light duties, a relatively generous salary, and a fine new organ tuned in the modern tempered system that allowed a wide range of keys to be used.",
				"after": "Despite strong family connections and a musically enthusiastic employer, tension built up between Bach and the authorities after several years in the post. Bach was dissatisfied with the standard of singers in the choir, while his employer was upset by his unauthorised absence from Arnstadt; Bach was gone for several months in 1705â06, to visit the great organist and composer Dieterich Buxtehude and his Abendmusiken at St.Â Mary's Church in the northern city of LÃ¼beck. The visit to Buxtehude involved a 450-kilometre (280Â mi) journey each way, reportedly on foot.[24]",
