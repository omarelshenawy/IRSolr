				"previous": "Two populations of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers of Montana are both at risk of extinction and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018.[2] Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15Â years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber dam every four to fiveÂ years to try and recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done in an effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.[38]",
				"after": "In Nebraska, a small number of pallid sturgeon have been captured along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri river system, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte River, between 1979 and 2003 over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River.[39] A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer months. By mid-summer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.",
