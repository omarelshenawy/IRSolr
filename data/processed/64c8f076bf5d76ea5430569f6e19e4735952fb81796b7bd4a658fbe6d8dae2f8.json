				"previous": "A letter sent in response to an inquiry by a thylacine-searcher, Murray McAllister, in 2000 indicated that the reward had been withdrawn.[99] In March 2005, Australian news magazine The Bulletin, as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations, offered a $1.25Â million reward for the safe capture of a live thylacine. When the offer closed at the end of June 2005 no one had produced any evidence of the animal's existence. An offer of $1.75Â million has subsequently been offered by a Tasmanian tour operator, Stewart Malcolm.[95] Trapping is illegal under the terms of the thylacine's protection, so any reward made for its capture is invalid, since a trapping licence would not be issued.[98]",
			"after": [
				"Records of all specimens, many of which are in European collections, are now held in the International Thylacine Specimen Database.",
				"The Australian Museum in Sydney began a cloning project in 1999.[100] The goal was to use genetic material from specimens taken and preserved in the early 20th century to clone new individuals and restore the species from extinction. Several molecular biologists have dismissed the project as a public relations stunt and its chief proponent, Professor Mike Archer, received a 2002 nomination for the Australian Skeptics Bent Spoon Award for \"the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudo-scientific piffle.\"[101]"
