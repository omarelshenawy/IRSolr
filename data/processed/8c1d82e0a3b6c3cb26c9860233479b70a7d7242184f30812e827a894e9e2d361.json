				"after": "In September 1933, after a complaint was made to the Senate Committee on Ocean Mail and Air Mail by radio journalist Fulton Lewis, Jr. that air mail contracts had been awarded to companies that had not submitted the lowest bids, its chairman, Alabama Senator and later U.S. Supreme Court justice, Hugo Black, agreed to establish a special Senate committee to investigate alleged improprieties and gaming of the rate structure, such as carriers padlocking individual pieces of mail to increase weight. Despite showings that Brown's administration of the air mail had increased the efficiency of the service and lowered its costs from $1.10 to $0.54 per mile,[1] and the obvious partisan politics involved in investigating what appeared to be a Republican scandal by a Democratic-controlled committee, the hearings raised serious questions regarding its legality and ethics.",
