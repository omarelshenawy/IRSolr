				"previous": "The First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the thirteen British Colonies in North America.[8] On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, referring to the new nation as the \"United States of America\". The Articles of Confederation in 1781 created a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions. With no executive or judiciary, and minimal authority, this government was weak[9] and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws.[10][11]",
				"after": "Government powerlessness led to the Convention of 1787 which proposed a revised constitution with a twoâchamber or bicameral congress.[12] Smaller states argued for equal representation for each state.[13] The two-chamber structure had functioned well in state governments.[5] A compromise plan was adopted with representatives chosen by population (benefitting larger states) and exactly two senators chosen by state governments (benefitting smaller states).[5][14] The ratified constitution created a federal structure with two overlapping power centers so that each citizen as an individual was subjected to both the power of state government and the national government.[15][16][17] To protect against abuse of power, each branch of governmentâexecutive, legislative, and judicialâhad a separate sphere of authority and could check other branches according to the principle of the separation of powers.[18] Furthermore, there were checks and balances within the legislature since there were two separate chambers.[19] The new government became active in 1789.[18][20]",
