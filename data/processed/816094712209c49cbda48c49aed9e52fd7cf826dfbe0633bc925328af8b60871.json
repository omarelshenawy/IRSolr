				"previous": "Although studies showed that turbojet engines are highly desirable for supersonic airliners, none were available. The Tu-144 prototype was therefore originally fitted with the inefficient Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofan engines and consequently suffered from higher nacelle aerodynamic drag. While this permitted early test flights, it did not permit cruising at Mach 2 without afterburner. A maximum cruising speed of 2,430Â km/h (1,510Â mph; 1,310Â kn) (Mach 2.29) was obtained with the afterburner.[7] This meant that while Concorde could supercruise (maintain supersonic flight without using its afterburners), the Tu-144 could not. Later work on the Tu-144S resolved this shortcoming.[8] The turbofan engines suffered from heavy fuel consumption, and hence a limited range of about 2,500Â km (1,600Â mi; 1,300Â nmi), far less range than the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 turbojet that powered Concorde.",
				"after": "The Tu-144S model, of which nine were produced, featured the Kuznetsov NK-144F turbofan engines that offered better fuel efficiency over the original engine. The four engines each had a maximum afterburning thrust of 200 kilonewtons (45,000Â lbf) and each had separate inlet ducts in each nacelle and variable intake ramps in the inlets,[9] giving a cruising speed of 2,000Â km/h (1,200Â mph; 1,100Â kn) (Mach 1.88). This also gave it a longer range of 3,080Â km (1,910Â mi; 1,660Â nmi), but still less than half the range of Concorde.[10]",
