				"after": "Rix twice visited north Africa. She first joined American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner, his wife and a Miss Simpson on a trip to Morocco in January 1912. They travelled via Spain, where Rix viewed the work of VelÃ¡zquez, whose compositions and palette she greatly admired.[30] The party's destination was Tangier, a place where many other artists had sought inspiration. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant lived and painted there in the 1870s, while Renoir and John Singer Sargent visited in the 1880s. Henri Matisse and Rix were in Tangier at the same time,[31] during which both visited TÃ©touan, about 60 kilometres (37Â mi) east of Tangier;[32] they also used the same model in their works.[33]",
