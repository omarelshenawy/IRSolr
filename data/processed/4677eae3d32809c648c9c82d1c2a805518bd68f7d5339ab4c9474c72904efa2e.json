				"previous": "The municipality of ZÃ¼rich has an area of 91.88Â km2 (35.48Â sqÂ mi), of which 4.1Â km2 (1.6Â sqÂ mi) is made up of Lake ZÃ¼rich. The area includes a section of the northern Swiss Plateau. The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast-northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of two to three kilometres. The partially channelled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The River Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in Oberengstringen at 392Â m (1,286Â ft) above sea level.",
				"after": "On its west side the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the Albis chain, which runs along the western border. The Ãetliberg is, with 869Â m (2,851Â ft) above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the Uetlibergbahn. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake and the Alps can be seen.",
