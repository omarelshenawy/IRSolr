				"previous": "As collective combat experience grew, the more successful pilots such as Oswald Boelcke, Max Immelmann, and Edward Mannock developed innovative tactical formations and maneuvers to enhance their air units' combat effectiveness.",
				"after": "Allied andâbefore 1918âGerman pilots of World War I were not equipped with parachutes, so in-flight fires or structural failure were often fatal. Parachutes were well-developed by 1918 having previously been used by balloonists, and were adopted by the German flying services during the course of that year (the famous \"Red Baron\" was wearing one when he was killed), but the allied command continued to oppose their use on various grounds.[5]",
