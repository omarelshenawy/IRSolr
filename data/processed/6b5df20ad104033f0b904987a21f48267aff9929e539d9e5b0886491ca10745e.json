On 12 April 1961, Yuri Gagarin wore a Shturmanskie (a transliteration of Ð¨ÑÑÑÐ¼Ð°Ð½ÑÐºÐ¸Ðµ which actually means ânavigatorâsâ) wristwatch during his historic first flight into space. The Shturmanskie was manufactured at the First Moscow Factory. Since 1964, the watches of the First Moscow Factory have been marked by the trademark âÐÐ¾Ð»ÑÑâ, transliterated as âPOLJOTâ, which means âflightâ in Russian and is a tribute to the many space trips its watches have accomplished. In the late 1970s, Poljot launched a new chrono movement, the 3133. With a 23 jewel movement and manual winding (43 hours), it was a modified Russian version of the Swiss Valjoux 7734 of the early 1970s. Poljot 3133 were taken into space by astronauts from Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine. On the arm of Valeriy Polyakov, a Poljot 3133 chronograph movement-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history.[52]",
