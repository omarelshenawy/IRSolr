				"after": "The Green is a five-acre (two-hectare) plot located in the center of downtown Hanover, New Hampshire.[2][4] It is crossed by seven gravel walking paths, the locations of which varied until about 1931, when the configuration was last altered.[2] Three of them bisect the Green, running southwest to northeast, northwest to southeast, and east to west. The northernmost of its two east-west paths was added after Massachusetts Hall was constructed in 1907, and links the central entrance to that dormitory west of the Green to the northern entrance to Dartmouth Hall, east of it.[2] Two paths run from the northwest and southwest corners respectively to the middle of the Green's eastern edge. A final path runs north-south along the eastern side. The Green also has paved sidewalks along its southern and western edges.",
