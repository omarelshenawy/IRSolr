				"The 172M of 1973â76 gained a drooped wing leading edge for improved low speed handling. This was marketed as the \"camber-lift\" wing.",
				"The 1974 172M was also the first to introduce the optional 'II' package which offered higher standard equipment, including a second nav/comm radio, an ADF and transponder. The baggage compartment was increased in size and nose-mounted dual landing lights were available as an option.[14]"
