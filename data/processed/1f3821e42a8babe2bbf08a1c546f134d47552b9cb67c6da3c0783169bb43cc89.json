				"previous": "Unique factorization can be partially recovered for O in that it has the property of unique factorization of ideals into prime ideals (i.e. it is a Dedekind domain). This makes the study of the prime ideals in O particularly important. This is another area where things change from Z to O: the prime numbers, which generate prime ideals of Z (in fact, every single prime ideal of Z is of the form (p):=pZ for some prime number p,) may no longer generate prime ideals in O. For example, in the ring of Gaussian integers, the ideal 2Z[i] is no longer a prime ideal; in fact",
				"after": "On the other hand, the ideal 3Z[i] is a prime ideal. The complete answer for the Gaussian integers is obtained by using a theorem of Fermat's, with the result being that for an odd prime number p",
