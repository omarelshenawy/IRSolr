The angled shell design seats have 58-62\" of pitch and a width of 20-21.5\". Seats have lumbar massage and are equipped with 10 to 15\" AVOD screens. Prior to refurbishment, older generation Royal Silk seats on some Boeing 747-400s were sold as Premium Economy Class seats on routes to Scandinavian countries. A new set of Royal Silk seats is expected with the arrival of THAI's Airbus A380s and new Boeing 777-300ERs scheduled for delivery beginning in late 2012. The new seats allow for a fully horizontal recline at 180 degrees.",
