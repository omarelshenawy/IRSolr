Interstate Highways are numbered in a gridâeven-numbered routes are eastâwest routes (but the lowest numbers are along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico), and odd-numbered routes are northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean). US Highways are also numbered in a gridâeven numbered for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). There are 21 Interstate highways in California ranging from Interstate 5 to Interstate 980. There are seven current U.S. highways including U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 395.",
