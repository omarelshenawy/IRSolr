				"previous": "The airline had 5,384 employees at MarchÂ 2000Â (2000-03). At this time, the aircraft park consisted of two Airbus A310-300s, four Airbus A340-200s, four Boeing 737-200s, Boeing 737-200 Advanced, one Boeing 737-200C and nine Boeing 747-200Bs, whereas six Airbus A340-600s were on order.[nb 2] The list of international destinations served at the time was AsunciÃ³n, Auckland, BogotÃ¡, CancÃºn, Caracas, Florianopolis, Lima, Madrid, Mexico City, Miami, Montevideo, New York, Orlando, Paris, Punta del Este, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Santiago, SÃ£o Paulo and Sydney; domestic services to Catamarca, Comodoro Rivadavia, Cordoba, Corrientes, Esquel, Iguazu, Jujuy, La Rioja, Mar del Plata, Mendoza, Neuquen, Posadas, President Roque Saenz Pena, Resistencia, Rio Gallegos, Rio Grande, Rosario, Salta, San Carlos de Bariloche, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, Trelew, Tucuman, Ushuaia and Villa Gesell were also operated.[66]",
				"after": "Allegations of corruption were made on the basis of the price paid by Iberia and the Spanish firm's ulterior conduct (including some convoluted lease-back operations), with the airline paying the price for its own purchase with its assets.[44] Subsequent management by American Airlines and SEPI drove AerolÃ­neas Argentinas into an almost terminal crisis in 2001.[54][67] In JuneÂ 2001Â (2001-06), the aftermath began after the airline filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors,[68] and went into administration;[69] the salaries were paid by the Argentine Government, instead of using money coming from the SEPI.[70] The payment of salaries for the upcoming months was suspended, as the mechanics union refused to accept the reorganisation plan raised by the SEPI to keep the company afloat.[71][72][73] On 6 June,[74] flights to Auckland, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, SÃ£o Paulo, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro were halted.[45][75] Owing to a US$15Â million debt with the fuel supplier,[76] the suspension of the daily flight to Madrid, which also served Rome and was the last connection with Europe,[77] followed a week later.[74] After this, most of the fleet was grounded, and only 30% and 10% of domestic and international flights, respectively, were operating.[69]",
