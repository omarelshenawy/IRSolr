				"after": "The first Great House known to evince fastidious proportioning and alignment was Casa Rinconada: the twinned \"T\"-shaped portals of its 10Â m (33Â ft)-radius great kiva were north-south collinear, and axes joining opposing windows passed within 10Â cm (4Â in) of its center.[75] The Great Houses of Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl were found by the \"Solstice Project\" and the U.S. National Geodetic Survey to be sited along a precisely east-west line, an axis that captures the passage of the equinox sun. The lines perpendicularly bisecting their principal walls are aligned north-south, implying a possible intent to mirror the equinox midday. Pueblo Alto and Tsin Kletsin are also north-south aligned. These two axes form an inverted cross when viewed from above; its northbound reach is extended another 35Â mi (56Â km) past Pueblo Alto by the ramrod-straight \"Great North Road\", a pilgrimage route which modern-day Pueblo Indians believe to be an allusion to myths surrounding their arrival from the distant north.[9]",
