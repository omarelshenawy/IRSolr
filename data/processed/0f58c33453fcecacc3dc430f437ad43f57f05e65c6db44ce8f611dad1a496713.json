				"after": "The earliest known specimen collection of B.Â cuneata was made by Julia Wells some time before 1880. What would later become the type specimen for the species was collected by Western Australian botanist and Banksia expert Alex George on 20 November 1971, from Badjaling Nature Reserve, about 8Â km (5Â mi) east of Quairading, at 31Â°59â²S 117Â°30â²Eï»¿ / ï»¿31.983Â°S 117.500Â°Eï»¿ / -31.983; 117.500ï»¿ (Type locality of Banksia cuneata).[5] The species was finally published by George nearly a decade later, in his 1981 monograph \"The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)\". The specific epithet is from the Latin cuneatus (\"wedge-shaped\"), in reference to the shape of the leaves.[3]",
