				"after": "Crosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone, rather than using the deep, loud \"vaudeville style\" associated with Al Jolson and others.[36] Crosby's love and appreciation of jazz music helped bring the genre to a wider mainstream audience. Within the framework of the novelty-singing style of the Rhythm Boys, Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was firmly rooted in jazz. He had already been introduced to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith prior to his first appearance on record. Crosby and Armstrong would remain professionally friendly for decades, notably in the 1956 film High Society, where they sang the duet \"Now You Has Jazz\".",
