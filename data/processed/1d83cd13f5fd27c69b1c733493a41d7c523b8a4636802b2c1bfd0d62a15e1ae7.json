				"previous": "Following the intentional deorbiting of Mir on 23 March 2001, the ISS became the only space station in orbit around Earth; it retained this distinction until the launch of Tiangong-1 on 29 September 2011.[41] Mirââ'âs legacy lives on in the station, bringing together five space agencies in the cause of exploration and allowing those space agencies to prepare for their next leap into space, to the Moon, Mars and beyond.[42]",
				"after": "Criticism of the program was primarily concerned with the safety of the aging Mir, particularly following the fire aboard the station and collision with the Progress supply vessel in 1997.[8]",
