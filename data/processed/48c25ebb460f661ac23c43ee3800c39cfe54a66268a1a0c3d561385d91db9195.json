				"previous": "(with different domain) is not considered the same function, even though the formulas defining f and g agree, and similarly with a different codomain. Despite that, many authors drop the specification of the domain and codomain, especially if these are clear from the context. So in this example many just write f(x) = 4 â x. Sometimes, the maximal possible domain is also understood implicitly: a formula such as may mean that the domain of f is the set of real numbers x where the square root is defined (in this case xÂ â¤Â 2 or xÂ â¥Â 3).[5]",
