				"after": "The first botanical collection of this species may well have been Claude Riche, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's 1791 expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-FranÃ§ois de Galaup, comte de La PÃ©rouse. During a visit to Esperance Bay, Riche explored an area in which B.Â speciosa is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections.[7] The species was eventually collected by Robert Brown in 1802, and published by him in 1810.[1][8] Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at Lucky Bay to be the lectotype in 1981.[3] An early common name was handsome banksia.[9] Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves.[4]",
