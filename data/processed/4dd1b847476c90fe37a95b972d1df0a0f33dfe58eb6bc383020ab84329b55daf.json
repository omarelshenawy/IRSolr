				"after": "Starfish are widespread in the oceans, but are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste,[72] and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous.[128] Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning.[129] Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but on the island of \"Huamobel\" [sic] the people cut them up, squeeze out the \"black blood\" and cook them with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk.[121] Starfish are sometimes eaten in China,[130] Japan[131][132] and in Micronesia.[133]",
