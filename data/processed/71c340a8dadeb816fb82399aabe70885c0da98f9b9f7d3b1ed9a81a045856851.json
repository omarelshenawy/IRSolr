				"after": "After N.W.A broke up, Dr. Dre (a former member) released The Chronic in 1992, which peaked at #1 on the R&B/hip hop chart,[85] #3 on the pop chart and spawned a #2 pop single with \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang.\" The Chronic took West Coast rap in a new direction,[86] influenced strongly by P funk artists, melding smooth and easy funk beats with slowly drawled lyrics. This came to be known as G-funk and dominated mainstream hip hop for several years through a roster of artists on Death Row Records, including Tupac Shakur, whose double disc album All Eyez on Me was a big hit with hit songs \"Ambitionz az a Ridah\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\",[citation needed] and Snoop Dogg, whose Doggystyle included the songs \"What's My Name?\" and \"Gin and Juice\", both top ten hits.[87] As the Los Angeles-based label Death Row Records built an empire around Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and the rapper-actor Tupac Shakur. It also entered into a rivalry with New York Cityâs Bad Boy Records. (See the article on the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry.)",
