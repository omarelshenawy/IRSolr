				"previous": "In 1898 a friend of Watts suggested to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF it would make a suitable site for Watts's memorial. Watts was approached, and agreed to the suggestion.[38][n 10] On 13Â October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining Â£3,000 were raised, Watts would design and build a covered way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people.[47] Watts planned to build a covered way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported on stone or timber columns.[46]",
				"after": "The MPGA were not consulted about the proposal, and the following week Lord Meath wrote to The Times and the City Press to complain about the scheme. He argued that the MPGA had devoted large amounts of time and money to prevent the park from being built on, and that while Watts's proposal was \"worthy of all encouragement and support\", Postman's Park, at less than one acre (0.4Â ha) and surrounded by tall buildings, was an inappropriate site.[38] The three-sided design was abandoned, in favour of a 50-foot (15Â m) long and 9-foot (2.7Â m) tall wooden loggia with a tiled roof, designed by Ernest George. The supporting wall contained space for 120 memorial tablets.[46] St Botolph's Aldersgate secured the necessary funds to complete the purchase of the CPF land, and Watts agreed to pay the Â£700 (about Â£69,000 as of 2015) construction costs himself.[36][48]",
