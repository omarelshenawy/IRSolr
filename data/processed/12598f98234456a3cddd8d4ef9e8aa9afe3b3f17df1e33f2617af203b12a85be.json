In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \"close to best overall health care\" in the world.[249] The French healthcare system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[250][251] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[252] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the US. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies.[253]",
