				"previous": "On 7 July 1720, while Bach was on travel to Carlsbad with Prince Leopold, Bach's first wife suddenly died.[40] The following year, he met Anna Magdalena Wilcke, a young, highly gifted soprano seventeen years his junior, who performed at the court in KÃ¶then; they married on 3 December 1721.[41] Together they had thirteen more children, six of whom survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726â81), who married Bach's pupil Johann Christoph Altnickol; Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian, who both became significant musicians; Johanna Carolina (1737â81); and Regina Susanna (1742â1809).[42]",
