				"previous": "Only JulyÂ 1, the system's circulation became broad, with most of the convection located west of the center.[3] The next day, Chataan briefly weakened to an intensity of 85Â km/h (50Â mph), although it began strengthening steadily on JulyÂ 3,[6] when its center passed very near Weno in Chuck State in the FSM. At 1800Â UTC that night, the JTWC upgraded Chataan to a typhoon,[3] and about 24Â hours later the JMA followed suit while the storm was approaching Guam from the southeast.[6] At about 2130Â UTC on JulyÂ 4, the eye of Chataan moved across northern Guam in about two hours, although the center of the eye passed north of the island.[3]",
				"after": "After affecting Guam, Chataan continued toward the northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000Â UTC on JulyÂ 8, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 175Â km/h (110Â mph 10-minute sustained) while located near the Japanese island of Okinotorishima.[6] The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240Â km/h (150Â mph 1-minute sustained) about six hours earlier; on that basis, the agency classified the system as a super typhoon. On JulyÂ 8, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18Â hours.[5] On JulyÂ 9 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530Â UTC on JulyÂ 10, Chataan made landfall on the BÅsÅ Peninsula in Honshu with winds of about 100Â km/h (65Â mph 10-minute sustained). The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern Hokkaido at 1200Â UTC on JulyÂ 11;[6] this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28Â years.[7] A few hours later, Chataan became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Okhotsk, where the remnants stalled before dissipating on JulyÂ 13 near Sakhalin.[6]",
