				"after": "Genetic drift is the change in allele frequency from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles are subject to sampling error.[138] As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to \"drift\" upward or downward randomly (in a random walk). This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed, either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.[139]",
