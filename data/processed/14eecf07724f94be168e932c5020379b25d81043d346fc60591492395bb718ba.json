				"previous": "The unimproved airfield remains a phenomenon in military aspects. The DHC-4 Caribou served in the U.S. military in Vietnam (designated as the CV-2), landing on rough, unimproved airfields where the C-130 workhorse could not operate. Earlier, the Ju-52 and Fieseler Storch could do the same, one example of the latter taking off from the FÃ¼hrerbunker whilst completely surrounded by Russian troops.",
				"after": "An airport is an aerodrome certificated for commercial flights.",
