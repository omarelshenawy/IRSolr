				"A controllable-pitch propeller (CPP) or variable-pitch propeller is a type of propeller with blades that can be rotated around their long axis to change the blade pitch. Reversible propellersâthose where the pitch can be set to negative valuesâcan also create reverse thrust for braking or going backwards without the need to change the direction of shaft revolution."

			"after": [
				"Propellers whose blade pitch could be adjusted while the aircraft was on the ground were used by a number of early aviation pioneers,[1] including A. V. Roe and Louis Breguet.",
				"The French aircraft firm Levasseur displayed a variable-pitch propeller at the 1921 Paris Airshow which it claimed had been tested by the French government in a ten-hour run and could change pitch at any engine RPM.[2]"
