				"after": "The route of the Strand on the southern boundary of what was to become Covent Garden was used during the Roman period as part of a route to Silchester, known as \"Iter VII\" on the Antonine Itinerary.[6][7] Excavations in 2006 at St Martin-in-the-Fields revealed a Roman grave, suggesting the site had sacred significance.[8] The area to the north of the Strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century, but theories by Alan Vince and Martin Biddle that there had been an Anglo-Saxon settlement to the west of the old Roman town of Londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005. These revealed Covent Garden as the centre of a trading town called Lundenwic, developed around 600 AD,[9] which stretched from Trafalgar Square to Aldwych.[3] Alfred the Great gradually shifted the settlement into the old Roman town of Londinium from around 886 AD onwards, leaving no mark of the old town, and the site returned to fields.[10]",
