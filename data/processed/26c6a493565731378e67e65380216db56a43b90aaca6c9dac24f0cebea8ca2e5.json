The universality states that given any vector space X and any bilinear map gÂ : V Ã W â X, there exists a unique map u, shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose composition with f equals g: u(v â w) = g(v, w).[44] This is called the universal property of the tensor product, an instance of the methodâmuch used in advanced abstract algebraâto indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.",
