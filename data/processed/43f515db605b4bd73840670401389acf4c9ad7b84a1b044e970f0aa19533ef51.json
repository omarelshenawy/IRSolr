				"after": "In 1993, Oman Air was founded. The airline's first flight was in March, when a wet-leased Boeing 737-300 from Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services (AWAS) flew from Muscat to Salalah.[6] In July of the same year, the airline's first international flight was operated to Dubai, also using a Boeing 737â300.[5] Flights to other destinations quickly followed, with Trivandrum services starting in November, Kuwait and Karachi in January 1994, and Colombo in October.[5] In 1995, two Airbus A320s were wet-leased from Region Air of Singapore to replace the 737s. From 1995 to 1997, services were commenced to Mumbai, Dhaka, Abu Dhabi, Doha and Chennai. In October 1998, Oman Air was admitted in the international aviation industry trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA). By the end of the following year, Gwader, Peshawar, Jeddah and Al-Ain were included in the airline's ever-expanding route network, although the former two, along with a host of other destinations, were withdrawn in 2000.[5]",
