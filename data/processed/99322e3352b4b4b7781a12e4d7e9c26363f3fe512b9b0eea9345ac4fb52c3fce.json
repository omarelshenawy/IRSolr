				"previous": "Even after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war. German intelligence reported to Franco and the Nationalists that the French military was engaging in open discussions about intervention in the war through French military intervention in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.[150] In 1938, Franco feared an immediate French intervention against a potential Nationalist victory in Spain through French occupation of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Spanish Morocco.[151]",
				"after": "A large air and sealift of Nationalist troops in Spanish Morocco was organized to the southwest of Spain.[152] Coup leader Sanjurjo was killed in a plane crash on 20 July,[153][154] leaving an effective command split between Mola in the North and Franco in the South.[46] This period also saw the worst actions of the so-called \"Red\" and \"White Terrors\" in Spain.[155][156] On 21 July, the fifth day of the rebellion, the Nationalists captured the central Spanish naval base, located in Ferrol in northwestern Spain.[157]",
