				"previous": "The Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line. It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay. The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the Mesozoic era.[19] The region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the Southwest Mountains around Charlottesville.[20] The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the state, the tallest being Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet (1,746Â m).[21] The Ridge and Valley region is west of the mountains and includes the Great Appalachian Valley. The region is carbonate rock based and includes Massanutten Mountain.[22] The Cumberland Plateau and the Cumberland Mountains are in the southwest corner of Virginia, south of the Allegheny Plateau. In this region, rivers flow northwest, with a dendritic drainage system, into the Ohio River basin.[23]",
				"after": "The Virginia Seismic Zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5Â in magnitude, because Virginia is located away from the edges of the North American Plate. The largest earthquake, at an estimated 5.9Â magnitude, was in 1897 near Blacksburg.[25] A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral. The earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as Toronto, Atlanta and Florida.[26]",
