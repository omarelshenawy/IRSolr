				"after": "To the north of the central campus area, along Columbia Road, sits the School of Medicine complex. The main School of Medicine building is the remodeled St. Michael's Hospital building which was built in 1951.[24] Other buildings in the medical school complex include the Biomedical Research Center and the Neuroscience Research Facility.[24] Further north sits an area that is called University Village. This land sat virtually empty for decades, but has recently been developed for UND, commercial, and residential purposes.[27] University Village is anchored by the $100 million Ralph Engelstad Arena, which is used by both the men's and women's hockey teams. University Village is also home to the Betty Engelstad Sioux Center, the new Student Wellness Center, university apartments, the UND bookstore, a medical clinic, and several residential and commercial properties.",
