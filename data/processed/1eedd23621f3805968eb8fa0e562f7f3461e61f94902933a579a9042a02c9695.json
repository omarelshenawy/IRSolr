				"previous": "On a broader level, cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise of cognitive psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, researchers in artificial intelligence, linguists, humanâcomputer interaction, computational neuroscience, logicians and social scientists. Computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest.",
				"after": "Starting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques developed by Wundt, James, Ebbinghaus, and others re-emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivistâconcerned with information and its processingâand, eventually, constituted a part of the wider cognitive science.[90] Some called this development the cognitive revolution because it rejected the anti-mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis.[90]",
