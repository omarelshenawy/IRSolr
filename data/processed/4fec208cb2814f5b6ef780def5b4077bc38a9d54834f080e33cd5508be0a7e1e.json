				"after": "The actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown.[109] It depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the Svear (Sweonas) ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the Svear and the GÃ¶tar (Geats) of GÃ¶taland being united under one ruler. In the first case, Sweden was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. However, historians usually start the line of Swedish monarchs from when Svealand and GÃ¶taland were ruled under the same king, namely Eric the Victorious (Geat) and his son Olof SkÃ¶tkonung in the 10th century. These events are often described as the consolidation of Sweden, although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later.",
