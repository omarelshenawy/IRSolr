				"previous": "The sale of Grupo Cintra was scheduled after several delays in September 1999, and with the looming presidential elections in 2000, everything was delayed once again. The ruling party lost the election after 70 years in office and all the policies changed. Due to the recession in 2000 the new government put everything on hold waiting for better economic conditions to start the stock sell-off, and just when they were everything was about to start, the 11 September 2001 attacks occurred and nothing materialized since the two main carriers Mexicana and AeromÃ©xico (as most Legacy carriers) were losing large amounts of money.",

				"In the period between 2000 and 2005 AeromÃ©xico had an average fleet of 60 aircraft in main line, plus 20 in Aerolitoral, as well as five CEO's during this time. After 9/11 and the Iraq War, it was forced to put in movement an ambitious fleet renovation program. In 2003, the airline acquired its first Boeing 737-700 instead of the Boeing 717 as a replacement for its aging DC-9 aircraft. On 29 March 2006 AeromÃ©xico CEO, AndrÃ©s Conesa announced the inauguration of direct flights between Japan and Mexico City via Tijuana. This was after the purchase of two Boeing 777-200ER, making AeromÃ©xico the third airline in Latin America to fly regularly to Asia, after Varig and the now defunct VASP. However, because of Varig's redimention, AeromÃ©xico is currently the sole airline with this service until some other Latin American airline starts flying to Asia. AeromÃ©xico has resumed its Mexico City-Tijuana-Shanghai route twice a week as of 30 March 2010. Suspension of this flight was due to the 2009 flu pandemic."
