Its GDP per capita of USD $20,300 (2011) is one of the highest in the Caribbean.[41] In November 2011, the OECD removed Trinidad and Tobago from its list of Developing Countries.[42] Trinidad's economy is strongly influenced by the petroleum industry. Tourism and manufacturing are also important to the local economy. Tourism is a growing sector, although not as proportionately important as in many other Caribbean islands. Agricultural products include citrus and cocoa.",
