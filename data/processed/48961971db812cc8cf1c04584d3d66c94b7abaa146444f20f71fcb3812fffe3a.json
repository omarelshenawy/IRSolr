				"after": "Despite the name, Blakeney Point, like most of the northern part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea.[1] The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4Â km (4Â mi) long,[2] and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20Â m (65Â ft) in width and up to 10Â m (33Â feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3Â millionÂ m3 (82Â millionÂ ft3) of shingle in the spit,[3] 97Â per cent of which is derived from flint.[4]",
