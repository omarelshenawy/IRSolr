				"previous": "On 8 August 1962,[3]:210 Kuwait Airways became the first foreign customer in ordering the Trident when two aircraft of the type were acquired, and an option for a third was taken. The deal was valued at Â£5.5Â million, and also included a Comet 4C. At the same time, the carrier had also a Â£3Â million order in place for three BAC One-Elevens, with an option for a fourth.[10]:221 The airline took delivery of the first Comet of its own in JanuaryÂ 1963Â (1963-01),[11][12] but Comet operations had started in July the previous year with an aircraft on lease from MEA.[13]:225 In AugustÂ 1963Â (1963-08), a second Comet was ordered.[14][15] The delivery of this second airframe established an unofficial record in early 1964, when it flew between London and Kuwait, a distance of 2,888 miles (4,648Â km), at 461 miles per hour (742Â km/h) on average.[16] On 1 June 1963, the government increased its participation in the airline to 100%.[17] In MarchÂ 1964Â (1964-03), the carrier added its first European destination to the route network when flights to London were inaugurated using Comet equipment; from that time, services between London and some points in the Middle East, including Abadan, Bahrain, Beirut, Dhahran, Doha and Kuwait, started being operated in a pool agreement between the carrier and BOAC and MEA.[18][19] A month later, the airline absorbed Trans Arabia Airways.[20]:855[21]",
				"after": "At AprilÂ 1965Â (1965-04), the route network had expanded to include Abadan, Baghdad, Bahrain, Beirut, Bombay, Cairo, Damascus, Doha, Frankfurt, Geneva, Jerusalem, Karachi, London, Paris and Teheran. At this time, the fleet was comprised two Comet 4Cs, three DC-6Bs, two Twin Pioneers and three Viscount 700s; the carrier had two Trident 1Es and three One-Elevens pending delivery.[17] The first Trident was handed over by the aircraft manufacturer in MarchÂ 1966Â (1966-03),[23] and the second followed in May the same year.[24] In the interim, a third aircraft of the type was ordered.[24] On the other hand, the One-Elevens were never delivered: in JanuaryÂ 1966Â (1966-01) the carrier stated that the simultaneous introduction of both types of aircraft was not possible due to a tightened budget, and postponed their delivery;[25] it was informed late that year that the airline would not take them.[26][nb 4] Three Boeing 707-320Cs were ordered in NovemberÂ 1967Â (1967-11).[22] The carrier made its first profit ever in 1968, with a net income of Â£910,000.[28]",
