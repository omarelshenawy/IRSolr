				"after": "The viewers first see Madonna who runs on the street. She witnesses the murder of a young woman, but is too frozen in fear to protest.[65] A black man walking down the alley notices the incident and decides to help the woman, but the police arrive and arrest him. The murderers give a threatening look towards Madonna and leave.[65] She escapes to a church and sees a caged saint who resembles the black man on the street. As the song starts, Madonna utters a prayer in front of the saint, who appears to be crying.[65]",
