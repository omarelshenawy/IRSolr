Soon after the second Nephite evacuation of Lehi-Nephi, these Nephites were en route to Zarahemla when they came to âa place which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.â This place of Mormon contained a beautiful fountain of pure waterâ near which the prophet Almaâa fugitive from King Noahâs courtââdid hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the kingâ and preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ to âas many as believed himâ.",
