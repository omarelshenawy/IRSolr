				"previous": "In preparation to produce the A330 and A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. In England, BAe made a Â£7Â million investment in a three-storey technical centre with 15,000Â m2 (160,000Â sqÂ ft) of floor area at Filton.[30] BAe also spent Â£5Â million on a new production line at its Chester wing production plant.[30] In Germany, Messerschmitt-BÃ¶lkow-Blohm (MBB) invested DM400Â million ($225Â million) on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary, including at Bremen, Einswarden, Varel, and Hamburg.[31] France saw the biggest investments, with AÃ©rospatiale constructing a new Fr.2.5Â billion ($411Â million) final-assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Colomiers; by November 1988, the pillars for the new ClÃ©ment Ader assembly hall had been erected.[32] The assembly process featured increased automation, such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing-to-fuselage mating process.[33]",
				"after": "On 12 March 1987, Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet. The domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options, while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft, split evenly between firm orders and options.[16][34] Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330 and A340 programmes by April 1987, with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330 deliveries to start in 1993. Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March.[34]",
