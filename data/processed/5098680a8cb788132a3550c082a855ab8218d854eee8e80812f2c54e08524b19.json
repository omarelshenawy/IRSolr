				"after": "Shortly after the attacks, President Bush made a public appearance at Washington's largest Islamic Center and acknowledged the \"incredibly valuable contribution\" that millions of American Muslims made to their country and called for them \"to be treated with respect.\"[194] However, numerous incidents of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians were reported in the days following the attacks.[195][196][197] Sikhs were also targeted because Sikh males usually wear turbans, which are stereotypically associated with Muslims. There were reports of attacks on mosques and other religious buildings (including the firebombing of a Hindu temple), and assaults on people, including one murder: Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh mistaken for a Muslim, was fatally shot on September 15, 2001, in Mesa, Arizona.[197]",
