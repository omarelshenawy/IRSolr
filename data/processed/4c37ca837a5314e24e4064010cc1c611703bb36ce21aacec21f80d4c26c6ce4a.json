				"previous": "In 1908, Frankel sold the diamond for $400,000[39] to a Salomon or Selim Habib, a wealthy Turkish diamond collector,[40] reportedly in behalf of Sultan Abdulhamid of Ottoman Empire; however, on June 24, 1909, the stone was included in an auction of Habib's assets to settle his own debts,[9] and the auction catalog explicitly stated that the Hope Diamond was one of only two gems in the collection which had never been owned by the Sultan. A contrary report, however, suggested that Sultan Abdul Hamid did own the gem but ordered Habib to sell it when his throne \"began to totter.\"[11] Habib reportedly sold the stone in Paris in 1909 for $80,000.[11] The Parisian jewel merchant Simon Rosenau bought the Hope Diamond for 400,000 francs and resold it in 1910 to Pierre Cartier for 550,000 francs. In 1910, it was offered for $150,000, according to one report.[10]",
				"after": "Pierre Cartier tried to sell the Hope Diamond to Washington D.C. socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean and her husband in 1910.[2] Cartier was a consummate salesman who used an understated presentation to entice Mrs. McLean.[41] He described the gem's illustrious history to her while keeping it concealed underneath special wrapping paper.[41] The suspense worked: McLean became impatient to the point where she suddenly requested to see the stone. She recalled later that Cartier \"held before our eyes the Hope Diamond.\"[41] Nevertheless, she initially rejected the offer. Cartier had it reset. She found the stone much more appealing in this new modern style. There were conflicting reports about the sale in the New York Times; one account suggested that the young McLean couple had agreed to purchase the diamond, but after having learned about its unfortunate supposed history, the couple had wanted to back out of the deal[42] since they knew nothing of the \"history of misfortunes that have beset its various owners.\"[42]",
