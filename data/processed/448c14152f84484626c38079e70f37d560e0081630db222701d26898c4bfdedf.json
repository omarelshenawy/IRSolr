				"after": "The music video was released on picture messaging application Snapchat on February 5, 2015, where it was available for viewing on the application's \"Snap Channel\" platform.[64] Madonna became the first artist to premiere her video on Snapchat. The video was deleted after 24 hours, in lieu of Snapchat's self-destructing ethos, and was later uploaded on Madonna's Vevo channel.[70] Sara Spary from Marketing Week commended the decision, believing it to be \"a major move for Snapchat and the decision by Madonna's label could pave the way for other label giants to host content on the app as well as other branded content.\"[71]",
