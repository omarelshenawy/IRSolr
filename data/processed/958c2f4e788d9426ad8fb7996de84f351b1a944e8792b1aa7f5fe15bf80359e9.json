				"As the other square root is simply â1 times the principal square root, both roots can be written as",

			],
				"after": "Because of the discontinuous nature of the square root function in the complex plane, the law âzw = âzâw is in general not true. (Equivalently, the problem occurs because of the freedom in the choice of branch. The chosen branch may or may not yield the equality; in fact, the choice of branch for the square root need not contain the value of âzâw at all, leading to the equality's failure. A similar problem appears with the complex logarithm and the relation logâz + logâw = log(zw).) Wrongly assuming this law underlies several faulty \"proofs\", for instance the following one showing that â1 = 1:",
