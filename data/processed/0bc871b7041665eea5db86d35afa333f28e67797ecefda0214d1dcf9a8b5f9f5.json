				"after": "On their return home for the 1912 season England, captained by C. B. Fry, were involved in the first-ever triangular Test tournament, consisting of matches between England, Australia and South Africa. This experiment was severely affected by wet weather, the weakness of the South African side, and a dispute among the Australian side which resulted in substandard team being sent.[105] Rhodes played as Hobbs' opening partner in each of England's six matches and once again won praise from Wisden.[105] In England's first match, a victory against South Africa, Rhodes scored 36, his steady defence being described as invaluable.[106] In the following drawn game against Australia, Hobbs and Rhodes scored 112 for the first wicket. Rhodes scored 59, his first 52 runs being scored out of a total of 77 before he slowed down; Wisden reported that the later part of his innings was \"as cautious as the first part was brilliant\".[107] Later in the match Rhodes bowled and took three wickets for 59, his only bowling success of the tournament.[41][108]",
