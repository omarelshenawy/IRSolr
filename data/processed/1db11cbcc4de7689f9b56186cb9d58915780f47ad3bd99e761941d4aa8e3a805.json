				"About 25 surviving airframes exist in museum collections worldwide.",
				"On 10 March 1956, four B-47 Stratojets left MacDill Air Force Base in Florida for a non-stop flight to Ben Guerir Air Base in Morocco. Their first aerial refueling was completed without incident. After descending through cloud to begin their second refueling, over the Mediterranean Sea at 14,000Â ft, the aircraft manned by Captain Robert H. Hodgin (31, commander), Captain Gordon M. Insley (32, navigator/observer), and 2nd Lt. Ronald L. Kurtz (22, pilot) failed to make contact with the tanker. Neither the aircraft nor its personnel were ever found."
