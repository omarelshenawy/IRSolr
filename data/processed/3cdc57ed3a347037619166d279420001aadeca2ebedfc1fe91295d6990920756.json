				"after": "The Crown Pearl Badge is considered the \"official means of identifying oneself with the Fraternity.\"[65] The fraternity badge is in the shape of an ancient Venetian harp, with a musical staff of gold lines on black enamel in the center of the badge, with the Greek letters \"Kappa Kappa Psi\" in gold across the staff. Five pearls adorn the bar across the top of the badge, and ten gems are set in the harp's semicircle. In the upper left corner, the Greek letters \"Alpha Epsilon Alpha\" appear in gold on black enamel. A golden baton penetrates the badge diagonally from right to left.[12] Unlike other Greek organizations, however, purchase of the badge is optional for members of Kappa Kappa Psi. Many brothers instead wear the recognition pin, which is a gold lapel pin in the shape of the fraternity's coat of arms.[65]",
