				"previous": "The synagogue building, known as Honen Dalim, (She who is charitable to the Poor) was constructed in 1737. Permission for building the synagogue came from the Dutch West India Company, with additional funding support from the Jewish community on CuraÃ§ao. Permission was conditional on the fact that the Jewish house of worship would be sited where \"the exercise of their (Jewish) religious duties would not molest those of the Gentiles\".[13] The building is located off a small lane called Synagogue Path, away from the main street. The synagogue attested to the wealth of the Jews of St. Eustatius and their influence on the island.[14]",
				"after": "In 2001 its walls were restored as part of the Historic Core Restoration Project. The Historic Core Restoration Project has sought funds from private donors to construct a modern roof on the ancient ruins. Unfortunately no known images exist showing what the synagogue looked like when it was still in use, and therefore archeological research is attempting to restore the structure to the best estimate of its former condition. The grounds include a Jewish ritual bath (a mikveh) and an oven used on Passover.",
