These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals, and it is known variously as cow crane, cow bird or cow heron, or even elephant bird, rhinoceros egret.[21] Its Arabic name, abu qerdan, means \"father of ticks\", a name derived from the huge number of parasites such as avian ticks found in its breeding colonies.[21][59]",
