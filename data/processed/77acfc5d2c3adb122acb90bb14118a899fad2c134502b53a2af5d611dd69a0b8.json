				"after": "Since the equations have four unknowns [x, y, z, b]âthe three components of GPS receiver position and the clock biasâsignals from at least four satellites are necessary to attempt solving these equations. They can be solved by algebraic or numerical methods. Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions are discussed by Abell and Chaffee.[47] When n is greater than 4 this system is overdetermined and a fitting method must be used.",
