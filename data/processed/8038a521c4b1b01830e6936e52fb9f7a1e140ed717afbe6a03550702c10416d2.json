The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel.[238] While the queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis.[239] The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting.[240]",
