				"previous": "Suppose a clock is at rest in the unprimed system S. Two different ticks of this clock are then characterized by Îx = 0. To find the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems, the first equation can be used to find:",
				"after": "This shows that the time (Ît') between the two ticks as seen in the frame in which the clock is moving (Sâ²), is longer than the time (Ît) between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock (S). Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena; for example, the decay rate of muons produced by cosmic rays impinging on the Earth's atmosphere.[19]",
