				"previous": "Later, Riemann considered this function for complex values of s and showed that this function can be extended to a meromorphic function on the entire plane with a simple pole at sÂ =Â 1. This function is now known as the Riemann Zeta function and is denoted by Î¶(s). There is a plethora of literature on this function and the function is a special case of the more general Dirichlet L-functions.",
				"after": "In the early 20th century G. H. Hardy and Littlewood proved many results about the zeta function in an attempt to prove the Riemann Hypothesis. In fact, in 1914, Hardy proved that there were infinitely many zeros of the zeta function on the critical line",
