				"after": "Johnson was born on 19 June 1964,[1] in The Clinic, a hospital on the Upper East Side of New York City.[2] His birth was registered with both the U.S. authorities and the city's British Consulate, and thus he was awarded both American and British citizenship.[3] His English father, Stanley Johnson, had moved to the United States to study creative writing at the University of Iowa, before transferring to study economics at New York's Columbia University.[4] Boris's English mother, Charlotte Johnson Wahl (nÃ©e Fawcett),[5] had been from a family of left-wing and liberal intellectuals and had married the politically conservative Stanley in 1963, before accompanying him to the U.S.[6] The journalist Toby Young has described Johnson's background as being \"lower-upper-middle class\".[7]",
