				"after": "According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 656.3 square miles (1,700Â km2); this comprises 634.0 square miles (1,642Â km2) of land and 22.3 square miles (58Â km2) of water.[38] Most of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or prairie which resembles the Deep South, and are all still visible in surrounding areas. Flatness of the local terrain, when combined with urban sprawl, has made flooding a recurring problem for the city.[39] Downtown stands about 50 feet (15Â m) above sea level,[40] and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet (38Â m) in elevation.[41][42] The city once relied on groundwater for its needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as LakeÂ Houston, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston.[16][43] The city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day worth of groundwater.[44]",
