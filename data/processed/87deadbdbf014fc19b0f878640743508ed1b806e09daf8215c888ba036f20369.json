				"previous": "In 1967, the X-15 set the air speed record for an aircraft at 4,534Â mph (7,297Â km/h) or Mach 6.1 (7,297Â km/h). Aside from vehicles designed to fly in outer space, this record was renewed by X-43 in the 21st century.",
				"after": "The Harrier Jump Jet, often referred to as just \"Harrier\" or \"the Jump Jet\", is a British designed military jet aircraft capable of Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing (V/STOL) via thrust vectoring. It first flew in 1969. The same year that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon, and Boeing unveiled the Boeing 747 and the AÃ©rospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic passenger airliner had its maiden flight. The Boeing 747 was the largest commercial passenger aircraft ever to fly, and still carries millions of passengers each year, though it has been superseded by the Airbus A380, which is capable of carrying up to 853 passengers. In 1975 Aeroflot started regular service on the Tu-144âthe first supersonic passenger plane. In 1976 British Airways and Air France began supersonic service across the Atlantic, with Concorde. A few years earlier the SR-71 Blackbird had set the record for crossing the Atlantic in under 2 hours, and Concorde followed in its footsteps.",
