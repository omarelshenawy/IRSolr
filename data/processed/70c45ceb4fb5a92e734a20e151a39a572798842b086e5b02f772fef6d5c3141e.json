				"previous": "On 1 August 2007, British Airways was fined Â£121.5 million for price-fixing by the OFT, and the US DOJ subsequently announced that it would also fine British Airways US$300 million (Â£148 million) for price-fixing.[200] Although BA said fuel surcharges were \"a legitimate way of recovering costs\", in May 2007 it had put aside Â£350 million for legal fees and fines.[201] In July 2009 Steve Ridgway, the CEO of Virgin Atlantic, admitted he knew about the illegal price-fixing at his airline and did nothing to stop it.[199][202]",
				"after": "In January 2008, BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies which took advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights, flying non-stop between major European cities and the United States.[203] Operations between Paris and New York began with a single Boeing 757 in June 2008.[204] On 2 July 2008 British Airways announced that it had agreed to buy French airline L'Avion for Â£54 million. L'Avion was fully integrated with OpenSkies in 2009.[205]",
