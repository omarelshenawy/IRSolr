				"In analytic geometry a plane is described with Cartesian coordinatesÂ : C = {(x,y)Â : x, y in R}. The points are sometimes identified with complex numbers z = x + y Îµ where the square of Îµ is in {â1, 0, +1}. The Euclidean plane corresponds to the case Îµ2 = â1 since the modulus of z is given by"
