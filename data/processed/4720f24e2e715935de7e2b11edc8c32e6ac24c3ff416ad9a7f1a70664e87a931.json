				"after": "Although the rock formations exposed in Leonard Harrison State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge are at least 300Â million years old, the gorge itself formed only about 20,000Â years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near the present village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, which caused a reversal of the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded to the south and quickly carved a deep channel on its way to the West Branch Susquehanna River.[42][49]",
