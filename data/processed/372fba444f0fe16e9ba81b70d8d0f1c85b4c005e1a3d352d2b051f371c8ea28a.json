				"previous": "As of 2013, the ZÃ¼rich City Council is made up of four representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party, one of whom is the mayor), two members of the Green Party and one member each of FDP (Free Democratic Party), CVP (Christian Democratic Party) and AL (Alternative Left Party), giving the left parties a combined seven out of nine seats.[31]",
				"after": "ZÃ¼rich is situated at 408Â m (1,339Â ft) above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake ZÃ¼rich (ZÃ¼richsee) about 30 kilometers (19Â mi) north of the Alps, nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat river, which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about 700Â m (2,300Â ft) north of where the river issues from Lake ZÃ¼rich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley (German: Glattal) and to the north in the Limmat Valley (German: Limmattal). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourses has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.",
