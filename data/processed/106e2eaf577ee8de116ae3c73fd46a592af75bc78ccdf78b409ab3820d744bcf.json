Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[344] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.[345]",
