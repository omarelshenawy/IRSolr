				"after": "Like all Sterna terns, the common tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, from a height of 1â6Â m (3.3â19.7Â ft), either in the sea or in freshwater lakes and large rivers. The bird may submerge for a second or so, but to no more than 50Â cm (20Â in) below the surface.[84] When seeking fish, this tern flies head-down and with its bill held vertically.[56] It may circle or hover before diving, and then plunges directly into the water, whereas the Arctic tern favours a \"stepped-hover\" technique,[85] and the roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height, and submerges for longer.[86] The common tern typically forages up to 5â10Â km (3.1â6.2Â mi) away from the breeding colony, sometimes as far as 15Â km (9.3Â mi).[87] It will follow schools of fish, and its west African migration route is affected by the location of huge shoals of sardines off the coast of Ghana;[84] it will also track groups of predatory fish or dolphins, waiting for their prey to be driven to the sea's surface.[87][88] Terns often feed in flocks, especially if food is plentiful, and the fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one-third higher than for individuals.[84]",
