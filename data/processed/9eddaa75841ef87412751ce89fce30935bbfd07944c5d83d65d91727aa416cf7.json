				"after": "Less than a week after Vera's cub was removed from the polar bear enclosure, the zoo dedicated a website to the cub. It provided frequent updates on her health and development, as well as exclusive photographs and videos. The website also showcased a competition in which fans could vote for the cub's name.[6] The official name was announced on 18 January 2008 by Ulrich Maly, mayor of Nuremberg, and broadcast live on television. Despite the overwhelming number of e-mailed suggestions from across the world (including \"Stella\", \"Knutschi\", \"Sissi\" and \"Yuki Chan\"[7]), the zoo officially named her Flocke, German for \"flake\", as in \"snowflake\". \"Flocke\", used widely by the media previous to her official naming, was the nickname originally given to her by zookeepers because of her white fur.[8]",
