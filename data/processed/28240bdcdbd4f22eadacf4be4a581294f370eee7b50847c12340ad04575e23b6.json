				"previous": "Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes are assigned at the national level. Interstate Highways are numbered in a gridâeven-numbered routes are eastâwest routes (but the lowest numbers are along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico), and odd-numbered routes are northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean). U.S. Routes are also numbered in a gridâeven numbered for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). For this reason, mainline (two-digit) Interstate Highways in New York all have numbers above 78 and mainline U.S. Routes (with the exception of USÂ 44 and USÂ 62) all have numbers below 20. Three-digit Interstate and U.S. Highways, also known as \"child routes,\" are branches off their main one- or two-digit \"parents\". The majority of Interstate and U.S. Highways are maintained by NYSDOT.",
