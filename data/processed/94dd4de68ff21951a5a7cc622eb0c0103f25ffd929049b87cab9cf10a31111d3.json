				"after": "The Boulonnais was once a popular workhorse in France, with an estimated population of over 600,000 in the early 1900s. World War I and World War II almost destroyed the breed, as its home area saw heavy combat in both wars and the bands of broodmares were scattered.[11] Between World War II and the 1970s, the breed almost became extinct, and only a few breeders kept it alive. In the 1970s, it became popular for horse meat, and consumers considered it to be some of the best meat available.[23] However, by this point, there were fewer than 1,000 mares remaining.[8] During the mid-20th century, the stallions FrÃ©thun (foaled in 1949), Select (1962), TrÃ©sor (1963),[24] AstÃ©rix (1966) and Prince (1981) had a strong influence on the breed, although this contributed to the problem of inbreeding.[2] FrÃ©thun genes are found in 14 percent of the pedigrees of Boulonnais living today.[25] In the early 1970s, Henry Blanc, the newly appointed director of the French National Stud, proposed that nine draft horse breeds, including the Boulonnais, be recategorized from pulling horses to meat horses. When enacted, this recategorization helped to preserve the gene pool of the Boulonnais by encouraging breeding, but it also changed its primary purpose, resulting in a dramatic weight increase by the 1980s.[26]",
