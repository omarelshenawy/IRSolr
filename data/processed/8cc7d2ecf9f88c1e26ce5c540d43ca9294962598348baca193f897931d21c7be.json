				"after": "Both of the \"mummy\" specimens collected by the Sternbergs were reported to have had possible gut contents. Charles H. Sternberg reported the presence of carbonized gut contents in the American Museum of Natural History specimen,[80] but this material has not been described.[81] The plant remains in the Senckenberg Museum specimen have been described, but have proven difficult to interpret. The plants found in the carcass included needles of the conifer Cunninghamites elegans, twigs from conifer and broadleaf trees, and numerous small seeds or fruits.[82] Upon their description in 1922, they were the subject of a debate in the German-language journal PalÃ¤ontologische Zeitschrift. KrÃ¤usel, who described the material, interpreted it as the gut contents of the animal,[82] while Abel could not rule out that the plants had been washed into the carcass after death.[83]",
