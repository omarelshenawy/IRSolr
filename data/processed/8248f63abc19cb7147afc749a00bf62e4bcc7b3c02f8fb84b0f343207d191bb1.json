				"after": "In 1902, Hay wrote that when he died, \"I shall not be much missed except by my wife.\"[225] Nevertheless, due to his premature death at age 66, he was survived by most of his friends.[226] These included Adams, who although he blamed the pressures of Hay's office, where he was badgered by Roosevelt and many senators, for the Secretary of State's death, admitted that Hay had remained in the position because he feared being bored. He memorialized his friend in the final pages of his autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams: with Hay's death, his own education had ended.[227]",
