Males form territories during the breeding season, and they defend their area with territorial calls.[20] These calls are given from a perch up to 6 meters (20Â ft) off the ground for an hour after sunrise and occasionally throughout the day and night.[11] During courtship, males have been observed feeding the female.[20]",
