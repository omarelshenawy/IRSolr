				"previous": "Unlike most moths, the sunset moth is day flying and the bright aposematic colours warn predators of its toxicity, a strategy seen in many diurnal moths. Another habit the moth has in common with many butterflies is the night resting postureâthe wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night.[17] The moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100Â m (300Â ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.[16]",
				"after": "Continuous generations of the moth are present all year. The highest populations are found from March to August (fall and winter), while the lowest are from October to December (spring).[16] The females lay their eggs late in the afternoon or at nightfall, and locate potential oviposition sites visually.[17] Like the eggs of other Uraniidae, the sunset moth's eggs are domed with projecting ribs.[25] A single egg weighs about 1 milligram (3.5Ã10â5Â oz) and usually has 17 ribs, but sometimes 18 or less often 16. The eggs are usually laid on the lower surface of Omphalea leaves, but occasionally on the upper surface. Eggs are laid in groups of 60 to 110, usually about 80.[16]",
