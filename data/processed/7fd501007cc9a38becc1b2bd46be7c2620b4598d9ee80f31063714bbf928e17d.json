				"previous": "Molecular phylogenetic analyses have proven these three are all distinctive and separate species;[37] other taxa formerly believed to be unique species or subspecies, such as B.Â betulicola, B.Â chippewaensis, B.Â persoonii, B.Â quercicola and B.Â venturii, are now known to be part of a B.Â edulis species complex with a wide morphological, ecological and geographic range,[38][39] and that the genetic variability in this complex is low.[40] Similar molecular technology has been developed to rapidly and accurately identify B.Â edulis and other commercially important fungi.[41][42]",
				"after": "Western North America has a number of species closely related to B.Â edulis. The white king bolete (Boletus barrowsii), found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California (and possibly elsewhere), is named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows.[43] It is lighter in colour than B.Â edulis, having a cream-coloured cap with pink tones;[44] often mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine, it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find its flavour as good as if not better than B.Â edulis.[45] The California king bolete (Boletus edulis var. grandedulis) can reach massive proportions, and is distinguished from B.Â edulis by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish. The cap colour appears to be affected by the amount of light received during its development, and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy, to dark-brown, red-brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light.[46] The queen bolete (Boletus regineus), formerly considered a variety of B.Â aereus, is also a choice edible. It is generally smaller than B.Â edulis, and unlike that species, is typically found in mixed forests.[47] The spring king bolete (Boletus rex-veris), formerly considered a variety of B.Â edulis or B.Â pinophilus, is found throughout western North America. In contrast to B.Â edulis, B.Â rex-veris tends to fruit in clusters, and, as its common name suggests, appears in the spring.[48]",
