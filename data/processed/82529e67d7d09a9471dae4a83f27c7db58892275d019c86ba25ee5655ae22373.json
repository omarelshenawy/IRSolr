				"after": "Flight Unlimited is a 1995 flight simulator video game developed and published by Looking Glass Technologies. It allows the player to pilot reproductions of five real-world airplanes and to perform aerobatic stunts. A virtual instructor teaches basic and advanced flight techniques, such as the Immelmann turn and Lomcevak. The first self-published game released by Looking Glass, Flight Unlimited was intended to establish the company as a major video game publisher and to compete with the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise. Project leader Seamus Blackley (pictured), a particle physicist formerly of Fermilab, used real-time computational fluid dynamics calculations to code a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited. Previous flight simulators had often used wind tunnel data to determine a plane's motion, which precluded complex maneuvers. The game was a commercial and critical success that spawned three sequels: Flight Unlimited II (1997), Flight Unlimited III (1999) and Jane's Attack Squadron (2002). Soon after Flight Unlimitedââ'âs completion, Blackley was fired from Looking Glass, and he went on to design Jurassic Park: Trespasser for Dreamworks Interactive and the Xbox for Microsoft.
