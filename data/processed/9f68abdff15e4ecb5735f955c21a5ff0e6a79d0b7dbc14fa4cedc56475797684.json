				"previous": "The influence of The Raft of the Medusa was felt by artists beyond France. Francis Danby, a British painter born in Ireland, probably was inspired by GÃ©ricault's picture when he painted Sunset at Sea after a Storm in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that The Raft of the Medusa was \"the finest and grandest historical picture I have ever seen\".[70]",
				"after": "The subject of marine tragedy was undertaken by J. M. W. Turner (1775â1851), who, like many English artists, probably saw GÃ©ricault's painting when it was exhibited in London in 1820.[71][72] His A Disaster at Sea (c. 1835) chronicled a similar incident, this time a British catastrophe, with a swamped vessel and dying figures also placed in the foreground. Placing a coloured figure in the centre of the drama was revisited by Turner, with similar abolitionist overtones, in his The Slave Ship (1840).[71]",
