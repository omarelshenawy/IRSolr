				"after": "Iridiumâosmium alloys were used to tip fountain pen nibs. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold.[5] Since 1944, the famous Parker 51 fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called \"iridium\", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as tungsten have taken its place.[76]",
