				"previous": "The company started a corporation with four regional steam ship companiesâVesterÃ¥lske, Nordenfjeldske, Stavangerske and Arendalskeâand on 21 November they established the company Norske Kystflyveruter and applied for all concessions to fly postal services around the coast, as well as to Gothenburg in Sweden. At the same time, Fred. Olsen & Co. and Bergenske bought Det Norske Luftfartselskap (DNL) and also applied for the routes. WiderÃ¸e wanted to use seaplanes, while DNL was going to use land planes. The government urged to companies to split the routes between them, but before the negotiations were completed, Cabinet Nygaardsvold was appointed, and they granted DNL a ten-year concession on all domestic flights.[4]",
				"after": "After losing all scheduled flights, WiderÃ¸e expanded to Northern Norway and started taxi flights. In 1935, the company also started in the cartography business. In Oslo, the company built a summer base for sea planes at Ingierstand, and a winter base for ski planes at Bogstadvannet. Around Bergen, the airline would land at cruise ships and offer flights to tourists to see the fjords and mountains. In March 1936, 51% of the company was taken over by DNL as part of a private placement. This allowed DNL to transfer some of its concessions to WiderÃ¸e, who started flying Oslo â Lillehammer/Tretten â GolÃ¥ â Fefor â Tyinholmen/Nystuen, mainly aimed at tourists. For this route, a Bellanca Senior Pacemaker was bought. WiderÃ¸e also wet operated DNL's route from Oslo to Gothenburg, the route TromsÃ¸ to HonningsvÃ¥g and Bergen â Vadheim â Slidre â Balestrand. This routes in part used a Stinson Reliant.[5]",
