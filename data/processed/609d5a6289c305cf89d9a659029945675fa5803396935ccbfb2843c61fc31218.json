Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises.[37][38] However, there is little direct evidence to show that either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids, such as the European magpie or Eurasian jay, have an impact on population numbers.[31]",
