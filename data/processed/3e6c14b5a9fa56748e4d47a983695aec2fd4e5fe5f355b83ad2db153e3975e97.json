				"after": "The only member of the corvid family that has a permanent population in Tasmania,[22] the forest raven is the most widely distributed bird species in the state.[23] There are three populations in southern Victoria: from the vicinity of Lakes Entrance west across Gippsland to Wilsons Promontory, the Otway Ranges from 10 km (6 mi) west of Torquay to Port Campbell, and lastly in the Grampians and Millicent Plain extending into south-east South Australia. Isolated records suggest the latter two populations may actually be continuous.[23] There are two disjunct populations in northern New South Wales. A coastal population is found from Tea Gardens north to Yuraygir National Park, while a more montane population is found along the Great Dividing Range and New England Tableland from Tenterfield and Glen Innes in the north to Gloucester Tops in the south. The gap between the two populations is around 70Â km (43Â mi), shrinking to 30Â km (19Â mi) at Dorrigo.[23]",
