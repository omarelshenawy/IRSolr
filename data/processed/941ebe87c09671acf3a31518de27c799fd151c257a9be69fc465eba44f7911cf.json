				"after": "Cricket has a close relationship with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.[55] In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with \"a code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The following year, Wills and other Victorian cricketers founded the Melbourne Football Club and codified the first laws of the game.[56] It is typically played on modified cricket fields and borrows terminology from cricket, such as \"umpire\" and \"sledging\".",
