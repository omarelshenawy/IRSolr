				"after": "Lamb returned to the police station and charged William with Ellen's murder. Ellen's jewellery, found in William's pockets, was confiscated.[44] A preliminary search of the premises revealed chalk graffiti on the rear door of the flat, which read \"Jack Ripper [sic] is at the back of this door\", and on the stairwell leading up from the rear of the property, which read \"Jack Ripper is in this seller [sic]\".[45] The press and the police thought they had been written by a local boy before the tragedy, but the writer was never identified.[46] A more extensive search the following morning found blood-stained clothing in the crate that had contained the body, and the remains of more clothing and some of Ellen's personal effects burned in the fireplace.[47] The flat was bereft of furniture, indicating that it may have been burnt on the fire, either for heat or to destroy evidence.[48] A large penknife was found with human flesh and blood upon it, and the rope that William had bought on the morning of 4 February was found with strands of Ellen's hair caught in the fibres.[49]",
