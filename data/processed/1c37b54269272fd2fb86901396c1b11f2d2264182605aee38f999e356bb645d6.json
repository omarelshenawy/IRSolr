				"after": "Typhoon Pongsona maintained a 65Â km (40Â mi) wide eye upon crossing the northern portion of the island of Guam; the Andersen Air Force Base was in the eye for two hours. Sustained winds from the typhoon peaked at 232Â km/h (144Â mph) with gusts peaking at 278Â km/h (173Â mph); gusts of at least 160Â km/h (100Â mph) affected the entire island. The lowest pressure on the island was 935Â millibars (27.61Â inHg), making Pongsona the third most intense typhoon to strike Guam; it is behind only a typhoon in 1900 (926Â mbar, 27.34Â inHg) and Typhoon Karen of 1962 (932Â mbar, 27.52Â inHg).[4]",
