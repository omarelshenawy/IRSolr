				"after": "A mature common raven ranges between 54 and 67Â cm length, with a wingspan of 115 to 130Â cm.[25][26][27][28] Recorded weights range from 0.69 to 2Â kg (1.5 to 4.4Â lb),[29][30] thus making the common raven one of the heaviest passerines. Birds from colder regions such as the Himalayas and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills.[31] Representative of the size variation in the species, ravens from California weighed an average of 784Â g (1.728Â lb), those from Alaska weighed an average of 1,135Â g (2.502Â lb) and those from Nova Scotia weighed an average of 1,230Â g (2.71Â lb).[32][33][34] The bill is large and slightly curved, with a culmen length of 5.7 to 8.5Â cm (2.2 to 3.3Â in), easily one of the largest bills amongst passerines (perhaps only the thick-billed raven has a noticeably larger bill). It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, at 20 to 26.3Â cm (7.9 to 10.4Â in), and mostly black iridescent plumage, and a dark brown iris. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. The legs and feet are good-sized, with a tarsus length of 6 to 7.2Â cm (2.4 to 2.8Â in).[35][36] Juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue-grey iris.[37]",
