				"previous": "Einstein began by postulating simple proportionality relations for the different reaction rates involved. In his model, the rate for a system to absorb a photon of frequency and transition from a lower energy to a higher energy is proportional to the number of atoms with energy and to the energy density of ambient photons with that frequency,",
				"after": "where is the rate constant for emitting a photon spontaneously, and is the rate constant for emitting it in response to ambient photons (induced or stimulated emission). In thermodynamic equilibrium, the number of atoms in state i and that of atoms in state j must, on average, be constant; hence, the rates and must be equal. Also, by arguments analogous to the derivation of Boltzmann statistics, the ratio of and is where are the degeneracy of the state i and that of j, respectively, their energies, k the Boltzmann constant and T the system's temperature. From this, it is readily derived that and",
