				"after": "The Nauru reed warbler is endemic to the island of Nauru, in the Pacific Ocean. It is one of only two indigenous land birds which breed on the island, the other being the Micronesian pigeon. The warbler can be found throughout the island, thriving in the scrubland in areas previously used for phosphate mining, as well as the remaining patches of forest on the island's central plateau.[7] It is most common in the remains of forest found on the island's steep slopes.[1] It is also readily observed in gardens and ruderal areas on the island's coast; in 1881, Finsch described the species as abundant, calling it \"as common as the House-Sparrow in England.\"[7] Biologist Donald Buden again found it widespread on the island in 2008.[7]",
