Minnesotans helped shape the history of music through popular American culture: the Andrews Sisters' \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" was an iconic tune of World War II, while the Trashmen's \"Surfin' Bird\" and Bob Dylan epitomize two sides of the 1960s. In the 1980s, influential hit radio groups and musicians included Prince, The Original 7ven, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, The Jets (Minnesota band), Lipps Inc., and Information Society (band).",
