				"after": "Runestone U 270 was discovered in Smedby (location) near Vallentuna and depicted by Johan Hadorph and assistant, for Johan PeringskiÃ¶ld, during the national search for historic monuments in 1667â84. Richard Dybeck noted in 1867 that he had seen the runestone intact three years previously, but that it had been used for the construction of a basement in 1866. Dybeck sued the guilty farmer, and the prosecution was completed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. The documentation from the court case shows that it had been standing at the homestead and that it had been blown up three times into small pieces that could be used for the construction of the basement. Reconstruction of the runestone was deemed impossible. The stone was 2.5Â m (8Â ft 2Â in) tall and 1.2Â m (3Â ft 11Â in) wide,[59] and it was raised in memory of a father who appears to have travelled to Greece.[60]",
