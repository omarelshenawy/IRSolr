				"previous": "There is a 1:1 molar ratio of NH3 to NO2 in the above balanced combustion reaction, so 5.871 mol of NO2 will be formed. We will employ the ideal gas law to solve for the volume at 0 Â°C (273.15 K) and 1 atmosphere using the gas law constant of R = 0.08206 LÂ·atmÂ·Kâ1Â·molâ1Â :",
				"after": "Gas stoichiometry often involves having to know the molar mass of a gas, given the density of that gas. The ideal gas law can be re-arranged to obtain a relation between the density and the molar mass of an ideal gas:",
