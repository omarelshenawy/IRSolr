				"after": "The square-windowed Comet 1 was the first model produced, a total of 12 aircraft in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115Â ft (35.05Â m), and overall length 93Â ft (28.35Â m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000Â lb (47.628Â kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.[62]",
