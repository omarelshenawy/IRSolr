				"previous": "The above double integral is the generalized distance functional between two plymer conformation. is a spatial parameter and is pseudo-time. This means that is the polymer/string conformation at time and is parameterized along the string length by . Similarly is the trajectory of an infinitesimal segment of the string during transformation of the entire string from conformation to conformation . The term with cofactor is a Lagrange multiplier and its role is to ensure that the length of the polymer remains the same during the transformation. If two discrete polymers are inextensible, then the minimal-distance transformation between them no longer involves purely straight-line motion, even on a Euclidean metric. There is a potential application of such generalized distance to the problem of protein folding[1][2] This generalized distance is analogous to the Nambu-Goto action in string theory, however there is no exact correspondence because the Euclidean distance in 3-space is inequivalent to the space-time distance minimized for the classical relativistic string.",
				"after": "In mathematics, in particular geometry, a distance function on a given set M is a function d: M Ã M â R, where R denotes the set of real numbers, that satisfies the following conditions:",
