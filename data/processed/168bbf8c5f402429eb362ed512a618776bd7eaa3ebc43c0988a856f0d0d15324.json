				"previous": "Following the ouster of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after mass protests, many analysts (including former European Commission President Romano Prodi) saw Egypt as the next country where such a revolution might occur.[100] According to The Washington Post, \"The Jasmine Revolution [...] should serve as a stark warning to Arab leaders â beginning with Egypt's 83-year-old Hosni Mubarak â that their refusal to allow more economic and political opportunity is dangerous and untenable.\"[101] Others believed that Egypt was not ready for revolution, citing little aspiration by the Egyptian people, low educational levels and a strong government with military support.[102] The BBC said, \"The simple fact is that most Egyptians do not see any way that they can change their country or their lives through political action, be it voting, activism, or going out on the streets to demonstrate.\"[103]",
