				"previous": "The amplitude of a wave may be constant (in which case the wave is a c.w. or continuous wave), or may be modulated so as to vary with time and/or position. The outline of the variation in amplitude is called the envelope of the wave. Mathematically, the modulated wave can be written in the form:[8][9][10]",
				"after": "where is the amplitude envelope of the wave, is the wavenumber and is the phase. If the group velocity (see below) is wavelength-independent, this equation can be simplified as:[11]",
