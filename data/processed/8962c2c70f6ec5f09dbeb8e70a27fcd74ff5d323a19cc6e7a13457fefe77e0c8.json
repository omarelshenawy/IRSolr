				"previous": "The typical Chinese navigational compass was in the form of a magnetic needle floating in a bowl of water.[32] According to Needham, the Chinese in the Song Dynasty and continuing Yuan Dynasty did make use of a dry compass, although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass.[33] Evidence of this is found in the Shilin guangji (\"Guide Through the Forest of Affairs\"), published in 1325 by Chen Yuanjing, although its compilation had taken place between 1100 and 1250.[33] The dry compass in China was a dry suspension compass, a wooden frame crafted in the shape of a turtle hung upside down by a board, with the lodestone sealed in by wax, and if rotated, the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction.[33] Although the European compass-card in box frame and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by Japanese pirates in the 16th century (who had in turn learned of it from Europeans),[34] the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century.[35] However, according to Kreutz there is only a single Chinese reference to a dry-mounted needle (built into a pivoted wooden tortoise) which is dated to between 1150 and 1250, and claims that there is no clear indication that Chinese mariners ever used anything but the floating needle in a bowl until the 16th-century.[32]",
				"after": "The first recorded use of a 48 position mariner's compass on sea navigation was noted in The Customs of Cambodia by Yuan Dynasty diplomat Zhou Daguan, he described his 1296 voyage from Wenzhou to Angkor Thom in detail; when his ship set sail from Wenzhou, the mariner took a needle direction of âding weiâ position, which is equivalent to 22.5 degree SW. After they arrived at Baria,[disambiguation needed] the mariner took \"Kun Shen needle\", or 52.5 degree SW.[36] Zheng He's Navigation Map, also known as \"The Mao Kun Map\", contains a large amount of detail \"needle records\" of Zheng He's expeditions.[37]",
