				"previous": "As a simple example, consider the map f: R2 â R2, given by f(x, y) = (0, y). Then for an equation f(x, y) = (a, b) to have a solution, we must have a = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (x, b) or equivalently stated, (0, b) + (x, 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (x, 0) < V: the value of x is the freedom in a solution â while the cokernel may be expressed via the map W â R, given a vector (a, b), the value of a is the obstruction to there being a solution.",
