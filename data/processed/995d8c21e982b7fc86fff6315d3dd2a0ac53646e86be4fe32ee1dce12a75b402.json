				"after": "The Olympic marmot's head is wide with small eyes and ears; the body is stocky with stubby legs and sharp, rounded claws that facilitate digging;[9][10] the tail is bushy and ranges from 18 to 24Â cm (7.1 to 9.4Â in) long.[2] The Olympic marmot is about the size of a domestic cat; adults weigh from 3.1 to 11Â kg (6.8 to 24.3Â lb) and are from 67 to 75Â cm (26 to 30Â in) in length, with the average being 71Â cm (28Â in). It is the largest marmot, about 7% longer than the hoary and Vancouver Island marmots. This species has the most pronounced sexual dimorphism found in marmots, with adult males weighing on average 9.3Â kg (21Â lb) and adult females weighing 7.1Â kg (16Â lb).[11]",
