				"after": "Aquinas is held in the Roman Catholic Church to be the model teacher for those studying for the priesthood. The works for which he is best-known are the Summa Theologica and the Summa Contra Gentiles. One of the 33 Doctors of the Church, he is considered by many Christians to be the Roman Catholic Church's greatest theologian and philosopher. Consequently, many institutions of learning have been named after him. The Eastern Orthodox Church has had a complex relationship with Aquinas' work. In the twentieth century, there was a reaction against this \"Latin captivity\" of the Orthodox theology, and later writers have emphasized the otherness of scholasticism.",
