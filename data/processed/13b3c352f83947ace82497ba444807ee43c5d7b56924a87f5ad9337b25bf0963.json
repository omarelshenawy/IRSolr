				"after": "In the spring of 1790, Forster and the young Alexander von Humboldt started from Mainz on a long journey through the Southern Netherlands, the United Provinces, and England, which eventually finished in Paris. The impressions from the journey were described in a three volume publication Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant, Flandern, Holland, England und Frankreich im April, Mai und Juni 1790 (Views of the Lower Rhine, from Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France in April, May and June 1790), published 1791â1794. Goethe said about the book: \"One wants, after one has finished reading, to start it over, and wishes to travel with such a good and knowledgeable observer.\" The book includes considerations in the field of the history of art that were as influential for the discipline as A Voyage round the world was for ethnology. Forster belongs, for example, to the first writers who gave just treatment to the Gothic architecture of Cologne Cathedral,[31] which was widely perceived as \"barbarian\" at that time. The book conformed well to the early Romanticism intellectual movements in German-speaking Europe.[32]",
