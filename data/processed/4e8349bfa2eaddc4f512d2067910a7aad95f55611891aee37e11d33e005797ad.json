				"previous": "Also on the first floor is the \"Chapel Drawing Room\" in the south wing, connected to the Drawing Room.[70] The Copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel, which is entered through it.[71] The current chapel has an altar reredos with paintings of the Virgin Mary, St. Stephen, St. Mary Magdalene and St. John the Evangelist, by Alexander Rowan and dated by Pevsner to about 1840.[68][72] The tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house, and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier; in the early 19th century it had hung in the Red Drawing Room.[73] When the chapel ceiling was restored by Sir William Cope, it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood.[73] The large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel.[68]",
				"after": "The house is set in 262-acre (106Â ha) of grounds,[74] which include an 18-acre (7.3Â ha) lake north of the house.[75] The grounds form part of a Registered Historic Park that received a GradeÂ II* listing in 1984. Under this designation are the 25 acres (10Â ha) of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house, the wider 490 acres (200Â ha) medieval park, landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century, with 250 acres (100Â ha) of woodland[76] and buildings including an icehouse and a folly known as Conduit House.[74] Parts of the park have been used for commercial softwood production since the 19th century.[76]",
