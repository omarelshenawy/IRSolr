				"previous": "Following complaints about the finances, buildings and management of Eton, the Clarendon Commission was set up in 1861 as a Royal Commission to investigate the state of nine schools in England, including Eton.[38] Questioned by the Commission in 1862, head master Edward Balston came under attack for his view that in the classroom little time could be spared for subjects other than classical studies.[39]",
				"after": "The Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that \"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton\".[40] Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there. According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, \"There grows the stuff that won Waterloo\",[41] a remark Nevill construes as a reference to \"the manly character induced by games and sport\" amongst English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's âC'est ici qu' a Ã©tÃ© gagnÃ© la bataille de Waterlooâ (âIt is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won.\")",
