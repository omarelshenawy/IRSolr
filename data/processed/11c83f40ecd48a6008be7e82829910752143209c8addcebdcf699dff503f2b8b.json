				"after": "The terms Union Jack and Union Flag are both historically correct for describing the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom. Whether to call it the \"Union Jack\" or the \"Union Flag\". It is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship [7] According to the Parliament of the United Kingdom:[8][9] \"Until the early 17th century England and Scotland were two entirely independent kingdoms. This changed dramatically in 1603 on the death of Elizabeth I of England. Because the Queen died unmarried and childless, the English crown passed to the next available heir, her cousin James VI, King of Scotland. England and Scotland now shared the same monarch under what was known as a union of the crowns.",
