Even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete.[263][264] Roman roads are considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. The roads were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Even after the collapse of the central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.",
