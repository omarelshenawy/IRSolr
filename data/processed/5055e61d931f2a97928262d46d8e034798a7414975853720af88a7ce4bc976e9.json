				"previous": "Tree species succession may change tree species composition once the old-growth stage has been achieved. For example, an old boreal forest may contain some large aspen trees, which may die and be replaced by smaller balsam fir or black spruce. Consequently, the forest will switch back to Understory Reinitiation stage.[12] If old growth stage is seen as an end point of stand development, it can be easily evaluated using structural or static attributes. However, in some forest ecosystems this can lead to decisions regarding the preservation of unique stands or attributes that will disappear over the next few decades because of natural succession processes. Consequently, using stand dynamics to define old-growth forest is more useful in cases where the species that constitute old-growth forest can have long life span or in ecosystem where succession is very slow.",
