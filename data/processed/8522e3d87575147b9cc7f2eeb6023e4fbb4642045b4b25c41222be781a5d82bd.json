				"previous": "The West is still one of the most sparsely settled areas in the United States with 49.5 inhabitants per square mile (19/kmÂ²). Only Texas with 78.0 inhabitants/sq mi. (30/kmÂ²), Washington with 86.0 inhabitants/sq mi. (33/kmÂ²), and California with 213.4 inhabitants/sq mi. (82/kmÂ²) exceed the national average of 77.98 inhabitants/sq mi. (30/kmÂ²).",
				"after": "The entire Western region has also been strongly influenced by Hispanic or Latino, Asian, American Indians, and Pacific Islander; it contains the largest number of minorities in the U.S. While most of the studies of racial dynamics in America such as riots in Los Angeles have been written about European and African Americans, in many cities in the West and California, whites and blacks together are less than half the population because of the preference for the region by Hispanics and Asians. African and European Americans, however, continue to wield a stronger political influence because of the lower rates of citizenship and voting among Asians and Hispanics.",
