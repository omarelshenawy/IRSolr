				"previous": "Texas joined the United States in 1845 as the 28th state, after nearly a decade of being the Republic of Texasâan independent country. Texas historically had a \"larger than life\" reputation, especially in cowboy films. The term \"Texas-sized\" is used to describe something larger than average, and large geographic areas are often described in terms of the size of Texas. It is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico. It is in the south-central part of the United States of America. It is considered to form part of the U.S. South and also part of the U.S. Southwest.",
				"after": "In 2011, Texas had a gross state product of $1.3 trillion, the second-highest in the U.S. after California. Texas is the only state in the U.S. to have three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas, which are also among the 10 largest cities of the United States. They are larger than any other cities in the Southern United States. Austin, El Paso, and Fort Worth are in the top 25 largest U.S. cities.",
