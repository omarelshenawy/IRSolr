				"Over a field, a square matrix is invertible if and only if it is full-rank (right?) So, I don't think \"full-rank\" is particularly useful for a square marrix. For a non-square matrix, a \"full-rank\", I think, has the usual meaning, meaning the rank (row rank) is the maximal possible; i.e., the matrix defines a surjection when it is viewed as a linear transformation. For example, to check the submersion theorem applies one checks if the Jacobian matrix has full-rank, meaning it is surjective; see for instance [5]. At least, this (full-rank = surjective) is how I use the term in my day life. -- Taku (talk) 19:41, 15 May 2015 (UTC)"
