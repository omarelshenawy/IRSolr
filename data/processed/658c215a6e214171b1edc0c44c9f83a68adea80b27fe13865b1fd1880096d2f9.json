				"after": "Nico Haupt and former chief economist within the Labor Department under the Bush administration, Morgan Reynolds, argue that no planes were used in the attacks. Reynolds claims it is physically impossible that the Boeing planes of Flights 11 and 175 could have penetrated the steel frames of the Towers, and that digital compositing was used to depict the plane crashes in both news reports and subsequent amateur video.[170] \"There were no planes, there were no hijackers,\" Reynolds insists. \"I know, I know, I'm out of the mainstream, but that's the way it is.\" According to David Shayler, \"The only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes,\" he says. \"Watch footage frame by frame and you will see a cigar-shaped missile hitting the World Trade Center.\" Some truth movement veterans have repeatedly refuted the \"no-plane\" claims.[75][170][171] In fact, discussion of no-plane theories has been banned from certain conspiracy theory websites and advocates have sometimes been threatened with violence by posters at other conspiracy theory websites.[172]",
