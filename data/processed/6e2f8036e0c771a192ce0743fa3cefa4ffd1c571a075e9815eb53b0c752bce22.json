				"previous": "Pilots who flew both preferred the B-17 over the B-24 for its greater stability and ease in formation flying. Its electrical systems were less vulnerable to damage than the B-24's hydraulics, and the B-17 flew better than the B-24 when missing an engine.[158] During the war, the largest offensive bombing force, the Eighth Air Force, had an open preference for the B-17. Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle wrote about his preference for equipping the Eighth with B-17s, citing the logistical advantage in keeping field forces down to a minimum number of aircraft types with their individual servicing and spares. For this reason, he wanted B-17 bombers and P-51 fighters for the Eighth. His views were supported by Eighth Air Force statisticians, whose studies showed that Fortresses had utility and survivability much greater than that of the B-24.[11] Making it back to base on numerous occasions despite extensive battle damage, its durability became mythical;[9][10] stories and photos of B-17s surviving battle damage were widely circulated during the war.[11] Despite an inferior performance and smaller bombload than the more numerous B-24,[159] a survey of Eighth Air Force crews showed a much higher rate of satisfaction in the B-17.[160]",
				"after": "Many B-17 crew members received military honors and 17 received the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States:[171]",
