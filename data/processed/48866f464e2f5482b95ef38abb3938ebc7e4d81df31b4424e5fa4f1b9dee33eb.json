				"after": "For the majority of human history, space was explored by remote observation; initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. Explorer II manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of 22Â km (14Â mi).[124] This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German A-4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about 80Â km (50Â mi). In 1957, the unmanned satellite Sputnik 1 was launched by a Russian R-7 rocket, achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of 215â939 kilometres (134â583Â mi).[125] This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin was sent into orbit on Vostok 1. The first humans to escape Earth orbit were Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders in 1968 on board the U.S. Apollo 8, which achieved lunar orbit[126] and reached a maximum distance of 377,349Â km (234,474Â mi) from the Earth.[127]",
