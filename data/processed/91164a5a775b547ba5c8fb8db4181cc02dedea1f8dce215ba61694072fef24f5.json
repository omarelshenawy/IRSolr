Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans,[N 5] it is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The world's smallest continent[132] and sixth largest country by total area,[133] Australiaâowing to its size and isolationâis often dubbed the \"island continent\",[134] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island.[135] Australia has 34,218 kilometres (21,262Â mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands),[136] and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060Â sqÂ mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory.[137] Apart from Macquarie Island, Australia lies between latitudes 9Â° and 44Â°S, and longitudes 112Â° and 154Â°E.",
