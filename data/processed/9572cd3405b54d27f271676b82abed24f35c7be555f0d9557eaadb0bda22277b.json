				"after": "The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents.[6] The animal lacks under hair, and guard hair differs little from over hair. Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134Â cm (3.48 to 4.40Â ft) in length, stand 50 to 62Â cm (20 to 24Â in) tall at the withers, and typically weigh 35 to 66Â kg (77 to 146Â lb), with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of 48.9Â kg (108Â lb).[10][11][12] The top recorded weights are 91Â kg (201Â lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5Â kg (162Â lb) for a wild male from Uruguay.[6][13] The dental formula is 1.1.0.01.1.3.3.[6] Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails.[6] Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet.[14] Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads. Females are slightly heavier than males.",
