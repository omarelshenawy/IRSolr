				"previous": "for any integer a not divisible by p, may be proved using these notions. This implies",
				"after": "Giuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p â 1 or a divisor of p â 1. The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than baseÂ 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor ofÂ q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer pÂ >Â 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (pÂ âÂ 1)!Â +Â 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (nÂ âÂ 1)! is divisible byÂ n.",
