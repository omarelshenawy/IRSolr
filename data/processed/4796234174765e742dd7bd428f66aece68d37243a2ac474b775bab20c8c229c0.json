				"after": "The narrow spindle-shaped eggs are laid in a series of slits cut by the mother's ovipositor in branches or twigs, usually of eucalypts.[25] On average about twelve eggs are laid in each slit, for a total of several hundred. These cuts can cause significant damage to the bark of tender trees.[17] The eggs all hatch around 70 days laterâusually within a day or two of one anotherâbut take longer in cold or dry conditions.[25] The larvae then fall to the ground and burrow into the soil.[26] Though the timing of the double drummer's life cycle is unknown,[27] nymphs of cicadas in general then spend from four to six years underground.[28] Unusual for Australian cicadas, double drummers emerge during the daytime.[2] Emerging en masse generally, nymphs are covered in mud. This mud remains on their exuviae,[29] which emerging cicadas leave at the bases or in burnt out hollows of eucalypts. Within a forest, successive broods may emerge in different locations each year.[27] The cicada's body and wings desiccate and harden once free of the exuvia.[12]",
