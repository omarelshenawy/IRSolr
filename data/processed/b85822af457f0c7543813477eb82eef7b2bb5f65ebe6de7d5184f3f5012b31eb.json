				"previous": "McCay began work that May on his next animated film, How a Mosquito Operates,[61] based on a Rarebit Fiend episode from June 5, 1909,[63] in which a man in bed tries in vain to defend himself from a giant mosquito, which drinks itself so full that it explodes.[64] The animation is naturalisticârather than expanding like a balloon, with each sip of blood the mosquito's abdomen swells according to its body structure.[65] The film was completed in January 1912,[61] and McCay toured with it that spring and summer.[63]",
				"after": "Gertie the Dinosaur debuted in February 1914 as part of McCay's vaudeville act. McCay introduced Gertie as \"the only dinosaur in captivity\",[66] and commanded the animated beast with a whip.[66] Gertie seemed to obey McCay, bowing to the audience, and eating a tree and a boulder, though she had a will of her own and sometimes rebelled. When McCay admonished her, she cried. McCay consoled her by throwing her an appleâin reality pocketing the cardboard prop apple as a cartoon one simultaneously appeared on screen.[67] In the finale, McCay walked offstage, reappeared in animated form in the film, and had Gertie carry him away.[68] Producer William Fox's Box Office Attractions obtained distribution rights to a modified version of Gertie that could be played in regular movie theaters. This version was prefaced with a live-action sequence and replaced the interactive portions with intertitles.[69]",
