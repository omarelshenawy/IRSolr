				"The RNZAF ensign was approved in 1939, based on the ensign of the Royal Air Force, with the letters \"NZ\" inserted within the roundel.",

A white kiwi or silver fern on a black background or a New Zealand flag frequently appeared on RNZAF aircraft, and also on RAF aircraft with NZ aircrew. Map outlines of New Zealand with a Kiwi superimposed appeared on the tails of Canberras flown from Singapore in the Malayan Emergency; Venoms used in the conflict had a white kiwi on a black tail."
