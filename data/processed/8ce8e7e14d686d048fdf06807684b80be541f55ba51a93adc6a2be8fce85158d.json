His supporters included the National Republicans, who were beginning to identify as \"Whigs\" in honor of ancestors during the Revolutionary War. They opposed the \"tyranny\" of Jackson, as their ancestors had opposed the tyranny of King George III. Clay strongly opposed Jackson's refusal to renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States, and advocated passage of a resolution to censure Jackson for his actions.",
