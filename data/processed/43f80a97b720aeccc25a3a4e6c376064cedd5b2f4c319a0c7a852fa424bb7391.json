				"previous": "The torpedo gunboat in practice failed in their primary objective, as they were not fast enough to keep up with torpedo boats. They were phased out with the introduction of the first destroyers in the 1890s.",
			"after": [
				"The first ships to bear the formal designation \"torpedo boat destroyer\" (TBD) were the DaringÂ class of two ships and HavockÂ class of two ships of the Royal Navy.",
				"Early torpedo gunboat designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral Jackie Fisher ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel water-tube boilers and quick-firing small calibre guns. Six ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder: HMSÂ Daring and HMSÂ Decoy from John I. Thornycroft & Company, HMSÂ Havock and HMSÂ Hornet from Yarrows, and HMSÂ Ferret and HMSÂ Lynx from Laird, Son & Company.[17]"
