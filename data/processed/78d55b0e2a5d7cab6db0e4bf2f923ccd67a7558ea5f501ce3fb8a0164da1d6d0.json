				"after": "The 20th century brought improvements to energy and domestic systems: electrical service was introduced in 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarÂ II, the town installed a water system.[13] The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic through the center of town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.[13]",
