				"after": "Cathode rays were discovered by Johann Hittorf in 1869 in primitive Crookes tubes. He observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the cathode (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. Artur Shuster demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by electric fields, and William Crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, J. J. Thompson succeeded in measuring the mass of cathode rays, showing that they consisted of negatively charged particles smaller than atoms, the first \"subatomic particles\", which were later named electrons. The earliest version of the CRT was known as the \"Braun tube\", invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897.[5][6] It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor-coated screen.",
