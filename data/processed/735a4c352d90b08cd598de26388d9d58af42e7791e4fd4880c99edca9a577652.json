				"after": "The basic design was fairly typical for a cargo aircraft, consisting of a large boxy fuselage with a tilted rear area featuring a loading ramp. It had a wingspan of 67Â ft (20Â m) and was 58Â ft (18Â m) long overall. The fuselage housed a 30Â ft (9.1Â m) long, 7.5Â ft (2.3Â m) wide 7Â ft (2.1Â m) high cargo area with a somewhat boxy cockpit on the front for the crew of two pilots and a loadmaster. The wing was high-mounted and the tail surfaces were a \"semi-T-tail\" to keep the rear area clear during loading. Tricycle landing gear were used, with the main legs retracting into blisters on the fuselage sides. In normal parked configuration it would appear to be a conventional cargo plane.",
