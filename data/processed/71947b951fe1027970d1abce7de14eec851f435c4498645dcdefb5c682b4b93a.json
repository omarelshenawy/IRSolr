They prefer Acacia, Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands.[10]:322 The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments.[58] Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring trees of genera Acacia, Commiphora and Terminalia,[4] which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate.[11] They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit.[10]:324 A giraffe eats around 34Â kg (75Â lb) of foliage daily.[25] When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches. Although herbivorous, the giraffe has been known to visit carcasses and lick dried meat off bones.[10]:325",
