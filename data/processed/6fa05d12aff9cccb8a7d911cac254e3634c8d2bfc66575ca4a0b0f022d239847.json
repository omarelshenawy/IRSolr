				"after": "Sir Stanley Savige (1890â1954) was an Australian Army soldier and officer who served in the First and Second World Wars. He enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force in March 1915, and served in the ranks during the Gallipoli Campaign, where he received a commission. He earned the Military Cross for bravery in fighting on the Western Front. In 1918 he joined Dunsterforce, and participated in the Caucasus Campaign, during which he was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees. After the war he wrote a book, Stalky's Forlorn Hope, about his wartime experiences, and played a key role in the establishment of Legacy Australia, a war widows and orphans benefit fund. During the Second World War, he commanded the 17th Infantry Brigade in the North African campaign, the Battle of Greece and SyriaâLebanon campaign. His outspoken criticism of professional soldiers earned him their rancour. He returned to Australia after the Battle of Greece, but later commanded the 3rd Division in New Guinea in the Salamaua-Lae campaign. He rose to the rank of lieutenant general, commanding the II Corps in the Bougainville campaign in the final stages of the war. (FullÂ article...)",
