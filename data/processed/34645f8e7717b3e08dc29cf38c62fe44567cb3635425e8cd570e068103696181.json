				"previous": "Manitoba's culture has been influenced by both traditional (Aboriginal and MÃ©tis) and modern Canadian artistic values, as well as by the cultures of its immigrant populations and American neighbours. The Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport is responsible for promoting and, to some extent, financing Manitoban culture.[117] Manitoba is the birthplace of the Red River Jig, a combination of aboriginal pow-wows and European reels that was popular among early settlers.[118] Manitoba's traditional music has strong roots in MÃ©tis and Aboriginal culture, in particular the old-time fiddling of the MÃ©tis.[119] Manitoba's cultural scene also incorporates classical European traditions. The Royal Winnipeg Ballet (RWB), based in Winnipeg, is Canada's oldest ballet and the longest continuously operating ballet company in North America; it was granted its royal title in 1953 under Queen ElizabethÂ II.[120] The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO) performs classical music and new compositions at the Centennial Concert Hall.[121] Manitoba Opera, founded in 1969, also performs out of the Centennial Concert Hall.",
				"after": "Le Cercle MoliÃ¨re (founded 1925) is the oldest French-language theatre in Canada,[122] and Manitoba Theatre Centre (founded 1958) is Canada's oldest English-language regional theatre.[123] Manitoba Theatre for Young People was the first English-language theatre to win the Canadian Institute of the Arts for Young Audiences Award, and offers plays for children and teenagers as well as a theatre school.[124] The Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG), Manitoba's largest art gallery and the sixth largest in the country, hosts an art school for children; the WAG's permanent collection comprises over twenty thousand works, with a particular emphasis on Manitoban and Canadian art.[125][126]",
