				"Superscripts may indicate not only exponentiation, but modification of a function. Examples include:",
				"Subscripts are often used to indicate arguments, typically integers. In a few cases, the semicolon (;) or even backslash (\\) is used as a separator. In this case, the translation to algorithmic languages admits ambiguity and may lead to confusion."
			],
				"after": "Most special functions are considered as a function of a complex variable. They are analytic; the singularities and cuts are described; the differential and integral representations are known and the expansion to the Taylor series or asymptotic series are available. In addition, sometimes there exist relations with other special functions; a complicated special function can be expressed in terms of simpler functions. Various representations can be used for the evaluation; the simplest way to evaluate a function is to expand it into a Taylor series. However, such representation may converge slowly if at all. In algorithmic languages, rational approximations are typically used, although they may behave badly in the case of complex argument(s).",
