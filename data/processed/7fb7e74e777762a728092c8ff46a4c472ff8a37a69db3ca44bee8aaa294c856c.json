				"previous": "Westrobothnian (mÃ¥Le or bondska[1]) is a number of closely related non-standardized Scandinavian dialects spoken natively in the coast of the historical province of Westrobothnia in co-existence with Finnish, Sami and during the last centuries, national standard language Swedish. Westrobothnian is the northernmost dialect group of the North Germanic languages in Sweden and borders the traditional Sami speaking Lapland to the west and Finnish speaking Torne Valley to the north. Like all Scandinavian, the different varieties of Westrobothnian originate in Proto-Norse and dialects of Old Norse, spoken by immigrating Germanic settlers during the Viking Age. It has three grammatical genders in most dialects, two plural forms of indefinite nouns, and broad usage of definite nouns. Nouns are also inflected differently in the dative and accusative case. Some adjectives can be serially joined with nouns and some have two plural forms. A pleonastic article is always used before people's and pet's names in the vocative and when referring to a person.",
