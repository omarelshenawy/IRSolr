				"after": "Roosevelt was included with Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln at the Mount Rushmore Memorial, designed in 1927 with the approval of Republican President Calvin Coolidge.[210][211] For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, Roosevelt's commanders recommended him for the Medal of Honor. In the late 1990s, Roosevelt's supporters again recommended the award. On January 16, 2001, President Bill Clinton awarded Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor posthumously for his charge on San Juan Hill, Cuba, during the SpanishâAmerican War.[212] The United States Navy named two ships for Roosevelt: the USSÂ Theodore RooseveltÂ (SSBN-600), a submarine that was in commission from 1961 to 1982, and the USSÂ Theodore RooseveltÂ (CVN-71), an aircraft carrier that has been on active duty in the Atlantic Fleet since 1986. On November 18, 1956, the United States Postal Service released a 6Â¢ Liberty Issue postage stamp honoring Roosevelt. A 32Â¢ stamp was issued on February 3, 1998, as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.[citation needed]",
