				"after": "In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.[78] In Spain RamÃ³n de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La CoruÃ±a in 1845 which was inspired by ProudhonÂ´s ideas.[79] The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish[80] and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock \"These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's.\"[81] According to the Encyclopedia Britannica \"During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or \"cantonalist,\" political system on Proudhonian lines.\"[79]",
