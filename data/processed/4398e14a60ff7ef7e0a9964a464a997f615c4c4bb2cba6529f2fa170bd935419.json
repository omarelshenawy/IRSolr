				"after": "In 162 BC, the Xiongnu troops of Laoshang Chanyu had invaded and driven the Yuezhi from their homeland; the Chanyu had the Yuezhi monarch executed and his skull fashioned into a drinking cup.[57][122] Thus the Han court decided it was favorable to send an envoy to the Yuezhi to secure a military alliance.[123] In 138 BC, the diplomat Zhang Qian left with an envoy and headed towards the Yuezhi encampments.[57][124] However, the envoy was captured by the Xiongnu and held hostage.[57][123] A decade went by, until Zhang Qian and some of his convoy escaped.[57][123] They travelled to the territories of Ferghana (Dayuan å¤§å®), Soghdiana (Kangju åº·å±), and Bactria (Daxia å¤§å¤), ultimately finding the Yuezhi forces north of the Amu River.[123] Despite their efforts, the envoy could not secure a military alliance.[66][123] As the Yuezhi had settled in those new lands for quite some time, they had almost no desire to wage a war against the Xiongnu.[66][123] In 126 BC, Zhang Qian headed to the Hexi Corridor in order to return to his nation.[32] While traveling through the area, he was captured by the Xiongnu, only to escape a year later and return to China in 125 BC.[47]",
