				"after": "At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the Apple TV (previously known as the iTV),[200] a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40Â GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for HDMI and component video, and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p.[201] On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40Â GB model.[202] A software update released on January 15, 2008 allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.[203]",
