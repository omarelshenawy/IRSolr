				"previous": "Conventional nautical charts are printed on large sheets of paper at a variety of scales. Mariners will generally carry many charts to provide sufficient detail for the areas they might need to visit. Electronic navigational charts, which use computer software and electronic databases to provide navigation information, can augment or in some cases replace paper charts, though many mariners carry paper charts as a backup in case the electronic charting system fails.",
				"after": "Nautical charts must be labeled with navigational and depth information. There are a few software solutions in the market that do automatic label placement for any kind of map or chart.",
