				"The Boeing T50 (company designation Model 502) was a small turboshaft engine produced by Boeing. Based on Boeing's earlier Model 500 gas generator, the T50's main application was in the QH-50 DASH helicopter drone of the 1950s. An up-rated version designated Model 550 was developed to power the QH-50D and was given the military designation T50-BO-12."
