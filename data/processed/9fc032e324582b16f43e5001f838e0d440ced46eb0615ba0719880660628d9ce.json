The general contractors Hegeman & Harris built it for $11.3Â million, although the reported twenty-year mortgage value was $12Â million[16][17] ($12Â million in 1925 equates to about 160Â million in 2015 dollars). Clad in gray Indiana limestone, topped with a copper pyramid roof, and standing on a site running 174Â ft (53Â m) east â west on Jackson Boulevard and 240Â ft (73Â m) north â south on LaSalle Street, the 605Â ft (184Â m) tall art deco-styled building opened on June 9, 1930. It serves as the southern border for the skyscrapers hugging LaSalle Street and is taller than surrounding structures for several blocks. The Chicago Board of Trade has operated continuously on its fourth floor since the 1930 opening, dedicating 19,000 square feet (1,800Â m2) to what was then the world's largest trading floor.[18]",
