Six and Executive Vice President Harding Lawrence (who came to Continental from Pioneer when the two carriers merged), who both frequently referred to his company as \"the Airline that needs to grow.\"[5][9][pageÂ needed] In 1958 Continental introduced turboprop service with the Vickers Viscount on the new medium-haul routes. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many of the smaller cities on the system, enabling the carrier's new aircraft to operate more economically on longer flights. In 1960 Continental flew more than three times the passenger-miles it had in 1956. (Aviation Week June 22, 1959: \"Continental's current re-equipment program â involving a total cost of $64 million for the Boeings, Viscounts and DC-7Bs â was launched in 1955 when the carrier's net worth amounted to $5.5 million.\")",
