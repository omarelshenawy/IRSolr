				"previous": "The United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially the Panama Canal construction and control) led to the separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation (the United States intensively encouraged the Panamanian separatist movement).[16] From 1903 until 1968, Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a commercially oriented oligarchy. During the 1950s, the Panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy's political hegemony.",
				"after": "Amidst negotiations for the RoblesâJohnson treaty, Panama held elections in 1968. The candidates were Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Antonio GonzÃ¡lez Revilla, and engineer David Samudio, who had the government's support. Samudio was the candidate of Alianza del Pueblo (\"People's Alliance\"), Arias Madrid was the candidate of UniÃ³n Nacional (\"National Union\"), and GonzÃ¡lez Revilla was the candidate of Democracia Cristiana (\"Christian Democrats\") (see Pizzurno GelÃ³s and AraÃºz, Estudios sobre el PanamÃ¡ republicano 508).[17]",
