				"previous": "Stone tools, weapons, elephants, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as 2000 BC, although there are no existing records from that time. Historians have theorized that the state of Lhomon (literally, \"southern darkness\"), or Monyul (\"Dark Land\", a reference to the Monpa, the aboriginal peoples of Bhutan) may have existed between 500 BC and AD 600. The names Lhomon Tsendenjong (Sandalwood Country), and Lhomon Khashi, or Southern Mon (country of four approaches), have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles.[22][23]",
				"after": "Buddhism was first introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD. Tibetan king SongtsÃ¤n Gampo[24] (reigned 627â649), a convert to Buddhism, who actually had extended the Tibetan Empire into Sikkim and Bhutan,[25] ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, at Bumthang in central Bhutan and at Kyichu (near Paro) in the Paro Valley.[26] Buddhism was propagated in earnest[24] in 746[27] under King Sindhu RÄja (also KÃ¼njom;[28] Sendha Gyab; Chakhar Gyalpo), an exiled Indian king who had established a government in Bumthang at Chakhar Gutho Palace.[29]:35 [30]:13",
