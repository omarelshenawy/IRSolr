				"previous": "In the first era (1stâ6th editions, 1768â1826), the Britannica was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, by Archibald Constable, and by others. The Britannica was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh as the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French EncyclopÃ©die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (published 1751â72), which had been inspired by Chambers's Cyclopaedia (first edition 1728). The Britannica was primarily a Scottish enterprise; it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment.[96] In this era, the Britannica moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editorâWilliam Smellie[97]âto a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities. Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of Abraham Rees's CyclopÃ¦dia and Coleridge's EncyclopÃ¦dia Metropolitana[98] and David Brewster's Edinburgh EncyclopÃ¦dia.",
