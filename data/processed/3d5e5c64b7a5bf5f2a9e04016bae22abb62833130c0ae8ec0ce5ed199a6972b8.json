				"after": "Boone was a militia officer during the Revolutionary War (1775â83), during which he was elected to the first of his three terms in the Virginia General Assembly. Following the war, Boone worked as a surveyor and merchant, but fell deeply into debt through failed Kentucky land speculation. In 1799 Boone emigrated to eastern Missouri, where he spent most of the last two decades of his life. Boone remains an iconic figure in American history; his adventures â real and legendary â were influential in creating the archetypal Western hero of American folklore.",
