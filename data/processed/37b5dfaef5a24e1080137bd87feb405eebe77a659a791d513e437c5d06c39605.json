				"previous": "In 1877 Beato sold most of his stock to the firm Stillfried & Andersen,[32] who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to Adolfo Farsari in 1885.[49] Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen, Beato apparently retired for some years from photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and trader.[50] On 29 November 1884 he left Japan, ultimately landing in Port Said, Egypt.[51] It was reported in a Japanese newspaper that he had lost all his money on the Yokohama silver exchange.[52]",
			"after": [
				"From 1884 to 1885 Beato was the official photographer of the expeditionary forces led by Baron (later Viscount) G.J. Wolseley to Khartoum, Sudan, in relief of General Charles Gordon.[52]",
				"Briefly back in England in 1886, Beato lectured the London and Provincial Photographic Society on photographic techniques.[52]"
