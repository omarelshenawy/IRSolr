				"after": "Banksia aemula is generally a gnarled shrub or small tree to 8Â m (25Â ft), although usually smaller. The trunk has thick orange-brown wrinkled and warty bark, and the new growth is hairy but becomes smooth as it ages.[1] New shoot growth is in spring and summer.[2] The shiny green leaves are obovate to oblong in shape and measure 3â22Â cm (1.4â9Â in) in length, and 1â2Â cm (0.4â0.8Â in) in width. The leaf ends are truncate and the margins flat and serrated. Flowering is in autumn, from March to June; the green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are terminal, found on the ends of branches and emerging from the foliage. Measuring 4 to 20Â cm (1.6â8Â in) in height and 8 to 9Â cm (2.8â3.2Â in) in width, they are various shades of pale and greenish yellow.[1] Anywhere from 800 to 1700 individual small flowers arise from a central woody spike (or rachis). Initially tipped with white conical pollen presenters, the flowers open sequentially from the bottom to the top of the inflorescence over one to two weeks,[3] in a process known as anthesis. Each flower produces nectar for around seven days after opening.[4] The flower spikes turn grey as they age and up to 25 finely furred grey follicles appear, which can be very large, measuring 3â4.5Â cm (1.2â2.6Â in) long, 2â3.5Â cm (0.8â1.4Â in) high, and 2â3.5Â cm (0.8â1.4Â in) wide. They split open either after bushfire or spontaneously, and release oval seeds 4â4.7Â cm (1.6â1.9Â in) in length, composed of a wedge-shaped body 1â1.5Â cm (0.4â0.6Â in) long and 1.1â1.6Â cm (0.4â0.6Â in) wide, and curved wing 2â3.2Â cm (0.8â1.3Â in) wide. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody lignotuber after fire.[1]",
