				"after": "One of Brownhills' most prominent landmarks is a 46 feet (14Â m) stainless steel sculpture of a coal miner, erected in May 2006 on a roundabout at one end of the High Street, where the A4124 Pelsall Road and High Street A452 cross. The colossal sculpture, by John McKenna ARBS, commemorates the town's mining tradition.[89][90] A competition was organised to choose an official nickname for the statue. The winning name was Jigger after Jack \"Jigger\" Taylor who died when the roof of Walsall Wood pit collapsed in 1951.[91]",
