				"previous": "The German inventor Christian HÃ¼lsmeyer was the first to use radio waves to detect \"the presence of distant metallic objects\". In 1904 he demonstrated the feasibility of detecting a ship in dense fog, but not its distance from the transmitter.[4] He obtained a patent[5] for his detection device in April 1904 and later a patent[6] for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship. He also got a British patent on September 23, 1904[7] for a full radar system, that he called a telemobiloscope. It operated on a 50 cm wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a spark-gap. His system already used the classic antenna setup of horn antenna with parabolic reflector and was presented to German military officials in practical tests in Cologne and Rotterdam harbour but was rejected.[8]",
