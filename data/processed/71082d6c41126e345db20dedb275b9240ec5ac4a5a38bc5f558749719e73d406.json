				"previous": "There are several major annual events such as First Night, which occurs on New Year's Eve, the Boston Early Music Festival, the annual Boston Arts Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, and Italian summer feasts in the North End honoring Catholic saints.[158] The city is the site of several events during the Fourth of July period. They include the week-long Harborfest festivities[159] and a Boston Pops concert accompanied by fireworks on the banks of the Charles River.[160]",
				"after": "Because of the city's prominent role in the American Revolution, several historic sites relating to that period are preserved as part of the Boston National Historical Park. Many are found along the Freedom Trail, which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded in the ground. The city is also home to several art museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.[161] The Institute of Contemporary Art is housed in a contemporary building designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in the Seaport District.[162] The University of Massachusetts Boston campus on Columbia Point houses the John F. Kennedy Library. The Boston Athenaeum (one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States),[163] Boston Children's Museum, Bull & Finch Pub (whose building is known from the television show Cheers),[164] Museum of Science, and the New England Aquarium are within the city.",
