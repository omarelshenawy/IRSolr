				"previous": "Phoenician traders,[45] who used the islands as a stop on their trade routes from the eastern Mediterranean to Cornwall, joined the natives on the island.[46] The Phoenicians inhabited the area now known as Mdina, and its surrounding town of Rabat, which they called Maleth.[47] The Romans, who also much later inhabited Mdina, referred to it (and the island) as Melita.[28]",
				"after": "After the fall of Phoenicia in 332 BC, the area came under the control of Carthage, a former Phoenician colony.[48] During this time the people on Malta mainly cultivated olives and carobs, and produced textiles.[48]",
