				"after": "When international cricket resumed after the Great War, Armstrong, now over forty years of age, was appointed captain of a strong Australian team boosted by the inclusion of players such as Jack Gregory and Herbie Collins who had starred in the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team. Armstrong was much older than many of his team-mates and was the subject of some awe; Gregory describing him as \"my ideal cricketer\".[60] The English team, captained once again by Johnny Douglas was no match for the Australians, who won all five Tests in the 1920â21 series, completing the first and only Ashes whitewash for 86 years on 1 March.[61] Armstrong was masterful throughout the Test series. He scored 474Â runs at an average of over 77 including three centuries; 158 in Sydney, 121 in Adelaide and 123 not out in Melbourne.[62] Before going out to bat in the second innings at Sydney, he was seen, \"padded up, [drinking] whisky with his mates at the members' bar\".[63]",
