				"after": "In 1973, after a four-year disappearance,[2] the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams. Beginning with Batman #251's \"The Joker's Five-Way Revenge,\" the character returns to his roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman.[34][35] This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character.[36] O'Neil said his idea was \"simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.\"[37] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the Joker's legal insanity, the reason he was sent to Arkham Asylum (then Arkham Hospital) after its creation in 1974 instead of to prison.[38] Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.[39]",
