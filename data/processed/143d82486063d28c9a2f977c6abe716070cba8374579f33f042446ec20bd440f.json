				"previous": "The A350-1000 will feature a slightly larger wing than the â800/900 models; a trailing-edge extension increasing its area by 4%. This will extend the high-lift devices and the ailerons, making the chord bigger by around 400Â mm, optimising flap lift performance as well as cruise performance.[129] These and other engineering upgrades are necessary so that the â1000 model does not suffer a reduction in range.[148] Qatar Airways will be the launch customer of the -1000 variant.[149]",
