				"Elita dropped heavy rainfall of over 200Â mm (8Â inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. Over 50,000Â people were left homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces. Flooding from the storm damaged or destroyed more than 450Â kmÂ² (170Â sqÂ mi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. Across the island, the cyclone caused at least 33Â deaths, with its impact further compounded by Cyclone Gafilo about two months later. Elsewhere, the cyclone brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi, while its outer circulation produced rough seas and strong winds in Seychelles, Mauritius, and RÃ©union."
