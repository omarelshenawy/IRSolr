				"previous": "The phase of water (i.e., whether it assumes the form of a solid, liquid, or gas) is determined by its temperature and pressure. For example, in the case of liquid-gas transition, at each pressure there is a special âtransition temperatureâ such that if the sample temperature is even a little above , the sample will be a gas, but, if the sample temperature is even a little below , the sample will be a liquid; see phase transition. For example, at the standard atmospheric pressure, is 100Â Â°CÂ =Â 212Â Â°F. The transition temperature decreases with decreasing pressure (which explains why water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes and at higher temperatures in a pressure cooker; see here for more information). In the case of water vapor in air, the corresponding to the partial pressure of water vapor is called the dew point. (The solidâliquid transition also happens around a specific transition temperature called the melting point. For most substances, the melting point also decreases with decreasing pressure, although water ice in particular - in its Ih form, which is the most familiar one - is a prominent exception to this rule.)",
				"after": "Here we follow the discussion in Ref.[3] To first approximation, the formation of vortex cores is thermodynamically an adiabatic process, i.e., one with no exchange of heat. In such a process, the drop in pressure is accompanied by a drop in temperature, according to the equation",
