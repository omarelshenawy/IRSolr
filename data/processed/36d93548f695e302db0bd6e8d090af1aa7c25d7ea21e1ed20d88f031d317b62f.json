				"after": "Communist China had been tacitly supported by the Soviet Union since the 1920s, though the Soviet Union diplomatically recognised the Republic of China, Joseph Stalin supported cooperation between the Nationalists and the Communistsâincluding pressuring the Nationalist Government to grant the Communists state and military positions in the government.[13] This was continued into the 1930s that fell in line with the Soviet Union's subversion policy of popular fronts to increase communists' influence in governments.[13] The Soviet Union urged military and cooperation between Soviet China and Nationalist China during China's war against Japan.[13] Initially Mao Zedong accepted the demands of the Soviet Union and in 1938 had recognized Chiang Kai-Shek as the \"leader\" of the \"Chinese people\".[14] In turn, the Soviet Union accepted Mao's tactic of \"continuous guerilla warfare\" in the countryside that involved a goal of extending the Communist bases, even if it would result in increased tensions with the Nationalists.[14]",
