				"after": "The man is positioned within an undefined narrow space and set against a flat black background. Typically for van Eyck, the head is large in relation to the torso. He is dressed in typically Burgundian fashion, with a red robe and a green wool chaperon with a bourrelet and cornette hanging forward. The headdress is trimmed with fur, fastened with two buttons, and extends to the parapet.[17] His right hand might be holding the end of the cornette.[15] Neither the shape of his head nor his facial features correspond to contemporary standard types, let alone canons of ideal beauty. The sitter appears to be bald, although there are some faint traces of fair hair, leading Erwin Panofsky to conclude that his \"countenance is as 'Nordic' as his dress is Burgundian.\"[18] He has neither eyebrows nor stubble, while it is believed the eyelashes were added by a 19th-century restorer.[15] Van Eyck's cool observation of the man's narrow shoulders, pursed lips and thin eyebrows extends to detailing the moisture on his blue eyes.[17] He holds a scroll that might be a legal document, letter or pamphlet. In his early portraits, van Eyck's sitters are often shown holding objects indicative of their profession.[12] The scroll contains six lines of illegible writing. The abbreviations are more prominent and seem to be in Latin, but may be vernacular.[6]",
