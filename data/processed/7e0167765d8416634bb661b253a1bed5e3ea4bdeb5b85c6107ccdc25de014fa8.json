The Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and NCOs with battle experience, and experienced a small expansion. Here, the Marines fought their famed battle at Belleau Wood, creating the Marines' reputation in modern history. While its previous expeditionary experiences had not earned it much acclaim in the Western world, the Marines' ferocity and toughness in France earned them the respect of the Germans, who rated them of stormtrooper quality.[citation needed] Though Marines and American media reported that Germans had nicknamed them Teufel Hunden as meaning \"Devil Dogs\", there is no evidence of this in German records (as Teufelshunde would be the proper German phrase). Nevertheless, the name stuck.[44]",
