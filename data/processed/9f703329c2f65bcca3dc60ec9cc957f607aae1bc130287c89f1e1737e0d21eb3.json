				"after": "When the approach and landing phase began, the orbiter was at a 3,000Â m (9,800Â ft) altitude, 12Â km (7.5Â mi) from the runway. The pilots applied aerodynamic braking to help slow down the vehicle. The orbiter's speed was reduced from 682 to 346Â km/h (424 to 215Â mph), approximately, at touch-down (compared to 260Â km/h or 160Â mph for a jet airliner). The landing gear was deployed while the Orbiter was flying at 430Â km/h (270Â mph). To assist the speed brakes, a 12Â m (39Â ft) drag chute was deployed either after main gear or nose gear touchdown (depending on selected chute deploy mode) at about 343Â km/h (213Â mph). The chute was jettisoned once the orbiter slowed to 110Â km/h (68.4Â mph).",
