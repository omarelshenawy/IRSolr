				"after": "On November 23, 1998, Madonna appeared on the Spanish RTVE show A La Carta and performed \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\", along with her other song \"The Power of Good-Bye\".[14] 3 years later, Madonna named her 2001 Drowned World Tour after the song, which was also performed as the opening number. She entered the stage amidst billows of dry ice, dressed in a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, jeans with zips and bondage straps, a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt and performed the song standing on a rising platform on the middle of the stage.[15][16] Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH gave the performance a positive review, saying it was sung beautifully.[17] Also during this same tour, the last lyrics from the song (\"Now, I find I changed my mind/This is my religion\") were used at the end of the performance of \"Ray of Light\".[18]",
