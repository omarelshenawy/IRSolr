				"after": "The American Cream is the only breed of draft horse developed in the United States that is still in existence today.[4] The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny. She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer.[5] She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell, Iowa. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color.[4] Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed,[17] and the color is now known as gold champagne.[3] In 1946, two years after the breed registry was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny.[4]",
