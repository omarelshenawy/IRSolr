				"after": "Barnum bought Jumbo for $10,000. Jumbo's entire costs actually amounted to $30,000. Barnum later wrote that Jumbo earned his costs in his first two weeks with the circus at Madison Square Garden. Jumbo did no tricks, but 20,000 circus-goers per day saw him in the circus zoo and the parade at the start of the show. The London Zoo had sent Jumbo's howdah to America, and, with it, the great elephant gave rides to circus-goers as he had done at the London Zoo.[54]",
