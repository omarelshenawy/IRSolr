Most were capable of top speeds between 16 and 18 knots (21Â mph; 33Â km/h).[25] The ironclads of the 1880s used compound engines, and by the end of the 1880s the even-more efficient triple expansion compound engine was in use. Some fleets, though not the British, adopted the quadruple-expansion steam engine.[26]",
