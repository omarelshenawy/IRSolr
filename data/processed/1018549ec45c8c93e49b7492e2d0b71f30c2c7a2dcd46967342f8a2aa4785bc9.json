				"previous": "The Iberian Peninsula is the westernmost of the three major southern European peninsulasâthe Iberian, Italian, and Balkan. It is bordered on the southeast and east by the Mediterranean Sea, and on the north, west, and southwest by the Atlantic Ocean. The Pyrenees mountains form the northeast edge of the peninsula, separating it from the rest of Europe. Its southern tip is very close to the northwest coast of Africa, separated from it by the Strait of Gibraltar.",
				"after": "The English word Iberia was adapted from the use of the Ancient Greek word ÎÎ²Î·ÏÎ¯Î± (IbÄrÃ­a) by Greek geographers under the rule of the Roman Empire to refer to what is known today in English as the Iberian Peninsula.[1] At that time, the name did not describe a single political entity or a distinct population of people.[2] Strabo's Iberia was delineated from KeltikÄ (Gaul) by the Pyrenees[3] and included the entire land mass southwest (he says \"west\") of there.[4]",
