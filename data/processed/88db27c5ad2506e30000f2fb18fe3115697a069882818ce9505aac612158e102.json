				"previous": "In the event, neither the breakwater nor the railway were built, but the issue was re-examined by the 1858 British Parliamentary Select Committee on Harbours for Refuge. The select committee took evidence from many witnesses about harbours all around the country. For Padstow, evidence from a Captain Claxton, RN, stated that without the removal of the sand, ships in distress could only use the harbour at high tide.[18] The committee was told by J. D. Bryant, a port commissioner and Receiver of Wreck for Padstow,[26] that in 1848 Padstow Harbour Association had cut down a small piece of Stepper Point, which had given ships about 50 fathoms of extra \"fair wind\" into the harbour. Bryant recommended further removal of the point which would allow a true wind along the whole channel past the dangerous sandbar.[27]",
				"after": "The select committee report concluded the bar would return through re-silting if it were dredged, and there were insufficient resources to prevent it. Several alternatives were discussed, including the construction of two guide walls to sluice water across the bar, thereby removing it.[18] Evidence was given that the bar was made up of \"hard sand\" which would prove difficult to remove.[28] During the discussions, it was indicated that whilst the sandbank could be removed by a variety of methods, it would not significantly improve access to the harbour, and that a harbour of refuge would be better on the Welsh coast.[18]",
