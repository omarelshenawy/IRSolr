It works by measuring pressures or pressure differences and using these values to assess the speed and altitude.[1] These pressures can be measured either from the static port (static pressure) or the pitot tube (pitot pressure). The static pressure is used in all measurements, while the pitot pressure is used only to determine airspeed.",
