				"Daoshi (éå£«, \"master of the Tao\") refers to a priest in Taoism. In some schools they practice asceticism in the mountains and alchemy, with the aim of becoming xian, \"mountain men\" or \"holy men\".",
				"The activities of the daoshi tend to be informed by materials which may be found in the Daozang, or Daoist canon; however, daoshi generally choose, or inherit, specific texts which have been passed down for generations from teacher to student, rather than consulting published versions of these works. They can perform a variety of ceremonies and practices, depending on the school they belong."
