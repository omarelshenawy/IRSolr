				"after": "The president and other high-ranking government officials of Iran are still using the aged but famous Shahin, a special VIP designed Boeing 707 which was ordered and purchased by the Shah of Iran in the 1970s. It was initially far more luxuriously outfitted than US Air Force One, but after the Iranian Revolution it was redesigned as a normal VIP aircraft. Another VIP airliner, an Airbus A321 which was purchased during the 1990s, is also used on medium range trips of high officials like the Foreign Minister, the Speaker of Parliament and the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. The other VIP planes in use by the government consist of 1 Dassault Falcon 20, 3 Dassault Falcon 50 and 1 Lockheed JetStar all operated by the Iranian Air Force. The government of Iran also owns a Boeing 727 but it is stored in Iran and no longer used. The interior retains its VIP configuration ordered by Henry Ford II in the 1960s.",
