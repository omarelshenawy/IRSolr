				"previous": "Stela 13 dates to the Late Preclassic. It is badly damaged, having been broken in two parts. It is carved in early Maya style and bears a design representing a stylised serpentine head, very similar to a monument found at Kaminaljuyu.[170] StelaÂ 13 was erected at the base of the south side of StructureÂ 7A. At the base of the stela was found a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels, 33 prismatic obsidian blades, as well as other artifacts. The stela and the offering are associated with the Late Preclassic royal tomb known as BurialÂ 1.[173]",
				"after": "Stela 14 is on the southern edge of TerraceÂ 3, in the Central Group, where it is one of 5 monuments in an east-west row.[77] It is fashioned from andesite and has 26 cup-like depressions upon the upper surface.[126] It is one of the few such monuments found within the ceremonial centre of the city.[175] AltarÂ 48 was found underneath StelaÂ 14 in 2008, having been carefully covered by it in antiquity.[127] Stela 14 measures 2.25 by 1.4 metres (7.4 by 4.6Â ft) by 0.75 metres (2.5Â ft) thick and weighs more than 6 tonnes (6.6 short tons).[128] The lower surface of the stela had been sculpted completely flat with 6 small cupmarks and a series of marks forming a design reminiscent of the discarded skin of a snake or of a vertebral column.[126]",
