				"STS-134 was the penultimate space shuttle mission; STS-135 was added to the schedule in January 2011, and in July Atlantis flew for the final time.[citation needed]",
				"Endeavour landed at the Kennedy Space Center at 06:34 UTC on June 1, 2011, completing its final mission.[15] It was the 25th night landing of a shuttle. [16][17] Over its flight career, Endeavour flew 122,853,151 miles and spent 299 days in space.[18] During Endeavour's last mission, the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA-20 departed from the ISS and paused at a distance of 200 meters. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli took a series of photographs and videos of the ISS with Endeavour docked.[19] This was the second time a shuttle was photographed docked and the first time since 1996. Commander Mark Kelly was the last astronaut off Endeavour after the landing, and the crew stayed on the landing strip to sign autographs and pose for pictures.[citation needed]"
