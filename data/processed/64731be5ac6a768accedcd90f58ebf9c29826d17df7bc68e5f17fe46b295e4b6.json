				"previous": "The New Yorker wrote that \"Colbert has made vital observations about the American political system, particularly about the sordid role that money plays within it. The Colbert Report and the Daily Show [...] have changed the way that young liberals of a certain class think and talk about civic culture.\"[46]",
				"after": "The show also coined another word, wikiality, that means \"reality as decided on majority rule.\" Viewers of the show also coined a word, freem, based on its inclusion in the show's opening sequence; the word refers to \"'freedom' without having to 'do' anything â without any responsibility or action.\"[15] In response to the \"Better Know a District\" segment, Rahm Emanuel, then the Democratic Caucus chair, instructed incoming freshmen not to do appearances on the show in 2007.[115] In 2008, East Carolina University associate professor Jason Bond named a species of trapdoor spider Aptostichus stephencolberti in honor of Stephen Colbert.[116]",
