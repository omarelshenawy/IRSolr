				"after": "The first live performance of \"Like a Prayer\" was on the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour.[95] Madonna started the performance by uttering the word \"God\" suddenly, as everything became silent. Then she started singing \"Like a Prayer\", donning a dress that looked like a cross between a Mediterranean widow's attire and evocative clergyman's robes.[95] A red velvet bed, which was present during the previous performance, was replaced by hundreds of burning candles. At the beginning of the song, Madonna knelt down in front of the stage, as the backup singers cried the words \"Oh my God\" several times.[95] Madonna eventually removed a scarf from her head to display a huge crucifix hanging from her neck, and then rose and sang the full song, while her dancers gyrated around her.[95] Two different performances were taped and released on video: the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990,[96] and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.[97]",
