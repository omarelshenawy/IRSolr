				"previous": "In 1994, the USCG therefore held a fast-track competition to select a new powerplant, and in March 2004 the Guard announced the selection of the Turbomeca Arriel 2C2-CG, already installed on the EC155. This upgrade began in 2004, and has resulted in a safer and more capable aircraft. These modified HH-65As and HH-65Bs, which also gained new avionics and other enhancements, have been designated as HH-65Cs.",
				"after": "The HH-65A's minimum equipment requirements exceeded anything previously packaged into a helicopter weighing less than 10,000 pounds. 75% of the HH-65's structure â including rotorhead, rotor blades and fuselage â consists of corrosion-resistant composite materials. Some Coast Guard pilots have nicknamed the Dolphin as \"Tupperwolf\", a portmanteau of tupperware (because of the aircraft's high composites content)[2] and Airwolf (from the 1980s TV series).",
