Despite the resemblance, Dromaeosauroides is not considered part of that genus. It is unlikely that a genus would survive for 60Â million years; Dromaeosauroides lived during the Early Cretaceous, and Dromaeosaurus during the Late Cretaceous. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.[1]",
