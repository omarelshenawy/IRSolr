Hobson for surmising that the blue stones might be sapphires, and his guess was confirmed by a jeweler in Helena.[44] Ultimately, in 1895, Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office, which in turn sent them via regular, uninsured mail to Tiffany's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. George Frederick Kunz,[18] the leading American gemologist of the time.[60] Impressed by their quality and color, Kunz pronounced them \"the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States\".[2] Tiffany's sent Hoover a check for $3,750 (approximately $106,300 as of 2015),[61] along with a letter that described the blue pebbles as \"sapphires of unusual quality\".[31]",
