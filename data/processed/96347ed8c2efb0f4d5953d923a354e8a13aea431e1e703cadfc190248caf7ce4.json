				"previous": "An owl's eyes are placed at the front of the head and have a field overlap of 50â70%, giving it better binocular vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30â50%).[8] The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36Â million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed,[9] it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10.[10] The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.[10]",
				"after": "Adaptations to night vision include the large size of the eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have superior light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity.[11] Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.[8]",
