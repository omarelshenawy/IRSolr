				"after": "Contemporary Chicago critics considered the building too radical a departure from Burnham & Root's previous designs and too extreme in its stark simplicity and disregard for prevailing aesthetic norms, calling it an \"engineer's house\"[111] and a \"thoroughly puritanical\"[112] example of commercial style.[113] European critics were even less approving. In the words of French architect Jacques Hermant, \"The Monadnock was no longer the result of an artist responding to particular needs with intelligence and drawing from them all of the possible consequences. It is the work of a laborer who, without the slightest study, super-imposes 15 strictly identical stories to make a block then stops when he finds the block high enough.\"[114]",
