				"after": "HMSÂ Royal Oak (pennant number 08) was a Revenge-class battleship of the British Royal Navy. Launched in 1914 and completed in 1916, Royal Oak saw action in First World War at the Battle of Jutland. In the inter-war period, she served in the Atlantic, Home and Mediterranean fleets, coming under accidental attack on more than one occasion. The ship became the centre of worldwide attention in 1928 when her senior officers were controversially court-martialled. During a twenty-five year career, attempts to modernise Royal Oak could not address her fundamental lack of speed, and by the start of the Second World War, she was no longer suited to front-line duty. Royal Oak was anchored at Scapa Flow in Orkney, Scotland on 14 October 1939 when she was torpedoed by the German submarine U-47, becoming the first of the five Royal Navy battleships and battlecruisers sunk in the war. Although the sinking made little difference to the naval balance of power, it considerably affected wartime morale. The raid made an immediate celebrity and war hero out of the U-boat commander, GÃ¼nther Prien, who became the first Kriegsmarine submarine officer to be awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. To the British, the raid demonstrated that the Germans were capable of bringing the naval war to their home waters, and the shock resulted in rapidly arranged changes to dockland security. Now lying almost upside-down in 30Â m of water with her hull 5Â m beneath the surface, Royal Oak is a designated war grave. In an annual ceremony to mark the loss of the ship, Royal Navy divers place a White Ensign underwater at her stern. Unauthorised divers are prohibited from approaching the wreck at any time.",
