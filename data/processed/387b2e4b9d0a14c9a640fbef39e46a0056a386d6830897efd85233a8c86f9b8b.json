It was later announced that pre-owned copies purchased from GameStop would contain the necessary unlock code.[134] A Warner Bros. rep confirmed that playing as Catwoman would not be required to complete the game.[135] The Catwoman DLC also contains two alternate skins for the character: her appearances from The Animated Series and Batman: The Long Halloween.[136] The PC version of the game includes the DLC, requiring no downloads or further installs to access.[38]",
