				"after": "Russia State Transport Company operates two Ilyushin Il-96-300PU for use of the President of Russia. At least one of the aircraft was refitted as a VIP transport in 2001 by a British company for a price of GBP 10 million. The aircraft has the word \"Ð Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸Ñ\" displayed in large Cyrillic letters across the upper side. As pictures leaked to the Internet in 2007 indicate, the luxurious refit included gold-plated bathroom fittings, marble floors, silk-lined walls and other expensive amenities.[34] The aircraft is reported to have an escape capsule, much like the one featured in the film Air Force One.[26]",
