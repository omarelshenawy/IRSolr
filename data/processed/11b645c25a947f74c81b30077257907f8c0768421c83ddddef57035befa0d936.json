				"after": "In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, critic Chris Willman wrote: \"Superior tracks, like 'LoveStoned' and 'What Comes Around', suggest a happy middle path, where Timberlake can equally embrace Timbaland's canny beats and his own vocal helium.\"[20] Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media described the song as \"brilliantlyÂ ... tight, clipped disco funk\" and went onto say that it \"descends precipitously into the gorgeous melancholy of 'I Think That She Knows', all MOR-rock guitar churn and weightless strings, the same chorusÂ ... transformed from infatuation to the paranoid and elegiac admission of an addict\".[21] Lauren Murphy of Entertainment.ie noted \"LoveStoned\" as excellent and \"a sexy, layered affair with inspired violin intervals, and the consecutive interlude is a classy sliver of deftly-produced pop\".[22] Lucy Davies of the BBC wrote: \"'LoveStoned' is a great track, with chopping violins, beatboxing, and bongos. 'I Think She Knows', the interlude which follows, is quite beautiful, shimmering, and brilliantly constructed.\"[23] Jonah Weiner of Blender wrote, \"From the grinding 'SexyBack' to the percolating 'LoveStoned'Â ... the vibe is all infectious, feverish build-up.\"[24] Rolling Stone believed that \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\" was the \"madcap peak\" of the \"historic creative roll\" of Timberlake and Timbaland, describing the song as \"flowing from hip-hop bump-and-grind to an ambient wash of Interpol-inspired guitar drone.\"[25]",
