The Enchey monastery is the city's oldest monastery and is the seat of the Nyingma order.[40] The two-hundred-year-old baroque monastery houses images of gods, goddesses, and other religious artifacts.[40] In the month of January, the Chaam, or masked dance, is performed with great fanfare. The Dro-dul Chorten is a stupa which was constructed in 1945 by Trulshik RimpochÃ©, head of the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism.[40] Inside this stupa are complete set of relics, holy books, and mantras. Surrounding the edifice are 108 Mani Lhakor, or prayer wheels.[40] The complex also houses a religious school.",
