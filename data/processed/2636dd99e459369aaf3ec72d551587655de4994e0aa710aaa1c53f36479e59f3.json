				"after": "A \"painted vulture\" (\"Sarcoramphus sacra\" or \"S. papa sacra\") is described in William Bartram's notes of his travels in Florida during the 1770s. This bird's description matches the appearance of the king vulture except that it had a white, not black, tail.[22] Bartram describes the bird as being relatively common and even claimed to have collected one.[22] However, no other naturalists record the painted vulture in Florida and sixty years after the sighting its validity began to be questioned, leading to what John Cassin described as the most inviting problem in North American ornithology.[22] An independent account and painting was made of a similar bird by Eleazar Albin in 1734.[23]",
