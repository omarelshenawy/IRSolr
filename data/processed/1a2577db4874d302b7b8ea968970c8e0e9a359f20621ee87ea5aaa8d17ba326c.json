				"after": "The piano music of Gabriel FaurÃ© is among his best known work. Written between the 1860s and the 1920s, FaurÃ©'s major sets of piano works are thirteen nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus and four valses-caprices. These sets display the change in his style, over the decades, from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in Fâ¯ major, Mazurka in Bâ­ major, ThÃ¨me et variations in Câ¯ major, and Huit piÃ¨ces brÃ¨ves. For piano duet, FaurÃ© composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil AndrÃ© Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth. Much of the ambidextrous FaurÃ©'s piano music is difficult to play, but it is rarely virtuoso in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement.",
