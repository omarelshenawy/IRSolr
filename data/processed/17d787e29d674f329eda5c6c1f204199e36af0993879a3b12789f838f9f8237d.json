				"previous": "The Silver Museum, sometimes called \"The Medici Treasury\", contains a collection of priceless silver, cameos, and works in semi-precious gemstones, many of the latter from the collection of Lorenzo de' Medici, including his collection of ancient vases, many with delicate silver gilt mounts added for display purposes in the 15th century. These rooms, formerly part of the private royal apartments, are decorated with 17th-century frescoes, the most splendid being by Giovanni da San Giovanni, from 1635 to 1636. The Silver Museum also contains a fine collection of German gold and silver artefacts purchased by Grand Duke Ferdinand after his return from exile in 1815, following the French occupation.[24]",
				"after": "First opened in 1973, this museum is housed in the Casino del Cavaliere in the Boboli Gardens.[25] The porcelain is from many of the most notable European porcelain factories, with SÃ¨vres and Meissen near Dresden being well represented. Many items in the collection were gifts to the Florentine rulers from other European sovereigns, while other works were specially commissioned by the Grand Ducal court. Of particular note are several large dinner services by the Vincennes factory, later renamed SÃ¨vres, and a collection of small biscuit figurines.",
