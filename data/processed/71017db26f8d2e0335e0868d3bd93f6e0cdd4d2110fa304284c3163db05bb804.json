				"after": "The transportation infrastructure in the Philippines is relatively underdeveloped. This is partly due to the mountainous terrain and the scattered geography of the islands, but also the result of the lower investment of the government in infrastructure. In 2013, about 3% of the GDP went to infrastructure development which was lower than that of some of its neighbors.[258][259] There are 213,151 kilometers (132,446Â mi) of roads in the Philippines, with 25.56% of the roads being paved.[260] The current administration under President Benigno Aquino III has been pushing to improve the country's infrastructure and transportation systems through various projects.[261] Buses, jeepneys, taxis, and motorized tricycles are commonly available in major cities and towns. In 2007, there were about 5.53Â million registered motor vehicles with registration increasing at an average annual rate of 4.55%.[262]",
