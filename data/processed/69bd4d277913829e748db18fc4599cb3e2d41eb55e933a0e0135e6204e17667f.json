				"after": "The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing.[19] It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three-dimensional glass cage. This framing device, described by Sylvester as a \"space-frame\", was to feature heavily throughout the artist's career.[26] A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case, falling just in front of the pope's face and partially covering his eyes. It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty, but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon's later works, may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist.[27] Apart from its symbolic meaning, it has a compositional function, framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines.[28] Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 Triptych, MayâJune 1973, where it is clearly a dangling light bulb.[29] For Bacon, these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer, alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off, curtains open or closed.[30]",
