				"after": "Materials science, also commonly known as materials science and engineering, is an interdisciplinary field which deals with the discovery and design of new materials. Though it is a relatively new scientific field that involves studying materials through the materials paradigm (synthesis, structure, properties, and performance), its intellectual origins reach back to the emerging fields of chemistry, mineralogy, and engineering during the Enlightenment.[1] It incorporates elements of physics and chemistry and is at the forefront of nanoscience and nanotechnology research. In recent years, materials science has become more widely known as a specific field of science and engineering.",
