				"previous": "As with any large research institution, Vanderbilt investigators work in a broad range of disciplines, and the university consistently ranks among the top 20 research institutions in the United States.[50][51] In 2013, Vanderbilt University was ranked 9th in the country in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[52] Its Institute for Space and Defense Electronics, housed in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, includes the largest academic facility in the world involved in radiation-effects research.[53]",
				"after": "Among its more unusual activities, the university has institutes devoted to the study of coffee and of bridge.[54] Indeed, the modern form of the latter was developed by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, a former president of the university's Board of Trust and a great-grandson of the Commodore.[54] In addition, in mid-2004 it was announced that Vanderbilt's chemical biology research may have serendipitously opened the door to the breeding of a blue rose, something that has long been coveted by horticulturalists and rose lovers.[55]",
