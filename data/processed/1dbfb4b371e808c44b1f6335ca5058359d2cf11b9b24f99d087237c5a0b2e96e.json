				"previous": "The subspecies division has been challenged, given a lack of clear geographic breaks in their ranges and the minor differences between subspecies.[10]",
				"after": "The bobcat resembles other species of the Lynx genus, but is on average the smallest of the four. Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish-brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. Its spotted patterning acts as camouflage. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. There is generally an off-white color on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions are darkest. Kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots.[11] A few melanistic bobcats have been sighted and captured in Florida. They appear black, but may still exhibit a spot pattern.[12]",
