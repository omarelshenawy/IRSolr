				"previous": "Local silk weaving became a large part of everyday life. The work took place in domestic cottages in a room known as a \"loomshop\",[48] and the woven silk was transported to firms in Macclesfield 8 miles (13Â km) away.[51] Silk-weaving remained commonplace in the area until the early 20th century, when the process became industrialised.[48] Other industries in the area included a corn mill, which collapsed some time during the First World War, located next to the Micker Brook; cotton weaving; and brickworks, one located where the fire station is and one near the railway station.[52] A coal wharf was situated opposite the railway station and supplied the area with coal.[53]",
				"after": "The building of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people in places such as Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of people coming to live in the area.[50][54] In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy Green area, selling groceries, sweets and other provisions.[48] As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand.[52] During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area, and it gradually became more suburban.[55] In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms.[21][56] In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm.[57] By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather's Farm on Ladybridge Road.[58]",
