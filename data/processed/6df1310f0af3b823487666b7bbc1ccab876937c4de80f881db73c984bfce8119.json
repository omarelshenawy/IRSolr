				"previous": "A trimotor is an aircraft powered by three engines and represents a compromise between complexity and safety and was often a result of the limited power of the engines available to the designer. Many trimotors were designed and built in the 1920s and 1930s, when engine power lagged behind the designers' power requirements.",
