				"after": "Discoveries in organometallic chemistry have led to important insights into chemical bonding. Zeise's salt, K[PtCl3(C2H4)]Â·H2O, was reported in 1831[6] and Mond's discovery of Ni(CO)4 occurred in 1888.[24] Each contained a bond between a metal centre and small molecule, ethylene in the case of Zeise's salt and carbon monoxide in the case of nickel tetracarbonyl.[5] The space-filling model of the anion of Zeise's salt (image at left)[23] shows direct bonding between the platinum metal centre (shown in blue) and the carbon atoms (shown in black) of the ethylene ligand; such metalâcarbon bonds are the defining characteristic of organometallic species. However, bonding models were unable to explain the nature of such metalâalkene bonds until the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model was proposed in the 1950s.[11] The original formulation covered only metalâalkene bonds[24] but the model was expanded over time to cover systems like metal carbonyls (including [Ni(CO)4]) where Ï backbonding is important.[25]",
