				"previous": "In 2007 controversy about the academic program arose, when members of the Baltimore City College Alumni Association argued that the IB Program was diverting a significant amount of the school's resources to benefit a fraction of the student population.[65] Approximately 30 students out of 1300 were enrolled in the full IB Diploma Program at City College. Some members also argued that the rigidity of the program did not give students enough flexibility.[56] Citing these concerns, the alumni association encouraged the school to replace the IB Program with the \"A course\" and expand the number of Advanced Placement courses offered.[65] In December 2008 City announced the donation of $50,000 by alumnus H. Corbin Gwaltney '39. The founder and longtime editor of Johns Hopkins Magazine, Gwaltney's donation will benefit the modernization of City's library.[66] This is the second largest donation by a single alumnus to the school, David Rubenstein, founder of the Carlyle Group donated the largest amountâ$100,000 in 2006.",
