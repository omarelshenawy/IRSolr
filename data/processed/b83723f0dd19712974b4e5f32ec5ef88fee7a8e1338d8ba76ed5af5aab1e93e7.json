				"previous": "In January 1912, Baden-Powell was en route to New York on a Scouting World Tour, on the ocean liner SSÂ Arcadian, when he met Olave St Clair Soames.[40][41] She was 23, while he was 55; they shared the same birthday, 22 February. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation due to Baden-Powell's fame. To avoid press intrusion, they married in private on 30 October 1912, at St Peter's Church in Parkstone.[42] The Scouts of England each donated a penny to buy Baden-Powell a wedding gift, a car (note that this is not the Rolls-Royce they were presented with in 1929). There is a monument to their marriage inside St Mary's Church, Brownsea Island.",
				"after": "Baden-Powell and Olave lived in Pax Hill near Bentley, Hampshire from about 1919 until 1939.[43] The Bentley house was a gift of her father.[44] Directly after he had married, Baden-Powell began to suffer persistent headaches, which were considered by his doctor to be of psychosomatic origin and treated with dream analysis.[9] The headaches disappeared upon his moving into a makeshift bedroom set up on his balcony.",
