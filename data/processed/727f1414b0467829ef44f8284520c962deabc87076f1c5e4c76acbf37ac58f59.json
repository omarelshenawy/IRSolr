				"previous": "In the plane , a horizontal shear (or shear parallel to the x axis) is a function that takes a generic point with coordinates to the point ; where is a fixed parameter, called the shear factor.",
				"after": "Straight lines parallel to the -axis remain where they are, while all other lines are turned, by various angles, about the point where they cross the -axis. Vertical lines, in particular, become oblique lines with slope . Therefore the shear factor is the cotangent of the angle by which the vertical lines tilt, called the shear angle.",
