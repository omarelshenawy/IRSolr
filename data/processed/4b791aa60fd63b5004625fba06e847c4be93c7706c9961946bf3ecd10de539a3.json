				"previous": "B-52Bs reached the end of their structural service life by the mid-1960s and all were retired by June 1966, followed by the last of the B-52Cs on 29 September 1971; except for NASA's B-52B \"008\" which was eventually retired in 2004 at Edwards AFB, California.[176] Another of the remaining B Models, \"005\" is on display at the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver, Colorado.[177]",
				"after": "A few time-expired E models were retired in 1967 and 1968, but the bulk (82) were retired between May 1969 and March 1970. Most F models were also retired between 1967 and 1973, but 23 survived as trainers until late 1978. The fleet of D models served much longer; 80 D models were extensively overhauled under the Pacer Plank program during the mid-1970s.[178] Skinning on the lower wing and fuselage was replaced, and various structural components were renewed. The fleet of D models stayed largely intact until late 1978, when 37 not already upgraded Ds were retired.[179] The remainder were retired between 1982 and 1983.[180]",
