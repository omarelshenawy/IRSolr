Several concentration camps were formed in Serbia and at the 1942 Anti-Freemason Exhibition in Belgrade the city was pronounced to be free of Jews (Judenfrei). On 1 April 1942, a Serbian Gestapo was formed. An estimated 120,000 people were interned in German-run concentration camps in NediÄ's Serbia between 1941 and 1944. 50,000[106] to 80,000 were killed during this period.[95] Serbia became the second country in Europe, following Estonia,[107][108] to be proclaimed Judenfrei (free of Jews).[25][109][110][111][112] Approximately 14,500 Serbian Jews â 90 percent of Serbia's Jewish population of 16,000 â were murdered in World War II.[113]",
