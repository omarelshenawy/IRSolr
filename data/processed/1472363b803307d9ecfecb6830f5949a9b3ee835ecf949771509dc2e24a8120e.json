				"previous": "More attempts were made by Jeremy Thacker in England in 1714, and Henry Sully in France in 1716, who published his work in 1726 with Une Horloge inventÃ©e et executÃ©e par M. Sulli, but these inventions remained unable to resist the rolling of the high seas and keep time precisely enough.[5]",
				"after": "In 1714, the British government offered a longitude prize for a method of determining longitude at sea, with the awards ranging from Â£10,000 to Â£20,000 (Â£2 million to Â£4 million in 2015 terms) depending on accuracy. John Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter, submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force, which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea. Construction of his third machine, designated H3, in 1759 included novel circular balances and the invention of the bi-metallic strip and caged roller bearings, inventions which are still widely used. However, H3's circular balances still proved too inaccurate and he eventually abandoned the large machines.[7]",
