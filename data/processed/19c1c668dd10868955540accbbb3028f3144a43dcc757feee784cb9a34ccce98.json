				"previous": "Dan-Air was the first British operator of the Boeing trijet, at the time the world's best-selling commercial jetliner. The first of three former Japan Airlines Boeing 727 100 series[36] was introduced on 13 April 1973[37] [38] The aircraft needed a full stall protection system, among other modifications, fitted to meet British requirements.[39][40]",
				"after": "Dan-Air's original eight Boeing 727-100s, which entered service between 1973 and 1978, differed from overseas-registered aircraft. Dan-Air's additional emergency doors each side of the rear fuselage as well as a stall-protection system known as a \"stick pusher\". The additional exits came from having an increased maximum seating capacity of 150. For certification, the British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requirement was that all passengers could leave within 90 seconds using only half the available exits. Stall protection had been introduced in the light of experience with the stalling characteristics of both civil and military British T-tailed jet aircraft[41] including the loss of a Hawker Siddeley Trident on a test flight over Norfolk when it entered a deep stall. This stall-protection system consisted of a stick pusher, a \"nudger\" and an independent \"shaker\" for each pilot. When the aircraft was in danger of stalling it warned the pilots by shaking the control columns as well as correcting attitude and altitude, in an attempt to increase air speed and so avert an irrecoverable deep stall. It was estimated that installing stall-protection cost Dan-Air Â£100,000 per aircraft and up to Â£1 million for the entire fleet.[38][42][43][44]",
