				"previous": "After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for even more capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the \"Hunchback of Mukilteo\" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage.[48][49] In 1986, the manufacturer announced the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest.[49] By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the 777 designation.[49] Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.[46]",
				"after": "Buoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s, with 1989 being the most prolific year with 132 firm orders.[40][45] By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession.[40] During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.[50] By the end of the decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined.[51] The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes.[20][52] Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights.[20] The increase in the number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional hub-and-spoke model.[20][52]",
