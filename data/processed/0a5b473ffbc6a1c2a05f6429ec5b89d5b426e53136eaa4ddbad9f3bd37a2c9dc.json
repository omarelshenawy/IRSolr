				"previous": "The male calls from near the nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate. He may also carry nest material into the nest hole.[5] The display and nest building is repeated in autumn. The preferred locations for the autumn display are old Eurasian tree sparrow nests, particularly those where nestlings had hatched. Empty nest boxes, and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds, such as tits, pied flycatchers or common redstarts, are rarely used for the autumn display.[36]",
				"after": "The untidy nest is composed of hay, grass, wool or other material and lined with feathers,[30] which improve the thermal insulation.[37] A complete nest consists of three layers; base, lining and dome.[36] The typical clutch is five or six eggs (rarely more than four in Malaysia),[31] white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots, small blotches, or speckling;[38] they are 20Â xÂ 14Â mm (0.8Â xÂ 0.6Â in) in size and weigh 2.1Â g (0.08Â oz), of which 7% is shell.[3] The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12â13 days before the altricial, naked chicks hatch, and a further 15â18 days elapse before they fledge. Two or three broods may be raised each year;[3] birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs, but the reverse is true for second and third clutches.[39] Females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time, so within-pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs' reproductive ability.[40] There is a significant level of promiscuity; in a Hungarian study, more than 9% of chicks were sired by extra-pair males, and 20% of the broods contained at least one extra-pair young.[41]",
