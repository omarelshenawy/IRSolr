				"after": "Access to airport lounges may be obtained in several ways.[6] In Australia, Canada, and the United States, a common method to gain access is by purchasing an annual or a lifetime membership, while in Asia and Europe this is usually impossible.[citation needed] Membership fees are sometimes discounted for elite members of an airline's frequent flyer program, and may often be paid using miles. Certain high-end credit cards associated with an airline, such as the Delta Reserve Credit Card and the United MilagePlus Club card, include membership to the lounges for as long as one owns the card.[7]",
