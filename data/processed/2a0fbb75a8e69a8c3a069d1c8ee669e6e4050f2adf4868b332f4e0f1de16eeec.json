In April 1999, Boeing proposed to cut the price of the C-17 if the Air Force bought 60 more,[34] and in August 2002, the order was increased to 180 aircraft.[35] In 2007, 190 C-17s were on order for the USAF.[36] On 6 February 2009, Boeing was awarded a $2.95 billion contract for 15 additional aircraft, increasing the total USAF C-17 fleet to 205 and extending production from August 2009 to August 2010.[37] On 6 April 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that there would be no more C-17s ordered beyond the 205 planned.[38] However, on 12 June 2009, the House Armed Services Air and Land Forces Subcommittee added a further 17 C-17s.[39]",
