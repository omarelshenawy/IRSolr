				"previous": "Takalik Abaj is located in the north of the municipality of El Asintal, in the extreme north of Retalhuleu department, some 120 miles (190Â km) from Guatemala City.[17] The site lies among five coffee plantations in the lower foothills of the Sierra Madre mountains; the Santa Margarita, San Isidro Piedra Parada, Buenos Aires, San ElÃ­as and Dolores plantations.[18] Takalik Abaj sits upon a ridge running northâsouth, descending in a southwards direction.[19] This ridge is bordered on the west by the NimÃ¡ River and on the east by the IxchayÃ¡ River, both flowing down from the Guatemalan Highlands.[20] The IxchayÃ¡ flows in a deep ravine but a suitable crossing point is located near to the site. The situation of Takalik Abaj at this crossing point was probably important in the founding of the city, since this channeled important trade routes through the site and controlled access to them.[21]",
				"after": "Takalik Abaj sits at an altitude of approximately 600 metres (2,000Â ft) above sea level in an ecoregion classed as subtropical moist forest.[23] The temperature normally varies between 21 and 25Â Â°C (70 and 77Â Â°F) and the potential evapotranspiration ratio averages 0.45.[24] The area receives high annual rainfall, varying between 2,136 and 4,372 millimetres (84 and 172Â in), with an average annual rainfall of 3,284 millimetres (129Â in).[25] Local vegetation includes the Pascua de MontaÃ±a (Pogonopus speciosus), Chichique (Aspidosperma megalocarpon), Tepecaulote (Luehea speciosa), Caulote or West Indian Elm (Guazuma ulmifolia), Hormigo (Platymiscium dimorphandrum), Mexican Cedar (Cedrela odorata), Breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), Tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and Papaturria (Coccoloba montana).[26]",
