				"after": "Wild condors maintain a large home range, often traveling 250Â km (160Â mi) a day in search of carrion.[41] It is thought that in the early days of its existence as a species, the California condor lived off the carcasses of the \"megafauna\", which are now extinct in North America. They still prefer to feast on large, terrestrial mammalian carcasses such as deer, goats, sheep, donkeys, horses, pigs, cougars, bears, or cattle. Alternatively, they may feed on the bodies of smaller mammals, such as rabbits or coyotes, aquatic mammals such as whales and California sea lions, or salmon. Bird and reptile carcasses are rarely eaten. Since they do not have a sense of smell,[42] they spot these corpses by looking for other scavengers, like eagles and smaller vultures, the latter of which cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor. They can usually intimidate other scavengers away from the carcass, with the exception of bears, which will ignore them, and golden eagles, which will fight a condor over a kill or a carcass.[19] In the wild they are intermittent eaters, often going for between a few days to two weeks without eating,[41] then gorging themselves on 1â1.5 kilograms (2.2â3.3Â lb) of meat at once.",
