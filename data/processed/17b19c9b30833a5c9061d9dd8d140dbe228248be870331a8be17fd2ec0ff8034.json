				"previous": "The gray mouse lemur is nocturnal, sleeping during the day in tree holes lined with leaf litter or purpose-built spherical nests constructed from dead leaves, moss and twigs.[9] It usually forages alone at night, but may sleep in groups during the day, the composition of which depends on gender and season.[7] Tree holes can be shared with up to 15 other individuals,[9] although males tend to sleep alone while females tend to share nests.[6]",
				"after": "All mouse lemurs are highly active at night,[10] often scurrying like mice and leaping over 3Â m (9.8Â ft),[22] using the tail as a balancing organ.[10] When moving among the terminal branches of bushes and trees, they grip using all four feet and move with four legs.[10][22] When on the ground, either to catch insects or cross short open areas, mouse lemurs hop like a frog.[10] When hunting, the grey mouse lemur is known to catch invertebrates and small vertebrates with quick hand grasps.[17]",
