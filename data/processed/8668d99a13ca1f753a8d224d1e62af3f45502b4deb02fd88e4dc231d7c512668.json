				"after": "Mice are common experimental animals in laboratory research of biology and psychology fields primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of homology with humans. They are the most commonly used mammalian model organism, more common than rats. The mouse genome has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse genes have human homologs. They can also be manipulated in ways that are illegal with humans, although animal rights activitsts often object. A knockout mouse is a genetically engineered mouse that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a gene knockout.",
