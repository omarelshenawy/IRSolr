				"after": "The former Birmingham Central Library, opened in 1972, was considered to be the largest municipal library in Europe.[252] Six of its collections were designated by the Arts Council England as being \"pre-eminent collections of national and international importance\", out of only eight collections to be so recognised in local authority libraries nationwide.[253] A new Library of Birmingham in Centenary Square, replacing Central Library, was opened on 3 September 2013. It was designed by the Dutch architects Mecanoo and has been described as \"a kind of public forumÂ ... a memorial, a shrine, to the book and to literature\".[254] This library faces cuts, due to reduced funding from Central government.[255]",
