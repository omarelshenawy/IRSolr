				"As the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body, Apollo 8's profile had two different sets of orbital parameters, separated by a translunar injection maneuver.",
				"Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal 100-nautical-mile (185Â km) circular Earth parking orbit. Apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of 99.99 nautical miles (185.18Â km) and a perigee of 99.57 nautical miles (184.40Â km), with an inclination of 32.51Â° to the Equator, and an orbital period of 88.19Â minutes. Propellant venting increased the apogee by 6.4 nautical miles (11.9Â km) over the 2Â hours, 44Â minutes and 30Â seconds spent in the parking orbit.[21]"
