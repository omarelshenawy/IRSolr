				"previous": "One of the most serious shortcomings of the 2-pdr was the lack of a high explosive shell, especially when the 2-pdr was the main gun of a tank; this was very important when a tank was being used for infantry support, leaving it with only its machine gun for anti-personnel use. A high explosive shell was designed for the 2-pdr, but never produced.[3]",
