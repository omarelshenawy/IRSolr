				"Guor Marial (born 15 April 1984) is a South Sudanese track and field athlete. He is a Dinka tribesman.",
				"Marial competed in the men's marathon at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Because South Sudan did not yet have a recognized national Olympic committee (NOC), Marial competed under the Olympic Flag at the 2012 Olympics, rather than the South Sudanese flag. He is one of four athletes competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics under the Olympic flag rather than that of an individual country."
