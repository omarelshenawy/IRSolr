				"previous": "Xerochrysum bracteatum can be grown in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower growing cultivars are suitable for hanging baskets and border plantings.[38] The flowers attract butterflies to the garden.[40] Dried flowers are long lastingâup to some yearsâand are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry.[37] More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers.[41] The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.[42]",
