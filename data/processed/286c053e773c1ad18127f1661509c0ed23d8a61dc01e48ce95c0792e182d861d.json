				"previous": "East Lansing is very much a college town, with 60.2% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24.[152] President John A. Hannah's push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States.[153] Around 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the Residence Halls Association. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus,[154] mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a co-op.",
