They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists.[30] Fractures in their wing bones also indicate that they were used in combat.[27] It has also been suggested that these fractures may instead have been the result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries.[31] But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour.[25] Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.[23]",
