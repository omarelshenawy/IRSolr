Unlike the 747-400ER, no customers ordered the optional body fuel tanks (cargo compartment fuel tanks). The 747-400ERF has a maximum takeoff weight of 910,000 pounds (412,769Â kg) and a maximum payload of 248,600 pounds (112,760Â kg). It offers cargo airlines the choice of either adding 22,000 pounds (9,980Â kg) more payload than other 747-400 freighter variants, or adding 525 nautical miles (972Â km) to the maximum range.[33]",
