				"previous": "In September 2008, Alenia North America was awarded a USAF contract to upgrade and refurbish 18 G.222s, to be transferred to and used by the Afghan Air Force and Afghan National Army Air Corps. Ballistic protection, adaptations for serving in the conditions of Afghanistan, and many new avionics systems, including a digital auto-pilot, were installed; two aircraft were also configured for VIP transport duties.[22][24] In January 2013, the USAF decided not to renew the support contract for the Afghan fleet due to claimed servicability issues and operational difficulties; Alenia responded, stating that the fleet was exceeding the requirements laid out by the USAF, with 10-12 aircraft available for operations against the requirement for six.[25] The 16 G.222s delivered to Afghanistan were scrapped in the summer of 2014 by the Defense Logistics Agency.[26] After the U.S. spent $486 million to buy 20 C-27As, 16 were sold as scrap to an Afghan construction company for about $32,000; the planes were scrapped \"to minimize impact on drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\" The four remaining aircraft are stored at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, with the U.S. seeking other interested buyers. From January to September 2012, the Afghan C-27A fleet flew only 234 out of 4,500 required hours.[27]",
