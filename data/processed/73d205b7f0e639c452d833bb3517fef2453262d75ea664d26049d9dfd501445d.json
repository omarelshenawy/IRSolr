				"previous": "Meanwhile, planning began for Operation Dauntless, a drive 30 kilometres (19Â mi) into the Iron Triangleâa key communist concentration area and communications junction in the central sector between Chorwon and Kumwha in the south and Pyonggang in the north. Contingency planning also included precautions against a further Chinese offensive, in which the US Eighth Army would conduct a delaying defence on successive positions.[20] Further indications of an imminent communist offensiveâincluding the visible strengthening of Chinese and North Korean artillery and logistic systemsâled Ridgway to order Van Fleet not to exploit any opportunities beyond the Wyoming Line. Confident nonetheless, Ridgway widened the scope of the offensive, designating a secondary objective line in the eastern sector known as the Alabama Line. Fate would intervene however, and Van Fleet launched his offensive on 21 April only to be met by a much stronger Chinese and North Korean offensive the following night.[5]",
				"after": "The First Chinese Spring Offensiveâalso known as the Chinese Fifth Phase Campaign, First Impulseâenvisioned the total destruction of the US I and IX Corps above the Han River, involving three Chinese Army Groupsâthe 3rd, 9th, and 19th Army Groupsâand three North Korean corpsâthe I, III and V Corpsâunder the overall command of Peng Dehuai, the commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea.[23][24][25][note 1] With the immediate objective of capturing Seoul, the offensive commenced on 22 April on two broad fronts: the main thrust across the Imjin River in the western sector held by the US I Corps involving 337,000 troops driving towards Seoul, and the secondary effort involving 149,000 troops attacking further east across the Soyang River in the central and eastern sectors, falling primarily on the US IX Corps, and to a lesser extent on the US X Corps sector.[26] A further 214,000 Chinese troops supported the offensive; in total more than 700,000 men.[5] As part of the preparation, the battle hardened 39th and 40th Armies of the 13th Army Group were transferred to the 9th Army Group under the overall command of Song Shi-Lun, and Commander Wen Yuchen of the 40th Army was given the mission of destroying the South Korean 6th Division while blocking any UN reinforcements towards the Imjin River at Kapyong.[27][note 2]",
