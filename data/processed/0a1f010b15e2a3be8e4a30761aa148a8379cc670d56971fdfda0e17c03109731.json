The delegation from the Bureau International des Expositions which visited Dubai in February 2013 to examine the Emirateâs readiness for the largest exposition, was impressed by the infrastructure, and the level of national support. In May 2013, Dubai Expo 2020 Master Plan was revealed.[137] Dubai then won the right to host Expo 2020 on 27 November 2013.[138] The event will bring huge economic benefits by generating activities worth billions of dirhams and may create over 270,000 jobs.[139]",
