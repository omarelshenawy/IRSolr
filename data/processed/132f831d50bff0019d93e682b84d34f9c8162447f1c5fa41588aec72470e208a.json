				"after": "In the Muslim world, it seems the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but western influences have changed attitudes. Now, Bedouins are less likely to have long hair.[37] Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as satanic and a sign of an infidel.[38] Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.",
