Flight operations started in 1938 with a single floatplane of the type Waco YKS-7. In 1939 the airline had to be grounded when the aircraft was destroyed in a capsizing accident. The company moved to ReykjavÃ­k, where it acquired another Waco aircraft and was re-launched in 1940 as FlugfÃ©lag Ãslands, which translates as Flight Company of Iceland.[5] Previously, two unrelated airlines of the same name had existed in the country (from 1919 to 1920, and between 1928 and 1931).[6] For international purposes, the name Iceland Airways was adopted.[7]",
