				"previous": "A quantum state can be either pure or mixed. A pure quantum state is represented by a vector, called a state vector, in a Hilbert space. For example, when dealing with the energy spectrum of the electron in a hydrogen atom, the relevant state vectors are identified by the principal quantum number, written . For a more complicated case, consider Bohm's formulation of the EPR experiment, where the state vector",
				"after": "involves superposition of joint spin states for two particles. Mathematically, a pure quantum state is represented by a state vector in a Hilbert space over complex numbers, which is a generalization of our more usual three-dimensional space.[1] If this Hilbert space is represented as a function space, then its elements are called wave functions.",
