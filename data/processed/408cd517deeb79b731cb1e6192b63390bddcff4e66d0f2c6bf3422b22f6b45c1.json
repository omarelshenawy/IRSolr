DumÃ©zil[173] thinks it might have been an Etruscan (or local) creation based on Vitruvius' treatise on architecture, in which the three deities are associated as the most important. It is possible that the Etruscans paid particular attention to Menrva (Minerva) as a goddess of destiny, in addition to the royal couple Uni (Juno) and Tinia (Jupiter).[174] In Rome, Minerva later assumed a military aspect under the influence of Athena Pallas (Polias). DumÃ©zil argues that with the advent of the Republic, Jupiter became the only king of Rome, no longer merely the first of the great gods.",
