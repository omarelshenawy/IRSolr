				"previous": "In 2010, a new model was introduced, the SR22T. This used a new engine, the Continental TSIO-550K that produces 315Â hp (235Â kW) with a 7.5:1 compression ratio and will run on 94 octane fuel.[14]",
				"after": "SR22s that were built before 2003 were equipped with traditional analog instruments and a 10\" Multi-function display (MFD). In 2003 SR22s were first delivered with the Avidyne Entegra primary flight display which later that year became standard equipment, making the aircraft the first of its kind to come standard with an all glass cockpit.[15] Retrofits are available for the older aircraft that replace the instrument panels with a new one that will include the PFD, a new multifunction display and the installation of back-up mechanical instruments.[16]",
