				"after": "Laevistrombus canarium has a heavy shell with a rounded outline. The shell length of adult specimens is from 29Â mm (1.1Â in) to 71Â mm (2.8Â in).[7] The outer surface of the shell is almost completely smooth, except for barely visible spiral lines and occasional varices on the spire. Unlike species in the genus Strombus, the stromboid notch on the outer lip is inconspicuous. When a normal adult dextral shell of this species is viewed ventrally (with the anterior end pointing downwards), the stromboid notch can be observed to the right of the siphonal canal as a shallow, secondary anterior indentation in the lip. The siphonal canal itself is straight, short and ample; the columella is smooth, without any folds.[1] Adult specimens have a moderately flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip,[7][17] which is considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at the shoulder, with a few anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.[6]",
