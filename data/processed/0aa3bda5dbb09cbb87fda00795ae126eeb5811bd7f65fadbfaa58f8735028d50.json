				"after": "The Americas are usually accepted as having been named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by the German cartographers Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller and Matthias Ringmann.[4] Vespucci, who explored South America between 1497 and 1502, was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the East Indies, but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans. In 1507, WaldseemÃ¼ller produced a world map, in which he placed the word \"America\" on the continent of South America, in the middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio:[5]",
