				"previous": "IUCN was established on October 5, 1948, in Fontainebleau, France, when representatives of governments and conservation organizations signed a formal act constituting the International Union for Protection of Nature (IUPN). It is considered to be the first GONGO, i.e. Governmental and Non-Governmental Organization. The initiative to set up the new organisation came from UNESCO and especially from its first Director General, the British biologist Julian Huxley.",
				"after": "The objectives of the new Union were to encourage international cooperation in the protection of nature, to promote national and international action and to compile, analyse and distribute information. At the time of its founding IUPN was the only international organisation focusing on the entire spectrum of nature conservation (an international organisation for the protection of birds, now BirdLife International, had been established in 1922.)",
