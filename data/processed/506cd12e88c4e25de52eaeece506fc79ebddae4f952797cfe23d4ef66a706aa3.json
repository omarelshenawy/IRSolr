				"after": "As part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes builtÂ â among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.[124]",
