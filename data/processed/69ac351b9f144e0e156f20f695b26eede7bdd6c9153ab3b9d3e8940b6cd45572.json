				"previous": "Current knowledge on genetic diversity is fragmentary and the total number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy.[15] Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains obscure.[26] The Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization.[27]",
				"after": "Scientific evidence suggests that life began on Earth at least 3.5Â billion years ago.[29][30] The earliest evidences for life on Earth are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland[31] and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.[32][33]",
