				"after": "Supersonic speed is a rate of travel of an object that exceeds the speed of sound (MachÂ 1). For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20Â Â°C (68Â Â°F) at sea level, this speed is approximately 343.2Â m/s, 1,125 ft/s, 768Â mph, 667Â knots, or 1,235Â km/h. Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound (MachÂ 5) are often referred to as hypersonic. Flight during which only some parts of the air surrounding an object, such as the ends of rotor blades, reach supersonic speeds are called transonic. This occurs typically somewhere between MachÂ 0.8 and MachÂ 1.23",
