				"after": "The African crake occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Kenya and south to KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, except in arid areas of south and southwest Africa where the annual summer rainfall is less than 300Â mm (11.8Â in). It is widespread and locally common in most of its range, apart from the rainforests and the drier regions. Nearly all the South Africa population of about 8,000 birds occur in KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transvaal Province, and much good habitat is protected in the Kruger National Park and iSimangaliso Wetland Park. This crake is only a vagrant to southern Mauritania, southwest Niger, Lesotho, South Africa's northern and eastern Cape Province and North West Province,[2][13] and southern Botswana.[14] Further afield, it is rare on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea),[15] and there have been two records each for Sao Tome and Tenerife, the Canary Islands birds being the first records for the Western Palaeartic.[16][17] Holocene remains from North Africa suggest that the species may have been more widespread when the climate was wetter in what is now the Sahara.[18][19]",
