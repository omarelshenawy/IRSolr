				"after": "The 787-8 is the base model of the 787 family, with a length of 186 feet (57Â m) and a wingspan of 197 feet (60Â m) and a range of 7,650 to 8,200 nautical miles (14,170 to 15,190Â km), depending on seating configuration. It is the first of the 787 variants, and the third Boeing widebody (after the 747SP and the 777-200LR), with a wingspan wider than the length of the fuselage. The 787-8 seats 242 passengers in a three-class configuration.[257] The variant was the first of the 787 line to enter service, entering service in 2011. Boeing is targeting the 787-8 to replace the 767-200ER and 767-300ER, as well as expand into new non-stop markets where larger planes would not be economically viable. Approximately 43% of 787 orders are for the 787-8 in November 2014.[1]",
