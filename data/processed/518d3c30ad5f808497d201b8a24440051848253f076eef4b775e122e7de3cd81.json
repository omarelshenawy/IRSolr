				"after": "There are also many deep and wide ranging conjectures in number theory whose proofs seem too difficult for current techniques, such as the Twin prime conjecture which asks whether there are infinitely many primes p such that pÂ +Â 2 is prime. On the assumption of the ElliottâHalberstam conjecture it has been proven recently that there are infinitely many primes p such that pÂ +Â k is prime for some positive even k at mostÂ 12. Also, it has been proven unconditionally (i.e. not depending on unproven conjectures) that there are infinitely many primes p such that pÂ +Â k is prime for some positive even k at mostÂ 246.",
