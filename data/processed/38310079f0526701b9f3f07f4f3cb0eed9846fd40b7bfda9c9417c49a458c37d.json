				"previous": "The 727 also proved popular with cargo airlines and charter airlines. FedEx Express introduced 727s in 1978.[26] 727s were the backbone of its fleet until recently, but FedEx is now phasing them out in favor of the Boeing 757.[26] Many cargo airlines worldwide employ the 727 as a workhorse, since, as it is being phased out of U.S. domestic service due to noise regulations, it becomes available to overseas users in areas where such noise regulations have not yet been instituted. Charter airlines Sun Country, Champion Air, and Ryan International Airlines all started with 727 aircraft.",
				"after": "The 727 saw some military use as well. Since the aft stair could be opened in flight, the Central Intelligence Agency used them to drop agents and supplies behind enemy lines in Vietnam.[27]",
