				"previous": "The 1941â45 period of World WarÂ II is known in Russia as the \"Great Patriotic War\". During this conflict, which included many of the most lethal battle operations in human history, Soviet military and civilian deaths were 10.6Â million and 15.9Â million respectively,[77] accounting for about a third of all World WarÂ II casualties. The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater.[78] The Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation,[79] but the Soviet Union emerged as an acknowledged military superpower on the continent.",
				"after": "The Red Army occupied Eastern Europe after the war, including East Germany. Dependent socialist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states. Becoming the world's second nuclear weapons power, the USSR established the Warsaw Pact alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the United States and NATO. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and, later on, the Republic of Cuba. Significant amounts of the Soviet resources were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.[80]",
