				"previous": "During the Libyan Civil War, violence between protestors and the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi escalated, and on 17Â March 2011 led to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which called for a ceasefire, and authorized military action to protect civilians. AÂ coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya shortly afterwards. On 20 March 2011, NATO states agreed on enforcing an arms embargo against Libya with Operation Unified Protector using ships from NATO Standing Maritime GroupÂ 1 and Standing Mine Countermeasures GroupÂ 1,[89] and additional ships and submarines from NATO members.[90] They would \"monitor, report and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries\".[89]",
				"after": "On 24Â March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone from the initial coalition, while command of targeting ground units remained with the coalition's forces.[91][92] NATO began officially enforcing the UN resolution on 27Â March 2011 with assistance from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.[93] By June, reports of divisions within the alliance surfaced as only eight of the 28 member nations were participating in combat operations,[94] resulting in a confrontation between US Defense Secretary Robert Gates and countries such as Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Germany to contribute more, the latter believing the organization has overstepped its mandate in the conflict.[95][96][97] In his final policy speech in Brussels on 10 June, Gates further criticized allied countries in suggesting their actions could cause the demise of NATO.[98] The German foreign ministry pointed to \"aÂ considerable [German] contribution to NATO and NATO-led operations\" and to the fact that this engagement was highly valued by President Obama.[99]",
