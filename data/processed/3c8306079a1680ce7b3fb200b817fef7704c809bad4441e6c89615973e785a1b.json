An almost complex manifold is complex if and only if it admits a holomorphic coordinate atlas. An almost Hermitian structure is given by an almost complex structure J, along with a Riemannian metric g, satisfying the compatibility condition"

In particular, a KÃ¤hler manifold is both a complex and a symplectic manifold. A large class of KÃ¤hler manifolds (the class of Hodge manifolds) is given by all the smooth complex projective varieties."
