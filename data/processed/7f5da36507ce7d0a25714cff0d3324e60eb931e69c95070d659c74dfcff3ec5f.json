				"Approximately 70 languages are native to Sudan.[128]",
				"Sudanese Arabic is the most widely spoken language in the country. It is the variety of Arabic, an Afro-Asiatic language of the Semitic branch, that is spoken throughout Sudan. The dialect has borrowed much vocabulary from local Nilo-Saharan languages (Nobiin, Fur, Zaghawa, Borgu). This has resulted in a variety of Arabic that is unique to Sudan, reflecting the way in which the country has been influenced by Nilotic, Arab, and western cultures. Few nomads in Sudan still have similar accents to the ones in Saudi Arabia. Other important languages include Beja (AKA Bedawi) along the Red Sea, with perhaps 2 million speakers. It is the only language from the Afro-Asiatic family's Cushitic branch that is today spoken in the territory."
