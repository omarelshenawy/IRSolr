				"previous": "Aoki ultimately produced Chrono Trigger, while director credits were attributed to Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era.[2] Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs.[3] Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development.[38] The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style.[39] Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi was responsible for the game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas.[2][39] Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists.[40] Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott's visual work in the film Alien as an inspiration for the game's lighting.[41] Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice lay between that of Secret of Mana and the Final Fantasy series.[41]",
				"after": "Yuji Horii, a fan of time travel fiction (such as the TV series The Time Tunnel), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama.[42][43] Horii liked the scenario of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle.[39] Concerning story planning, Horii commented, \"If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in.\"[39] Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father.[39] Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 B.C. era.[4] He took pains to avoid what he described as \"a long string of errands...[such as] 'do this,' 'take this,' 'defeat these monsters,' or 'plant this flag'.\"[3] Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel.[41] Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest.[3] Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story.[3] Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths.[44] Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots.[4] Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects.[4] Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done.[41] Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen.[41] The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games, which used static enemy graphics.[41]",
