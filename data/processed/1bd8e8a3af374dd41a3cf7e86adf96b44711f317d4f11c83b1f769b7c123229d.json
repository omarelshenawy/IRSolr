				"The Quran is the central religious text of Islam. Muslims believe that it represents the words of God revealed to Muhammad through the archangel Gabriel.[28][29][30]",
				"Although it mentions Muhammad directly only four times,[31][QuranÂ 3:144][QuranÂ 33:40][QuranÂ 47:2][QuranÂ 48:29] there are verses which can be interpreted as allusions to Muhammad's life.[14][n 4] The Quran, however, provides minimal assistance for Muhammad's chronological biography; most verses in the Quran do not provide much in the way of historical context.[32][33]"
