The lowest casualty estimate is 8,000 (5,000 Egyptian and 3,000 Syrian) killed and 18,000 wounded.[34] The highest estimate is 18,500 (15,000 Egyptian and 3,500 Syrian) killed.[40] Most estimates lie somewhere in between the two, with the Insight Team of the London The Sunday Times combined Egyptian and Syrian losses of 16,000 killed.[6] and yet another source citing a figure of some 15,000 dead and 35,000 wounded.[44] U.S. estimates placed Egyptian casualties at 13,000.[333] Iraq lost 278 killed and 898 wounded, while Jordan suffered 23 killed and 77 wounded.[42] Some 8,372 Egyptians, 392 Syrians, 13 Iraqis and 6 Moroccans were taken prisoner.[41][334]",
