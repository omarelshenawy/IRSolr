				"after": "The Romance language most widely spoken natively today is Spanish (Castilian), followed by Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian and Catalan, which together cover a vast territory in Europe and beyond, and work as official and national languages in dozens of countries. Galician, with more than a million native speakers, is official together with Spanish in Galicia, and has legal recognition in neighbouring territories in Castilla y LeÃ³n. A few other languages have official recognition on a regional or otherwise limited level; for instance, Asturian and Aragonese in Spain; Mirandese in Portugal; Friulan, Sardinian and Franco-ProvenÃ§al in Italy; and Romansh in Switzerland.",
