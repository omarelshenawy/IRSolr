				"previous": "On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent a letter to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi noted that there had been some delay in the preparation of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow.[10] Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.[11]",
				"after": "On receipt, the sketches and letter were forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with making recommendations on coinage design, and then to its sculptor member, James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel. Fraser wrote to Rossi on May 18, deprecating the designs, \"the bear is entirely too short, and the whole thing inexperienced and amateurish.\"[12] He recommended that Chester Beach (credited with the design of the Monroe Doctrine coin) or Robert I. Aitken (who had created the Panama-Pacific $50 pieces) be hired, as both were from California and might create \"something which would be far more interesting and with a bigger sense of what California really is\".[12]",
