				"previous": "In the 1990s, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) began the HyTECH program for hypersonic propulsion. Pratt & Whitney received a contract from the AFRL to develop a hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet engine which led to the development of the SJX61 engine. The SJX61 engine was originally meant for the NASA X-43C, which was eventually canceled. The engine was applied to the AFRL's Scramjet Engine Demonstrator program in late 2003.[4] The scramjet flight test vehicle was designated X-51 on 27 September 2005.[5]",
				"after": "In flight demonstrations, the X-51 is carried by a B-52 to an altitude of about 50,000 feet (15Â km; 9.5Â mi) and then released over the Pacific Ocean.[6] The X-51 is initially propelled by an MGM-140 ATACMS solid rocket booster to approximately MachÂ 4.5 (2,970Â mph; 4,780Â km/h). The booster is then jettisoned and the vehicle's Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne SJY61 scramjet accelerates it to a top flight speed near Mach 6.[7][8] The X-51 uses JP-7 fuel for the SJY61 scramjet, carrying some 270Â lb (120Â kg) on board.[1]",
