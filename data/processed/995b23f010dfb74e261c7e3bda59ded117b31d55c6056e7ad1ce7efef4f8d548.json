				"previous": "Perhaps the most thorough redesign was of the wing, the objective being to match the performance of the cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A.[78] Engineers designed a new, one-piece supercritical wing, which improves cruise performance by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift-to-drag ratio.[78] Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher aspect ratio, reduced sweep (from 40Â° to 37Â°), and an area increased from 200Â sqÂ ft (18.6Â m2) to 230Â sqÂ ft (21.4Â m2). The wing has a high-lift configuration, employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped ailerons. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700Â lb (3,035Â kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000Â ft (300Â m) takeoff roll.[79] Because the wing is almost exclusively composite, it is 330Â lb (150Â kg) lighter than the AV-8A's smaller wing.[78]",
				"after": "The Harrier II was the first combat aircraft to extensively employ carbon-fiber composite materials, exploiting their light weight and high strength;[80][81] they are used in the wings, rudder, flaps, nose, forward fuselage, and tail. Twenty-six percent of the aircraft's structure is made of composites, reducing its weight by 480Â lb (217Â kg) compared to a conventional metal structure.[76]",
