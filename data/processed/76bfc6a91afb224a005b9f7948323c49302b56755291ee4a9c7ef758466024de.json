It became necessary to appoint a composite governing body, a third of them public representatives nominated by the Kent Education Committee, who also had some control over school affairs. Subsequently a fee of one guinea was paid to those who attended meetings of the governing body, the first of which was held on 4Â February 1920, at Skinners' Hall in London.[19][47]",
