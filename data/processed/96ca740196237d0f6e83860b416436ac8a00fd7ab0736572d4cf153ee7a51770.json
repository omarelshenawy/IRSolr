D. Lindsay, Nuffield wrote to him on 15Â August 1939 to say that he felt \"obliged to adhere to my adverse judgement of the plans\".[1] The design was \"un-English and out of keeping with the best tradition of Oxford architecture\", said Nuffield, adding that \"if a building of this type were to be erected, I would not allow my name to be associated therewith\".[1]",
