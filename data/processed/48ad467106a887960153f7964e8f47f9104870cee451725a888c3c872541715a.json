				"previous": "The academy is located approximately 50 miles (80Â km) north of New York City on the western bank of the Hudson River. West Point, New York, is incorporated as a federal military reservation in Orange County and is adjacent to Highland Falls.[80] Based on the significance both of the Revolutionary War fort ruins and of the military academy itself, the majority of the academy area was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.[81][82] In 1841, Charles Dickens visited the academy and said \"It could not stand on more appropriate ground, and any ground more beautiful can hardly be.\"[83] One of the most visited and scenic sites on post, Trophy Point, overlooks the Hudson River to the north, and is home to many captured cannon from past wars as well as the Stanford White-designed Battle Monument.[84] Though the entire military reservation encompasses 15,974 acres (65Â km2), the academic area of the campus, known as \"central area\" or \"the cadet area\", is entirely accessible to cadets or visitors by foot.[85]",
