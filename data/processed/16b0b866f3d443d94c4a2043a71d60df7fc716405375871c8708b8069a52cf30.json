Borobudur was likely founded around 800 CE.[21] This corresponds to the period between 760 and 830Â CE, the peak of the Sailendra dynasty rule upon Mataram kingdom in central Java,[22] when it was under the influence of the Srivijayan Empire. The construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years and been completed during the reign of Samaratungga in 825.[23][24]",
