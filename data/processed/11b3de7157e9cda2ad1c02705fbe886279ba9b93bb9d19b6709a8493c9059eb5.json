				"previous": "In SeptemberÂ 1996Â (1996-09), Vietnam Airlines started offering business class services and in 1999, the airline launched its frequent-flyer program, Golden Lotus Plus;[29] During 1996, Vietnam Airlines looked for aircraft which would substitute the A320s wet-leased from Air France when the deal was over. Apart from acquiring further A320s, the airline considered Boeing 737s and McDonnell Douglas MD-90s.[30] In FebruaryÂ 1996Â (1996-02), GECAS delivered the first of three Boeing 767-300ER to the carrier, on dry-lease for five years.[31] In October the same year, two Boeing 767-300ERs and a Boeing 767-200, on lease from AWAS and Royal Brunei Airlines, respectively, were returned to the lessors, but in early 1997 another Boeing 767-300ER was phased in on a one-year lease from AWAS.[32] With its freedom to operate Western-built aircraft, Vietnam Airlines considered the acquisition of long-haul aircraft to better service Vietnamese living overseas. The Airbus A340, Boeing 747 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 were topics of discussion.[30] Meanwhile, two Fokker 70s were acquired in May and July to replace the twelve Tupolev Tu-134s.[12]:31[33] On 3 September 1997, the crash of a Tupolev Tu-134B, on approach to Phnom Penhâââ'ââs Pochentong Airport in bad weather, resulted in more than 60 fatalities.[34]",
				"after": "A new livery was introduced in early 1998, initially unveiled on a Boeing 767.[35] In DecemberÂ 2001Â (2001-12), Vietnam Airlines signed a historic agreement with Boeing for the acquisition of its first ever US-built aircraft, signalling the start of trade under the Bilateral Trade Agreement between the two countries.[36] The deal involved four Boeing 777-200ERs.[37][38] The transaction was valued at US$680Â million; the first aircraft was initially scheduled for delivery in 2003.[36] These four aircraft, along with six others of the same type that are leased from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), are the flagships of the airline, and serve on medium and long-haul routes, respectively.[39][needs update] During that year, the airline carried 3.4Â million passengers, 1.9Â million of whom were on domestic flights; flights to Beijing resumed and services to Kunming were launched.[13][19] During 2002, Vietnam Airlines considered a lease offer from Airbus for two Airbus A340-300s.[40] On 4 September 2003, a landmark ceremony celebrated the airline's receipt of its first Boeing 777-200ER purchased outright from Boeing.[41] On 28 October, the airline decided to move its operations in Moscow from Sheremetyevo International Airport to Domodedovo International Airport.[42]",
