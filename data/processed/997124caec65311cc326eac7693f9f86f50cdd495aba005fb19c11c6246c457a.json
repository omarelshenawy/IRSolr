				"previous": "Antarctica is divided in two by the Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian.",
				"after": "About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, a sheet of ice averaging at least 1.6Â km (1.0Â mi) thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's fresh water). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about 60Â m (200Â ft).[32] In most of the interior of the continent, precipitation is very low, down to 20Â mm (0.8Â in) per year; in a few \"blue ice\" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by sublimation and so the local mass balance is negative. In the dry valleys, the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.",
