The state has renovated the park camping area since 2003, building modern bathrooms with flush toilets and hot showers, and no longer considers it \"rustic\".[33] The park has updated electric sites for RV campers as well. The campground has picnic tables and fire rings. The park has almost 100Â picnic tables for use; seven of these tables are in shelters.[10] The park hosted some 29,150Â picnickers in 2003.[2]",
