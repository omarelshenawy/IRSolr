This was followed by the talks between NASA and Intercosmos in the 1970s about a \"Shuttle-Salyut\" program to fly Space Shuttle missions to a Salyut space station, with later talks in the 1980s even considering flights of the future Soviet shuttles from the Buran programme to a future US space station â this \"Shuttle-Salyut\" program never materialized however during the existence of the Soviet Intercosmos program.[1]",
