The Webley is a top-break revolver with automatic extraction; breaking the revolver open for reloading also operates the extractor, removing the spent cartridges from the cylinder. The Webley Mk I service revolver was adopted in 1887, but it was a later versionâthe Mk IVâwhich rose to prominence during the Boer War of 1899â1902.

Webley service revolvers are among the most powerful top-break revolvers ever produced, firing the .455 Webley cartridge.
