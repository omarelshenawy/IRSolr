				"previous": "In 15â16th-century French and English depictions of relationships between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by BrantÃ´me in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women.[196] At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.[197]",
				"after": "Lesbianism became almost exclusive to French literature in the 19th century, based on male fantasy and the desire to shock bourgeois moral values.[199] HonorÃ© de Balzac, in The Girl with the Golden Eyes (1835), employed lesbianism in his story about three people living amongst the moral degeneration of Paris, and again in Cousin Bette and SÃ©raphÃ®ta. His work influenced novelist ThÃ©ophile Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin, which provided the first description of a physical type that became associated with lesbians: tall, wide-shouldered, slim-hipped, and athletically inclined.[200] Charles Baudelaire repeatedly used lesbianism as a theme in his poems \"Lesbos\", \"Femmes damnÃ©es 1\" (\"Damned Women\"), and \"Femmes damnÃ©es 2\".[201]",
