				"previous": "Sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found,[22] but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The oldest art objects in the worldâa series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years oldâwere discovered in a South African cave.[23] Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years.[24] Etched shells by homo erectus from 430,000 and 540,000 years ago were discovered in 2014.[25]",
				"after": "Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.",
