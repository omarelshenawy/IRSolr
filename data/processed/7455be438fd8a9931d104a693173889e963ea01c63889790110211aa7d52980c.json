A major Â£675Â million regeneration programme for Cardiff's St. David's Centre was completed in 2009, which has provided a total of 1,400,000 square feet (130,000Â m2) of shopping space, making it one of the largest shopping centres in the United Kingdom.[130] The centre was named the international shopping centre of the year in 2010 by Retail Leisure International (RLI).[131]",
