				"after": "Upon Eagle's arrival in Gibraltar, 824 Squadron transferred to RAF North Front and the ship loaded 15 Supermarine Spitfire fighters brought to Gibraltar by the carrier Argus.[60][61] These aircraft were partly assembled dockside and hoisted aboard for final assembly. They were too big to fit below deck and remained on the flight deck, where they impeded the operations of Eagleââ'âs aircraft, except for those few also carried on the flight deck, until the ferried aircraft were flown off.[62] On 27Â February 1942, she sailed to deliver the Spitfires to Malta, escorted by the battleship Malaya, Argus, the cruiser Hermione, and nine destroyers, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7Â March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off to Malta. Upon her return, the ship's engines required repairs that lasted until 13 March.[63] Nine more Spitfires were delivered to Malta on 21Â March and an additional seven on 29Â March.[64] After her return, her steering gear required extensive repairs that lasted until the end of April.[65]",
