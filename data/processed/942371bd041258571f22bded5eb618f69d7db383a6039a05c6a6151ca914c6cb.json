				"previous": "In 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum. Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.[11]",
				"after": "Gangtok is located at 27Â°19â²57â³N 88Â°36â²50â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿27.3325Â°N 88.6140Â°Eï»¿ / 27.3325; 88.6140 (coordinates of Gangtok head post office).[2] It is situated in the lower Himalayas at an elevation of 1,650Â m (5,410Â ft).[12] The town lies on one side of a hill, with \"The Ridge\",[6][13] a promenade housing the Raj Bhawan, the governor's residence, at one end and the palace, situated at an altitude of about 1,800Â m (5,900Â ft), at the other. The city is flanked on east and west by two streams, namely Roro Chu and Ranikhola, respectively.[11] These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, the eastern and western parts. Both the streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the Teesta at Singtam.[11] Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.[14]",
