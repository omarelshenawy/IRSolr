At the end of 1949 Pan Am, BOAC, and AOA were flying 377s transatlantic, while Northwest was flying in the United States; in January 1950 United began flights from San Francisco to Honolulu. For a short time Pan Am flew their 377s to Beirut, but after 1954 no 377 was scheduled east of Europe or west of Singapore. In 1955 BOAC B377s had 50 First Class seats (fare $400 one way New York to London) or 81 Tourist seats (fare $290).[9]",
