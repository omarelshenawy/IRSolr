				"previous": "Several species have been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were imported from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish what had once been a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced since 1906, after the lumbermen had moved out of the area.[60] The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the otters' diet of 5Â percent trout, some anglers fear the animals would deplete the game fish in the gorge.[58]",
				"after": "Fishers, medium-sized weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as part of an effort to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania.[59] Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania.[61] They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines.[58][62] Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own.[58] Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks,[58] and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.[56]",
