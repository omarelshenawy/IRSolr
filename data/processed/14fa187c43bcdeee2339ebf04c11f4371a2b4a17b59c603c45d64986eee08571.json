				"previous": "The traveller Ibn Battuta, who passed through around 1325, characterised it as \"one of the largest and most beautiful towns of Andalusia [uniting] the conveniences of both sea and land, and is abundantly supplied with foodstuffs and fruits\". He praised its grapes, figs, and almonds; \"its ruby-coloured Murcian pomegranates have no equal in the world.\" Another exported product was its \"excellent gilded pottery\". The town's mosque was large and beautiful, with \"exceptionally tall orange trees\" in its courtyard.[4]",
				"after": "MÃ¡laga was one of the Iberian cities where Muslim rule persisted the longest, having been part of the Emirate of Granada. While most other parts of the peninsula had already been liberated by the reconquista, the medieval Christian Spanish struggled to drive the Muslims out. MÃ¡laga was conquered by Christian forces on 18 August 1487,[5] The Muslim inhabitants resisted assaults and artillery bombardments before hunger forced them to surrender, virtually the entire population was sold into slavery or given as \"gifts\" to other Christian rulers,[6] five years before the fall of Granada.",
