				"previous": "Saint-Gaudens wrote to Roosevelt later in January, \"Whatever I produce cannot be worse than the inanities now displayed on our coins.\"[3] However, Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber, who \"has been in that institution since the foundation of the government, and will be found standing in its ruins\".[12] In May 1906, the sculptor wrote to Roosevelt that he had sent an assistant to Washington to obtain the technical details of the redesign, but \"if you succeed in getting the best of the polite Mr. Barber or the others in charge, you will have done a greater work than putting through the Panama Canal. Nevertheless, I will stick at it, even unto death.\"[12]",
				"after": "In May 1906, Saint-Gaudens wrote to Secretary Shaw, asking if there was any objection to having the date in Roman numerals. Shaw replied, \"While we are making coins for the people of the United States, I think we should confine ourselves to the English language. I have reminded our architects that I will dismiss the first one who puts a V on a public building where a U is intended.\"[14] However, Roosevelt overruled Shaw, and the sculptor proceeded with the use of Roman numerals.[15]",
