				"previous": "The Grade I listed Anglican parish church in Navenby is dedicated to Saint Peter. Despite parish registers existing from 1681, and Bishop's transcripts that go back to 1562, it is difficult to date the building as it has a mishmash of styles, although its origins are probably 13th century.[83]",
				"after": "St Peter's is made up of three parts, including a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859â60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875â76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit.[84]",
