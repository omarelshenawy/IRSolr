				"previous": "The World Conservation Union (IUCN) currently lists the cougar as a \"least concern\" species. The cougar is regulated under AppendixÂ I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),[121] rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts.",
				"after": "In the United States east of the Mississippi River, the only unequivocally known cougar population is the Florida panther. Until 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) recognized both an Eastern cougar (claimed to be a subspecies by some, denied by others)[122][123] and the Florida panther, affording protection under the Endangered Species Act.[124][125] Certain taxonomic authorities have collapsed both designations into the North American cougar, with Eastern or Florida subspecies not recognized,[1] while a subspecies designation remains recognized by some conservation scientists.[38] The most recent documented count for the Florida sub-population is 87 individuals, reported by recovery agencies in 2003.[126] In March 2011, the USFWS declared the Eastern cougar extinct. However, with the taxonomic uncertainty about its existence as a subspecies as well as the possibility of eastward migration of cougars from the western range, the subject remains open.[127]",
