				"after": "Several steroid derivatives have been isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L.Â perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, ergosterol Î±-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3Î²,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant components of the volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor.[53] Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency comparable to that of the antibiotic ampicillin.[54] These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis.[55] Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.Â tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae.[56] A 2009 study found L.Â perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14Â milligrams per kilogram of mushroom.[57] The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin.[58]",
