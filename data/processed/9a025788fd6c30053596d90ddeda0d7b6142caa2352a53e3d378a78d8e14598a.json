Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she will either submerge or leave the water.[22][27] Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent all the subordinates from copulating.[30] The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male.[30] The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.[31]",
