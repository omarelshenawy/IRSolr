				"previous": "A minute of arc (MOA), arcminute (arcmin) or minute arc is a unit of angular measurement equal to one-sixtieth (1â60) of one degree. As one degree is 1â360 of a circle, one minute of arc is 1â21,600 of a circle (or, in radians, Ïâ10,800). It is used in fields that involve very small angles, such as astronomy, optometry, ophthalmology, optics, navigation, land surveying and marksmanship.",
				"after": "A second of arc (arcsecond, arcsec) is 1â60 of an arc minute, 1â3,600 of a degree, 1â1,296,000 of a circle, and Ïâ648,000 (about 1â206,265) of a radian. This is approximately the angle subtended by a U.S. dime coin (18mm) at a distance of 4 kilometres (about 2.5Â mi).[1]",
