				"previous": "Yet another analytic proof uses the argument principle. Let R be a positive real number large enough so that every root of p(z) has absolute value smaller than R; such a number must exist because every non-constant polynomial function of degree n has at most n zeros. For each rÂ >Â R, consider the number",
				"after": "where c(r) is the circle centered at 0 with radius r oriented counterclockwise; then the argument principle says that this number is the number N of zeros of p(z) in the open ball centered at 0 with radius r, which, since rÂ >Â R, is the total number of zeros of p(z). On the other hand, the integral of n/z along c(r) divided by 2Ïi is equal to n. But the difference between the two numbers is",
