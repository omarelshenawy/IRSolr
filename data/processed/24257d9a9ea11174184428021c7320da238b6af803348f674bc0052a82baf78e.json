The reserve is open all year, and access is free, although non-members are charged for using the car park. The main part of the reserve is accessed from the visitor centre using the 1Â km (1,050Â yd) West Bank footpath. After leaving the woodland around the visitor centre, there are two short paths running from the main path; the 200Â m (220Â yd) Fen Trail to a hide overlooking the reed bed, and the 100Â m (110Â yd) Meadow Trail boardwalk loop through wet marsh and past the dragonfly pond. The main footpath continues north past the reedbed to the freshwater lagoon and the Island Hide, then reaches a bank running across the reserve. The new Parrinder hides are placed along this wall. The footpath continues past a tidal lagoon, and over another bank to a saltmarsh, ending at a raised wooden seawatching platform on the dunes by the beach.[24]",
