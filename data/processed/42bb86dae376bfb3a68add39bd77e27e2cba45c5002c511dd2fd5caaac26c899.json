				"previous": "The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages a visitor center next to the curve which is open April to October.[45] The 6,800-square-foot (632Â m2) center has historical artifacts and memorabilia relating to the curve, and a raised-relief map of the AltoonaâJohnstown area.[35] Access to the curve is by a 288-foot (88Â m) funicular or a 194-step stairway.[16][45] The funicular is single-tracked, with the cars passing each other halfway up the slope; the cars are painted to resemble Pennsylvania Railroad passenger cars.[35] Along with the locomotive, a former \"watchman's shanty\" is in the park.[46] Horseshoe Curve is popular with railfans; watchers might see three trains passing at once.[45][47] As part of Norfolk Southern's 21st Century Steam program, the former Nickel Plate steam locomotive 765 traversed Horseshoe Curve in AugustÂ 2012âthe first steam locomotive to do so since 1977âwhile deadheading to and from Harrisburg.[48] Nickel Plate 765 returned to the curve in MayÂ 2013 with public excursion trains from Lewistown to Gallitzin.[49]",
