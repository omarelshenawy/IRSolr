				"previous": "In late 1998 or early 1999, bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot. A series of meetings occurred in early 1999, involving Mohammed, bin Laden, and his deputy Mohammed Atef.[65] Atef provided operational support for the plot, including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers.[65] Bin Laden overruled Mohammed, rejecting some potential targets such as the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles because, \"there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation\".[66][67]",
				"after": "Bin Laden provided leadership and financial support for the plot, and was involved in selecting participants.[68] Bin Laden initially selected Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, both experienced jihadists who had fought in Bosnia. Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in the United States in mid-January 2000. In spring 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar took flying lessons in San Diego, California, but both spoke little English, did poorly with flying lessons, and eventually served as secondaryÂ â or \"muscle\"Â â hijackers.[69][70]",
