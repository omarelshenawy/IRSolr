				"after": "The college purchased 10 acres (0.040Â km2; 0.016Â sqÂ mi) of land in east Oxford (near the Cowley Road) in 1903 for use as a sports ground.[159] The 1905 pavilion was replaced in 1998 by a new pavilion on the opposite side of the sports ground; the old pavilion is now used as a table-tennis room (ground floor) with a three-bedroomed flat for graduates above. Residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 (Thelwall House, rebuilt in 1998), with additions between 1988 and 1990 (Hugh Price House and Leoline Jenkins House).[159][160] Writing in 1974, Pevsner said that Thelwall House was one of the recent college buildings that deserved note.[161]",
