Their arrangement maintained B.Â prionotes in B.Â subg. Banksia, but discarded George's sections and his series Crocinae. Instead, B.Â prionotes was placed at the end of series Banksia, in subseries Cratistylis.[19] Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. To date, this remains the most recent comprehensive arrangement. The placement of B.Â prionotes in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows:[4]",
