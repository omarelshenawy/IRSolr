				"previous": "His successor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, referred to him as \"the great Pope John PaulÂ II\" in his first address from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica, and Angelo Cardinal Sodano referred to John Paul as \"the Great\" in his published written homily for the pope's funeral Mass of Repose.[241][242]",
				"after": "Since giving his homily at the funeral of Pope John Paul, Pope Benedict XVI continued to refer to John Paul II as \"the Great\". At the 20th World Youth Day in Germany 2005, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking in Polish, John Paul's native language, said, \"As the Great Pope John PaulÂ II would say: Keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people.\" In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited John Paul's native Poland. During that visit, he repeatedly made references to \"the great John Paul\" and \"my great predecessor\".[243] Two newspapers have called him \"the Great\" or \"the Greatest\". The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera called him \"the Greatest\"[citation needed] and the South African Catholic newspaper, The Southern Cross, called him \"John Paul II the Great\".[244] Some Catholic institutions changed their names to incorporate \"the Great\", including John Paul the Great Catholic University and schools called some variant of John Paul the Great High School.",
