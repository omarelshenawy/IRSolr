				"after": "The compound polyozellinâa chemical which can be isolated and purified from P.Â multiplexâinhibits prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), an enzyme that has a role in processing proteins (specifically, amyloid precursor protein) in Alzheimer's disease. Chemicals that inhibit PEP have attracted research interest due to their potential therapeutic effects.[37] Further analyses of extracts from P.Â multiplex revealed similar dibenzofuranyl derivatives of polyozellin, each with different chemical properties, including kynapcin-12,[38] kynapcin-13 and -28,[39] and -24.[40] A total synthesis of kynapcin-24 was achieved in 2009.[41]",
