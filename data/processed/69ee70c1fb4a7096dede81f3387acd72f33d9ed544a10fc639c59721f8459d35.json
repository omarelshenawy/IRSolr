				"previous": "For many years, Newfoundland and Labrador had experienced a depressed economy. Following the collapse of the cod fishery during the early 1990s, the province suffered record unemployment rates and the population decreased by roughly 60,000.[82][86] Due to a major energy and resources boom, the provincial economy has had a major turnaround since the turn of the 21st century.[87] Unemployment rates decreased, the population stabilized and had moderate growth. The province has gained record surpluses, which has rid it of its status as a \"have not\" province.[88][89]",
				"after": "Economic growth, gross domestic product (GDP), exports and employment resumed in 2010, after suffering the impacts of the late-2000s recession. Total capital investment in the province grew to $6.2Â billion, an increase of 23.0% compared to 2009. GDP reached $28.1Â billion, compared to $25.0Â billion in 2009.[90]",
