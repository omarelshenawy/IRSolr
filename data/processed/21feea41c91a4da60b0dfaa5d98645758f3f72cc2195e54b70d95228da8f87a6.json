				"after": "Francis Mansell, who was appointed principal in 1630, raised hundreds of pounds from donors towards the building of a second quadrangle in 1640. Buildings along part of the north and south sides were completed at this time, and in 1638 he purchased some land known as Coggan's Garden adjoining Market Street for Â£90,[n 16][110] upon which much of the west side of the second quadrangle was later built.[111][112] The college also unsuccessfully proposed to the city council in 1638 that it should be permitted to expand to the north by closing Ship Street and purchasing the council's properties there.[113] According to his successor and biographer, Sir Leoline Jenkins, Mansell had sufficient benefactors to be able to complete the quadrangle, including the construction of a library on the west side, but the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1641 put paid to his plans.[60] Welsh tenants who supported Charles I refused to pay rent to the college after Michael Roberts was installed as principal in 1648 by the puritan regime, leaving the college \"on the verge of financial collapse\".[114] Overall, the college was \"reducedÂ ... to administrative chaos\"[115] and in 1660 it was said to be in a \"shatter'd condition\",[116] having suffered \"a decade of corruption and internal strife quite unique in Oxford during the revolutionary period\".[116] The college obtained further land on Market Street in 1675,[113] and building work began again in 1676.[117] Sir Leoline Jenkins built the library on the west side, which was completed by 1679.[1] After further land was obtained to link the Market Street and Ship Street sides of the college,[113] further rooms, including what is now known as the Senior Common Room (SCR), were built at the instigation of Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1688 to 1712) to complete the inner quadrangle; the project was completed just after his death in 1712.[1][118] Work to add a ceiling and wainscotting in the SCR took place in 1736, at a cost of Â£52 4s 5d,[n 17] with the walls to the west of the college placed further back to enlarge the common room's garden and increase the light.[1] Some minor work to repair and restore the walls has been carried out using Doulting stone.[119]",
