The airport's car rental market is in the top five among all U.S. Airports. And the facility continues to receive consistent top-ranking reviews from numerous publications. In 2007 and 2008, Zagat Survey ranked TPA the \"Best Overall U.S. Airport,\" while placing it second best overall in 2009 and 2010. In 2008 CondÃ© Nast Traveler recognized TPA as the second-best airport in the world, just two-tenths of a point behind the first place winner. JD Power and Associates have also given TPA Airport consistently high customer satisfaction ratings over the years. In November 2011, CNN ranked TPA sixth among ten of the world's most loved airports, being the only one on the list from the US.[30] Presently, the largest passenger aircraft serving TPA on a scheduled basis is the Boeing 777.",
