				"after": "Moderate or heavy clinical infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed on the basis of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though \"injury or deficiency in dietary tryptophan and ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs\", so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish's cartilage.[2] In heavy infections, only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores.[2] In less severe infections, the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the proteases pepsin and trypsin (pepsin-trypsin digestâPTD) before looking for spores. The head and other tissues can be further examined using histopathology to confirm whether the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for M. cerebralis. Serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an antibody raised against the spores is also possible. Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the 415 base pair 18S rRNA gene from M. cerebralis.[15] Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasites, with particular focus on fish in aquaculture units.[16]",
