				"after": "One of Greenway's finest works, St James' is listed on the Register of the National estate[98][99] and has been called an \"architectural gem\"[100] and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures[101] From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings.[102][103] In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House.[104] The Old Supreme Court Building next to the church is of the same date.[105] Across the square is Greenway's \"masterpiece\" Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church.[106] Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.[107]",
