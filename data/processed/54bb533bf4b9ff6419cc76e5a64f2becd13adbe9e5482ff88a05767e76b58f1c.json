				"previous": "On a trip to England in late May 1882, Barnum met a crowd of children on the street who were still angry that Jumbo had been taken away. Barnum made plans the same month to raise an iron building on the Thames Embankment for his circuses. People in the neighborhood did not like the idea. They said they would go to court to stop the plan. Barnum dropped the idea.[55]",
				"after": "Barnum had another publicity idea. The Brooklyn Bridge was finished in 1883. This was a long-awaited and exciting event. Barnum offered the bridge company $5,000 to allow Jumbo to cross the bridge before the official opening. The company directors believed Barnum was using the bridge for circus publicity. They declined his offer.[56]",
