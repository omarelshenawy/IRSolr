				"previous": "The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown, who sailed his ship La Dauphine into New York Harbor. He claimed the area for France and named it \"Nouvelle AngoulÃªme\" (New AngoulÃªme).[69]",
				"after": "A Spanish expedition led by captain EstÃªvÃ£o Gomes, a Portuguese sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 aboard the purpose-built caravel \"La Anunciada\" and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Rio de San Antonio. Heavy ice kept him from further exploration, and he returned to Spain in August. The first scientific map to show the North American East coast continuously, the 1527 world map known as the PadrÃ³n Real, was informed by Gomes' expedition, and labeled the Northeast as Tierra de Esteban GÃ³mez in his honor.[70]",
