				"previous": "A phenetic analysis of the genus undertaken by Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which A.Â cuneatus was grouped with A.Â stictus. This pairing was then neighbour to a larger group that included A.Â forrestii, A.Â eyrei, A.Â cacomorphus, A.Â ileticos, and several hybrid and unusual forms of A.Â cuneatus.[22] Nelson's analysis supported Bentham's sections, and so they were retained when Nelson published a taxonomic revision of the genus in 1978. He further subdivided A.Â sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, with A.Â cuneata placed into A.Â subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth,[23] but Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos, for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became cuneatus.[2]",
