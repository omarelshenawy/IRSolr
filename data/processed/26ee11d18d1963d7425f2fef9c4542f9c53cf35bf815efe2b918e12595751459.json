				"after": "Dedicated railway lines to airports have become popular since the 1980s, with airport terminals for airport express, intercity and commuter trains, allowing direct travel to the check-in halls. In most cases, this solution requires the building of new track; a cheaper option is to open a new station on an existing line, again connected to the airport by people mover or shuttle bus (see below). An early example of a mainline rail station built to serve an airport is Berlin SchÃ¶nefeld Flughafen station which opened in 1951 and serves Berlin SchÃ¶nefeld Airport, and another example is Frankfurt Airport regional station which opened in 1972 and is one of the two railway stations that serve Frankfurt Airport.",
