				"after": "The first sterling notes were issued by the Bank of England shortly after its foundation in 1694. Denominations were initially written on the notes at the time of issue. From 1745, the notes were printed in denominations between Â£20 and Â£1000, with any odd shillings added in hand. Â£10 notes were added in 1759, followed by Â£5 in 1793 and Â£1 and Â£2 in 1797. The lowest two denominations were withdrawn following the end of the Napoleonic wars. In 1855, the notes were converted to being entirely printed, with denominations of Â£5, Â£10, Â£20, Â£50, Â£100, Â£200, Â£300, Â£500 and Â£1000 issued.",
