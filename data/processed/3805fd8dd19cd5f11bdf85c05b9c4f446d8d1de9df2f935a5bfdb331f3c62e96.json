In areas that experience seasonal flooding, like the grassy plains of the Venezuelan llanos, anteaters mainly feed on ants, because termites are less available.[14] Conversely, anteaters at Emas National Park eat mainly termites, which occur in high density on the grasslands.[33] At Serra da Canastra, anteaters switch between eating mainly ants during the wet season (October to March) and termites during the dry season (May to September).[14]",
