				"after": "In the traditional literary canon, literature under Augustus, along with that of the late Republic, has been viewed as the \"Golden Age\" of Latin literature, embodying the classical ideals of \"unity of the whole, the proportion of the parts, and the careful articulation of an apparently seamless composition.\"[528] The three most influential Classical Latin poetsâVergil, Horace, and Ovidâbelong to this period. Vergil wrote the Aeneid, creating a national epic for Rome in the manner of the Homeric epics of Greece. Horace perfected the use of Greek lyric meters in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of the Augustan moral programme; it was one of the ostensible causes for which the emperor exiled him to Tomis (present-day ConstanÅ£a, Romania), where he remained to the end of his life. Ovid's Metamorphoses was a continuous poem of fifteen books weaving together Greco-Roman mythology from the creation of the universe to the deification of Julius Caesar. Ovid's versions of Greek myths became one of the primary sources of later classical mythology, and his work was so influential in the Middle Ages that the 12th and 13th centuries have been called the \"Age of Ovid.\"[529]",
