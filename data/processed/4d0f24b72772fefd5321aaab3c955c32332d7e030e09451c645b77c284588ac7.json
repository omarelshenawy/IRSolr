Since the United States at the time maintained official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and not the People's Republic of China, the Liaison Office did not have the official status of an embassy and Bush did not formally hold the position of \"ambassador\", though he unofficially acted as one. The 14 months that he spent in China were largely seen as beneficial for U.S.-China relations.[14]",
