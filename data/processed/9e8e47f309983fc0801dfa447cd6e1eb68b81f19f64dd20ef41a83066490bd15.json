The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packagesÂ â such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilitiesÂ â have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.",
