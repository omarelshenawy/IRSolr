				"previous": "A major barrier to development is the lack of entrepreneurial knowledge and experience within Indian reservations. \"A general lack of education and experience about business is a significant challenge to prospective entrepreneurs\", was the report on Native American entrepreneurship by the Northwest Area Foundation in 2004. \"Native American communities that lack entrepreneurial traditions and recent experiences typically do not provide the support that entrepreneurs need to thrive. Consequently, experiential entrepreneurship education needs to be embedded into school curricula and after-school and other community activities. This would allow students to learn the essential elements of entrepreneurship from a young age and encourage them to apply these elements throughout life\".[187] Rez Biz magazine addresses these issues.",
