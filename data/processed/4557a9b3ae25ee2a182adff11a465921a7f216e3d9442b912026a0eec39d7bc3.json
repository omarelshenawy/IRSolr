				"after": "In August 1973, Hawker Siddeley launched a new 70 seat regional airliner project, the HS.146, to fill the gap between turboprop-powered airliners like the Hawker Siddeley HS.748 and the Fokker F.27 and small jet airliners like the BAC One-Eleven and Boeing 737.[5][6] The chosen configuration had a high wing and a T-tail to give good short-field performance, while the aircraft was to be powered by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502s turbofan engines. The programme was initially launched with backing from the UK Government, which agreed to contribute 50% of the development costs in return for a share of the revenues from each aircraft sold.[7] In October 1974, all work on the project was halted as a result of the world economic downturn resulting from the 1973 oil crisis.[8][9][10]",
