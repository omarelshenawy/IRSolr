				"after": "In his review of the Best of Both Worlds tour, J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the concert as \"a nearly 90-minute blast of pop in which the charismatic Cyrus â who complained that she wasn't feeling wellÂ â commanded the stage with confidence, performing with a particular swagger.\"[214] When performing a cover of \"I Love Rock & Roll\" on the tour, Cyrus performed the song suspended in the air atop of a Harley-Davidson Dyna Fat Bob FXDF 2010 that traveled through the air.[215] Beginning with the release of The Time of Our Lives, Cyrus's performances became somewhat more explicit and controversial in nature. Cyrus's performance of \"Party in the U.S.A.\" at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards incited a media uproar, with some viewers criticizing Cyrus's provocative outfit and inclusion of a brief pole dance as inappropriate for her age, then sixteen, and for her young fans.[216] Conversely, Newsday reported that her sexualization \"has been coming for some time.\"[217] Ian Drew, senior editor of US Weekly, said, \"She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [Spears] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it looks to be working for Miley as well.\"[217] Her performance of Can't Be Tamed on Britain's Got Talent garnered much controversy. Midway through the performance, Cyrus grabbed a female backup dancer, dipping her low, and simulated a kiss.[218] The performance was met with negative reactions from the media and caused her to release a statement in which Cyrus promised she did not kiss the backup dancer. Cyrus wrote, \"It is ridiculous that two entertainers can't even rock out with each other without the media making it some type of story. I really hope my fans are not disappointed in me because the truth is I did nothing wrong. I got up there and did my job which is to perform to the best of my ability.\"[219]",
