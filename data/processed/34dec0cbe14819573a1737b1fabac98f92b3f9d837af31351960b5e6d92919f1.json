				"previous": "OseÃ±a-Paez was the anchor of ANC Life from 2005 to 2006, a one-hour weekly newscast/talk show revolving on local and international lifestyle and entertainment stories.",
				"after": "When F was canceled in 2006, OseÃ±a-Paez accepted Proudly Filipina,[3] a magazine show on QTV-11 focused on women achievers.[5] However, having recently started Urban Zone on ABS-CBN and still breastfeeding her second daughter Lily, she found that her \"heart was not really in it\" and she left the show.[4] Though only with the show seven months (June 2007 to February 2008), her hosting of Proudly Filipina was a commercial and critical success, even garnering an international award (see below).[5]",
