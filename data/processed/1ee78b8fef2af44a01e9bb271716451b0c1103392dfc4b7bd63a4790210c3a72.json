				"after": "The etymology of the name Plateosaurus is not entirely clear. Moser pointed out that the original description contains no information, and various authors have offered differing interpretations.[L] German geologist Hanns Bruno Geinitz in 1846 gave \"(ÏÎ»Î±ÏÏÏ, breit)\" [English: broad][M] In the same year, Agassiz offered Ancient Greek ÏÎ»Î±ÏÎ· (platÃª - \"paddle\", \"rudder\"; Agassiz translates this as Latin pala = \"spade\") and ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï (sauros - \"lizard\").[N] Agassiz consequently renamed the genus Platysaurus,[O] probably from Greek ÏÎ»Î±ÏÏÏ (platys - \"broad, flat, broad-shouldered\"), creating an invalid junior synonym. Later authors often referred to this derivation, and the secondary meaning \"flat\" of ÏÎ»Î±ÏÏÏ, so that Plateosaurus is often translated as \"flat lizard\". Often, claims were made that ÏÎ»Î±ÏÏÏ is supposed to have been intended as a reference to flat bones, for example the laterally flattened teeth of Plateosaurus,[P] which is impossible because the teeth and other flat bones such as the pubes and some skull elements were unknown at the time of description.",
