				"after": "In the Middle Ages, the Artes Liberales (liberal arts) were taught in universities as part of the Trivium â an introductory curriculum involving grammar, rhetoric, and logic[4] â and of the Quadrivium â a curriculum involving the âmathematical artsâ of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.[4] The Artes Mechanicae (mechanical arts, such as vestiaria -tailoring, weaving-, agricultura -agriculture-, architectura -architecture, masonry-, militia and venatoria -warfare and hunting, \"martial arts\"-, mercatura -trade, commerce-, coquinaria -cooking-, and metallaria -blacksmithing, metallurgy â division made, somewhat arbitrarily, by Johannes Scotus Eriugena, already in the 9th century) were practiced and developed in guild environments. The modern distinction between \"artistic\" and \"non-artistic\" skills did not develop until the Renaissance.",
