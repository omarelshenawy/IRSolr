				"On 23 July 2014 the company announced that it was suspending its flights to/from Tel Aviv, due to the danger posed to flights by Hamas-launched rockets fired towards Ben Gurion Airport from the Gaza Strip during the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict. This was the first time the company suspended its flights in this direction. Many other international carriers, including Air France, Lufthansa, Air Canada, United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Turkish Airlines also temporarily suspended their flights during this conflict.[12]"
