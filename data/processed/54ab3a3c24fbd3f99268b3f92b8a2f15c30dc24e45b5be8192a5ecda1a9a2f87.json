The local population was made up of farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor.[49] Most families kept animals for food, grew their own crops,[48] and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market.[49] Water was obtained from local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.[50]",
