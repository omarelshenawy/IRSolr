His experiments showed that the \"astonishing length\" of the 111â2Â inch (290Â mm) long nectary hanging from Angraecum sesquipedale flowers implied the need for an as yet unknown moth with a proboscis 10â11Â inches (250â275Â mm) long to pollinate these flowers in Madagascar. He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that \"there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the AngrÃ¦cum and the proboscis of certain moths\".[64][65] This wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an evolutionary arms race, but was disturbing to biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent divine purpose.[66]",
