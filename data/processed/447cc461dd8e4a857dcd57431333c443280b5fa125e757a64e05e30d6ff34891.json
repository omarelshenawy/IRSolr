				"after": "The original motivation for research investigations of the rhodocene system was to understand the nature of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled by the desire to explore and apply the metalâmetal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked.[21] Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics,[22] semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire),[21] and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.[22] Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene,[57] each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.[22]",
