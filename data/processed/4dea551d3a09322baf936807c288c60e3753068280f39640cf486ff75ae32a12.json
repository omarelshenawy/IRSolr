				"previous": "Unlike many Banksia species, B.Â telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so plants are killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly.[17] This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.Â telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency may be one reason why B.Â telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia.[18] Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.Â telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.[19]",
