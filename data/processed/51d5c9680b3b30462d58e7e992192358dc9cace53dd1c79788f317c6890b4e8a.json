				"after": "The blue and white coat of arms of ZÃ¼rich is attested from 1389, and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315 . The first certain testimony of banners with the same design is from 1434. The coat of arms is flanked by two lions. The red Schwenkel on top of the banner had varying interpretations: For the people of ZÃ¼rich, it was a mark of honour, granted by Rudolph I. ZÃ¼rich's neighbours mocked it as a sign of shame, commemorating the loss of the banner at Winterthur in 1292. Today, the Canton of ZÃ¼rich uses the same coat of arms as the city.[28][29]",
