				"previous": "In 1981, Alex George published a revised arrangement that placed B.Â attenuata in the subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, and that it had similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.Â elegans. He felt B.Â attenuata to have affinities to B.Â lindleyana and B.Â media.[3]",
