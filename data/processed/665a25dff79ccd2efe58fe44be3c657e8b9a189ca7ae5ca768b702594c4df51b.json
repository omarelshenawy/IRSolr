				"after": "BusinessFirst is offered on all Boeing 747-400, Boeing 767, Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, as well as all transatlantic-configured Boeing 757-200s. BusinessFirst passengers check in at separate counters and can use priority security screening where available. In-flight service includes pre-departure beverages, table linens and multi course meals designed by United's Congress of Chefs on international flights.[155] Passengers are also given priority with boarding and baggage handling and access to the United Club and other airline lounges. The longest domestic routes (such as the 9-10 hour long flights from the East Coast to Hawaii) utilize BusinessFirst equipped aircraft, however these flights are sold as United First but do not allow for complimentary premier upgrades. BusinessFirst also is equipped with lie-flat beds. On legacy United aircraft (registration numbers ending in \"-UA\"), BusinessFirst is configured with alternating rows facing backwards instead of forwards. On aircraft acquired during the merger with Continental, and on newly delivered Boeing 787s, all BusinessFirst seats face forwards.",
