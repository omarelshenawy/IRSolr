				"after": "The composition of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might be responsible for the characteristic odour of the dried mushroom.[76] The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds.[77] The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9Â Î¼M per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).[78]",
