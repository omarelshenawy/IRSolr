				"after": "The GNU project is a collaboration of many programmers who envisioned to create a free and open operating system that was similar to Unix but with new code licensed on the open-source license model. It was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, and is responsible for many components of most Linux variants. Thousands of pieces of software for virtually every operating system are licensed under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, the Linux kernel originated in 1991 as a side project of Linus Torvalds, while a university student in Finland. He posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers, and received support and assistance from volunteers who succeeded in creating a complete and functional kernel. GNU programmers joint the effort and both groups worked to integrate the finished GNU parts with the Linux kernel to create a complete operating system.",
