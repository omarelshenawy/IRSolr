				"previous": "While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8Â km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock, later known as the \"Father of Forestry\" in Pennsylvania.[17][20][26]",
				"after": "The waterfalls and Ganoga Lake were the hotel's biggest attractions. By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall Ganoga Falls; he eventually named 22 of the waterfalls. Ricketts gave most of them Native American names, and named others for relatives and friends.[17][20][27][28] Ricketts renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake in 1881. The name Ganoga was suggested by Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew; it is an Iroquoian word which Buckalew said meant \"water on the mountain\" in the Seneca language.[17] Donehoo's A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning \"place of floating oil\" and the name of a Cayuga village in New York.[29] Whatever the meaning, Ricketts also named the glen with the tallest waterfall in the park \"Ganoga\".[30]",
