Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of sulfuric acid.[1] In the same paper however, George E. Davis, an English consultant, was credited for having coined the term.[2] The History of Science in United States: An Encyclopedia puts this at around 1890.[3] \"Chemical engineering\", describing the use of mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in England after 1850.[4] By 1910, the profession, \"chemical engineer,\" was already in common use in Britain and the United States.[5]",
