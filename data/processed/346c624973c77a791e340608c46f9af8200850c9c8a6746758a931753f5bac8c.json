				"previous": "The vulnerability of New Zealand to Axis naval activity was demonstrated when a submarine-launched Japanese float plane overflew Wellington and Aucklandâwhere it was chased ineffectually by a Tiger Moth. As few combat-capable aircraft were available at home and Britain was unable to help, New Zealand turned to the United States and signed a lend-lease agreement.[citation needed] Gradually at first, America was able to supply New Zealand with aircraft for use in the Pacific Theatreâ initially, in 1942, Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks and additional Harvards and Hudsons. The fall of Singapore led to the evacuated RNZAF pilots, in the RAF there, becoming available in New Zealand and they provided an experienced nucleus around which new fighter squadrons (the first being No. 14 Squadron RNZAF) were formed.",
				"after": "The early lend-lease aircraft were obsolescent and had difficulty holding their own against the skilled and well-equipped Japanese pilots,[citation needed] but as soon as pilots had converted to the lend-lease aircraft they were pressed into action.",
