				"previous": "In 1981, GrÃ¸nlandsfly opened its first route to Iceland, linking ReykjavÃ­k Airport to its main hub at Kangerlussuaq via Kulusuk. In 1986, a route to KeflavÃ­k allowed the company to break SAS's monopoly on flights between Greenland and Denmark via a KeflavÃ­k-Copenhagen leg operated by Icelandair.[8] By 1989, the airline employed more than 400 Greenlanders and carried more than 100,000 passengers annually.[8]",
				"after": "The company saw its activity curtailed as the mines at Ivittuut (1987) and Maamorilik (1990) closed operation, leading to a recession in the Greenlandic economy.",
