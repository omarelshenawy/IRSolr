				"after": "Catherine Hills points out that it is too easy to consider Anglo-Saxon archaeology solely as a study of ethnology and fail to consider that identity is: \"less related to an overall Anglo-Saxon ethnicity and more to membership of family or tribe, Christian or pagan, elite or peasant\".[49] \"Anglo-Saxons\" or \"Britons\" were no more homogeneous than people are today and there would have exhibited diverse characteristics: male/female, old/young, rich/poor, farmer/warrior - or even Gildas' 'patria' (fellow citizens) /'cives' (indigenous people) /'hostes' (enemy) - as well as a diversity associated with language. Beyond these, in the early Anglo-Saxon period, identity was local, although people would have known their neighbours, it may have been important to indicate tribal loyalty with details of clothing and especially fasteners.[50] It is also unlikely that people would have thought of themselves as Anglo-Saxon, instead there were part of a tribe, region, descendants of a patron or followers of a leader. It is this identity that archaeological evidence seeks to understand and determine, considering how it might support separate identity groups, or identities that were inter-connected.[51]",
