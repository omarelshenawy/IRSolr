				"after": "The south hall contains the check-in areas A and B (former Terminal 1), currently closed due to reconstruction, was built in 1992 with a capacity for 3.5Â million passengers per year to replace the ageing complex from the communist era. Initially, it handled all the traffic. In 2005, the old arrival hall from 1970s was refurbished and reopened, and under the name \"Etiuda\", became a temporary terminal for low-cost traffic. In March 2009, the Etiuda terminal was closed and low-cost carriers and some other carriers (mainly SkyTeam alliance members) moved to T1.",
