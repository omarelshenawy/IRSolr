Having served on numerous battleships at the Urabi Revolt and Boxer Rebellion early in his career, Jellicoe later served as the Governor-General of New Zealand as well as Third, Second and First Sea Lord of the Admiralty, but he was removed by a new First Lord because of differences over policy and Britain's ability to carry on the war.",
