				"after": "The evening opened with Prabhupada's followersÂ â men in \"Merlin gowns\"[41] and women in sarisÂ â chanting Hare Krishna to an Indian tune, followed by Moby Grape.[41] When the swami himself arrived at 10Â PM, the crowd of hippies rose to their feet to greet him respectfully with applause and cheers.[4] Gurudas, one of the event's organizers, describes the effect that Prabhupada's arrival had on the audience, \"Then Swami Bhaktivedanta entered. He looked like a Vedic sage, exalted and otherworldly. As he advanced towards the stage, the crowd parted and made way for him, like the surfer riding a wave. He glided onto the stage, sat down and began playing the kartals.\"[9]",
