The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.[64] However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during Freshman, Senior, or sophomore Summer [65] During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.[64] The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.[66]",
