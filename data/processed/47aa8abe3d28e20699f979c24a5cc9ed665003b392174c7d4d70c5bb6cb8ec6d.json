				"previous": "[(Î·5-C5tBu3H2)Rh(Î·5-C5H5)]BF4 forms a colourless centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal belonging to the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486Â gÂ cmâ3.[41] Looking at the ORTEP diagram of the structure of the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroidâRhâcentroid angle is 177.2Â°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rhâcentroid distances are 1.819Â Ã and 1.795Â Ã), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand.[41] The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. However, the crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered.[41] This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also illustrates that the energy barrier to rotation is low â in ferrocene, the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5Â kJÂ molâ1 in both solution and gas phase.[12]",
				"after": "The diagram above shows the rhodiumâcarbon (in red, inside pentagons on the left) and carbonâcarbon (in blue, outside pentagons on the left) bond distances for both ligands, along with the bond angles (in green, inside pentagons on the right) within each cyclopentadienyl ring. The atom labels used are the same as those shown in the crystal structure above. Within the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, the carbonâcarbon bond lengths vary between 1.35Â Ã and 1.40Â Ã and the internal bond angles vary between 107Â° and 109Â°. For comparison, the internal angle at each vertex of a regular pentagon is 108Â°. The rhodiumâcarbon bond lengths vary between 2.16Â Ã and 2.18Â Ã.[41] These results are consistent with Î·5-coordination of the ligand to the metal centre. In the case of the substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, there is somewhat greater variation: carbonâcarbon bond lengths vary between 1.39Â Ã and 1.48Â Ã, the internal bond angles vary between 106Â° and 111Â°, and the rhodiumâcarbon bond lengths vary between 2.14Â Ã and 2.20Â Ã. The greater variation in the substituted ligand is attributed to the distortions necessary to relieve the steric strain imposed by neighbouring tert-butyl substituents; despite these variations, the data demonstrate that the substituted cyclopentadienyl is also Î·5-coordinated.[41]",
