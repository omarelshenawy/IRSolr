				"after": "Manitoba has an extreme continental climate. Temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north, and precipitation decreases from east to west.[14] Manitoba is far removed from the moderating influences of both mountain ranges and large bodies of water, and because of the generally flat landscape, it is exposed to cold Arctic high-pressure air masses from the northwest during January and February. In the summer, air masses sometimes come out of the Southern United States, as warm humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico.[15] Temperatures exceed 30Â Â°C (86Â Â°F) numerous times each summer, and the combination of heat and humidity can bring the humidex value to the mid-40s.[16] Carman, Manitoba recorded the second-highest humidex ever recorded in Canada, with 53.0.[17] According to Environment Canada, Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round, and ranked second for clearest skies in the summer and for the sunniest province in the winter and spring.[18]",
