When this title is a name, significant alternative names for the topic should be mentioned in the article, usually in the first sentence or paragraph. These may include alternative spellings, longer or shorter forms, historical names, and significant names in other languages. Indeed, alternative names can be used in article text in contexts where they are more appropriate than the name used as the title of the article. For example, the city now called \"GdaÅsk\" can be referred to as \"Danzig\" in suited historical contexts. The editor needs to balance the desire to maximize the information available to the reader with the need to maintain readability.",
