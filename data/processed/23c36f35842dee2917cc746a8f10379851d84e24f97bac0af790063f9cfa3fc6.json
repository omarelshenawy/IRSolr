				"after": "Pirates opened on 31 December 1879 in New York and was an immediate hit.[19] On 2 January 1880, Sullivan wrote, in another letter to his mother from New York, \"The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully funny in parts, and sometimes brilliant in dialogue â beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does. ... The music is infinitely superior in every way to the Pinafore â 'tunier' and more developed, of a higher class altogether. I think that in time it will be very popular.\"[34] Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing Pirates and Pinafore.[20][35] Sullivan's prediction was correct. After a strong run in New York and several American tours, Pirates opened in London on 3 April 1880, running for 363 performances there.[36] It remains one of the most popular G&S works.[37][38]",
