				"previous": "Given the Green's role as \"the physical and emotional center of campus life,\"[3] it is often the setting for protests, rallies, and demonstrations. Dartmo, an online directory of Dartmouth College's buildings, describes the Green as being \"used any time when collective joy or frustration is to be expressed.\"[2] Dartmouth's Student Handbook explicitly permits the Green to be used for demonstrations and rallies.[1]",
				"after": "One of the earliest student demonstrations took place in 1814, when students gathered on the Green to celebrate Napoleon's defeat in Europe.[2] At the height of the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, the Green regularly saw antiwar demonstrations, some attracting up to a thousand protesters.[22] A 1969 protest over the presence of the campus Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program culminated in the occupation of Parkhurst Hall, the College's administration building.[23][24] In 1986, students constructed shanties on the Green to encourage the College to divest from South African companies supporting Apartheid; staffers of the conservative newspaper The Dartmouth Review took sledgehammers to the structures.[25][26] More recently, the Green was the location of a controversial 2006 May Day rally in favor of immigrant rights.[27]",
