The five-year-old infanta, who later married Holy Roman Emperor LeopoldÂ I, was at this point Philip and Mariana's only surviving child.[22] She is attended by two ladies-in-waiting, or meninas: doÃ±a Isabel de VelascoÂ (2), who is poised to curtsy to the princess, and doÃ±a MarÃ­a Agustina Sarmiento de SotomayorÂ (3), who kneels before Margaret Theresa, offering her a drink from a red cup, or bucaro, that she holds on a golden tray.[23] To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: the achondroplastic German, Maribarbola (4)[23] (Maria Barbola), and the Italian, Nicolas PertusatoÂ (5), who playfully tries to rouse a sleepy mastiff with his foot. Behind them stands doÃ±a Marcela de UlloaÂ (6), the princess's chaperone, dressed in mourning and talking to an unidentified bodyguard (or guardadamas)Â (7).[23]",
