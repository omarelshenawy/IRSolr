				"previous": "Blue whale hunting was banned in 1966 by the International Whaling Commission,[78][79] and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s,[80] by which time 330,000 blue whales had been caught in the Antarctic, 33,000 in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic. The largest original population, in the Antarctic, had been reduced to 0.15% of their initial numbers.[17]",
				"after": "Since the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether the conservation reliant global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels.[17] According to a 2014 study, the Californian Blue Whale population has rebounded to an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.[81]",
