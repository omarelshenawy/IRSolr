				"after": "The XB-47, which looked unlike any contemporary bomber, was described by some observers as a \"sleek, beautiful outcome that was highly advanced\".[17] The 35-degree swept wings were shoulder-mounted, with the twin inboard turbojet engines mounted in neat pods, and the outboard engines tacked under the wings short of the wingtips. With the exception of a change from the shoulder wing configuration to being under the fuselage, most future airliners would use a similar configuration, with the engines mounted in underwing pylons. This arrangement would reduce the bending moment at the wing roots, saving structural weight and having the mass of the engines acting as counter-flutter weights, too.",
