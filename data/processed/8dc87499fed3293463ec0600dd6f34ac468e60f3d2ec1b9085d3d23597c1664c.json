Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles.[7] As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having \"a certain fictive quality\", the Picturesque and Gothic design generating \"a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here\", despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity.[8] Although there has been some criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a \"place amongst the greatest European palaces\".[9]",
