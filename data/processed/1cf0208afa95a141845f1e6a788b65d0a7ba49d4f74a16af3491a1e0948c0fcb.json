				"previous": "The club was founded on 8 January 1863 in the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield and was initially based at Bramall Lane. Headingley was first established in 1888 and Test cricket was first played there in 1899, eight years later than it hosted its inaugural first-class match when Yorkshire played Kent in 1891, the year in which the club's headquarters moved there. The \"out grounds\" in Hull, Sheffield, Bradford, Middlesbrough and Harrogate were used with great success until the 1970s.",
				"after": "On 31 December 2005, Yorkshire County Cricket Club purchased the Headingley cricket ground for Â£12Â million from the Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company, parent company of the Leeds rugby league club, with the help of a Â£9Â million loan from Leeds City Council. This purchase ensures that Test cricket continues at the venue with a 15-year staging agreement. On 11 January 2006, the stadium was officially renamed the Headingley Carnegie Stadium as a result of sponsorship from Leeds Metropolitan University and the club announced plans on 11 January 2006 to rebuild the stand next to the rugby ground with 3,000 extra seats, taking capacity to 20,000.[85] The club also announced plans to redevelop the Winter shed (North) stand on 25 August 2006 providing a Â£12.5Â million pavilion complex.[86]",
