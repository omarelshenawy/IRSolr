				"after": "The Hofburg Palace is a palace located in Vienna, Austria, that has housed some of the most powerful people in Austrian history, including the Habsburg dynasty, rulers of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It currently serves as the official residence of the President of Austria. It was the Habsburgs' principal winter residence, as the SchÃ¶nbrunn Palace was their preferred summer residence. The Hofburg area has been the documented seat of government since 1279 for various empires and republics, and has expanded over the centuries to include various residences, the Hofkapelle, museums (the Naturhistorisches Museum and Kunsthistorisches Museum), the Imperial Library, the treasury, the Burgtheater, the Spanish Riding School, the horse stables and the Hofburg Congress Center.",
