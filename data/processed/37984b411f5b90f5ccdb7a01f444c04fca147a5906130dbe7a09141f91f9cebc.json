In prehistoric times, life and existence was based on survival. There was little privacy and a person was identified by their role in the group. In modern times, many people have even come to think of their personal lives as if they are separate from their work. This segmentation of \"life areas\" is evident in such phrases as \"work life\", \"home life\", and \"sex life.\" The meaning or role of a person's \"life\" or \"human existence\" is discussed in many religions and philosophies. In Western industrialized countries, there are a variety of service industries that help people improve their personal lives, such as counselling and life coaching companies.",
