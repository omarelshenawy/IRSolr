				"previous": "The first version of the aircraft entered service in 1959 as the T2J-1. It was redesignated the T-2A in 1962 under the joint aircraft designation system. The two-seat trainer was powered by one Westinghouse J34-WE-46/48 turbojet. The aircraft was subsequently redesigned, and the single engine was replaced with two Pratt & Whitney J60-P-6 turbojets in the T-2B. The T-2C was fitted with two much more powerful 2,950Â lbf (13,100Â N) thrust General Electric J85-GE-4 turbojets. The T-2D was an export version which was sold to the Venezuelan Air Force, while the T-2E was sold to the Hellenic Air Force. The T-2 Buckeye (along with the TF-9J) replaced the T2V-1/T-1A SeaStar, though the T-1 would continue in some uses into the 1970s.",
				"after": "The Buckeye was designed as a low-cost multi-stage trainer. Its straight wing was similar to that used in the original North American North American FJ-1 Fury and its cockpit controls were similar to the T-28C Trojan trainer. The T-2's performance was between that of the U.S. Air Force's Cessna T-37 Tweet, and the U.S. Navy's TA-4J Skyhawk. While it had no built-in armament, the T-2 had two underwing hardpoints for .50-inch gun pods, 100Â lb (45Â kg) practice bombs or 2.75-inch rockets.",
