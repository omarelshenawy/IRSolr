Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002â3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. Botswana has been hit very hard by the AIDS pandemic; in 2006 it was estimated that life expectancy at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.[45] However, after Botswana's 2011 census current life expectancy is estimated at 54.06 years.[1] This revision shows the difficulty of accurately estimating the prevalence and impact of HIV/AIDS in the absence of hard numbers.",
