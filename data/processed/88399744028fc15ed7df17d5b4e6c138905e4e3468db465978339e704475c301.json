Himachal Pradesh is spread over 55,673 square kilometres (21,495Â sqÂ mi) and is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir on the north, Punjab on the west and south-west, Haryana on the south, Uttarakhand on the south-east and by Tibet area of China on the east. The literal meaning of Himachal Pradesh is land of snowy mountains. Himachal Pradesh was also known as Deva Bhoomi (i.e. the land of the gods). The Aryan influence in the region dates back to the period before the Rigveda. After the Anglo Gorkha war British colonial government came into power. In 1950 Himachal was declared as the union territory but after the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was enacted in 1971 Himchal emerged as the 18th state of the Indian Union. The state is located at altitudes ranging from 450 metres (1,476Â ft) to 6,500 metres (21,325Â ft) above sea level. The state capital is Shimla (formerly British India's summer capital under the name Simla); other major towns include Solan, Dharamsala, Kangra, Mandi, Kullu, Chamba, Hamirpur, Dalhousie and Manali.",
