				"after": "Although the book contradicted the prevailing natural theology and its teleological approach to design in nature, the Saturday Review thought that it would avoid the angry polemics aroused by On the Origin of Species. The Literary Churchman welcomed \"Mr. Darwin's expression of admiration at the contrivances in orchids\", only complaining that it was too indirect a way of saying \"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!\" (Psalm 104:24)[83] Darwin regarded these theological views as irritating misunderstandings, but wrote to Asa Gray describing his approach as a \"flank movement on the enemy\". By showing that the \"wonderful contrivances\" of the orchid have discoverable evolutionary histories, Darwin was countering claims by natural theologians that the organisms were examples of the perfect work of the Creator.[78][85]",
