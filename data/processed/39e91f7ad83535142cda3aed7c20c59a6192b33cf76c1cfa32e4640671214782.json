				"previous": "The Chinese counterattacked in April 1951, with the Fifth Phase Offensive, also known as the Chinese Spring Offensive, with three field armies (approximately 700,000 men).[223] The offensive's first thrust fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (22â25 April 1951) and the Battle of Kapyong (22â25 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the \"No-name Line\" north of Seoul.[224] On 15 May 1951, the Chinese commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK Army and the U.S. X Corps in the east at the Soyang River. After initial success, they were halted by 20 May.[225] At month's end, the U.S. Eighth Army counterattacked and regained \"Line Kansas\", just north of the 38th parallel.[226] The UN's \"Line Kansas\" halt and subsequent offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953.",
