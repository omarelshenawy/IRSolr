				"after": "Russula virescens can be found fruiting on soil in both deciduous forests and mixed forests,[13] forming ectomycorrhizal symbiotic relationships with a variety of trees, including oaks (Quercus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and aspen (Populus tremula).[38] Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of Dipterocarpaceae, an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of Southeast Asia.[39] Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups,[40] reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn.[18] A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in subtropical forests in Xalapa showed that the fruiting period of R.Â virescens occurred in April, before the onset of the rainy season.[41]",
