				"previous": "As of 2013[update], legislation banning FGM had been passed by 33 countries outside Africa and the Middle East.[204] As a result of immigration the practice spread to Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, North America and Scandinavia, all of which have outlawed it, either entirely or from being performed on minors.[205][206] Sweden outlawed it in 1982, the first Western country to do so.[207] Several former colonial powers, including Belgium, Britain, France and the Netherlands, followed suit, either with new laws or by making clear that it was covered by existing legislation.[208]",
				"after": "Canada recognized FGM as a form of persecution in July 1994, when it granted refugee status to Khadra Hassan Farah, who had fled Somalia to avoid her daughter being cut.[210] In 1997 it amended section 268 of the Criminal Code of Canada to make a ban on FGM explicit, except where \"the person is at least eighteen years of age and there is no resulting bodily harm\".[211] As of February 2015[update], there had been no prosecutions.[212]",
