				"after": "In many situations, the mapping of average quantities from some Eulerian position x to a corresponding Lagrangian position Î± forms a problem. Since a fluid parcel with label Î± traverses along a path of many different Eulerian positions x, it is not possible to assign Î± to a unique x. A mathematically sound basis for an unambiguous mapping between average Lagrangian and Eulerian quantities is provided by the theory of the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) by Andrews and McIntyre (1978).",
