				"previous": "Takalik Abaj MonumentÂ 23 dates to the Middle Preclassic period,[146] and is found in Takalik Abaj, an important city in the foothills of the Guatemalan Pacific coast,[36] in the modern department of Retalhuleu.[147] It appears to be an Olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture.[36] If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.[37]",
				"after": "MonumentÂ 23 is sculpted from andesite and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads. It stands 1.84 metres (6.0Â ft) high and measures 1.2 metres (3.9Â ft) wide by 1.56 metres (5.1Â ft) deep. Like the examples from the Olmec heartland, the monument features a flat back.[148] Lee Parsons contests John Graham's identification of MonumentÂ 23 as a re-carved colossal head;[149] he views the side ornaments, identified by Graham as ears, as rather the scrolled eyes of an open-jawed monster gazing upwards.[150] Countering this, James Porter has claimed that the re-carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident.[151]",
