Outside factors discouraged competing transport, such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel, and strikes which disrupted airline operations. Investments in Amtrak's track, equipment and information also made Amtrak more relevant to America's transportation needs.[33][34] Amtrak's ridership increased from 16.6Â million in 1972 to 21 million in 1981.[35]",
