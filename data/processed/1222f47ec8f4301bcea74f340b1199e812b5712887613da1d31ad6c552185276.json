				"after": "Participants and historians have long debated the number of Communards killed during Bloody Week. The official army report by General FÃ©lix Antoine Appert mentioned only Army casualties, which amounted, from April through May, to 877 killed, 6,454 wounded, and 183 missing. The report assessed information about Communard casualties only as \"very incomplete\".[3] The issue of Bloody Week casualties during arose at a National Assembly hearing on 28 August 1871, when Marshal MacMahon testified. Deputy M. Vacherot told him, \"A general has told me that the number killed in combat, on the barricades, or after the combat, was as many as 17,000 men.\" MacMahon responded, \"I don't know what that estimate is based upon; it seems exaggerated to me. All I can say is that the insurgents lost a lot more people than we did.\" Vacherot continued, \"Perhaps this number applies to all of the siege, and to the fighting at Forts d'Issy and Vanves.\" MacMahon replied, \"the number is exaggerated.\" Vacherot persisted, \"It was General Appert who gave me that information. Perhaps he meant both dead and wounded.\" MacMahon replied, \"Ah, well, that's different.\"[83]",
