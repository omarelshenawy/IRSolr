In most years, Illinois is either the first or second state for the highest production of soybeans, with a harvest of 427.7Â million bushels (11.64Â million metric tons) in 2008, after Iowa's production of 444.82Â million bushels (12.11Â million metric tons).[85] Illinois ranks second in U.S. corn production with more than 1.5Â billion bushels produced annually.[86] With a production capacity of 1.5 billion gallons per year, Illinois is a top producer of ethanol; ranking third in the United States in 2011.[87] Illinois is a leader in food manufacturing and meat processing.[88] Although Chicago may no longer be \"Hog Butcher for the World,\" the Chicago area remains a global center for food manufacture and meat processing,[88] with many plants, processing houses, and distribution facilities concentrated in the area of the former Union Stock Yards.[89] Illinois also produces wine, and the state is home to two American viticultural areas. In the area of The Meeting of the Great Rivers Scenic Byway, peach and apple are grown. The German immigrants from agricultural backgrounds who settled in Illinois in mid- to late 19th century are the in part responsible for the profusion of fruit orchards in that area of Illinois.[90] Illinois' universities are actively researching alternative agricultural products as alternative crops.",
