				"previous": "The following two identities are also usually regarded as axioms, even though they follow from the two absorption laws taken together.[note 1]",
				"after": "These axioms assert that both (L,) and (L,) are semilattices. The absorption laws, the only axioms above in which both meet and join appear, distinguish a lattice from an arbitrary pair of semilattices and assure that the two semilattices interact appropriately. In particular, each semilattice is the dual of the other.",
