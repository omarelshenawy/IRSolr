				"previous": "Author C. J. Stevens wrote The Supernatural Side of Maine, a 2002 book about witches and people from Maine who faced the supernatural.",
				"after": "Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist Ruth Behar writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a \"conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged.\"[113] Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.[114] Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an \"affirmation of hegemony\" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the casta system.[115]",
