				"after": "For many years following the ANAK Society's founding, membership was not confidential. ANAK members would select new initiates by \"tapping\" them (tapping them on the shoulder) or presenting them with red ribbon armbands at Georgia Tech's semi-annual Interfraternity Council (IFC) dance.[3][13] The ritual was dropped in 1961 when ANAK elected to become a secret society.[5] From this point forward, ANAK membership was made public only upon a student's graduation, via a list of graduating ANAK members published in the Blueprint and the Technique each year[11] and the ANAK Society's home page.[22] A similar policy applies to faculty and honorary members, whose involvement with the society is only made known upon their retirement from Georgia Tech.[23]",
