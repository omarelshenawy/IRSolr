				"previous": "Viruses are important pathogens of livestock. Diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue are caused by viruses.[195] Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. Canine parvovirus is caused by a small DNA virus and infections are often fatal in pups.[196] Like all invertebrates, the honey bee is susceptible to many viral infections.[197] However, most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and cause no signs or symptoms of disease.[2]",
				"after": "There are many types of plant virus, but often they cause only a loss of yield, and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms, known as vectors. These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms, and single-celled organisms have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, for perennial fruits, for example, efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.[198] Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells.[199]",
