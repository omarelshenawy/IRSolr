				"after": "Salem Village (present-day Danvers, Massachusetts) was known for its many internal disputes, and for disputes between the village and Salem Town (present-day Salem). Arguments about property lines, grazing rights, and church privileges were rife, and neighbors considered the population as \"quarrelsome.\" In 1672, the villagers had voted to hire a minister of their own, apart from Salem Town. The first two ministers, James Bayley (1673â79) and George Burroughs (1680â83), stayed only a few years each, departing after the congregation failed to pay their full rate. Despite the ministers' rights being upheld by the General Court and the parish admonished, each of the ministers still chose to leave. The third minister, Deodat Lawson (1684â88), stayed for a short time, leaving after the refusal of the church in Salem to ordain him and not over issues with the congregation. The parish disagreed about the choice of Samuel Parris as Salem Village's first ordained minister. On June 18, 1689, the villagers agreed to hire Parris for â¤66 annually, \"one third part in money and the other two third parts in provisions\", and use of the parsonage.[17]",
