Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour.[137] Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies, some frog species started to lay their eggs on land. Once this happened, the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival.[138] The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care.[137]",
