				"after": "Against all expectations, the war continued for five years. During this period, PedroÂ II's time and energy were devoted to the war effort.[176][177] He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy.[178] The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him.[179] He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that \"the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost.\"[180] \"Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness had no effect on his quiet resolve\", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome.[180] Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroÂ II remarked: \"What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry.\"[181]",
