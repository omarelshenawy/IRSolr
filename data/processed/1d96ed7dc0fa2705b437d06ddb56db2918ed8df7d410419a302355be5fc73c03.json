The city was also the scene of two scientific discoveries that were to prove critical to the outcome of the war.[79] Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls first described how a practical nuclear weapon could be constructed in the FrischâPeierls memorandum of 1940,[80] the same year that the cavity magnetron, the key component of radar and later of microwave ovens, was invented by John Randall and Henry Boot.[81] Details of these two discoveries, together with an outline of the first jet engine invented by Frank Whittle in nearby Rugby, were taken to the United States by the Tizard Mission in September 1940, in a single black box later described by an official American historian as \"the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores\".[82]",
