				"after": "Pulitzer Prize-winning Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin praised the decision to have architects design the pavilions as an \"inspired stroke\", speculating that if their designs had been left to contractors, visitors to Millennium Park could have instead seen unimpressive \"blunt utilitarian huts\".[3] Kamin was pleased with Piano's South Pavilions, describing them as \"minor modernist jewels, almost house-like\".[3] He lauded the way their limestone walls complement the transparent glass by way of contrast, and noted that they anticipated Piano's then-forthcoming addition to the Art Institute of Chicago Building. Kamin gave the South Pavilions a rating of three stars out of a possible four, or \"very good\".[3]",
