				"previous": "In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property.[131] On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.[132] Public opinion and the newspapers demanded war, but McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental.[133] Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence, but on March 20, the court ruled that the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine.[134] As pressure for war mounted in Congress, McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence.[135] Spain refused McKinleyâs proposals, and on April 11, McKinley turned the matter over to Congress. He did not ask for war, but Congress declared war anyway on April 20, with the addition of the Teller Amendment, which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba.[136]",
				"after": "The expansion of the telegraph and the development of the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed, and he used the new technologies to direct the armyâs and navyâs movements as far as he was able.[137] McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War, and did not get along with the Armyâs commanding general, Nelson A. Miles.[138] Bypassing them, he looked for strategic advice first from Milesâs predecessor, General John Schofield, and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin.[138] The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Shermanâs resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the warâs end.[139]",
