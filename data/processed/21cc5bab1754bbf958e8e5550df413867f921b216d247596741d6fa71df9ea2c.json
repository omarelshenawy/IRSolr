				"after": "On September 14, 2004, Daley and union leadersâincluding the president of Chicago's police unionâunveiled a monument by Chicago artist Mary Brogger, a fifteen-foot speakers' wagon sculpture echoing the wagon on which the labor leaders stood in Haymarket Square to champion the eight-hour day.[130] The bronze sculpture, intended to be the centerpiece of a proposed \"Labor Park\", is meant to symbolize both the rally at Haymarket and free speech. The planned site was to include an international commemoration wall, sidewalk plaques, a cultural pylon, a seating area, and banners, but construction has not yet begun.",
