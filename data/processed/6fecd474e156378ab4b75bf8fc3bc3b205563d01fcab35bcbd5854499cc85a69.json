				"previous": "Foods were commonly prepared by boiling in water (at first using green bamboo as a vessel, and later clay or iron pots),[14] roasting over a fire or grilling over hot stones or coals.[6] Fermentation was also used to create curds from milk, develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey, sugar cane juice or other local plants.[5] The techniques of sun curing (drying), smoking and salting were used to preserve various foods for transport, trade or future consumption. Many foods prepared in these ways, such as a smoked dried beef called kitoza ([kiËtuzÉÌ¥]) and salted dried fish, are still eaten in a similar form in modern-day Madagascar.[15]",
				"after": "By the 16thÂ century, centralized kingdoms had emerged on the west coast among the Sakalava and in the Central highlands among the Merina. The Merina sovereigns celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath (fandroana). For this ceremony, a beef confit called jaka ([ËdzakÉÌ¥]) was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with suet, then conserving it in an underground pit for a year. The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year's festival. As a dessert, revelers would eat rice boiled in milk and drizzled with honey, a preparation known as tatao ([taËtauÌ¯]). According to oral history, King Ralambo was the originator of these culinary traditions in Imerina.[16] Ralambo's father, King Andriamanelo, is credited with introducing the marriage tradition of the vodiondry ([vudiËuÉ³ÉÊ³Ê²]) or \"rump of the sheep,\" wherein the most favored cut of meatâthe hindquartersâwas offered by the groom to the parents of the bride-to-be at an engagement ceremony.[17] In contemporary Malagasy society the terminology persists but families are more likely to offer symbolic coins in place of an offering of food.[18]",
