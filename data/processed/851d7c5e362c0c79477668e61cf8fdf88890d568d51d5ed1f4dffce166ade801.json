				"previous": "The pilot project began operations on 23 October 2006.[69] On 8 November, Larry Sanger reported that 263 user names had access to the pilot wiki, 183 articles on the wiki were \"live\" (meaning \"someone is or intends to be working on them\") and there were about 300 total edits to the wiki on 7 November.[70]",
				"after": "In a 17 January 2007 post to the Citizendium forum, Sanger stated that \"we have had only 10â20 (very) active people out of 500 accounts created\". As a result, Sanger decided to delete all articles besides those marked \"CZ live\" from the pilot project in an attempt to motivate greater participation.[71] On 22 January 2007, Citizendium experimented with a new self-registration procedure: read/write access was granted automatically after creation of the account.[72] There were a few instances of vandalism after this change, though the vandalism was quickly reverted.[73] On 19 January, Sanger announced the formal organization of Citizendium as a legal non-profit organization.[74]",
