				"after": "The theatre was designed as a symmetrical pair with the Carlton Hotel and restaurant on the adjacent site, now occupied by New Zealand House.[51] The frontage formed three parts, each of nine bays. The hotel occupied two parts, the theatre one, and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor. The buildings rose to four storeys, with attic floors above, surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the French Renaissance. The theatre has a Corinthian colonnade at the first floor, rising to the second, forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer. This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances.[50] The theatre lies on an eastâwest axis. The stage at the western end was 49 feet (14.9Â m) deep and 69.5 feet (21.2Â m) wide,[5] and reputedly the first to be flat, rather than raked.[7] The interior was designed by the consulting architect, W. H. Romaine-Walker (1854â1940), after the Opera at Versailles by Gabriel. Stalls and the pit were entered at ground level, with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level, and upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above. In all, there were 1,319Â seats. Contemporary opinion was critical of the project. Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres, \"The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building.\"[52]",
