				"after": "\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" received acclaim from most music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine in his review for Allmusic picked the song as one of the album's highlights, calling it a \"terrific midtempo cut\",[20] Larry Flick of Billboard considered the song \"a hook-laden midtempo jam.\"[5] In a separate review, Chuck Taylor also of Billboard named the song \"one of the more substantive - and mature - musical ventures of her career,\" while panning its remix version for \"reduc[ing] the song to a mindless trickle of beats without any hints of the verses.[21] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine observed that on the track Madonna exposes her soul,[22] while Barry Walters of Rolling Stone wrote that the song is \"as musically gentle as it is lyrically barbed.\"[23] Garry Crossing of Dot labeled it a \"tender, sensitive, flirtatious, sexy and oddly vulnerable-feeling ode to the female perspective.\"[24] Regis D'Angiolini of CD Now praised the track, calling it \"one of Madonna's best songs in recent years, thanks to a catchy refrain, keyboard hook, and clever lyrics.\"[7]",
