				"previous": "Immigration since World War II has given Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee small South Asian communities.[210] In 2011, there were an estimated 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group.[3] Since the Enlargement of the European Union more people from Central and Eastern Europe have moved to Scotland, and the 2011 census indicated that 61,000 Poles live there.[3][211]",
				"after": "Scotland has three officially recognised languages: English, Scots, and Scottish Gaelic. Almost all Scots speak Scottish English.[citation needed] The 2011 census indicated that 63% of the population had \"no skills in Scots\".[212] Others speak Highland English. Gaelic is mostly spoken in the Western Isles, where a large proportion of people still speak it; however, nationally its use is confined to just 1% of the population.[213] The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland dropped from 250,000 in 1881 to 60,000 in 2008.[214]",
