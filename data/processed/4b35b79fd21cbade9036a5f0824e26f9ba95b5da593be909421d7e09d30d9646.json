				"If the derivative exists everywhere, the function is differentiable. One can take higher derivatives as well, by iterating this process.",
				"One can classify functions by their differentiability class. The class C0 consists of all continuous functions. The class C1 consists of all differentiable functions whose derivative is continuous; such functions are called continuously differentiable. Thus, a C1 function is exactly a function whose derivative exists and is of class C0. In general, the classes Ck can be defined recursively by declaring C0 to be the set of all continuous functions and declaring Ck for any positive integer k to be the set of all differentiable functions whose derivative is in Ckâ1. In particular, Ck is contained in Ckâ1 for every k, and there are examples to show that this containment is strict. Câ is the intersection of the sets Ck as k varies over the non-negative integers. CÏ is strictly contained in Câ."
