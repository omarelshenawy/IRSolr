The GPS design originally called for 24Â SVs, eight each in three approximately circular orbits,[55] but this was modified to six orbital planes with four satellites each.[56] The six orbit planes have approximately 55Â° inclination (tilt relative to the earth's equator) and are separated by 60Â° right ascension of the ascending node (angle along the equator from a reference point to the orbit's intersection).[57] The orbital period is one-half a sidereal day, i.e., 11 hours and 58 minutes so that the satellites pass over the same locations[58] or almost the same locations[59] every day. The orbits are arranged so that at least six satellites are always within line of sight from almost everywhere on the earth's surface.[60] The result of this objective is that the four satellites are not evenly spaced (90 degrees) apart within each orbit. In general terms, the angular difference between satellites in each orbit is 30, 105, 120, and 105 degrees apart, which sum to 360 degrees.[61]",
