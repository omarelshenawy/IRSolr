				"previous": "In 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby (now part of the Stockholm Archipelago).[3] Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten,[27] he named it ytterbite[note 4] and sent samples to various chemists for further analysis.[3]",
				"after": "Johan Gadolin at the University of Ãbo identified a new oxide or \"earth\" in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794.[28][note 5] Anders Gustaf Ekeberg confirmed this in 1797 and named the new oxide yttria.[29] In the decades after Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been yttrium.[note 6]",
