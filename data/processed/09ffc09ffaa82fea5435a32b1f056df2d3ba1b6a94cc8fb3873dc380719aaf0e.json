				"previous": "By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second league spot, GarcÃ­a RemÃ³n was gone as Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, the well-traveled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in the runner-up spot. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe CF. One day later Luxemburgo got the axe and was replaced with Juan RamÃ³n LÃ³pez Caro. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.",
				"after": "During the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and he was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.[76] Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005â06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and reached the last 16 only in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as PÃ©rez resigned his president post in January 2006 with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on interim basis until the end of the season.",
