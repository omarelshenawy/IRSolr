				"after": "Primarily a herbivore, the giant eland eats grasses and foliage, as well as other parts of a plant.[17][25] In the rainy season, they browse in herds and feed on grasses. They can eat coarse, dry grass and weeds if nothing else is available. They eat fruits too, such as plums. A study in South Africa showed that an eland's diet consists of 75% shrubs and 25% grasses, with highly varying proportions. They often use their long horns to break off branches.[31]",
