				"after": "Fuller left The Dial in 1844 in part because of ill health but also because of her disappointment with the publication's dwindling subscription list.[53] She moved to New York that autumn and joined Horace Greeley's New York Tribune as literary critic, becoming the first full-time book reviewer in American journalism[54] and, by 1846, the publication's first female editor.[55] Her first article, a review of a collection of essays by Emerson, appeared in the December 1, 1844, issue.[56] At this time, the Tribune had some 50,000 subscribers and Fuller earned $500 a year for her work.[57] In addition to American books, she reviewed foreign literature, concerts, lectures, and art exhibits.[58] During her four years with the publication, she published more than 250Â columns, most signed with a \"*\" as a byline.[57] In these columns, Fuller discussed topics ranging from art and literature to political and social issues such as the plight of slaves and women's rights.[59] She also published poetry; her poems, styled after the work of Emerson, do not have the same intellectual vigor as her criticism.[60]",
