				"after": "The prize's focus on Europeans, and Swedes in particular, has been the subject of criticism, even from Swedish newspapers.[60] The majority of laureates have been European, with Sweden itself receiving more prizes than all of Asia, as well as all of Latin America. In 2009, Horace Engdahl, then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that \"Europe still is the center of the literary world\" and that \"the US is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature.\"[61]",
