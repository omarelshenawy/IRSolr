				"previous": "In January 1958 Pan Am scheduled 47 flights a week east from Idlewild to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and beyond; the following August there were 65.[45]",
				"after": "Pan Am was the launch customer of the 707, placing an order for 20 in October 1955. It also ordered 25 of Douglas's DC-8, which could seat six across (the 707 originally was to be 144 inches wide with five-abreast seating; Boeing widened it to match the DC-8). The combined order value was $269Â million. Pan Am's first scheduled jet flight was from New York Idlewild to Paris Le Bourget (stopping at Gander to refuel) on October 26, 1958, with Boeing 707â121 Clipper America (N711PA) with 111 passengers.[55][56] The 320 \"Intercontinental\" series 707 in 1959-60, and the Douglas DC-8 in March 1960, enabled non-stop transatlantic crossings with a viable payload in both directions.",
