				"previous": "John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary of 1859, makes reference to \"their use of a peculiar slang language\" when describing the costermongers of London's East End. In terms of other slang, there are also several borrowings from Yiddish, including kosher (originally Hebrew, via Yiddish, meaning legitimate) and stumm (/ÊtÊm/ originally German, via Yiddish, meaning quiet),[29] as well as Romany, for example wonga (meaning money, from the Romany \"wanga\" meaning coal),[30] and cushty (from the Romany kushtipen, meaning good). A fake Cockney accent is sometimes called \"Mockney\".",
