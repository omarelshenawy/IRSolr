This means that it is only possible for them to live in a marine environment and they are not found in any freshwater habitats.[19] Starfish species inhabit all of the world's oceans. Habitats range from tropical coral reefs, rocky shores, tidal pools, mud, and sand to kelp forests, seagrass meadows[55] and the deep-sea floor down to at least 6,000Â m (20,000Â ft).[56] The greatest diversity of species occurs in coastal areas.[55]",
