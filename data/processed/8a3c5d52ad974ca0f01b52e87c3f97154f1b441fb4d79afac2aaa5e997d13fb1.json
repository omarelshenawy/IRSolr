				"In quantum physics, quantum state refers to the state of a quantum system.",
				"A quantum state can be either pure or mixed. A pure quantum state is represented by a vector, called a state vector, in a Hilbert space. For example, when dealing with the energy spectrum of the electron in a hydrogen atom, the relevant state vectors are identified by the principal quantum number, written . For a more complicated case, consider Bohm's formulation of the EPR experiment, where the state vector"
