				"previous": "Islam arrived in the 7th century with Arab raids, which led to the construction of new fortifications.[10] The area fell from Byzantine control after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 to tribes of Seljuk Turks, only to be returned in 1120 by John II Komnenos.[22]",
				"after": "Following the Fourth Crusade's attack on the Byzantines, the Christian Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia periodically held the port, and it was from an Armenian, Kir Fard, that the Turks took lasting control in 1221 when the Anatolian Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I captured it, assigning the former ruler, whose daughter he married, to the governance of the city of AkÅehir.[23] Seljuk rule saw the golden age of the city, and it can be considered the winter capital of their empire.[24] Building projects, including the twin citadel, city walls, arsenal, and KÄ±zÄ±l Kule, made it an important seaport for western Mediterranean trade, particularly with Ayyubid Egypt and the Italian city-states.[25] Alaeddin Kayqubad I also constructed numerous gardens and pavilions outside the walls, and many of his works can still be found in the city. These were likely financed by his own treasury and by the local emirs, and constructed by the contractor Abu 'Ali al-Kattani al-Halabi.[12] Alaeddin Kayqubad I's son, Sultan GÄ±yaseddin KeyhÃ¼srev II, continued the building campaign with a new cistern in 1240.[26]",
