				"after": "Lambertia formosa grows as a spreading shrub to 2Â m (7Â ft) tall, with one or more stems arising from a woody base known as a lignotuber. The new growth is covered with a fine brownish hair. The stiff leaves are arranged in whorls of 3, or sometimes up to 4 to 6, on the stems, and are linear to narrow-oblanceolate in shape. Measuring anywhere from 1 to 8Â cm (0.4â3Â in) in length and 0.2â0.7Â cm wide, they have a pointed tip or apex. Flowers are seen at any time of the year, but more often over spring and summer (September to January).[8] Their bases are covered by greenish and reddish bracts.[9] The inflorescences are almost always made up of seven smaller individual flowers (less than 1% of flowerheads have either six or eight flowers),[10] known as florets, and can be shades of red or pink in colour. The tubular perianths are 4.5Â cm (1.6Â in) long, with the styles protruding another 1â1.5Â cm (0.5Â in) beyond. Flowering is followed by the development of woody fruit which measure 2â3 by 1â2Â cm. They have two 1â1.5Â cm sharp horny protuberances, and a 0.5Â cm 'beak', initially pale green in colour before fading to a grey-brown.[8] These woody follicles each have two flat, winged seeds that are retained until burnt by fire.[11][12]",
