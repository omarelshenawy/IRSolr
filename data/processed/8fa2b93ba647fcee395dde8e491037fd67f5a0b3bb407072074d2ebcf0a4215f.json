				"previous": "A simple example is Newton's second law of motion â the relationship between the displacement x and the time t of the object under the force F, which leads to the differential equation",
				"after": "for the motion of a particle of constant mass m. In general, F depends on the position x(t) of the particle at time t, and so the unknown function x(t) appears on both sides of the differential equation, as is indicated in the notation F(x(t)).[2][3][4][5]",
