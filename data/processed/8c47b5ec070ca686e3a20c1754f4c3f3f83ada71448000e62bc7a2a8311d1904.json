It is a segment of the Sunda Arc, a string of volcanic islands that forms the southern chain of the Indonesian archipelago.[10] Tambora forms the Sanggar peninsula on Sumbawa. At the north of the peninsula is the Flores Sea, and at the south is Saleh Bay, 86Â km (53Â mi) long and 36Â km (22Â mi) wide. At the mouth of Saleh Bay is a 30,000-hectare islet called Moyo (Indonesian: Pulau Moyo) which has a guest shelter or luxurious resort where celebrities such as Princess Diana once stayed.[11]",
