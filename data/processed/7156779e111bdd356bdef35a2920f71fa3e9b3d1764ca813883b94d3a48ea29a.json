				"after": "South African Airways was formed on 1 February 1934 following the acquisition of Union Airways by the South African government. Forty staff members, along with one de Havilland DH.60 Gypsy Moth, one de Havilland 80A Puss Moth, three Junkers F.13s and a leased Junkers F13 and Junkers A50 were among the acquired.[7] Upon acquisition, the government changed the airline's name to South African Airways.[8] came under control of the South African Railways and Harbours Administration (now Transnet).[9][10] Charter operations started that year.[11] On 1 February the following year, the carrier acquired South West African Airways,[7] which had since 1932 been providing a weekly air-mail service between Windhoek and Kimberley.[10] During this time, South African ordered three Junkers Ju 52/3m aircraft, which were delivered in October 1934 and entered service 10 days later.[7] These aircraft were configured to carry 14 passengers, along with four crew. They enabled services thrice-weekly DurbanâJohannesburg, with weekly services on the DurbanâEast LondonâPort ElizabethâGeorge/Mossel BayâCape Town route.[7] On 1 July 1935, SAA moved its operations to Rand Airport as it became increasingly obvious that Johannesburg would become the country's aviation hub, which coincided with the launching of RandâDurbanâEast LondonâPort ElizabethâCape Town services.[7] From July the following year a weekly RandâKimberleyâBeaufort WestâCape Town service commenced; in April A936, all RandâCape Town services were taken over from Imperial Airways.[7] A fourth Ju 52/3m shortly joined the fleet.",
