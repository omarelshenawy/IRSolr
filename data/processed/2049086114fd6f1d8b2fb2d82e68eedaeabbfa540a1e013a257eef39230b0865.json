				"previous": "In 2000, the United States Congress approved \"permanent normal trade relations\" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.[178] China has a significant trade surplus with the United States, its most important export market.[179] In the early 2010s, US politicians argued that the Chinese yuan was significantly undervalued, giving China an unfair trade advantage.[180][181][182] In recent decades, China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co-operation;[183][184][185] in 2012, Sino-African trade totalled over US$160 billion.[186] China has furthermore strengthened its ties with major South American economies, becoming the largest trading partner of Brazil and building strategic links with Argentina.[187][188]",
