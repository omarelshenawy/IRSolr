				"previous": "On Tuesday 7 August, following a Monday bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2:30Â am. Her body was found at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39Â times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results.[19] The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect it with the later murders.[20] Most experts today do not connect it with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.[21]",
				"after": "On Friday 31 August, prostitute Mary Ann Nichols was murdered in Buck's Row (since renamed Durward Street), a back street in Whitechapel. Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3:45Â am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance. Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound. Several shallower incisions across the abdomen, and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards.[23] As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or Bethnal Green Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was at first investigated by the local detectives. On the same day, James Monro resigned as the head of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) over differences with Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Charles Warren.[24] Initial investigations into the murder had little success, although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, as in the case of Smith.[25] The Star newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline.[26] Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline, Henry Moore and Walter Andrews from the Central Office at Scotland Yard.[27] On the available evidence, Coroner Baxter concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3Â am where she was found. In his summing up, he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram, as the lethal weapons were different in those cases, and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat.[28] However, by the time the inquest into Nichols' death had concluded, a fourth woman had been murdered, and Baxter noted \"The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable.\"[29]",
