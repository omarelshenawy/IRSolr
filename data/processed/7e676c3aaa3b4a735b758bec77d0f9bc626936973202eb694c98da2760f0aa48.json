				"previous": "On 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of that year's French football season.[155][156] Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012â13 season, Beckham was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife, Victoria, and children stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final home game against Brest.[157] In this game Beckham assisted a goal by Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed after 80 minutes, receiving hugs from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from fans.[157] PSG went on to win the game 3â1.[157]",
			"after": [
				"Beckham made his first appearance for the England national football team on 1 September 1996, in a World Cup qualifying match against Moldova.[158]",
				"Beckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France,[159] but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,[160] and he did not start in either of England's first two games. He was picked for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free kick in a 2â0 victory, which was his first goal for England.[161]"
