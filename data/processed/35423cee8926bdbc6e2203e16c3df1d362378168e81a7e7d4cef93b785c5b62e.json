In Eurasia, its northern nesting limit is just short of the treeline, roughly at the 10Â Â°C July isotherm, and it breeds south locally to about 51Â°N.[19] Most birds breed between 60â67Â°N, reaching 70Â°N in Scandinavia.[24] The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent, its range extending southwards beyond the US border in the Rocky Mountains.[1][22]",
