				"after": "In October 1939, Deutschland, Germania, and Der FÃ¼hrer were reorganized into the SS-VerfÃ¼gungs Division. The Leibstandarte remained independent and was increased in strength to a reinforced motorized regiment.[20][23] Hitler authorized the creation of two new divisions: the SS Totenkopf Division, formed from militarized Standarten of the SS-TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde, and the Polizei Division, formed from members of the national police force.[25] Almost overnight the force that the OKW had tried to disband had increased from 18,000 to over 100,000 men.[26] Hitler next authorized the creation in March 1940 of four Motorized Artillery battalions, one for each division and the Leibstandarte. The OKW was supposed to supply these new battalions with weapons, but was reluctant to hand over guns from its own arsenal. The weapons arrived only slowly, and by the time of the Battle of France only the Leibstandarte battalion was up to strength.[27]",
