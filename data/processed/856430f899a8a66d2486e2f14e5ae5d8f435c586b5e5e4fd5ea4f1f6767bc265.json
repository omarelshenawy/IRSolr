				"after": "Myriostoma is saprobic, deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter. Fruit bodies grow grouped in well-drained or sandy soil, often in the partial shade of trees.[25] The species occurs in deciduous forests and mixed forests, gardens, along hedges and grassy road banks, and grazed grasslands. In the Northern Hemisphere, it tends to grow on well-drained south-facing slopes, while it prefers a similar habitat on north-facing slopes in Australia.[16] In Europe, its major habitat is riparian mixed forests dominated by Salix alba and Populus alba along the great rivers.[24] In Hawaii, it has been collected at elevations above 2,000Â m (6,600Â ft) where it appears to favor the mamame (Sophora chrysophylla) forest.[30]",
