				"previous": "Cells usually have a single nucleus, but there are also cells that have many nuclei. Some other have no nucleus. This can be a result of a normal process, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or a result of faulty cell division.",
				"after": "Anucleated cells contain no nucleus and are, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte.[58] The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature \"micronucleated\" erythrocytes into the bloodstream.[59][60] Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.",
