Niobium pentafluoride (NbF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 79.0Â Â°C and niobium pentachloride (NbCl5) is yellow (see image at left) with a melting point of 203.4Â Â°C. Both are hydrolyzed to give oxides and oxyhalides, such as NbOCl3. The pentachloride is a versatile reagent being used to generate the organometallic compounds, such as niobocene dichloride ((C 5H 5) 2NbCl 2).[51] The tetrahalides (NbX 4) are dark-coloured polymers with Nb-Nb bonds, for example the black hygroscopic niobium tetrafluoride (NbF4) and brown niobium tetrachloride (NbCl4).",
