				"after": "BMI provided domestic and European feeder traffic into Heathrow Airport [51] until it was purchased by British Airways' parent company International Airlines Group in 2011. The Lufthansa-owned airline had faced heavy annual losses of more than Â£100 million. Under the terms of the takeover, IAG had to relinquish some former BMI domestic slots at Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic purchased enough slots in 2012 to enable it to launch a domestic service on 31 March 2013, under the \"Little Red\" brand, operating a total of 12 daily services from London to Aberdeen (3), Edinburgh (6), and Manchester (3).[52] The airline wet-leased four Airbus A320s from Aer Lingus, operating with Virgin Atlantic livery, under a three-year contract.[53][54]",
