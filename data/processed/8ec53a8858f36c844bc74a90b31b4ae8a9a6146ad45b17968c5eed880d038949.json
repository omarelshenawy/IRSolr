				"Commuter rail-type service directly from a city centre to the airport, without needing to change trains and sometimes without intermediate stops;",
				"In some airports, such as San Francisco International Airport, the rail link only serves one terminal or concourse directly; passengers using other terminals must use an people mover/airport circulator. Circulators typically also serve parking lots, and sometimes airport hotels and off-site car rental locations."
