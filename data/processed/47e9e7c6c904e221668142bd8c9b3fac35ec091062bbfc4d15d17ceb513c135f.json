				"previous": "For clarity in radio communications, each digit in the runway name is pronounced individually: runway three six, runway one four, etc. A leading zero, for example in \"runway zero six\" or \"runway zero one left\", is included for all ICAO and some U.S.Â military airports (such as Edwards Air Force Base). However, most U.S.Â civil aviation airports drop the leading zero as required by FAA regulation.[3] This also includes some military airfields such as Cairns Army Airfield. This American anomaly may lead to inconsistencies in conversations between American pilots and controllers in other countries. It is very common in a country such as Canada for a controller to clear an incoming American aircraft to, for example, runway 04, and the pilot read back the clearance as runwayÂ 4. In flight simulation programs those of American origin might apply U.S. usage to airports around the world. For example runwayÂ 05 at Halifax will appear on the program as the single digit 5 rather than 05.",
				"after": "Runway designations change over time because the magnetic poles slowly drift on the Earth's surface and the magnetic bearing will change. Depending on the airport location and how much drift takes place, it may be necessary over time to change the runway designation. As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10Â degrees, this will affect some runways more than others. For example, if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233Â degrees, it would be designated RunwayÂ 23. If the magnetic heading changed downwards by 5Â degrees to 228, the Runway would still be RunwayÂ 23. If on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226 (RunwayÂ 23), and the heading decreased by only 2Â degrees to 224, the runway should become RunwayÂ 22. Because the drift itself is quite slow, runway designation changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents. When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers at each end of the runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In JulyÂ 2009 for example, London Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.",
