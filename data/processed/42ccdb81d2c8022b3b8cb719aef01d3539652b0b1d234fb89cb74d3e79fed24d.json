				"after": "From 1862 to 1867, the theatre was managed by James Henry Mapleson, presenting Italian, French and German opera, including the British premiÃ¨res of La forza del destino, MÃ©dÃ©e, Faust and The Merry Wives of Windsor, and promoting such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, De Murska, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Tietjens, Antonio Giuglini, Charles Santley and Christine Nilsson.[44] On the night of 6 December 1867, the theatre was destroyed by fire, thought to have been caused by an overheated stove. Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street, suffered damage of varying severity. The Royal Opera Arcade, on the western side, survived with only superficial damage. With the destruction of the theatre, Mapleson took his company to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.[44]",
