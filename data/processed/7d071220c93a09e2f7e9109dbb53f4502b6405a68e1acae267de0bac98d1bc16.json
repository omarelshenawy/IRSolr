				"after": "The nautical mile was historically defined as a minute of arc along a meridian of the Earth (north-south), making a meridian exactly 180Ã60 = 10,800 historical nautical miles.[5] It can therefore be used for approximate measures on a meridian as change of latitude on a nautical chart. The originally intended definition of the metre as 10â7 of a half-meridian arc makes the mean historical nautical mile exactly (2Ã107)/10,800 = 1,851.851851â¦ historical metres. Based on the current IUGG meridian of 20,003,931.4585 (standard) metres the mean historical nautical mile is 1,852.216 m.",
