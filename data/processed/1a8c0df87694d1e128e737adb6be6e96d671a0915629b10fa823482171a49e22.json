				"previous": "Lampris guttatus is a large discoid and deeply keeled fish with an attractive form and a conspicuous coloration. They can reach a maximum length of 2Â m (6.6Â ft) and a maximum weight of 270Â kg (600Â lb). The body is a deep steely blue grading to rosy on the belly, with white spots in irregular rows covering the flanks. Both the median and paired fins are a bright vermillion. Jaws are vermillion, too. The large eyes stand out as well, ringed with golden yellow. The body is covered in minute cycloid scales and its silvery, iridescent guanine coating is easily abraded.",
				"after": "They have long falcated pectoral fins inserted (more or less) horizontally. The caudal fins are broadly lunated, forked, and emarginated. Pelvic fins are similar but a little longer than pectoral fins, with about 14â17 rays. The anterior portion of a dorsal fin (with about 50â55 rays) is greatly elongated, also in a falcate profile similar to the pelvic fins. The anal fin (34â41 rays) is about as high and as long as the shorter portion of the dorsal fin, and both fins have corresponding grooves into which they can be depressed. The snout is pointed and the mouth small, toothless, and terminal. The lateral line forms a high arch over the pectoral fins before sweeping down to the caudal peduncle.",
