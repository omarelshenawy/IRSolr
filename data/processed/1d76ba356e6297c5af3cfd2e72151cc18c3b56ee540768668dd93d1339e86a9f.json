				"This general equation may be used to derive any continuity equation, ranging from as simple as the volume continuity equation to as complicated as the NavierâStokes equations. This equation also generalizes the advection equation. Other equations in physics, such as Gauss's law of the electric field and Gauss's law for gravity, have a similar mathematical form to the continuity equation, but are not usually called by the term \"continuity equation\", because j in those cases does not represent the flow of a real physical quantity."
