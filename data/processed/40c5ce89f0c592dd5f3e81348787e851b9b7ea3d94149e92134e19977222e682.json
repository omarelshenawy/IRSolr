				"after": "Human cultivation and use of saffron spans more than 3,500 years[1][2] and spans cultures, continents, and civilizations. Saffron, a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativus), has through history remained among the world's most costly substances. With its bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, the apocarotenoid-rich saffron has been used as a seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine. Saffron is a genetically monomorphic clone[3] native to Southwest Asia;[4][5] it was first cultivated in Greece.[6]",
