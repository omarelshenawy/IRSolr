				"previous": "On February 1, 2010, Allegiant began operations at the airport. The company moved one half of its Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) schedule to Orlando to test revenue at the higher cost airport.[citation needed] After evaluating the routes out of Orlando,[when?] the carrier decided to consolidate and return its Orlando area operations to SFB citing an inability to achieve a fare premium at MCO as anticipated, passenger preference for Orlando Sanford International Airport, higher costs at MCO than expected and a more efficient operating environment at SFB. However, they continue to operate one flight a week from MCO on Fridays using the MD-83 aircraft.[citation needed]",
