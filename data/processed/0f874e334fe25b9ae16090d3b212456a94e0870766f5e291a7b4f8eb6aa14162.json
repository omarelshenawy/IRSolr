				"previous": "In the same year, comfort and performance of domestic flights in Iceland could be improved with the introduction of the Douglas DC-3 Dakota. A total of six airliners of that type had been purchased, which remained in service with the airline until 1972, the oldest one being still flightworthy as of 2011.[10] Until the late 1960s, FlugfÃ©lag concentrated mostly on domestic flights, where it initially faced fierce competition from LoftleiÃ°ir, another airline which had been founded in 1944. When a merger proposal of the Icelandic government was rejected by the two airlines, the domestic routes were split among them as a measure to ease competition. When LoftleiÃ°ir pulled out of the domestic market in 1952 to fully concentrate on international flights, FlugfÃ©lag became the main domestic carrier of the country.",
				"after": "International services stayed part of the business model of FlugfÃ©lag, though to a far lesser extent compared to LoftleiÃ°ir. In 1948, the Douglas C-54 Skymaster was introduced on those routes, and in 1957 two new Vickers 759 Viscounts were acquired, the first turboprop airliners to be operated by an Icelandic airline. In the 1950s, FlugfÃ©lag began to use the Icelandair branding for its international flights.[7]",
