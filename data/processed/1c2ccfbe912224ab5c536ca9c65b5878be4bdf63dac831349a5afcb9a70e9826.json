Bar-headed geese have been seen flying as high as 10,175Â m (33,383Â ft) above sea level. An aircraft over the Ivory Coast collided with a RÃ¼ppell's vulture at the astonishing altitude of 11,300Â m (37,100Â ft), the current record avian height.[8] The majority of bird collisions occur near or on airports (90%, according to the ICAO) during takeoff, landing and associated phases. According to the FAA wildlife hazard management manual for 2005, less than 8% of strikes occur above 900Â m (3,000Â ft) and 61% occur at less than 30Â m (100Â ft).[citation needed]",
