				"after": "Elevators are flight control surfaces, usually at the rear of an aircraft, which control the aircraft's pitch, and therefore the angle of attack and the lift of the wing. The elevators are usually hinged to the tailplane or horizontal stabilizer. They may be the only pitch control surface present, sometimes located at front (early airplanes) or integrated into a rear \"all-moving tailplane\" also called a slab elevator or stabilator.",
