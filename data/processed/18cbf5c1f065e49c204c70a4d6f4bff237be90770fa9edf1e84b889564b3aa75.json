France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41Â° and 51Â° N, and longitudes 6Â° W and 10Â° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone.",
