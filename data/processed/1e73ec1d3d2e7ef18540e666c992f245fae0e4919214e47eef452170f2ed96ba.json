The field Ï(r, t) can be a scalar field, often a scalar potential like the classical gravitational potential Î¶(r, t) or electric potential Ï(r, t), or a vector field like the Newtonian gravitational field g(r, t) or vector potentials like the magnetic potential A(r, t), or a tensor field of any order such as the electromagnetic tensor F(r, t), or even a spinor field which arise in describing particles as quantum fields. The Lagrangian density is a function of the field and its space and time derivatives: â[Ï(r, t), âÏ(r, t)/ât, âÏ(r, t)]."
