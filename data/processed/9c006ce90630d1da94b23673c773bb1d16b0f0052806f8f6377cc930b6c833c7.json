				"previous": "Sociological classifications of religious movements suggest that within any given religious group, a community can resemble various types of structures, including \"churches\", \"denominations\", \"sects\", \"cults\", and \"institutions\".",
				"after": "While there has been much debate about how religion affects the economy of countries, in general there is a negative correlation between religiosity and the wealth of nations. In other words, the richer a nation is, the less religious it tends to be.[87] However, sociologist and political economist Max Weber has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their Protestant work ethic.[88]",
