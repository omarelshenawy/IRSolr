				"after": "Hawke's administrative career began in 1898 when, following the death of Michael Ellison, he was elected to succeed him as Yorkshire President and remained in office for forty years, in the first twelve of which he was also the Yorkshire team captain.[48] He formed a successful liaison with Frederick Toone, who was club secretary from 1902 until his death in June 1930. Hawke praised Toone for increasing the membership from 3,000 in 1903 to over 7,000 ten years later.[81] They worked together to further improve the terms and conditions of the professional players' contracts. To 1914, they were paid Â£5 for a home match and Â£6 for an away match with a Â£1 win bonus. Players who had received their county cap were obliged to join the Cricketers' Friendly Society and were paid the winter wage of Â£2 a week.[82]",
