				"The following state parks are within 30 miles (48Â km) of Ricketts Glen State Park:[120][121][122][123][124]",
				"Many of the trails in the park are difficult and hikers are urged to use caution, especially on the Falls Trail, which is steep and often wet and slippery. Each year hikers fall in the glens and have to be rescued, which usually takes dozens of volunteers and up to 11Â hours because of the remote locations and rugged terrain.[115][116] As of 2008, the former concession stand along PA 118 in the southern end of the park was used for storage of rescue equipment.[117]"
