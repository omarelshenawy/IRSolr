A \"contained\" engine failure is one in which components might separate inside the engine but either remain within the engineâs cases or exit the engine through the tail pipe. This is a design feature of all engines and generally should not pose an immediate flight risk. An \"uncontained\" engine failure can be more serious because pieces from the engine exit the engine at high speeds in other directions, posing potential danger to the aircraft structure and persons within the plane. In the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board will likely investigate any uncontained engine failure involving a transport category aircraft.",
