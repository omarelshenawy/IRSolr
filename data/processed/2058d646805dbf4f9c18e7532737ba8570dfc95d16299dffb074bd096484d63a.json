				"Due to Jackson being a Jehovah's Witness at the time, the video begins with a disclaimer that reads:",
				"On a night set in the 1950s, a teenaged Michael and his unnamed girlfriend (Ola Ray), run out of gas while driving in a wooded area. They walk into the forest as they leave the car behind and Michael asks her to be his girlfriend. She accepts and he gives her a ring. However, he then tells her that he is \"different\" than other guys. She tells him that's the reason she likes him, but Michael insists that she doesn't understand what he means as his girlfriend asks what's he talking about. A full moon appears, and Michael begins transforming into a werecat,[2] growling at her to leave in the process. The girl shrieks and runs away, but the werecat catches up, knocks her down, lunges at her with his claws, and kills her (off-screen)."
