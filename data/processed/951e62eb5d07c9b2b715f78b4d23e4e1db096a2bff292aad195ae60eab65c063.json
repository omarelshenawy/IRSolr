Efforts are on to develop the PTA further, with an improved all digital flight control system, and a better turbojet engine.[10] The Nishant is a hydraulically launched short-ranged UAV for the tactical battle area. It is currently being evaluated by the Indian Navy and the Indian Paramilitary forces as well.",
