				"previous": "Air Flamenco flew under an air charter license until 2011. The FAA ordered the carrier to cease and desist exceeding the requirements of an air charter company as they were in actuality operating a commuter air service without license. They were fined $30,000. They have since obtained a license to fly as a commuter air service air carrier. The air carrier is a VFR-only approved carrier.",
