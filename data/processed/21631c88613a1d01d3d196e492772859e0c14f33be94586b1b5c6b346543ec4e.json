				"previous": "During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work. Lichtenstein was among them, and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters. Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961.[1] Lichtenstein's 1961 works, especially Look Mickey, are considered a minor step from his earlier comic strip pop art.[2]",
				"after": "According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, Look Mickey was based on the Little Golden Book series.[3] The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is entitled Donald Duck Lost and Found, written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through Disney Enterprises. The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten.[4][5] An alternative theory suggests that Look Mickey and Popeye were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers.[1] This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.[6]",
