				"previous": "It was far from certain that the passenger 707 would be profitable. At the time, Boeing was making nearly all of its money from military contracts: Its last passenger transport, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, had netted the company a $15 million loss before it was purchased by the Air Force as the KC-97 Stratofreighter.[8] In a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside Seattle, on August 7, 1955, test pilot Tex Johnston performed a barrel roll in the 367-80 prototype.[9]",
				"after": "The 132-inch (3,350Â mm) wide fuselage of the Dash 80 was large enough for four-abreast (two-plus-two) seating (in the manner of the Stratocruiser). Answering customers' demands and under Douglas competition, Boeing soon realized that this would not provide a viable payload, so it widened the fuselage to 144Â in (3,660Â mm) to allow five-abreast seating and use of the KC-135's tooling.[10] Douglas Aircraft had launched its DC-8 with a fuselage width of 147Â in (3,730Â mm). The airlines liked the extra space and six-abreast seating, and so Boeing increased the 707's width again to compete, this time to 148Â in (3,760Â mm).[11]",
