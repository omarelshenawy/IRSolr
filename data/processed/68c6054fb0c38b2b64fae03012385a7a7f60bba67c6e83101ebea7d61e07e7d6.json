				"previous": "On August 25, in retaliation for the raid, General Ewing authorized General Order No. 11 (not to be confused with General Ulysses S. Grant's order of the same name). The edict ordered the depopulation of three and a half Missouri counties along the Kansas border (with the exception of a few designated towns), forcing tens of thousands of civilians to abandon their homes. Union troops marched through behind them, burning buildings, torching planted fields and shooting down livestock to deprive the guerrillas of food, fodder, and support. The area was so thoroughly devastated that it became known thereafter as the \"Burnt District\". Quantrill and his men rode south to Texas, where they passed the winter with the Confederate forces.",
				"after": "While in Texas, Quantrill and his 400 men quarreled. His once-large band broke up into several smaller guerrilla companies. One was led by his lieutenant, \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson, Quantrill joined them briefly in the fall of 1864 during fighting north of the Missouri River.",
