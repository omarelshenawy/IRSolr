The airflow split is about 60/40 front back.[8] It was critical that the nozzles rotate together. This was achieved by using a pair of air motors fed from the HP (high pressure) compressor, in a fail over configuration, pairs of nozzles connected with, surprisingly, motor-cycle chains. The nozzles rotate over an angular range of 98.5 degrees.[6]",
