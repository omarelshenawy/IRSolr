				"previous": "The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.[2] It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.[d] The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the \"melancholy associations\" of the place.[25] The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former royal forest[e] that covered a considerable area south and east of Pendle Hill, extending almost to the towns of Burnley, Colne and Padiham.",
				"after": "One contender is in the civil parish of Blacko, on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;[29] since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.[3][30] In The Lancashire Witch-Craze, Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and Gisburn.[31] Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn public house; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.[32] The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.[33] It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the manor of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,[f] described as being \"in the north of Colne\",[29] but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.[35] The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.[4]",
