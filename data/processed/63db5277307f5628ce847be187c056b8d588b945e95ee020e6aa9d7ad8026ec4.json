				"previous": "The detonation created a blast equivalent to 16 kilotons of TNT (67Â TJ).[17] The U-235 weapon was considered very inefficient, with only 1.7% of its fissile material fissioning.[18] The radius of total destruction was about one mile (1.6Â km), with resulting fires across 4.4 square miles (11Â km2).[19] Americans estimated that 4.7 square miles (12Â km2) of the city were destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6â7% damaged.[20] Some 70,000â80,000 people, or some 30% of the city's population, were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm,[21] and another 70,000 injured.[22] Out of those killed, 20,000 were soldiers.[23]",
				"after": "Enola Gay returned safely to its base on Tinian to great fanfare, touching down at 2:58 pm, after 12 hours 13 minutes. The Great Artiste and Necessary Evil followed at short intervals. Several hundred people, including journalists and photographers, had gathered to watch the planes return. Tibbets was the first to disembark, and was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross on the spot.[16]",
