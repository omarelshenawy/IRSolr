				"previous": "Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5Â trillion, but only $3Â trillion was spent by the end of November 2009.[178] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5Â trillion or 10.6Â percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4Â trillion or 9.9Â percent of GDP.[179][180] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will slightly shrink to $1.34Â trillion, while the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53Â trillion or 90Â percent of GDP.[181] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2Â trillion took effect in February 2014.[182] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5Â trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2Â trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[183] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[184]",
				"after": "As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0Â percent and averaging 10.0Â percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7Â percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6Â percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[187] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8Â percent, which was less than the average of 1.9Â percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[188] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7Â percent,[189] decreasing to 6.7Â percent in the last month of 2013.[190] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3Â percent in the first quarter.[191] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6Â percent, followed by a 5.0Â percent increase in the fourth quarter.[192] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7Â percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[192] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain\".[193] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9Â percent in 2010.[194]",
