When I say this is it, it really means this is it, this will be the final curtain call.\"[9] On 11 March, two days before pre-sale began, an extra 40 dates were added to meet high demand, bringing the number of shows to 50Â â five of these dates were reserved in their entirety for the public sale.[10] Jackson's 50 dates would make the concerts the longest residency at the arena. In May 2009, the show was originally set to have begun on 8 July 2009, and finished on 6 March 2010.[11]",
