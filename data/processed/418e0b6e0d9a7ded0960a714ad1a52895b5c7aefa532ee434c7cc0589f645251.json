				"after": "The Irish overprinted stamps came, as supplied from the printers in London, with a watermark of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised design of the two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing the name of the country Saorstat Ãireann (Irish Free State). This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Ãire (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Ãire.[19] Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was fed into the printing machines.[34]",
