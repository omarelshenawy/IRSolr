				"after": "Throughout the early modern period, the English term \"witch\" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate cunning folk. \"There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent.\"[28] The contemporary Reginald Scot noted, \"At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'\".[29] Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,[30] which could lead to their being accused as \"witches\" in the negative sense. Many English \"witches\" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose fairy familiars had been demonised;[31] many French devins-guerisseurs (\"diviner-healers\") were accused of witchcraft,[32] and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.[33]",
