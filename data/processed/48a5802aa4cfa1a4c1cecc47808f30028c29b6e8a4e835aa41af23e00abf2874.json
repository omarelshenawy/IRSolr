				"Some dialect words now appear mainly, or solely, in place names, such as \"batch\" (North Somerset, = hill but more commonly applied to Coalmine spoil heaps e.g. Camerton batch, Farrington batch, Braysdown batch), \"tyning\", \"hoe\" (a bay). These are not to be confused with fossilised Brythonic or Cornish language terms, for example, \"-coombe\" is quite a common suffix in West Country place names (not so much in Cornwall), and means a \"valley\"."
