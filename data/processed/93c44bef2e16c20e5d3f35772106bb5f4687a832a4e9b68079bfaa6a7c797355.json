				"after": "The 757-200PF, the production cargo version of the 757-200, entered service with UPS Airlines in 1987.[61] Targeted at the overnight package delivery market,[61] the freighter can carry up to 15 containers or pallets on its main deck, for a volume of up to 6,600 cubic feet (187Â m3), while its two lower holds can carry up to 1,830 cubic feet (51.8Â m3) of bulk cargo.[29] The maximum revenue payload capability is 87,700 pounds (39,800Â kg) including container weight.[141] The 757-200PF is specified with a MTOW of 255,000 pounds (116,000Â kg) for maximal range performance;[61][141] when fully loaded, the aircraft can fly up to 3,150 nautical miles (5,830Â km).[141] Because the freighter does not carry any passengers, it can operate transatlantic flights free of ETOPS restrictions.[49] Power is provided by RB211-535E4B engines from Rolls-Royce, or PW2037 and PW2040 engines from Pratt & Whitney.[141]",
