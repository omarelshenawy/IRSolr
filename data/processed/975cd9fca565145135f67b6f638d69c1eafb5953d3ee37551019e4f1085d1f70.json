				"previous": "Pitch and roll control was provided by elevons, though Vought called these surfaces \"ailevators\" at the time. Slats were fitted to the entire span of the leading edge. All controls were hydraulically-powered. The very long nose landing gear strut required for high angle of attack takeoffs was rather weak, and a collapse could seriously jeopardize the pilot's safety. The F7U was also largely let down by its underpowered Westinghouse J34 turbojets, an engine that some pilots liked to say \"put out less heat than Westinghouse's toasters.\" Naval aviators called the F7U the \"Gutless Cutlass\" and/or the \"Ensign Eliminator\" or, in kinder moments, the \"Praying Mantis\".[4]",
				"after": "Three prototypes were ordered in 1946, with the first example flying on 29 September 1948, piloted by Vought's Chief Test Pilot, J. Robert Baker. The maiden flight took place from Naval Air Station Patuxent River and was not without its problems. During testing one of the prototypes reached a maximum speed of 625Â mph (1,058Â km/h)[7]",
