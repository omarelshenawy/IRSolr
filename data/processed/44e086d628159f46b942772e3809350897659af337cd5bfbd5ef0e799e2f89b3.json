Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and very dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.[73] The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58Â Â°C (136Â Â°F)), was discredited in 2013.[74][75]",
