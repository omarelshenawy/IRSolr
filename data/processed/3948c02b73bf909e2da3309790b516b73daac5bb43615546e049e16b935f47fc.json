				"previous": "Wikiwand (originally WikiWand) was founded in 2013 by Lior Grossman and Ilan Lewin.[2] Officially launched in August 2014,[3] the interface includes a sidebar menu, navigation bar, personalized links to other languages, new typography, and access to previews of linked articles.[4] The list of contents is constantly displayed on the left-hand side.[5]",
				"after": "Grossman developed it to overcome his own frustrations with Wikipedia, arguing that \"It didnât make sense to us that the fifth most popular website in the world, used by half a billion people, has an interface that hasnât been updated in over a decade. We found the Wikipedia interface cluttered, hard to read (large blocks of small text), hard to navigate, and lacking in terms of usability.\"[6]",
