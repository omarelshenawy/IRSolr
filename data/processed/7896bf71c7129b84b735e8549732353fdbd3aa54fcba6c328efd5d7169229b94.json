				"previous": "Hurricane Sandy which hit the United States east coast in late October 2012, caused unprecedented damage, flooded subways, closed down all major airports, resulted in cancellation of over 20,000 flights,[141][142] costing the aviation industry nearly 200 million dollars.[143] It claimed more than one-hundred lives.[144][145] Eleven states and the District of Columbia were declared disaster states.[146] Estimates for the damage cost vary from 50â70 billion dollars.[147][148]",
				"after": "The most intense storm on record was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979, which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals (26Â inHg) and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots (85Â m/s) or 190 miles per hour (310Â km/h).[149] Tip, however, does not solely hold the record for fastest sustained winds in a cyclone. Typhoon Keith in the Pacific and Hurricane Allen in the North Atlantic currently share this record with Tip.[150] Typhoon Nancy in 1961 had recorded wind speeds of 185 knots (95Â m/s) or 215 miles per hour (346Â km/h), but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high, and this is no longer considered the storm with the highest wind speeds on record.[117] Likewise, a surface-level gust caused by Typhoon Paka on Guam was recorded at 205 knots (105Â m/s) or 235 miles per hour (378Â km/h). Had it been confirmed, it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded on the Earth's surface, but the reading had to be discarded since the anemometer was damaged by the storm.[151]",
