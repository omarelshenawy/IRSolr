				"after": "Naturalist and popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala in his three-volume work The Mammals of Australia (1845â63) and introduced the species, as well as other members of Australia's little-known faunal community, to the general British public.[114] Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London.[115] In this widely cited publication he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat.[116] English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered just a few years before.[117] Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 The Mammals of Australia.[118]",
