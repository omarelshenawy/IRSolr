It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de LotbiniÃ¨re, Marquis de LotbiniÃ¨re between October 1755 and 1757 during the Seven Years' War, often referred to as the French and Indian War in the US. It was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War.",
