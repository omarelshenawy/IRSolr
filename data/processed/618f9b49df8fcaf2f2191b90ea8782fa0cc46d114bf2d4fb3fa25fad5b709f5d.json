				"after": "Lessons for Children and Barbauld's other popular children's book, Hymns in Prose for Children, had an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of William Wordsworth and William Blake, particularly Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience (1789â94),[28] they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren both in Britain and the United States. Barbauld's texts were used to perpetuate the ideal of Republican motherhood in 19th-century America, particularly the notion of the mother as the educator of the nation.[29] British children's author and critic Charlotte Yonge wrote in 1869 that the books had taught \"three-quarters of the gentry of the last three generations\" to read.[30] Poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning could still recite the beginning of Lessons at age thirty-nine.[31]",
