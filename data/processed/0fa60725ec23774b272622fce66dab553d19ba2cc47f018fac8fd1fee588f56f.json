				"previous": "YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[33] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[34][35] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[36] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[37] which is available only to users in the US, Canada and the UK as of 2010.[38][39] The service offers over 6,000 films.[40]",
				"after": "In March 2010, YouTube began free streaming of certain content, including 60 cricket matches of the Indian Premier League. According to YouTube, this was the first worldwide free online broadcast of a major sporting event.[41]",
