				"after": "The Blakeney Chapel ruins consist of an east-west rectangular structure (S1) 18Â m ÃÂ 7Â m (59Â ft ÃÂ 23Â ft) in size with a smaller rectangular building (S2), 13Â m ÃÂ 5Â m (43Â ft ÃÂ 16Â ft) built onto the southern side of the main room. Most of the structure is buried, only a 6Â m (20Â ft) length of a flint and mortar wall being exposed to a height of 0.3Â m (1Â ft) prior to the excavation of 2004â05. The ruins stand on the highest point of Blakeney Eye at about 2Â m (7Â ft) above sea level.[1] The Eye is a sandy mound in the marshes that is located inside the sea wall at the point where the River Glaven turns westward towards the sheltered inlet of Blakeney Haven. Cley Eye is a similar raised area on the east bank of the river. Despite the name, Blakeney Eye, like most of the northern part of the marshes in this area, is actually part of the parish of Cley next the Sea.[2]",
