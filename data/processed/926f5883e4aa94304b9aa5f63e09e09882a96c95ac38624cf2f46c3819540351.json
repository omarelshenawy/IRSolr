				"after": "Upon leaving the country, Emperor PedroÂ I selected three people to take charge of his son and remaining daughters. The first was JosÃ© BonifÃ¡cio de Andrada, his friend and an influential leader during Brazilian independence, who was named guardian.[19][20] The second was Mariana de Verna, who had held the post of aia (governess) since the birth of PedroÂ II.[21] As a child, the then-Prince Imperial called her \"Dadama\", as he could not pronounce the word dama (Lady) correctly.[11] He regarded her as his surrogate mother, and would continue to call her by her nickname well into adulthood out of affection.[18][22] The third person was Rafael, an Afro-Brazilian veteran of the Cisplatine War.[21][23] He was an employee in the Palace of SÃ£o CristÃ³vÃ£o whom PedroÂ I deeply trusted and asked to look after his sonâa charge that he carried out for the rest of his life.[10][23]",
