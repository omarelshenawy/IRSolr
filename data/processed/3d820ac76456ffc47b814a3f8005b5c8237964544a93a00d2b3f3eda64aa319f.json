				"previous": "The new palace was known in Catherine's time as the HÃ´tel de la Reine and later as the HÃ´tel de Soissons. The original design was based on the Uffizi palace in Florence, but Catherine dropped that idea for a less costly plan after 1576.[10] Engravings made by IsraÃ«l Silvestre in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the HÃ´tel de la Reine possessed a central wing, a courtyard, and gardens.[72] The central wing consisted of three large pavilions with tall, pitched roofs. In the middle, two tall projections decorated with pilasters flanked an arch. The walled gardens of the hÃ´tel included an aviary, a lake with a water jet, and long avenues of trees. Catherine also installed an orangery that could be dismantled in winter.[63] The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant's death in 1582.[73] The building was demolished in the 1760s.",
				"after": "All that remains of the HÃ´tel de la Reine today is a single Doric column, known as the Colonne de l'Horoscope, which stood in the courtyard.[74] It can be seen next to the domed Bourse de Commerce. Catherine's biographer Leonie Frieda has called it \"a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power\".[75] The staircase inside leads to a platform that can hold three persons and is topped by an iron cage. A balcony is thought to have once encircled the top.[76] The purpose of the column is not clear, but it would have served as a useful observation post. Catherine's astrologers may have used it to look at the stars.[20] The column also seems to have had a memorial significance.[77] Carvings of shattered mirrors, torn love-knots, and the intertwined letters \"C\" and \"H\"âall symbols of Catherine's grief at the loss of her husbandâare embedded in the fluting.[20]",
