				"after": "RanavalonaÂ III (1861â1917) was the last sovereign of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Her reign from 1883 to 1897 was marked by ultimately futile efforts to resist the colonial designs of the government of France. She entered into a political marriage with Rainilaiarivony who, in his role as Prime Minister of Madagascar, largely oversaw the day-to-day governance of the kingdom and managed its foreign affairs. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona tried to stave off colonization by strengthening trade and diplomatic relations with the United States and Great Britain. However, French attacks ultimately led to the capture of the royal palace in 1895, ending Madagascar's autonomy. The newly installed French colonial government initially permitted Ranavalona and her court to remain as symbolic figureheads until the outbreak of a popular resistance movement led the French to send her into exile. The queen, her family and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living, but she was never permitted to return to Madagascar despite her requests. She died at her villa in Algiers at the age of 55; her remains were returned to Madagascar in 1938.",
