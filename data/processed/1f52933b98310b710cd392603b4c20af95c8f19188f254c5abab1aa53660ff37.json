				"previous": "Barnes was selected for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937â38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring New Zealanders, Barnes fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97.[16] He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127Â not out against Western Australia, but the New South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first-class status, angering Barnes.[16] He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in the final game of the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick.[17] As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 runs, averaging 50.56),[18] Barnes was selected as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938.[19]",
				"after": "Unfortunately for Barnes, he broke his wrist while exercising on the sea voyage to England for the 1938 tour,[20] keeping the injury secret until the tourists had departed Gibraltar, for fear of being sent home.[21] On arrival in England, he therefore did not play an innings until the last day of June, missing exactly half of the 30Â first-class matches scheduled for the tour, including the first two Tests, both of which were drawn. His first innings was 42 against Derbyshire and he shared in a fourthÂ wicket stand of 176 with Bill Brown, who made an unbeaten 265.[22] The third Test was a wash-out and he was not picked for the fourth, which the Australians won, although in his autobiography he claimed that he was considered as a candidate to be wicketkeeper, having deputised for Ben Barnett in that role in tour matches against Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire.[23] In the event, his Test dÃ©but came in the final Test, played at The Oval.[24] Barnes had to field for 16 hours as England amassed a total of 903Â for sevenÂ declared, then the highest Test score.[25] Barnes bowled 38Â overs in the innings and took the seventh wicket, that of Arthur Wood, for 84Â runs. With both Don Bradman and Jack Fingleton injured and unable to bat, Australia struggled â England won by an innings and 579Â runs â still the largest winning margin in Test cricket history;[26] but Barnes played innings of 41 and 33 and, according to Wisden, \"well justified his choice\".[27] In all first-class matches on the tour, Barnes scored 720Â runs, and reached 90 three times, though without going on to a first-class century. He scored 140 in a two-day match against Durham, which was not considered first-class.[28]",
