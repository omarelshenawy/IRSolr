An ancient road from Glasgow to Kilmarnock known as the Flush was the most common path and can still be seen near Neilston.[10] The major A736 road (Lochlibo Road) from Irvine to Braehead runs to the north of Neilston. The nearest motorway is the M77, of which Junction 4 at Newton Mearns is the interchange for Neilston.",
