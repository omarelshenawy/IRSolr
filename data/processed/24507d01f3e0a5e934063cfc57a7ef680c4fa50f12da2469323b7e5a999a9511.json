				"previous": "As of 2005[update], there is no consensus as to which approach to follow, whether to accept traditional paraphyletic common names or whether to use monophyletic names, either new ones or adaptations of old ones. Both approaches will be found in biological sources, often in the same work. Thus, although Benton defines \"apes\" to include humans, he also repeatedly uses \"ape-like\" to mean \"like an ape rather than a human\", and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil writes of \"claims that Orrorin ... was an ape rather than a human\".[17]",
				"after": "A list of the families of the living primates is given below, together with one possible classification into ranks between order and family.[1][15][18][19] Other classifications are also used. For example, an alternative classification of the living Strepsirrhini divides them into two infraorders, Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes.[20]",
