According to Marie Jackson, \"Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards.\"[33] As stated in the introduction to The Museum of Bad Art: Masterworks, the primary attribute of an objet d'art to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should \"[result] in a compelling image\",[34] or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an \"Oh my God\" quality.[14]",
