				"after": "The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob FriedlÃ¤nder's pioneering Meisterwerke der NiederlÃ¤ndischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts. FriedlÃ¤nder focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged FriedlÃ¤nder's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance.[215]",
