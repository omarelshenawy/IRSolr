				"previous": "While residents of Oklahoma are associated with stereotypical traits of southern hospitality â the 2006 Catalogue for Philanthropy (with data from 2004) ranks Oklahomans 7th in the nation for overall generosity[134] â the state has also been associated with a negative cultural stereotype first popularized by John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath, which described the plight of uneducated, poverty-stricken Dust Bowl-era farmers deemed \"Okies\".[135][136] However, the term is often used in a positive manner by Oklahomans.[135]",
				"after": "In the state's largest urban areas, pockets of jazz culture flourish,[138] and Native American, Mexican American, and Asian American communities produce music and art of their respective cultures.[139] The Oklahoma Mozart Festival in Bartlesville is one of the largest classical music festivals on the southern plains,[140] and Oklahoma City's Festival of the Arts has been named one of the top fine arts festivals in the nation.[138]",
