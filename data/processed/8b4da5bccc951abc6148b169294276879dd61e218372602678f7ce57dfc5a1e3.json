				"previous": "During this time, the yard built civilian ships, including the Sankaty, which was built for the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard & Nantucket Steamboat Company. Furthermore, the company created the Fore River Apprentice School, in order to ensure that an adequately-trained workforce would be able to work at the yard in the coming years. Over time, over 2,000 people were graduated from its program.[1]",
				"after": "In 1906, USSÂ New JerseyÂ (BB-16) and USSÂ Rhode IslandÂ (BB-17) were delivered by the yard, marking the yard's first battleships delivered. The completion of these two battleships and other ships at the yard coincided at a time when there were 2,500 people employed. In 1908, there were eighteen contracts employed at Fore River, which would not be met again until 1916. The yard also completed car floats for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad during this time.[1]",
