Its 269-acre (1.09Â km2) campus is centered on a 5-acre (2Â ha) \"Green\",[74] a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771.[75] Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover,[76] and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million.[77] In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns 4,500 acres (18Â km2) of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains[78] and a 27,000-acre (110Â km2) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.[79]",
				"after": "Dartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006.[80][81] Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian American colonial style,[82][83][84] a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions.[85] The College has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A- from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.[86][87]",
