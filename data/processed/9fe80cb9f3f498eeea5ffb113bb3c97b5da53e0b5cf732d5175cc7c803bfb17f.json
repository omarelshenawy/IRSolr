The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic method of computing many definite integralsâwithout performing limit processesâby finding formulas for antiderivatives. It is also a prototype solution of a differential equation. Differential equations relate an unknown function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.",
