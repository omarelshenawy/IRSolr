				"after": "Around the turn of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, retiring several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and replacing them with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s.[13] The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance Greenland Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares, and higher profits.[14] Under his replacement Finn Ãelund, GrÃ¸nlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 million loss as contractual obligations maintained unprofitable service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post Greenland relocated a lucrative mail contract to the Danish-owned Air Alpha Greenland.[15] In response, the company successfully pushed back against Greenland Home Rule's large demands, high fees, and low subsidies[15] and rebranded itself, anglicizing its name to Air Greenland and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.[16]",
