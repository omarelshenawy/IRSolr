Vrcibradic published a note on the nomenclature of the Noronha skink informed by a re-examination of Gray's original type specimens; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they were apparently the first to do so since Boulenger in 1887.[25] Based on differences in the number of scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata,[25] they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used.[24] Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences,[25] but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.[16]",
