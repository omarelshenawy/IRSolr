				"previous": "The damage caused to the North Tower destroyed any means of escape at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndÂ floor up were rendered impassable,[37] trapping 1,344Â people.[37] According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building.[38] Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building.[39] At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thÂ floor, the 22ndÂ floor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.[40]",
				"after": "Jules Naudet, a French cameraman, and Pavel Hlava, a Czech immigrant, videotaped the crash.[42][43] A webcam set up by Wolfgang Staehle at an art exhibit in Brooklyn to take images of Lower Manhattan every four seconds also captured images of FlightÂ 11 crashing into the North Tower.[44] A WNYW newscamera left rolling on the ground also captured audio of the crash and video of the immediate aftermath.",
