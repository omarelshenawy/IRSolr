Cuban macaws were described and illustrated in several early accounts about the island.[2] In 1811, Johann MatthÃ¤us Bechstein scientifically named the species Psittacus tricolor.[3] Bechstein's description was itself based on the bird's entry in FranÃ§ois Le Vaillant's 1801 book Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets.[4][5]",
