				"previous": "Usually, a single equation corresponds to a curve on the plane. This is not always the case: the trivial equation xÂ =Â x specifies the entire plane, and the equation x2Â +Â y2Â =Â 0 specifies only the single point (0,Â 0). In three dimensions, a single equation usually gives a surface, and a curve must be specified as the intersection of two surfaces (see below), or as a system of parametric equations.[16] The equation x2Â +Â y2Â =Â r2 is the equation for any circle with a radius of r.",
