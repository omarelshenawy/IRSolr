				"after": "Cabbage seedlings have a thin taproot and cordate (heart-shaped) cotyledons. The first leaves produced are ovate (egg-shaped) with a lobed petiole. Plants are 40â60Â cm (16â24Â in) tall in their first year at the mature vegetative stage, and 1.5â2.0Â m (4.9â6.6Â ft) tall when flowering in the second year.[15] Heads average between 1 and 8 pounds (0.5 and 4Â kg), with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads.[16] Most cabbages have thick, alternating leaves, with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected; some varieties have a waxy bloom on the leaves. Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow.[11] About 90 percent of the root mass is in the upper 20â30Â cm (8â12Â in) of soil; some lateral roots can penetrate up to 2Â m (6.6Â ft) deep.[15]",
