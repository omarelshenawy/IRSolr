				"previous": "In contrast to the revision of Lucas and Sobus, a 2003 paper by Chinese researchers suggested that Indricotherium and Dzungariotherium were valid genera, and that P. prohorovi did not belong in Paraceratherium. They also recognised the validity of species such as P. lipidus, P. tienshanensis, and P. sui.[21] A 2004 paper by Chinese paleontologist Tao Deng and colleagues also recognised three distinct genera.[22] Some western writers have similarly used names otherwise considered invalid since the 1989 revision, but without providing detailed analysis and justification.[3]",
				"after": "The superfamily Rhinocerotoidea, which includes modern rhinoceroses, can be traced back to the early Eoceneâabout 50 million years agoâwith early precursors such as Hyrachyus. Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; the Amynodontidae, the Rhinocerotidae (\"true rhinoceroses\"), and the Hyracodontidae. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of Paraceratherium. There were long-legged, cursorial forms adapted for running and squat, semi aquatic forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely to be preserved. The upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a pi-shaped (Ï) pattern on the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses.[23]",
