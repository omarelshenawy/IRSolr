				"previous": "By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff.[9] In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.[7]",
				"after": "In 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400Â km2 (4,400Â sqÂ mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663Â km2 (1,800Â sqÂ mi), eliminating many foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the size of Banff was fixed at 6,697Â km2 (2,586Â sqÂ mi), with the passage of the National Parks Act.[6] The Act also renamed the park as Banff National Park, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland.[10] With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84Â km2 (0.32Â sqÂ mi) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641Â km2 (2,564Â sqÂ mi).[7]",
