				"previous": "Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican bishops place a cross [+] before their name when signing a document. The dagger symbol (â ) placed after the name of a dead person (often with the date of death) is sometimes taken to be a Christian cross.[15]",
				"after": "Although Christians accepted that the cross was the gallows on which Jesus died,[16] they had already begun in the 2nd century to use it as a Christian symbol.[17] During the first three centuries of the Christian era the cross was \"a symbol of minor importance\" when compared to the prominence given to it later,[18] but by the second century it was nonetheless so closely associated with Christians that Tertullian could designate the body of Christian believers as crucis religiosi, i.e. \"devotees of the Cross\".[19] and it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.[20] Martin Luther at the time of the Reformation retained the cross and crucifix in the Lutheran Church. Luther wrote: \"The cross alone is our theology.\" He believed one knows God not through works but through suffering, the cross, and faith[need quotation to verify].[21]",
