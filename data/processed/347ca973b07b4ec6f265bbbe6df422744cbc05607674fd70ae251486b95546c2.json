				"previous": "In total, Ranjitsinhji scored 24,692 runs at an average of 56.37, the highest career average of a batsman based mainly in England until Geoffrey Boycott retired in 1986. He scored 72 hundreds.[136]",
				"after": "Despite the discovery of an assassination plot on his life, in which Ranjitsinhji was implicated,[164] Jassaji took over the administration of Nawanagar from the British in March 1903. Roland Wild later described it as \"the shattering of [Ranjitsinhji's] dreams\".[158] During the 1904 season, Ranjitsinhji had a long meeting with Lord Curzon during a Sussex match. Immediately afterwards, he chose to miss three Championship games at short notice and visited Edith Borrisow in Gilling for 10 days; Simon Wilde suggests that Ranjitsinhji had at this point chosen to leave for India after the cricket season.[165]",
