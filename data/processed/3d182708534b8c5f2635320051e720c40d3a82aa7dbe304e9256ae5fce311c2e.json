				"after": "A key feature of the F-16's cockpit is the exceptional field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360Â° all-round visibility, with a 40Â° look-down angle over the side of the aircraft, and 15Â° down over the nose (compared to the common 12â13Â° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision.[38][74] The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30Â°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13â15Â°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage.[75] Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20Â°.[38][76] Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.[77]",
