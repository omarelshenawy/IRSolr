				"previous": "The Canberra class of landing helicopter docks, based on the Spanish vessel Juan Carlos I, is composed of two ships one of which has just entered service. The class is being built by Navantia and BAE Systems Australia; and HMAS Canberra is the largest ship ever built for the Royal Australian Navy.[39] Canberra underwent sea trials in late 2013 and has been commissioned in 2014, while HMAS Adelaide is expected to enter service in 2016. The Australian version retains the ski-ramp from the Juan Carlos I design, although the RAN has not acquired carrier based fixed-wing aircraft.",
				"after": "1 CATOBAR carrier: NAe SÃ£o Paulo (A12) is a Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier currently in service with the Brazilian Navy. The SÃ£o Paulo was first commissioned in 1963 by the French Navy as the Foch and was transferred in 2000 to Brazil, where she became the new flagship of the Brazilian Navy. During the period from 2005â2010, the SÃ£o Paulo underwent extensive modernization.[40] At the end of 2010, sea trials began, and as of 2011[update] the SÃ£o Paulo had been evaluated by the CIASA (Inspection Commission and Training Advisory). She was expected to rejoin the fleet in late 2013, but suffered another major fire in 2012.[41]",
