				"previous": "After successfully testing a Ticka watch camera on a train and whilst riding a sled,[7] Neubronner began the development of a light miniature camera that could be fitted to a pigeon's breast by means of a harness and an aluminum cuirass. Using wooden camera models which weighed 30 to 75 grams (1.1 to 2.6Â oz), the pigeons were carefully trained for their load.[8] To take an aerial photograph, Neubronner carried a pigeon to a location up to about 100 kilometres (60Â mi) from its home, where it was equipped with a camera and released.[9] The bird, keen to be relieved of its burden, would typically fly home on a direct route, at a height of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330Â ft).[10] A pneumatic system in the camera controlled the time delay before a photograph was taken. To accommodate the burdened pigeon, the dovecote had a spacious, elastic landing board and a large entry hole.[8]",
				"after": "According to Neubronner, there were a dozen different models of his camera. In 1907 he had sufficient success to apply for a patent. Initially his invention \"Method of and Means for Taking Photographs of Landscapes from Above\" was rejected by the German patent office as impossible, but after presentation of authenticated photographs the patent was granted in December 1908.[11][12] (The rejection was based on a misconception about the carrying capacity of domestic pigeons.[9]) The technology became widely known through Neubronner's participation in the 1909 International Photographic Exhibition in Dresden[13] and the 1909 International Aviation Exhibition in Frankfurt. Spectators in Dresden could watch the arrival of the pigeons, and the aerial photographs they brought back were turned into postcards.[2][14] Neubronner's photographs won prizes in Dresden as well as at the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.[15]",
