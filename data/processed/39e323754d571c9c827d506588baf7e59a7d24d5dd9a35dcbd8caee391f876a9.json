The earliest example is found in the hall at Rabbath Ammon in Moab (c. 614) built by the Sassanians, where it decorates the arch molding of the blind arcades and the string courses. The pattern consists of 4 flower petals forming a square or diamond shape with central elements. The petals have the form of the pointed conical canine tooth, eye tooth or cuspid.",
