This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%â50% O 2 by volume (about 30Â kPa at standard pressure).[27] (although this figure also is subject to wide variation, depending on type of mask).",
