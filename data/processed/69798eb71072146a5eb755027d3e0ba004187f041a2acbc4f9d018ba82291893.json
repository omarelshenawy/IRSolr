The resulting article ratings are used within the project to aid in recognizing excellent contributions and identifying topics in need of further work, and are also expected to play a role in the WP:1.0 program. The assessment is done in a distributed fashion through parameters in the {{WikiProjectGuitarists}} project banner; this causes the articles to be placed in a set of categories that serves as the basis for an automatically generated worklist.",
