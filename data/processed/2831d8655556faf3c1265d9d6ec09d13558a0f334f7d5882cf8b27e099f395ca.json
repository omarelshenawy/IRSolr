				"after": "As of January 2014, homosexuality is illegal in Uganda and carries a minimum sentence of two years in prison and a maximum of life. Sodomy laws from the British colonial era are still on the books, and there is an extreme social bias against homosexuality, with the murder rate for LGBT people being significantly higher than other groups. Gays and lesbians face discrimination and harassment at the hands of the media, police, teachers, and other groups. In 2007, a Ugandan newspaper, The Red Pepper, published a list of allegedly gay men, many of whom suffered harassment as a result.[50] Also on 9 October 2010, the Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone published a front page article titled \"100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak\" that listed the names, addresses, and photographs of 100 homosexuals alongside a yellow banner that read \"Hang Them\".[51]",
