In 2009, Milan surpassed New York City, which held the title for five years, and also overcame several traditional fashion capitals, such as Paris, London and Rome. The city is noted for its fashion design, and contains major headquarters of several of the world's top fashion houses and labels, such as Armani, Gucci, Prada, Valentino, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Luxottica, Missoni and Moschino. Milan holds a fashion week twice a year, exhibiting both spring/summer and autumn/winter collections. The Via Montenapoleone is the main shopping street in the city, and is the principle road in the quadrilatero della moda, Milan's top fashion district, consisting also of the Via della Spiga, Via Sant'Andrea, Corso Venezia and Via Manzoni, and which has the boutiques/emporia of virtually every major global fashion brand.",
