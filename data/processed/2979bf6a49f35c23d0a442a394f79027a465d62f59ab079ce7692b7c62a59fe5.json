				"A topos is a category that has the following two properties:",
				"When used for foundational work a topos will be defined axiomatically; set theory is then treated as a special case of topos theory. Building from category theory, there are multiple equivalent definitions of a topos. The following has the virtue of being concise:"
			],
			"after": [
				"From finite limits and power objects one can derive that",
				"In some applications, the role of the subobject classifier is pivotal, whereas power objects are not. Thus some definitions reverse the roles of what is defined and what is derived."
