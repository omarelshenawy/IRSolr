				"after": "The latest phase of its fleet renovation, which complies with a 15-20 year plan,[8] began in July 2009, with the entry into service of two Bombardier Q200. It was followed up with a ceremony in Toronto, Ontario, on 25 January 2010, when the first next-generation Bombardier Q400, registration CS-TRD, was unveiled. The first of a series (four in all) began arriving at the end of January 2010; the second, registration CS-TRE, was received on 11 February, and the remaining planes arrived in March (registered CS-TRF and CS-TRG). The Q400 aircraft were projected for the short distance, high density markets with the archipelago and Macaronesian destinations. Its two PW150A engines, allows the planes to cruise at 667Â km/hour, while transporting 80 passengers comfortably for distances up 2500Â km, markedly within the limits of the archipelago. Further, as AntÃ³nio Gomes de Menezes (President) affirmed, the operating range of the airline allowed SATA Air AÃ§ores to expand their services in the archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira and the Canaries with the new aircraft.[9]",
