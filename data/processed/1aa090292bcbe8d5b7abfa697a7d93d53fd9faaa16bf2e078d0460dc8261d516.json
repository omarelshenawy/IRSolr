				"previous": "Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from Brown University, which has a large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the doctorate, to Santa Clara University, which offers only the M.S. in applied mathematics.[5] Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include MIT. Brigham Young University also has an Applied and Computational Emphasis (ACME), a program that allows student to graduate with a Mathematics degree, with an emphasis in Applied Maths. Students in this program also learn another skill (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Pure Math, etc) to supplement their applied maths skills.",
				"after": "Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences.",
