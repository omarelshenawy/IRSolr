				"after": "Some populations of the North American caribou, for example, many herds in the subspecies barren-ground caribou and some woodland caribou in Ungava and Labrador, migrate the farthest of any terrestrial mammal, travelling up to 5,000Â km (3,100Â mi) a year, and covering1,000,000Â km2 (390,000Â sqÂ mi).[2][46] Other North American populations, the woodland caribou (boreal) for example, are largely sedentary.[47] In Europe populations have a shorter migration. Island herds such as the subspecies R. t. pearsoniand R. t. platyrhynchus make local movements. Migrating reindeer can be negatively affected by parasite loads. Severely infected individuals are weak and probably have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels variy in populations. Infections create an effect known as culling whereby migrating animals less likely to complete the migration.[48]",
