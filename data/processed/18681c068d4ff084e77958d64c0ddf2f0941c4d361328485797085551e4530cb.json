The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge, which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length â the smoot.[91][92] The Kendall MBTA Red Line station is located on the far northeastern edge of the campus in Kendall Square. The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods.[93][94]",
