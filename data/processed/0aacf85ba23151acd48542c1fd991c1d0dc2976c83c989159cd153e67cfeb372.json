				"previous": "The natives hunted sea animals from single-passenger, covered seal-skin boats called qajaq (Inuktitut syllabics: áá­á)[69] which were extraordinarily buoyant, and could easily be righted by a seated person, even if completely overturned. Because of this property the design was copied by Europeans and Americans who still produce them under the Inuit name kayak.",
				"after": "Inuit also made umiaq (\"woman's boat\"), larger open boats made of wood frames covered with animal skins, for transporting people, goods and dogs. They were 6â12Â m (20â39Â ft) long and had a flat bottom so that the boats could come close to shore. In the winter, Inuit would also hunt sea mammals by patiently watching an aglu (breathing hole) in the ice and waiting for the air-breathing seals to use them. This technique is also used by the polar bear, who hunts by seeking holes in the ice and waiting nearby.",
