				"previous": "Chaco Culture National Historical Park is managed by the National Park Service, a federal agency within the Department of the Interior; neighboring federal lands hosting Chacoan roads are controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. In the 2002â2003 fiscal year, the park's total annual operating budget was US$1,434,000.[48] The park has a visitor center, which features the \"Chaco Collection Museum\", an information desk, a theater, a book store, and a gift shop. Prior to the 1980s, archeological excavations within current park boundaries were intensive: compound walls were dismantled or demolished, and thousands of artifacts were extracted. Starting in 1981, a new approach, informed by traditional Hopi and Pueblo beliefs, stopped such intrusions. Remote sensing, anthropological study of Indian oral traditions, and dendrochronologyâwhich left Chacoan relics undisturbedâwere touted. In this vein, the \"Chaco American Indian Consultation Committee\" was established in 1991 to give Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, and other Indian representatives a voice in park oversight.[8]",
				"after": "Current park policy mandates partial restoration of excavated sites. \"Backfilling\", or re-burying excavated sites with sand, is one such means.[8] Other measures attempt to safeguard the area's ancient ambiance and mystique: the \"Chaco Night Sky Program\", which seeks to eliminate the impact of light pollution on the park's acclaimed night skies;[49] under the program, some 14,000 visitors make use of the Chaco Observatory (inaugurated in 1998), park telescopes, and astronomy-related programs.[8] The park was named a Gold-tier Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association in 2013.[50] Chacoan relics outside the current park's boundaries have been threatened by development: an example was the proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in the San Juan Basin for surface coal mining beginning in 1983. As ample coal deposits abut the park, this strip mining threatened the web of ancient Chacoan roads. The year-long \"Chaco Roads Project\" thus documented the roads, which were later protected from mining.[51]",
