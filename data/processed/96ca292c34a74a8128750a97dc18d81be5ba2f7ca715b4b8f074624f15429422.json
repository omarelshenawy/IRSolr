				"after": "In 2008 the population of Spain officially reached 46Â million people, as recorded by the PadrÃ³n municipal (Spain's Municipal Register).[133] Spain's population density, at 91/kmÂ² (235/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal. With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, Madrid, the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain more than doubled since 1900, when it stood at 18.6 million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.[134]",
