				"previous": "Much of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually independent. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.",
				"after": "At times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of heuristic algorithms and open problems, notably CramÃ©r's conjecture.",
