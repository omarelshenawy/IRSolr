				"Enomoto died in 1908 at the age of 72. His grave is at the temple of KisshÅ-ji, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo.[4] (35Â°43â²39â³N 139Â°45â²13â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿35.727425Â°N 139.75364Â°Eï»¿ / 35.727425; 139.75364)",
				"Enomoto was especially active in promoting Japanese emigration through settler colonies in the Pacific Ocean and South and Central America. In 1891, he established â against the will of the cabinet of Matsukata Masayoshi â a \"section for emigration\" in the Foreign Ministry, with the task of encouraging emigration and finding new potential territories for Japanese settlement overseas. Two years later, after leaving the government, Enomoto also helped to establish a private organization, the \"Colonial Association\", to promote external trade and emigration."
