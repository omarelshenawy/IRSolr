				"after": "Barnum tried to milk as much publicity as possible from Jumbo's death. He called a publisher three days after the accident to suggest that a children's book be published at Christmas about the event. He also lied to journalists about Jumbo saving both the dwarf elephant and Scotty, then turning to face the train alone and head-on. Jumbo's remains were sent far and wide across America. His tusks were broken into many pieces in the accident and sold as souvenirs. Cornell University bought Jumbo's heart. The great elephant's bones toured America for a few years with the circus. They weighed 2,400 pounds (1,100Â kg).[69] Then they were sent to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. His skeleton was put on display now and then. As time passed though, people forgot who Jumbo was. The skeleton was put away, but displayed again in 1977 and 1993.[70]",
