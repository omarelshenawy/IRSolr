				"previous": "In response to developing scientific challenges to its position refusing C-123 veterans' exposure claims, on March 10, 2014 VA began revising their web pages to include reference to the submission of a special C-123 study project for the Institute of Medicine. First promised the C-123 veterans in 2012, this study directs IOM to consider medical implications of their exposures. The results were published by the IOM on 9 January 2015, solidly confirming the post-Vietnam veterans' herbicide exposures, and faulting the 2012 USAF C-123 Consultative Letter which had relied on incorrect application of a formula in determining toxicity. Under Secretary Hickey assured veterans that VA would abide by the IOM findings, and VA immediately formed a committee to address its next step as C-123 veterans are brought into the VA health care system.",
