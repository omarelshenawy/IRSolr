				"previous": "Peru is a multiethnic nation formed by the combination of different groups over five centuries. Amerindians inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before Spanish Conquest in the 16th century; according to historian Noble David Cook their population decreased from nearly 5â9Â million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of infectious diseases.[74] Spaniards and Africans arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and with indigenous peoples. After independence, there has been gradual immigration from England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.[75] Chinese and Japanese arrived in the 1850s as a replacement for slave workers and have since become a major influence in Peruvian society.[76]",
				"after": "According to a 2015 genealogical DNA testing, the average Peruvian is estimated to be 79.1% Native American, 19.8% European, and 1.1% Sub-Saharan African overall.[77]",
