				"after": "San Bernardino features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa in the Koeppen climate classification) with cool to chilly winters (frost is common during this time of the year) and hot, dry summers. Relative to other areas in Southern California, winters are colder, with frost and with chilly to cold morning temperatures common. The particularly arid climate during the summer prevents tropospheric clouds from forming, meaning temperatures rise to what is considered by NOAA scientists as Class Orange. Summer is also a lot warmer with the highest recorded summer temperature at 117Â Â°F (47.2Â Â°C) in 1971.[18] In the winter, snow flurries occur upon occasion. San Bernardino gets an average of 16 inches (406Â mm) of rain, hail, or light snow showers each year. Arrowhead Springs, San Bernardino's northernmost neighborhood, gets snow, heavily at times due to its elevation of about 3,000 feet (910Â m) above sea level.",
