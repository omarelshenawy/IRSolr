				"after": "Silicon Alley, centered in Manhattan, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high technology industries[289] involving the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, financial technology (\"fintech\"), and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. In the first nine months of 2014, Silicon Alley generated nearly US$3.9 billion in venture capital investment across a broad spectrum of high technology enterprises,[290] most based in Manhattan, with others in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in New York City and the region, bolstered by the city's position in North America as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines,[291] New York's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity.[292] Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.[293] As of 2014, New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector.[294][295]",
