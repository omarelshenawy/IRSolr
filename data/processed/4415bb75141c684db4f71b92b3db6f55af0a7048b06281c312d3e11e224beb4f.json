				"previous": "Reindeer hooves adapt to the season: in the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become sponge-like and provide extra traction. In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof, which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an activity known as \"cratering\")[31][32] through the snow to their favorite food, a lichen known as reindeer moss.",
				"after": "The females usually measure 162â205Â cm (64â81Â in) in length and weigh 80â120Â kg (180â260Â lb).[33] The males (or \"bulls\") are typically larger (although the extent to which varies in the different subspecies), measuring 180â214Â cm (71â84Â in) in length and usually weighing 159â182Â kg (351â401Â lb).[33] Exceptionally large males have weighed as much as 318Â kg (701Â lb).[33] Shoulder height typically measure from 85 to 150Â cm (33 to 59Â in), and the tail is 14 to 20Â cm (5.5 to 7.9Â in) long. The reindeer from Svalbard are the smallest. They are also relatively short-legged and may have a shoulder height of as little as 80Â cm (31Â in),[34] thereby following Allen's rule.",
