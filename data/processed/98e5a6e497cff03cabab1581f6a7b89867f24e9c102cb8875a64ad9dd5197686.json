Hegel. Professor Tom Rockmore described Hegel, for example, as a polymath and \"a modern Aristotle, perhaps the last person to know everything of value that was known during his lifetime.\"[1] Such persons are generally described as such based on their deep cognitive grasp of multiple and diverse fields of inquiry---an intellectually exceptional subset of philosophers who might also be differentiated from the multi-talented, the genius, or the \"Renaissance man\".",
