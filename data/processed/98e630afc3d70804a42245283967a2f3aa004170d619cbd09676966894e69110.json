				"previous": "Hippos mark their territory by defecation. While depositing the faeces, hippos spin their tails to distribute their excrement over a greater area.[72] \"Yawning\" serves as a threat display.[34] When fighting, male hippos use their incisors to block each other's attacks and their large canines to inflict injuries.[9]:260 When hippos become over-populated or a habitat is reduced, bulls sometimes attempt infantacide, but this behavior is not common under normal conditions.[66] Incidents of hippo cannibalism have been documented, but this is believed to be the behavior of distressed or sick hippos.[12]:82â83",
