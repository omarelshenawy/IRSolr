				"The B-17 has also been featured in artistic works expressing the physical and psychological stress of the combat conditions and the high casualty rates that crews suffered.[194][195] Works such as The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner by Randall Jarrell and Heavy Metal (film)'s section \"B-17\" depict the nature of these missions. The Ball turret itself has inspired works like Steven Spielberg's The Mission. Artists who served on the bomber units also created paintings and drawings depicting the combat conditions in World War II.[196][197]"
