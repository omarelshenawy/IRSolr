				"previous": "\"Re-inventing Radcliffe\" is the name given on a report of a proposed improvement scheme. The report envisages several initiatives, and includes the creation of new housing both to the north and south of the town. Existing industry to the west of the town and along Milltown Street would be retained and improved, along with sections of the former Radcliffe Paper Mill and Pioneer Mill. The market would be redeveloped along with the Kwik Save site and bus station, and the town could become a centre for the arts. To improve transport links, new crossings of the Irwell and canal are proposed, along with a new school to replace the two closed secondary schools. Finally, the report suggests improving the image of Radcliffe within the Bury area.[3]",
				"after": "\"Newlands\" is a regeneration programme run by the Forestry Commission.[88] One site under consideration for regeneration is the former waste tip of Radcliffe E'es.[89]",
