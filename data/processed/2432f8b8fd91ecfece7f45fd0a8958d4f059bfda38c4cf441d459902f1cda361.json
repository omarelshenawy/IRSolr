				"after": "Charles Bouleau wrote of the tension in Bruegel's compositional rhythms. The picture is divided into nine equal parts divided by a set of parallel oblique lines. These are divided by another network of lines at constant angles to the first.[33] The composition invites the reader to follow the action rather than dwell on the individual figures. The blind men resemble each other in dress and facial features,[34] and they appear as if they succeed one another in a single movement culminating in a fall,[9] beginning on the left with \"rambling, then hesitation, alarm, stumbling, and finally falling\".[34] The succession of heads follows a curve, and the further the succession, the greater the space between heads, suggesting increasing speed.[34] The steep roofs of the background houses contribute to the composition's feeling of motion.[7]",
