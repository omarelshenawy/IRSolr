Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).[143] As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships.[143][144] In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.[7]",
