				"previous": "Monaco's name comes from the 6th century BC nearby Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"Î¼ÏÎ½Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï\", \"single house\", from \"Î¼ÏÎ½Î¿Ï\" (monos) \"alone, single\"[11] + \"Î¿á¼¶ÎºÎ¿Ï\" (oikos) \"house\",[12] which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods.[13] As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos.[14][15]",
