				"after": "Autumn or Fall is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn is the period between summer and winter, usually in September (northern hemisphere) or March (southern hemisphere) when the arrival of night becomes noticeably earlier. In the northern hemisphere, the meteorological start of autumn is on September 1 and it ends on November 30; in the southern hemisphere it starts on March 1 and ends on May 31. The astronomical start of autumn is on the Autumnal Equinox (September 22â23) and ends on the Winter Solstice (December 21â22) in the northern hemisphere, and March 20 and June 21 in the southern hemisphere. Autumn starts on or around August 7 and ends on about November 6 in solar term. The word autumn comes from the Old French word autompne (automne in modern French), and was later normalized to the original Latin word autumnus. There are rare examples of its use as early as the 14th century, but it became common by the 16th century. Before the 16th century, harvest was the term usually used to refer to the season. However as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns, the word harvest lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and fall and autumn began to replace it as a reference to the season.",
