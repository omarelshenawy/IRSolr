				"previous": "Early colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy.[79] The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate their own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan. On 3 September 1939 New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Savage proclaiming, \"Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand.\"[80]",
				"after": "In 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests,[81] while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty.[82] The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War,[83] the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior,[84] disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.[85][86] Despite the USA's suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend.[87] Close political contact is maintained between the two countries, with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit, live and work in both countries without restrictions.[88] In 2013, there are about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is about 15 percent of the population of New Zealand.[89] 65,000 Australians live in New Zealand.[88]",
