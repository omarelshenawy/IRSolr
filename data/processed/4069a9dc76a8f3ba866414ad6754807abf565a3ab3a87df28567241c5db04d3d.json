When defined exclusively as written work, Ancient Egyptian literature,[43] along with Sumerian literature are considered the world's oldest literatures.[44] The primary genres of the literature of Ancient Egyptâdidactic texts, hymns and prayers, and talesâwere almost entirely written in verse;[45] while use of poetic devices is clearly recognisable, the prosody of the verse is unknown.[46]",
