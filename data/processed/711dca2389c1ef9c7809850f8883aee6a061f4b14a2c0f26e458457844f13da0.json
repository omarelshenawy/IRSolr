				"previous": "Elemental Spirits, also called Mana Spirits, are beings who govern the magic elements of the series' world, and are at the core of the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells.[53] Eight types of spirits have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena.[54] In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters' meeting with them.[54][55] In Legend of Mana, the spirits serve as factors in the Land Creation System.[56] In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple spirits of the same elemental type appear.[56][57] In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, the spirits are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3).[50][58][59] In Dawn of Mana's North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.[29]",
				"after": "Rabites, known as Rabi (ã©ã?) in the Japanese versions of the games, are cute, fictional, rabbit-like creatures appearing as a common enemy in the series since its beginning. The Rabite has become a sort of mascot for the Mana series, much the same way as the Chocobo represents Final Fantasy, and is one of its most recognizable icons.[60] The Rabite resembles a bodiless, one-toothed rabbit with large ears that curve upward and form a point at the tip, and a round, puffy pink tail that moves by hopping along the ground. It is most commonly yellow colored, but also pink, lilac, black, and white, and are variously minor enemies, \"superboss\" characters and even friendly units and pets.[19][20][61][62][63][64][65] Rabites are also mentioned in Final Fantasy X-2 with an accessory comically named \"Rabite's Foot\", which increases a character's luck statistic; as well as Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, where they appear in the description of one of the game's optional missions as an endangered species due to being poached for good luck charms.[66] Rabites have appeared prevalently in several pieces of Mana merchandise, including plush dolls, cushions, lighters, mousepads, straps, telephone cards, and T-shirts.[67]",
