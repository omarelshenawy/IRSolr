				"previous": "Later that same year, two other Ottoman armies appeared on the borders. The commander of one of the Ottoman armies was Ballaban Pasha, who, together with Jakup Bey, the commander of the second army, planned a double-flank envelopment. Skanderbeg, however, attacked Ballaban's forces at the Second Battle of Vajkal, where the Ottomans were defeated. This time, all Ottoman prisoners were slain in an act of revenge for the previous execution of Albanian captains.[114] The other Ottoman army, under the command of Jakup Bey, was also defeated some days later in Kashari field near Tirana.[114]",
				"after": "In 1466, Sultan Mehmed II personally led an army of 30,000 into Albania and laid the Second Siege of KrujÃ«, as his father had attempted 16 years earlier.[115] The town was defended by a garrison of 4,400 men, led by Prince Tanush Thopia.[115] After several months of siege, destruction and killings all over the country, Mehmed II, like his father, saw that seizing KrujÃ« was impossible for him to accomplish by force of arms. Subsequently, he left the siege to return to Constantinople.[115] However, he left the force of 30,000 men under Ballaban Pasha to maintain the siege by building a castle in central Albania, which he named Il-basan (modern Elbasan), in order to support the siege. Durazzo would be the next target of the sultan in order to be used as a strong base opposite the Italian coast.[115]",
