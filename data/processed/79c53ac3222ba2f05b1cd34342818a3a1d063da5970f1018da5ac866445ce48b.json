				"previous": "In 1828, Santa Anna, Vicente Guerrero, another early leader; Lorenzo de Zavala, and other politicians staged a coup against the elected President Manuel GÃ³mez Pedraza. He had supported the rebels as legitimate forces in the nation. On 3 December 1828, the army shelled the National Palace; the election results were annulled, and Guerrero took over as president.",
				"after": "In 1829, Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading Tampico with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the Barradas Expedition with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from yellow fever. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Annaâs popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a hero. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Motherland\". His main act of self-promotion was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West\".",
