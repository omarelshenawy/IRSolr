				"after": "Argentina has the largest railway system in Latin America, with 36,966Â km (22,970Â mi) of operating lines in 2008[update], out of a full network of almost 48,000Â km (29,826Â mi).[184] This system links all 23 provinces plus Buenos Aires City, and connects with all neighboring countries.[185] There are four incompatible gauges in use; this forces virtually all interregional freight traffic to pass through Buenos Aires.[185] The system has been in decline since the 1940s: regularly running up large budgetary deficits, by 1991 it was transporting 1,400 times less goods than it did in 1973.[185] However, in recent years the system has experienced a greater degree of investment from the state, in both commuter rail lines and long distance lines, renewing rolling stock and infrastructure.[186][187] In April 2015, by overwhelming majority the Argentine Senate passed a law which re-created Ferrocarriles Argentinos (2015), effectively re-nationalising the country's railways, a move which saw support from all major political parties on both sides of the political spectrum.[188][189][190]",
