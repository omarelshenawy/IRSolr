				"previous": "where and are constants. Then the EulerâLagrange equation holds as before in the region where x<0 or x>0, and in fact the path is a straight line there, since the refractive index is constant. At the x=0, f must be continuous, but f' may be discontinuous. After integration by parts in the separate regions and using the EulerâLagrange equations, the first variation takes the form",
				"after": "The factor multiplying is the sine of angle of the incident ray with the x axis, and the factor multiplying is the sine of angle of the refracted ray with the x axis. Snell's law for refraction requires that these terms be equal. As this calculation demonstrates, Snell's law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of the optical path length.",
