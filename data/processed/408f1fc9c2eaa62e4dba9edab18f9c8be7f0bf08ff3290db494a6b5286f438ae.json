				"after": "The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an elevation of 2,000â3,000Â m (6,600â9,800Â ft), is dominated by MÄmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and Naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as mÄmaneânaio forest. MÄmane seeds and Naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the Palila (Loxioides bailleui). The Palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and HualÄlai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Keaâonly 10% of its former rangeâand has been declared critically endangered.[51]",
