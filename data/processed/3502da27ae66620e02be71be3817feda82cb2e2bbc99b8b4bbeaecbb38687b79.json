At 110,567 sq mi (286,367 km2), Nevada is the seventh-largest state, and includes parts of the Mojave Desert in the south and Great Basin in the north. Nevada is the \"Silver State\" due to rich deposits of silver discovered and mined there. In 1864, Nevada became the 36th state to enter the union, and the phrase \"Battle Born\" on the state flag reflects the state's entry on the Union side during the American Civil War. Its first historical settlement was Mormon Station.",
