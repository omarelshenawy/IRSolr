				"previous": "Business class is offered on all Qantas mainline passenger aircraft.",
				"after": "International Business Class is available on the BoeingÂ 747, International Airbus A330-200s, the A330-300 and the AirbusÂ A380. On the BoeingÂ 747, seating is in a 2-3-2 configuration on the main deck and a 2â2 configuration on the upper deck. The A330 features a 2-2-2 configuration. There are two versions of what Qantas call its \"Skybed\": the lie flat business class seat. Older versions of the lie-flat Skybeds feature 150Â cm (60Â in) of seat pitch and 55Â cm (21Â 1â2Â in) width, however passengers sleep at a distinct slope to the cabin floor. Later versions of the Skybed have an 200Â cm (80Â in) pitch, and lie fully horizontal.[117] By 2015, the business class of its entire fleet of Airbus A330 aircraft will be fitted with lie flat seats.[118]",
