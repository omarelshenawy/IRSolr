				"Lower Saxony lies in north-western Germany and is the country's second largest federal state. It is named after a historical province that emerged during the Middle Ages; its capital is Hanover.",
				"Much of northern Lower Saxony is a vast lowland of heath and bog, part of the North German Plain. It includes the LÃ¼neburg Heath - an expanse of heather, bracken, pine, bog and fields interspersed with small towns and villages - that gained its wealth, historically, from the salt trade centred on LÃ¼neburg, but was also the site of the surrender of North Germany at the end of the Second World War. Today, much of the area is a nature park, but retains its military connexions, being home to the largest military training area in Europe. To the northwest were once great marshes by the North Sea, but these have largely been reclaimed and are famous for cattle and horse rearing. Off the North Sea coast is a string of islands, popular with holidaymakers, known as the East Frisians."
