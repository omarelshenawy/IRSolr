				"after": "The red-winged fairywren occurs in the wetter, southwest corner of Western Australia, from Moore River north of Perth south through to the Margaret River region and east to Albany.[3] It is common in parts of its range,[29] though there is some evidence of decline from draining of swampland.[30][31] It lives in the understorey of karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata). Older forests appear to be less favourable habitats, while birds appear to be attracted to disturbed areas after logging.[32] Fire also results in populations disappearing, returning after a period of two years.[33] Forestry plantations of pine (Pinus spp.) and eucalypts are generally unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.[34]",
