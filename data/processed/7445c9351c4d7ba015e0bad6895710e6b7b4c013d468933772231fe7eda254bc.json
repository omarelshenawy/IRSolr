Examples of algebraic integers are 5 + 13â2, 2 â 6i, and 1â2(1 + iâ3). Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper superset of the integers, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials x â k for all k â Z. In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what integers are to rational numbers.",
