				"after": "The 19th century saw more radical change in Shapinsay. Thomas Balfour's grandson, David Balfour, transformed the island after inheriting the family estate, which by 1846 encompassed the whole of Shapinsay. Most of the land was divided into fields of 4 hectares (10 acres),[13] a feature that is still apparent today.[5] Tenants were required to enclose and drain the land or pay for the estate to do it in the form of a surcharge added to their rents. In 1846, 303 hectares (1.17Â sqÂ mi) on Shapinsay consisted of arable land. By 1860, that had trebled to more than 890.3 hectares (3.44Â sqÂ mi).[13] New crops and breeds of cattle and sheep were also introduced.[10] Balfour's reforms were described as \"the fountain and source of Orkney Improvement.\"[11]",
