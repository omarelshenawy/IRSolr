				"previous": "The 1890s were Cassatt's busiest and most creative time. She had matured considerably and became more diplomatic and less blunt in her opinions. She also became a role model for young American artists who sought her advice. Among them was Lucy A. Bacon, whom Cassatt introduced to Camille Pissarro. Though the Impressionist group disbanded, Cassatt still had contact with some of the members, including Renoir, Monet, and Pissarro.[59]",
				"after": "In 1891, she exhibited a series of highly original colored drypoint and aquatint prints, including Woman Bathing and The Coiffure, inspired by the Japanese masters shown in Paris the year before. (See Japonism) Cassatt was attracted to the simplicity and clarity of Japanese design, and the skillful use of blocks of color. In her interpretation, she used primarily light, delicate pastel colors and avoided black (a \"forbidden\" color among the Impressionists). Adelyn D. Breeskin, Cassatt's most noted historian and the author of two catalogue raisonnÃ©s of her work, notes that these colored prints, \"now stand as her most original contribution... adding a new chapter to the history of graphic arts...technically, as color prints, they have never been surpassed\".[60]",
