				"previous": "The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted,[46] while LÃ©on Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \"direct citation\" of Ingres' portrait.[47]",
				"after": "Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein.[24] Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humourous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\".[46] Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \"massive, monumental presence\".[48] In 1907 the Swiss artist FÃ©lix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait,[46] prompting Ãdouard Vuillard to exclaim, \"That's Madame Bertin!\"[49]",
