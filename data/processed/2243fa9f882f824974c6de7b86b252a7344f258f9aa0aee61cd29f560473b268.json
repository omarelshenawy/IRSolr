				"previous": "In late 2004, Northrop Grumman proposed a YF-23-based bomber to meet a USAF need for an interim bomber, for which the FB-22 and B-1R were also competing.[38] Northrop modified aircraft PAV-2 to serve as a display model for its proposed interim bomber.[30] The possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which favored a long-range bomber with a much greater range.[39][40] The USAF has since begun the Next-Generation Bomber program.[41]",
				"after": "Both YF-23 airframes remained in storage until mid-1996, when the aircraft were transferred to museums.[37]",
