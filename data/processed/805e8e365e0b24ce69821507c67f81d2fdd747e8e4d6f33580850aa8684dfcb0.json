				"previous": "The medieval history of Tiruchirappalli begins with the reign of the Pallava king Mahendravarman I, who ruled over South India in the 6th century AD and constructed the rock-cut cave-temples within the Rockfort.[18][19][20] Following the downfall of the Pallavas in the 8th century, the city was conquered by the Medieval Cholas, who ruled until the 13th century.[21]",
				"after": "After the decline of the Cholas, Tiruchirappalli was conquered by the Pandyas,[22] who ruled from 1216 until their defeat in 1311 by Malik Kafur, the commander of Allauddin Khilji.[23][24] The victorious armies of the Delhi Sultanate are believed to have plundered and ravaged the region.[23][24][25] The idol of the Hindu god Ranganatha in the temple of Srirangam vanished at about this time and was not recovered and reinstated for more than fifty years.[24][25] Tiruchirappalli was ruled by the Delhi and Madurai sultanates from 1311 to 1378,[26] but by the middle of the 14th century the Madurai Sultanate had begun to fall apart.[27] Gradually, the Vijayanagar Empire established supremacy over the northern parts of the kingdom, and Tiruchirappalli was taken by the Vijayanagar prince Kumara Kampanna Udaiyar in 1371.[28] The Vijayanagar Empire ruled the region from 1378 until the 1530s, and played a prominent role in reviving Hinduism by reconstructing temples and monuments destroyed by the previous Muslim rulers.[29] Following the collapse of the Vijayanagar Empire in the early part of the 16th century, the Madurai Nayak kingdom began to assert its independence.[30][31][32] The city flourished during the reign of Vishwanatha Nayak (c. 1529â1564), who is said to have protected the area by constructing the Teppakulam and building walls around the Srirangam temple.[33][34] His successor Kumara Krishnappa Nayaka made Tiruchirappalli his capital,[34] and it served as the capital of the Madurai Nayak kingdom from 1616 to 1634 and from 1665 to 1736.[35][36][37]",
