It was added in 1990 and has 22 nozzles shooting water 12 feet (3.7Â m) into the air in a plaza that also has slabs of stone with information about Oregon's history. Added in 1985, the Capitol Beaver family represents the state animal. Additional features of the grounds include a peace pole donated by the Society of Prayer for World Peace, a large boulder that once lay along the Oregon Trail, a planter that spells out \"Oregon\" using shrubs, and a rose garden maintained by the Salem Rose Society.[38]",
