				"previous": "A newer innovation by Zodiac Seats U.S. (formerly Weber Aircraft LLC) is an articulating seat bottom, where the seat bottom moves forward in addition to the seat back tilting backwards.[4] Examples of airlines that have introduced such seats to some of their aircraft include Aer Lingus, Delta Air Lines, Emirates[citation needed], American Airlines, and Avianca. This feature was eventually adopted by competitors such as B/E Aerospace and Recaro.",
