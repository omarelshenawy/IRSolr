				"previous": "Although the rink was budgeted for $5 million, it was constructed for only $3.2 million ($4.3 million today), making it one of the few Millennium Park attractions to cost less than was initially budgeted.[13] The rink was funded by and named for the McCormick Tribune Foundation,[3] which was established by former Chicago Tribune owner and publisher Robert R. McCormick. The McCormick Tribune Foundation is a supporter of the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum and the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, both of which are also located in Chicago.[14][15]",
				"after": "McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink was the first feature in Millennium Park to open. Its grand opening was celebrated on December 20, 2001,[16] a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage. Mayor Daley, McCormick Tribune Foundation Chairman of the Board John W. Madigan, Millennium Park private donor group chief John Bryan, actress Bonnie Hunt and other local celebrities attended the event.[2] The new ice rink was seen as a replacement for \"Skate on State\", a public skating rink on State Street in the Loop[17][18] which closed in 2001.[19]",
