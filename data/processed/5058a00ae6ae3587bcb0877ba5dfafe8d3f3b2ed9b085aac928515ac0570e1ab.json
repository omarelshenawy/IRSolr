				"previous": "Initial releases into Florida failed. Attempted introductions before 1936 and 1944, made with the objective of controlling sugarcane pests, were unsuccessful as the toads failed to proliferate. Later attempts failed in the same way.[101][102] However, the toad gained a foothold in the state after an accidental release by an importer at Miami International Airport in 1957, and deliberate releases by animal dealers in 1963 and 1964 established the toad in other parts of Florida.[102][103] Today, the cane toad is well established in the state, from the Keys to north of Tampa, and they are gradually extending further northward.[104] In Florida, the toad is a regarded as a threat to both native species [105] and to pets,[106] so much so, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recommends residents kill them.[107]",
				"after": "Around 150 cane toads were introduced to Oahu in Hawaii in 1932, and the population swelled to 105,517 after 17Â months.[61] The toads were sent to the other islands, and more than 100,000 toads were distributed by July 1934;[108] eventually over 600,000 were transported.[109]",
