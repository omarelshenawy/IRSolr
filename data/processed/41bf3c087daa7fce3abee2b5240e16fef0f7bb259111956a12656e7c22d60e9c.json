				"after": "In January 2001, Air Canada acquired Canada's second largest air carrier, Canadian Airlines, merging the latter's operations, becoming the world's twelfth-largest airline in the first decade of the 21st century.[9] As Air Canada gained access to their former rival's financial statements, officials learned that the carrier was in worse financial shape than was previously believed.[14] An expedited merger strategy was pursued, but in summer 2000 integration efforts led to flight delays, luggage problems and other frustrations.[14] However, service improved following Air Canada officials' pledge to do so by January 2001.[14] The airline was confronted by the global aviation market downturn and increased competition, posting back-to-back losses in 2001 and 2002.[14]",
