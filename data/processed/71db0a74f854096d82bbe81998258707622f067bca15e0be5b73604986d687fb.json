				"after": "Katanas are traditionally made from a specialized Japanese steel called tamahagane,[24] which is created from a traditional smelting process that results in several, layered steels with different carbon concentrations.[25] This process helps remove impurities and even out the carbon content of the steel. The smith begins by folding and welding pieces of high and low carbon steel several times to work out most of the impurities. The resulting block of steel is then drawn out to form a billet.",
