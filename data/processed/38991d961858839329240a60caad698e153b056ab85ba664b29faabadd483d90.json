				"after": "Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke (May 25, 1848âJune 18, 1916), also known as Moltke the Younger, was a nephew of Field Marshal Count Moltke and served as the Chief of the German General Staff from 1906 to 1914. His role in the development of German war plans and the instigation of the First World War is extremely controversial. As Chief of the General Staff Moltke was responsible for the development and execution of the strategic plans of the German Army. There is considerable debate over the nature of his plans. Critics from the so-called \"Schlieffen School\" argue that Moltke took his predecessor's plan (the \"Schlieffen Plan\"), modified it without understanding it, and failed to execute it properly during the First World War, thus dooming German efforts.",
