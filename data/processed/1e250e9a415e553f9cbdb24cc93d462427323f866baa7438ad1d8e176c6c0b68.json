				"after": "Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to Patagonia, the southernmost region in South America, had been causing tension between the two countries since the 1840s.[1] Both countries were incapable of enforcing these claims with a seaborne force, though: in 1860, the Chileans had only five small vessels, while the Argentine Navy had no seagoing ships.[2] These attitudes quickly changed when the circumstances warranted; when Chile joined Peru against Spain in the Chincha Islands War, the Spaniards blockaded and bombarded ValparaÃ­so, leading the Chilean government to strengthen the navy. The Argentine government, under President Domingo Sarmiento, decided to build a navy in the 1870s to counter Brazilian naval acquisitions. Two large monitors, Los Andes and La Plata, were ordered from Laird Brothers, a British company, along with two gunboats. They were delivered in 1874 and 1875.[3]",
