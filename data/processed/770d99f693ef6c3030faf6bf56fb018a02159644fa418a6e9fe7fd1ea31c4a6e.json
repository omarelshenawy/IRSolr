				"after": "Note that the characteristic equation for a rotation is a quadratic equation with discriminant , which is a negative number whenever is not an integer multiple of 180Â°. Therefore, except for these special cases, the two eigenvalues are complex numbers, ; and all eigenvectors have non-real entries. Indeed, except for those special cases, a rotation changes the direction of every nonzero vector in the plane.",
