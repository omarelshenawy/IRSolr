New technologies to be introduced include composite aerostructures, more electrical systems (reduction of hydraulic systems), and more fuel-efficient turbofan engines (such as the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G Geared Turbofan, General Electric GEnx, the CFM International LEAP56, and the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000). The term \"Yellowstone\" refers to the technologies, while \"Y1\" through \"Y3\" refer to the actual aircraft.[1]",
