				"after": "On 5 March 2007, the European Commission banned all but nine planes of the PIA 42-plane fleet from flying to Europe citing safety concerns of its aging fleet. The ban was imposed following an on-site visit led by Federico Grandini, European Commissionâs Air Safety Administrator.[18][19] The remaining seven, namely the fleet of Boeing 777s, was exempted from the ban.[20] PIA claimed that the ban was discriminatory and unjustifiable. On 26 March 2007, Tariq Saeed Kirmani was forced to resign after pressure from higher authorities because of the EU ban[citation needed]. Zafar Khan was appointed as the new chairman of Pakistan International Airlines.",
