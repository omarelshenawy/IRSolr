				"previous": "The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo â Chiyoda, ChÅ«Å and Minato â are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[47] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies, and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[48] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also located in Chiyoda.",
			"after": [
				"To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan.",
				"While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of these also have a local commercial and industrial base. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama Area or Western Tokyo."
