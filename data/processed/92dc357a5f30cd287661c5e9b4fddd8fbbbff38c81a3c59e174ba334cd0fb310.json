				"after": "This rockfowl measures around 38 to 41Â cm (15 to 16Â in) in length, with its notably long tail contributing about 18Â cm (7.1Â in).[12] Adult rockfowl show little sexual dimorphism in plumage and the sexes cannot be told apart by appearance.[13] On the adult, the head, excluding the chin and throat, is completely bare of feathers except for a thin layer of fuzz on the forehead.[13] The head's skin is bright yellow except for two large, circular patches of black skin located just behind the eye and containing the ear; only a thin, 2Â mm (0.079Â in) wide patch of yellow skin on the crown prevents the two black patches from connecting.[13] The black patch has a raised edge and appears to be a distinct part of the face.[13] The eyelid and eyering are a thin line of black surrounding the bird's large, dark brown eyes.[13] The beak is robust, disproportionately large, and black.[7][14] This beak can be considered crow-like, is noticeably decurved in the upper mandible, and is about 30Â mm (1.2Â in) long.[11][15] The bird's chin and throat are covered in a thin layer of white feathers, and the neck is long and slender.[2][13] The nape is also covered in white feathers, while the hindneck is nearly bare, revealing the orange-yellow skin. The upper mantle is a solid black, merging into a greyish-black lower mantle.[13] The rockfowl's thighs are very muscular and aid its partially terrestrial lifestyle.[2] The back, rump, and undertail are a bluish grey, while the tail is a dark brown and tented in shape. The moderately-sized wings are also a dark brown.[11][13] The underparts are a creamy white and appear their creamiest in the upper breast.[13] In dim light the white-necked rockfowl can appear to be solely black above and white below.[12] The legs are blue and relatively long.[7][13] Overall the plumage appears to be smooth with long feathers.[13] The adult weighs 200 to 250Â g (7.1 to 8.8Â oz).[11]",
