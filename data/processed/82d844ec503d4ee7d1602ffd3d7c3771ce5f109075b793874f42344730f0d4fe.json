The Old English castel, Old French castel or chastel, French chÃ¢teau, Spanish castillo, Italian castello, and a number of words in other languages also derive from castellum.[1] The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to denote this type of building, which was then new to England.[2]",
