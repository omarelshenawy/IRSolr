				"previous": "With the rise of Renaissance humanism and moral relativism, the knightâand chivalry along with himâlost much of his relevance to society, and the idealism of chivalric romance was fundamentally rejected in NiccolÃ² Machiavelli's Il Principe (1532) and more directly derided in Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote (1605â1615). The medieval literary genre of chivalric romance had been the high-water mark of idealism and romanticism in literature, but in the 16th century Machiavelli instructed aspiring political rulers to be ruthlessly pragmatic and to apply the principle that the ends justify the means, directly counter to the high-flown idealism of late medieval chivalry. Later, the high-flown values of chivalric romance were heavily satirized in Cervantes's Don Quixote, which portrayed the charmingly idealistic protagonist as a lovable but hopelessly delusional imbecile.",
