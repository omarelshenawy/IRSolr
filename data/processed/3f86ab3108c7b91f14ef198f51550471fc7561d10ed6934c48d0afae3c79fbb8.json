				"after": "During the auditing process, the auditor may collect personal information from the person being audited.[326] Auditing records are referred to within Scientology as preclear folders.[327] The Church of Scientology has strict codes designed to protect the confidentiality of the information contained in these folders.[326] However, people leaving Scientology know that the Church is in possession of very personal information about them, and that the Church has a history of attacking and psychologically abusing those who leave it and become critics.[327] On December 16, 1969, a Guardian's Office order (G. O. 121669) by Mary Sue Hubbard authorized the use of auditing records for purposes of \"internal security.\"[328] Some former members have said that while they were still in the Church, they combed through information obtained in auditing sessions to see if it could be used for smear campaigns against critics.[329][330]",
