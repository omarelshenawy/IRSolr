In 1638, the college became home for North America's first known printing press, carried by the ship John of London.[26][27] In 1639, the college was renamed Harvard College after deceased clergyman John Harvard, who was an alumnus of the University of Cambridge. He had left the school Â£779 and his library of some 400 books.[28] The charter creating the Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.",
