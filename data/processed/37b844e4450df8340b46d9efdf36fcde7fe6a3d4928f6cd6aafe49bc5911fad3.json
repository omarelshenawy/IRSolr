				"Almost half of all journeys in the metropolitan area are made on public transport, a very high proportion compared with most European cities.[71]:62â4"

				"after": "In terms of longer-distance transport, Madrid is the central node of the system of autovÃ­as, giving the city direct fast road links with most parts of Spain and with France and Portugal. It is also the focal point of one of the world's three largest high-speed rail systems, Alta Velocidad EspaÃ±ola (AVE), which has brought major cities such as Seville and Barcelona within 2.5 hours travel time. There are now 2,900Â km of AVE track, connecting Madrid with 17 provincial capitals, and further lines are under construction.[71]:72â75",
