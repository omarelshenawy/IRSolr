It usually grows as an erect tree up to 10 metres (33Â ft) in height, but some populations along the south coast consist of small trees or even spreading shrubs.[1] It is generally a 5 metres (16Â ft) high small tree in the Margaret River region.[2] The leaves arising from many short branchlets make a dense foliage close to the trunk and branches.[3]",
