				"after": "Ingres was by nature self-critical and consumed with doubt. He often took months to complete a portrait,[12] leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive,[13] three of them signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. Completed during \"innumerable sittings\", the sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form. They are similar in size; around 35Â cm (14Â in) wide.[14]",
