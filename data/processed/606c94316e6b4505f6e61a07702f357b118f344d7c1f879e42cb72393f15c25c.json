				"after": "The taxonomic history of Plateosaurus is \"long and confusing\", a \"chaotic tangle of names\".[R] As of 2011, only two species are universally accepted as valid:[3][16] the type species P.Â engelhardti and P.Â gracilis, previously assigned to its own genus Sellosaurus. British palaeontologist Peter Galton showed clearly that all cranial material from Trossingen, Halberstadt and Frick pertains to one species.[8] Moser performed the most extensive and detailed investigation of all plateosaurid material from Germany and Switzerland, concluding that all Plateosaurus and most other prosauropod material from the Keuper stems from the same species as the type material of Plateosaurus engelhardti.[3] Moser considered Sellosaurus to be the same genus as Plateosaurus, but did not discuss whether S.Â gracilis and P.Â engelhardti belong to the same species.[S] Palaeontologist Adam Yates of the University of the Witwatersrand cast further doubt on the generic separation. He included the type material of Sellosaurus gracilis in Plateosaurus as P.Â gracilis and reintroduced the old name Efraasia for some material that had been assigned to Sellosaurus.[16] In 1926, von Huene had already concluded the two genera were the same.[T]",
