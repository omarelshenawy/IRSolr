				"after": "The word textile is from Latin texere which means \"to weave\", \"to braid\" or \"to construct\". The simplest textile art is felting, in which animal fibers are matted together using heat and moisture. Most textile arts begin with twisting or spinning and plying fibers to make yarn (called thread when it is very fine and rope when it is very heavy). Yarn can then be knotted, looped, braided, or woven to make flexible fabric or cloth, and cloth can be used to make clothing and soft furnishings. All of these items â felt, yarn, fabric, and finished objects â are referred to as textiles.",
