				"after": "The park's kiddieland area, Raccoon Lagoon, was added in 1989, after originally opening in a different location in 1954. The 9-acre (3.6Â ha) area devoted to children-oriented rides is one of the largest in the United States.[23] Also in Raccoon Lagoon was Mister Rogers' Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Built in 1989, the trolley ride was designed specifically for Idlewild by local native Fred Rogers and is based on his popular children's television show.[13] Prior to the 2014 season it was announced that the ride would be re-themed in coordination with the Fred Rogers Company to their modern children's show, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, based on the original series.",
