				"previous": "The F-22 can also carry air-to-surface weapons such as bombs with Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance and the Small-Diameter Bomb, but cannot self-designate for laser-guided weapons.[140] Internal air-to-surface ordnance is limited to 2,000Â lb.[141] An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20Â mm cannon is embedded in the right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door to maintain stealth.[142] The radar projection of the cannon fire's path is displayed on the pilot's head-up display.[143]",
				"after": "The F-22's high cruise speed and altitude increase the effective ranges of its munitions, it has 50% greater employment range for the AIM-120 AMRAAM than prior platforms, and range will be further extended with the introduction of the AIM-120D.[112] While specifics are classified, it is expected that JDAMs employed by F-22s will have twice or more the effective range of legacy platforms.[144] In testing, an F-22 dropped a GBU-32 JDAM from 50,000 feet (15,000Â m) while cruising at Mach 1.5, striking a moving target 24 miles (39Â km) away.[145]",
