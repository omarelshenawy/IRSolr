				"previous": "In an early written history of Mackinac Island (1887) by Andrew Blackbird, an official interpreter for the U.S. government and an Ottawa chief's son, he describes that a small independent tribe called \"Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go\" once occupied Mackinac Island. They became confederated with the Ottawa from Ottawa Island (now Manitoulin Island) situated north of Lake Huron. One winter the Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go on Mackinac Island were almost entirely annihilated by the Seneca people from New York, who were part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Only two of the local natives escaped by hiding in one of the natural caves at the island. To commemorate the losses of this allied tribe, the Ottawa and Chippewa named what is now Mackinac Island, as \"Mi-shi-ne-macki-nong.\" [37] In 1895 Fort Mackinac's John R. Bailey, M. D. published his history, entitled Mackinac formerly Michilimackinac, describing some of the first recorded presence on Mackinac of French traders. They arrived in 1654 with a large party of Huron and Ottawa heading to Three Rivers; another visitor was an adventurer making a canoe voyage in 1665.[1]",
				"after": "Mackinac Island was formed as the glaciers of the last ice age began to melt around 13,000Â BC. The bedrock strata that underlie the island are much older, dating to Late Silurian and Early Devonian time, about 400 to 420 million years ago. Subsurface deposits of halite (rock salt) dissolved, allowing the collapse of overlying limestones; these once-broken but now solidified rocks comprise the Mackinac Breccia.",
