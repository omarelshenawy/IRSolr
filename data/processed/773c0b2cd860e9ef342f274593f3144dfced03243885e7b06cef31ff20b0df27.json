				"previous": "On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee, stating that she intended to complete the memorial and offering to select 35 names from Watts's list of names and to raise the Â£62 (about Â£6,000 as of 2015) necessary to finance the completion of the first two rows of tablets.[36][50] Mary Watts selected eleven names to complete the first row, and DeÂ Morgan provided the tiles in October 1905.[51] Unfortunately, five of the tiles were damaged during shipping and needed to be replaced.[51]",
				"after": "Henry Gamble and Mary Watts also commissioned a memorial plaque from T. H. Wren, a student of the school of arts and crafts established by Watts in Compton. The relief plaque depicts Watts holding a scroll marked \"Heroes\", and is captioned \"The utmost for the highest\" and \"In memorial of George Frederic Watts, who desiring to honour heroic self-sacrifice placed these records here\".[51] Eventually, on 13Â December 1905, the eleven tiles and Wren's memorial to Watts, placed in the centre of the monument, were unveiled by Arthur Winnington-Ingram, Bishop of London, completing the first row of tiles.[52]",
