The lower canines and lower incisors are enlarged, especially in males, and grow continuously. The incisors can reach 40Â cm (1.3Â ft), while the canines reach up to 50Â cm (1.6Â ft).[34] The canines and incisors are used for combat and play no role in feeding. Hippos rely on their broad horny lips to grasp and pull grasses which are then ground by the molars.[9]:259, 263 The hippo is considered to be a pseudoruminant; it has a complex three- or four-chambered stomach but does not \"chew cud\".[12]:22",
