				"after": "Maltese cuisine shows strong Sicilian and English influences as well as influences of Spanish, Maghrebin and ProvenÃ§al cuisines. A number of regional variations, particularly with regards to Gozo, can be noted as well as seasonal variations associated with the seasonal availability of produce and Christian feasts (such as Lent, Easter and Christmas). Food has been important historically in the development of a national identity in particular the traditional fenkata (i.e. the eating of stewed or fried rabbit).",
