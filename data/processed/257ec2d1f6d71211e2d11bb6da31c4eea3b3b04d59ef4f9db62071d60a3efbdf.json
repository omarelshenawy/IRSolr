The vowel /ÉÉ/ (as in \"door\", \"boar\") had largely merged with /ÉË/ by the Second World War, and the vowel /ÊÉ/ (as in \"poor\", \"tour\") has more recently merged with /ÉË/ as well among most speakers,[61] although the sound /ÊÉ/ is still found in conservative speakers (and this is still the only pronunciation given in the OED). See poorâpour merger. The remaining two centring glides /ÉªÉ/ /eÉ/ are increasingly pronounced as long monophthongs [ÉªË] [ÉË], although without merging with any existing vowels.[46]",
