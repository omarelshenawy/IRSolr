Its population grew by 17.64% during 2001â2011,[240] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991â2001).[240] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[8] The median age was 24.9 in the 2001 census.[195] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361.1 million people.[241] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[242] India continues to face several public health-related challenges.[243][244]",
