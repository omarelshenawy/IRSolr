				"after": "The Office was filmed with a single-camera setup in a cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© style simulating the look of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track, allowing for its \"deadpan\" and \"absurd\" humor to fully come across.[44] The primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film Dunder Mifflin and its employees, seemingly around the clock.[44] The presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters, especially Michael Scott, who enthusiastically participates in the filming.[45] The characters, especially Jim and Pam, also look towards the camera when Michael creates an awkward situation.[26] The main action of the show is supplemented with talking-head interviews or \"confessionals\", with the characters speaking one on one with the camera crew about the day's events.[26]",
