				"previous": "At the start of the 21st century, the layout of the lake was significantly altered for the first time since its construction, through the Kingston Foreshores Redevelopment on southern shore of the East Basin, which was planned in 1997.[86] A bidding process was enacted,[87] multi-million dollar luxury apartment complexes were built in the suburb of Kingston,[88] driving property values to record-breaking levels.[86] After a dispute over the environmental impact of the development, building works commenced on the previously industrial lakeside area of the suburb.[89][90] In 2007, work started to reclaim land from the lakebed to form a harbour, which is expected to turn the area into an entertainment hub.[86]",
				"after": "The Kingston Powerhouse, which used to provide the city's power supply, was converted into the Canberra Glassworks in 2007, 50 years after the electricity generators stopped.[91] A 22-metre (72Â ft) high tower of glass and light named Touching Lightly, will be built at Kingston after being approved by the government in April 2009. An environmentally friendly structure, it is expected to be completed in mid-2009.[92]",
