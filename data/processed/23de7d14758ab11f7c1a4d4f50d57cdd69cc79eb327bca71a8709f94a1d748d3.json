				"after": "The Columbia Slough flows roughly parallel to and about 0.4 to 1.7 miles (0.6 to 2.7Â km) south of the Columbia River in Multnomah County.[10] It begins at Fairview Lake in the city of Fairview and immediately enters the city of Gresham. Less than 1 mile (1.6Â km) later, it enters the city of Portland and continues generally westward for about another 18 miles (29Â km) to its confluence with the Willamette River.[10] Throughout its course, the slough is nearly level, 10 feet (3.0Â m) above sea level at the source and 9 feet (2.7Â m) at the mouth.[1][2] Semidiurnal tides cause reverse currents on the lower 8.5 miles (13.7Â km) of the slough.[11]",
