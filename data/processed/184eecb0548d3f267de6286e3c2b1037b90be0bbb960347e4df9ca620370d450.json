				"previous": "There are a total of four weapons stations between the two internal bays. Two of these can carry air-to-surface missiles up to 2,000Â lb (910Â kg) in A and C models, or two bombs up to 1,000Â lb (450Â kg) in the B model; the other two stations are for smaller weapons such as air-to-air missiles.[261][262] The weapon bays can carry AIM-120 AMRAAM, AIM-132 ASRAAM, the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Paveway series of bombs, the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), Brimstone anti-tank missiles, and cluster munitions (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser).[261] An air-to-air missile load of eight AIM-120s and two AIM-9s is possible using internal and external weapons stations; a configuration of six 2,000Â lb (910Â kg) bombs, two AIM-120s and two AIM-9s can also be arranged.[261][263] The Terma A/S multi-mission pod (MMP) could be used for different equipment and purposes, such as electronic warfare, aerial reconnaissance, or rear-facing tactical radar.[264][258]",
				"after": "Lockheed Martin states that the weapons load can be configured as all-air-to-ground or all-air-to-air, and has suggested that a Block 5 version will carry three weapons per bay instead of two, replacing the heavy bomb with two smaller weapons such as AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles.[265] Upgrades are to allow each weapons bay to carry four GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) for A and C models, or three in F-35B.[266] Another option is four GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb IIs in each bay on all F-35 variants.[267] The F-35A has been outfitted with four SDB II bombs and an AMRAAM missile to test adequate bay door clearance,[268] as well as the C-model, but the VTOL F-35B will not be able to carry the required load of four SDB IIs in each weapons bay upon reaching IOC due to weight and dimension constraints; F-35B bay changes are to be incorporated to increase SDB II loadout around 2022 in line with the Block 4 weapons suite.[269] The Meteor (missile) air-to-air missile may be adapted for the F-35, a modified Meteor with smaller tailfins for the F-35 was revealed in September 2010; plans call for the carriage of four Meteors internally.[270] The United Kingdom planned to use up to four AIM-132 ASRAAM missiles internally, later plans call for the carriage of two internal and two external ASRAAMs.[271] The external ASRAAMs are planned to be carried on \"stealthy\" pylons; the missile allows attacks to slightly beyond visual range without employing radar.[259][272]",
