				"Terminals 1 and 2 are linked by a public walkway that takes about 10â15 minutes to traverse. Shuttle buses connect all three terminals.",
				"Terminal 2 opened on 1 November 1999, with a floor area of 336,000Â m2 (3,620,000Â sqÂ ft).[10] This terminal was used to replace Terminal 1 while the latter was undergoing renovation, cramping all airlines into this terminal despite it being far bigger than Terminal 1 and it can handle twenty aircraft at docks connecting directly to the terminal building. Prior to the opening of Terminal 3, all international flights (and the majority of the domestic flights) operated from this terminal. This terminal now houses China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Skyteam, Air Koryo, and other domestic and international flights after Air China, Shanghai Airlines, Star Alliance members, Oneworld members moved operations to the new Terminal 3. A gate capable of handling the A380 (gate 21) was also built at the terminal."
