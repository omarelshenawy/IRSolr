				"previous": "As British Airways headed towards privatisation,[6][27] Sir John King hired Colin Marshall as CEO in 1983. King was credited with transforming the loss-making giant into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world, boldly claiming to be \"The World's Favourite Airline\", while many other large airlines struggled.[57] The airline's fleet and route map were overhauled in the early years of King's tenure,[6] with brand and advertising experts being recruited to change the airline's image.[6] Over 23,000 jobs were shed in the early 1980s,[6][58] though King managed the considerable trick of boosting staff morale and modernising operations at the same time.[59] Offering generous inducements for staff to leave led to record losses of Â£545 million, to the cost of taxpayers but to the benefit of the future privatised company.[60][61]",
				"after": "At Marshall's direction, the airline consolidated most of its long-haul operations in 1986,[62] including Concorde services,[63] at the newly constructed Heathrow Terminal 4.[64][65] Terminal 4 would remain as BA's hub at Heathrow Airport for the next 22 years.[66] Due in part to a recession and rising fuel prices,[67][68] aircraft such as the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Vickers Super VC10 and Boeing 707 were quickly phased out of service,[62][69] and planes such as the Boeing 737 were acquired in their place.[70][71] In an effort to increase the use of the operational Concorde fleet,[72] King allowed the planes to be chartered for special services.[54][73] Concorde services to Singapore in cooperation with Singapore Airlines begun, in addition to a service to Miami by 1984.[27][62] In the 1980s, British Airways regarded Concorde as its flagship, both prestigious and profitable.[74]",
