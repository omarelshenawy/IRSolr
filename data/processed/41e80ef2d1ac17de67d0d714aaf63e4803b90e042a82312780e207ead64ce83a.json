				"previous": "Arthur James, the Governor of Pennsylvania, signed legislation creating Ricketts Glen State Park on August 1, 1941. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261 acres (510Â ha), including the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000 on December 31, 1942. The new state park opened to the public on August 1, 1943;[55] however, the park's official history says \"recreational facilities first opened in 1944\".[3] The state bought a total of 16,000 acres (6,500Â ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000 acres (4,000Â ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000 acres (1,200Â ha) acquired from others.[3][14][49]",
				"after": "The state's original plans for the new park included building an inn, an 18-hole golf course and country club, and a winter sports complex for skiing, ice boating, and tobogganing, as well as a beach with bathing facilities, cabins, and a tent camping area. Only the last three were actually built, all south of Lake Jean; the Hayfield area north of Lake Jean was to have had the facilities for golf and tennis, and the inn and winter sports complex were to have been atop Cherry Ridge, at an elevation of 2,461 feet (750Â m).[14][57]",
