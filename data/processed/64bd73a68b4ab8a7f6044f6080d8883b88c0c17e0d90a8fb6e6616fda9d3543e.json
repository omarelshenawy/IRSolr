				"after": "Ficus obliqua is a tree, which may reach 15â60Â m (50â200Â ft) in height with a similar crown width.[10] It has smooth thin grey bark with lighter-coloured lenticels, and a buttressed trunk, which may reach 3Â m (10Â ft) in diameter. The glossy green leaves are elliptic to oblong in shape and measure 5â8Â cm (2â3Â in) long by 2â3.5Â cm (0.8â1.4Â in) wide on 1â2Â cm (0.4â0.8Â in) petioles.[10] They are alternately arranged on the stems.[2] Growing in pairs, the round yellow fruit turn orange or orange-red dotted with darker red and reaches a diameter of 6 to 10Â mm (0.2â0.4Â in) upon ripening over April to July,[10] although fruit can appear at other times of year.[11] As is the case with all figs, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the inner surface.[12] Ficus obliqua is monoeciousâboth male and female flowers are produced by the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit. Within any given fruit, female flowers mature several weeks before the male flowers.[13]",
