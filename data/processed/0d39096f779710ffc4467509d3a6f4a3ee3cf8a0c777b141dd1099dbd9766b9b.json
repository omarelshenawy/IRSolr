				"previous": "In 1889, a commemorative nine-foot (2.7 meter) bronze statue of a Chicago policeman by sculptor Johannes Gelert was erected in the middle of Haymarket Square with private funds raised by the Union League Club of Chicago.[123] The statue was unveiled on May 30, 1889, by Frank Degan, the son of Officer Mathias Degan.[124] On May 4, 1927, the 41st anniversary of the Haymarket affair, a streetcar jumped its tracks and crashed into the monument.[125] The motorman said he was \"sick of seeing that policeman with his arm raised\".[125] The city restored the statue in 1928 and moved it to Union Park.[126] During the 1950s, construction of the Kennedy Expressway erased about half of the old, run-down market square, and in 1956, the statue was moved to a special platform built for it overlooking the freeway, near its original location.[126]",
				"after": "The Haymarket statue was vandalized with black paint on May 4, 1968, the 82nd anniversary of the Haymarket affair, following a confrontation between police and demonstrators at a protest against the Vietnam War.[127] On October 6, 1969, shortly before the \"Days of Rage\" protests, the statue was destroyed when a bomb was placed between its legs. Weatherman took credit for the blast, which broke nearly 100 windows in the neighborhood and scattered pieces of the statue onto the Kennedy Expressway below.[128] The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4, 1970, to be blown up yet again by Weathermen on October 6, 1970.[127][128] The statue was rebuilt, again, and Mayor Richard J. Daley posted a 24âhour police guard at the statue.[128] This guard cost $67,440 per year.[129] In 1972 it was moved to the lobby of the Central Police Headquarters, and in 1976 to the enclosed courtyard of the Chicago police academy.[127] For another three decades the statue's empty, graffiti-marked pedestal stood on its platform in the run-down remains of Haymarket Square where it was known as an anarchist landmark.[127] On June 1, 2007 the statue was rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters with a new pedestal, unveiled by Geraldine Doceka, Officer Mathias Degan's great-granddaughter.[124]",
