				"previous": "The 18thÂ century in the central highlands was characterized by increasing population density and consequent famines, aggravated by warring among the principalities of Imerina. At the turn of the 19th century, King Andrianampoinimerina (1787â1810) successfully united these fractious Merina groups under his rule, then used slaves and forced laborâexacted in lieu of taxes for those without means to offer material paymentâto systematically work the irrigated rice fields around Antananarivo. In this way, he ensured regular grain surpluses that were sufficient to consistently feed the entire population and export products for trade with other regions of the island. Marketplaces were established across the island to serve as central trading points for designated commodities such as smoked and dried seafood and meats, dried maize, salt, dried cassava and various fruits.[24] Rice cakes, including mofo gasy ([ËmufÊ·ËÉ¡asÊ²]) and menakely ([menÉÌ¥ËkelÊ²]), were also sold by market vendors.[25] By this period, coastal cuisine had likewise evolved: early 19thÂ century voyagers reported eating dishes on Ãle Sainte-Marie prepared with curry powder (including a spiced rice resembling biryani) and drinking coffee and tea.[26] Andrianampoinimerina's son, Radama I, succeeded in uniting nearly the entire island under his rule, and established the Kingdom of Madagascar. A line of Merina monarchs would continue to govern the island until its colonization by the French in 1896.[27]",
				"after": "Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, plantations were established for the production of crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconutsâwhich had been relatively sparse on the islandâwere cultivated on plantations for the production of oil. Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19thÂ century, when more intensive cultivation for export began.[28] Vanilla, later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30Â years later.[29] Nonetheless, vanilla remained a marginal crop until the end of the monarchy.[30]",
