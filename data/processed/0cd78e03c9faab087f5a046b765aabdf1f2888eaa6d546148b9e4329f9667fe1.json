				"previous": "The church is relatively large, seating 850.[47] It is built in the Venetian Gothic style, and divided into a five-bay nave, transepts, chancel, morning chapel and organ chamber.[47] Although Plumbe's original design envisaged a tower, one was never built. By 1900, St Mark's was reported as having a congregation twice that of any other church in Wood Green.[46]",
				"after": "In 1913, a second much larger mission hall was opened nearby, named the Walsham-How Mission Hall after William Walsham How, leader of the Shropshire Mission to East London.[46] The Shropshire Hall, built by the Shropshire Mission in Gladstone Avenue, is now the Noel Park Children's Centre.[48] Noel Park's relative geographic isolation led to the formation of large numbers of clubs and societies using the two mission halls for a wide range of activities, including large numbers of sporting societies.[41]",
