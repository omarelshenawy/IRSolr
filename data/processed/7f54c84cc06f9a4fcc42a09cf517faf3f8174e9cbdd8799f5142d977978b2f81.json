He also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. He gave a full treatment of the equation [62] and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss.[63] In his old age, he was the first to prove \"Fermat's last theorem\" for (completing work by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and crediting both him and Sophie Germain).[64]",
