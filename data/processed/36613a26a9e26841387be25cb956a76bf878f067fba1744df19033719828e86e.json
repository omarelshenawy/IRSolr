				"previous": "ViÃ©gas began her research while at the MIT Media Lab, focusing on graphical interfaces for online communication. Her Chat Circles system introduced ideas such as proximity-based filtering of conversation and a visual archive of chat history displaying the overall rhythm and form of a conversation.[4] Her email visualization designs (including PostHistory and Themail) are the foundation for many other systems; her findings on how visualizations are often used for storytelling influenced subsequent work on the collaborative aspects of visualization.[5] While at MIT, she also studied usage of Usenet and blogs.[6]",
			"after": [
				"A second stream of work, in partnership with Martin Wattenberg, centers on collective intelligence and the public use of data visualization.",
				"Her work with visualizations such as History Flow and Chromogram led to some of the earliest publications on the dynamics of Wikipedia, including the first scientific study of the repair of vandalism.[7]"
