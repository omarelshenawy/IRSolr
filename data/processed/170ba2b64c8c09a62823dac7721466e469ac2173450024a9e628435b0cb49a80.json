				"after": "With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550â1070Â BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate.[50] Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and once again they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. The Egyptologist Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals.[51] The most important god of the time was Amun, whose main cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose high priests may have wielded considerable political influence.[52]",
