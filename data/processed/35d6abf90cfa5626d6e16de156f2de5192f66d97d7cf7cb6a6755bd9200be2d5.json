				"previous": "Saffron contains more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components,[28] many of which are carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various Î±- and Î²-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of Î±-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(Î²-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.[28] Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin.[28] Crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant Î±-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make Î±-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.[7]",
				"after": "The bitter glucoside picrocrocin is responsible for saffron's flavour. Picrocrocin (chemical formula: C 16H 26O 7; systematic name: 4-(Î²-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6- trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an aldehyde sub-element known as safranal (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid zeaxanthin that is produced via oxidative cleavage, and is the glycoside of the terpene aldehyde safranal. The reddish-coloured zeaxanthin is, incidentally, one of the carotenoids naturally present within the retina of the human eye.[29]",
