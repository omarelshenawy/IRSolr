				"after": "In November 2002, Justin Timberlake released his debut solo album Justified;[1] it produced the US top-five singles \"Rock Your Body\" and \"Cry Me a River\".[2] \"Cry Me a River\" has been credited for having helped the album sell and peak on the music charts.[3] Justified sold up to four million copies in the US alone.[3] Although the album established his career outside his then-band 'NSYNC,[4] Timberlake, who was then 22 years old, was \"at a crossroads\" and felt he was at the stage of being \"burnt out\",[3][5] and thought he had lost his voice \"in regards to knowing what (and how) he wanted to sing\".[5] Timberlake stated that Justified had been years in the making, and a record that would re-create its success would be a challenge he was not ready to take.[6]",
