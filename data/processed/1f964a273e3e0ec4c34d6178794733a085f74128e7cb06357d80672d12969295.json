These aircraft were used mainly on routes to European destinations to cover the interim period before the delivery of the first two new Boeing 777-300ERs in 2011.[165] To secure the delivery of these two brand new 777-300ERs the airline used an initial US$277Â million loan granted from JPMorgan Chase.[164][166][167] Wearing a new livery, the carrier took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER in late October 2011.[168][169] It was the 300th 777-300ER delivered by Boeing.[170][171] The 301st ever delivered Boeing 777-300ER also went to Biman;[172] the airline took possession of it in late NovemberÂ 2011Â (2011-11).[173] The third Boeing 777-300ER, named Aakash Pradeep, was handed over to the carrier in FebruaryÂ 2014Â (2014-02);[174] the fourth one, named Raanga Pravat, joined the fleet in MarchÂ 2014Â (2014-03),[175] following the government approving a US$356Â million loan, of which US$290Â million will be provided by the Ex-Im Bank and the rest by the Standard Chartered Bank.[176]",
