				"The airline was established by the Estonian government with aircraft acquired from the defunct local Aeroflot Division.[3]",
				"In 1992, the airline became a member of IATA and the first Boeing 737â500 was delivered in 1995. The company was partially privatised in 1996 with 66% of shares to Maersk Air (49%) and Cresco investment bank (17%).[4] The company leased two Boeing 737-500s to replace its old Soviet planes, and in 1996, after obtaining two more Fokker 50s, it was able to retire the Soviet fleet entirely."
