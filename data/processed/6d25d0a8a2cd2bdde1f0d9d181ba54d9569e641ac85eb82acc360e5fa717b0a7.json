				"after": "The 1924 Rose Bowl was a postseason American college football bowl game between the Navy Midshipmen and the Washington Huskies played on New Year's Day. The game was the final contest of the 1923 season, in which Washington had come in second in the Pacific Coast Conference and Navy, an independent, finished as one of the best eastern teams. The game marked several firsts for the Rose Bowl, including its first time being broadcast on radio. Despite general consensus among sportswriters that Washington would have a slight advantage, Navy began the game stronger and scored first. Following a botched onside kick attempt by the Midshipmen, Washington went on a 50-yard drive and scored a touchdown to tie the game. Navy reached the end zone late in the first half on a short run from quarterback Ira McKee to take a 14â7 halftime lead. After a quiet third quarter, Navy made a late fumble and Washington recovered on the Navy 10-yard line. The Huskies scored four plays later, on a trick pass play. Navy quickly turned the ball over again, and Washington took over from midfield. A last-second field goal attempt by the Huskies missed, and the contest ended in a 14â14 tie. McKee was named the Most Valuable Player. (FullÂ article...)",
