				"previous": "Today, the Port of Blyth handles up to 1.5 million tonnes of cargo, mainly containers and RoRo, and some limited volumes of bulk cargos.[39] Blyth Harbour Wind Farm, developed by AMEC Wind and owned by the port commissioners, was commissioned in January 1993 consists of nine 0.3MW WindMaster turbines, giving a total capacity of 2.7Â MW.[43] In January 2008 consent was granted to replace the existing nine turbines with seven new ones, six generating 2.5Â MW each, and a seventh at 163Â m (535Â ft) would produce 7.5Â MW.[44]",
				"after": "With the running down of the coal mining and shipbuilding industries, Blyth largely exists today as a dormitory town in the commuter belt serving Newcastle and North Tyneside. However, its port still remains a major industry in the area, handling over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo annually.[45] Its main trades are forest products, such as paper, pulp and timber, unitised cargo (containers and RoRo) and the import of materials used in the production of aluminium. It also handles the import of a variety of stones and metals.[46] A twice weekly container service between the port and Moerdijk, near Rotterdam, provides connections with the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France as well as South America and the Far East.[47] The port is operated by Port of Blyth, which is the operating division of Blyth Harbour Commission.[16] Port of Blyth is a trust port, which means that it is governed by its own local legislation under the control of an independent board; there are no shareholders and therefore no dividends to support, which allows any surplus to be reinvested in the port.[16][48]",
