				"previous": "In April 2008, the zoo decreased human interaction with the cub, hoping that one day she could coexist with members of her species and not be dependent on humans. Becoming more independent from her keepers, Flocke was reported often playing happily on her own.[21] She was given a plastic \"dummy\", similar to a child's teething ring, tied to the bars on the inside of her stable door to suckle on while resting. This suckling caused the cub's nose to appear bent; her muzzle remained in this shape for some time before returning to normal.[21]",
				"after": "At the age of six months, it was reported that Flocke, whose diet at the time consisted mostly of a kilogram of beef, assorted vegetables and a liter of puppy milk a day, was at the correct weight for her development at 45 kilograms (99Â lb). The zoo's vet, Bernhard Neurohr, also remarked upon the bear's sweet tooth, stating that \"Flocke is very enthusiastic about grapes, melon, kiwi fruit and pears\", with a particular fondness for bananas.[22]",
