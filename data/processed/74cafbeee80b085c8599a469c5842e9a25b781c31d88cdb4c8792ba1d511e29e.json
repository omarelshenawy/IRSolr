Because of this wide distribution, accurate information about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined.[3] The population on the US Naval Base at GuantÃ¡namo Bay has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base.[1][15][16] An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005.[29][30]",
