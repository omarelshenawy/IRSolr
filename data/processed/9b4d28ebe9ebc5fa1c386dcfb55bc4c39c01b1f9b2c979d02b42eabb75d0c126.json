				"previous": "By 1929, the remains of 34 mammoths with frozen soft tissues (skin, flesh, or organs) had been documented. Only four of them were relatively complete. Since then, about that many more have been found. In most cases, the flesh showed signs of decay before its freezing and later desiccation.[110] Since 1860, Russian authorities have offered rewards of up to ÑÑÐ±.1000 for finds of frozen woolly mammoth carcasses. Often such finds were kept secret due to superstition. Several carcasses have been lost because they were not reported, and one was fed to dogs. In more recent years, scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters. The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed \"Effie\", which was found in 1948. It consists of the head, trunk, and a foreleg, and is about 25,000 years old.[101]",
				"after": "In 1977, the well-preserved carcass of a seven- to eight-month-old woolly mammoth calf named \"Dima\" was discovered. This carcass was recovered near a tributary of the Kolyma River in northeastern Siberia. This specimen weighed approximately 100Â kg (220Â lb) at death and was 104Â cm (41Â in) high and 115Â cm (45Â in) long. Radiocarbon dating determined that \"Dima\" died about 40,000 years ago. Its internal organs are similar to those of modern elephants, but its ears are only one-tenth the size of those of an African elephant of similar age. A less complete juvenile, nicknamed \"Mascha\", was found on the Yamal Peninsula in 1988. It was 3â4 months old, and a laceration on its right foot may have been the cause of death. It is the westernmost frozen mammoth found.[111]",
