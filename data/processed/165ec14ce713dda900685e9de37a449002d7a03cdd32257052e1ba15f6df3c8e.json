The modulation is repeated alternating Morse-style dots and dashes of a 1.3Â kHz tone at the rate of two per second (Â·-Â·-) (\"Ã\" or \"AA\"). The cockpit indicator is an amber lamp that flashes in unison with the received audio code. In the United States, middle markers are not required so many of them have been decommissioned.[citation needed]",
