				"after": "Muhammad adopted the practice of praying alone for several weeks every year in a cave on Mount Hira near Mecca.[64][65] Islamic tradition holds that during one of his visits to Mount Hira, the angel Gabriel appeared to him in the year 610 and commanded Muhammad to recite verses which would later be included in the Quran.[66] There is a consensus that the first words of the Quran to be revealed were the beginning of Surah 96:1.[67] Upon receiving his first revelations, he was deeply distressed. After returning home, Muhammad was consoled and reassured by Khadijah and her Christian cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal.[68] Waraqah is variously described as an Ebionite priest (possibly of Mecca) or Nestorian. He also feared that others would dismiss his claims as being possessed.[44] Shi'a tradition maintains that Muhammad was neither surprised nor frightened at the appearance of Gabriel but rather Muhammad welcomed him as if he was expecting.[69] The initial revelation was followed by a pause of three years (a period known as fatra) during which Muhammad felt depressed and further gave himself to prayers and spiritual practices.[67] When the revelations resumed he was reassured and commanded to begin preaching: \"Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased.\"[70][71][72]",
