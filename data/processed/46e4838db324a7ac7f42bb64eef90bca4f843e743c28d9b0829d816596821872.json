				"after": "Sometime in 1692, minister of the Third Church in Boston,[73] Samuel Willard anonymously published a short tract in Philadelphia entitled, \"Some Miscellany Observations On our present Debates respecting Witchcrafts, in a Dialogue Between S. & B.\" The authors were listed as \"P.E. and J. A.\" (Philip English and John Alden), but the work is generally attributed to Willard. In it, two characters, S (Salem) and B (Boston), discuss the way the proceedings were being conducted, with \"B\" urging caution about the use of testimony from the afflicted and the confessors, stating, \"whatever comes from them is to be suspected; and it is dangerous using or crediting them too far\".[74]",
