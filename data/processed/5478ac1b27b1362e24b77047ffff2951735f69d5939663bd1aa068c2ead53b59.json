				"previous": "In March 2007, Boeing announced that it had no plans to produce further passenger versions of the â400.[158] However, orders for 36 â400F and â400ERF freighters were already in place at the time of the announcement.[158] The last passenger version of the 747-400 was delivered in April 2005 to China Airlines. Some of the last built 747-400s were delivered with Dreamliner livery along with the modern Signature interior from the Boeing 777. A total of 694 of the 747-400 series aircraft were delivered.[3] At various times, the largest 747-400 operator has included Singapore Airlines,[159] Japan Airlines,[159] and British Airways with 57 as of June 2013[update].[160][161]",
				"after": "The 747-400 Dreamlifter[162] (originally called the 747 Large Cargo Freighter or LCF[163]) is a Boeing-designed modification of existing 747-400s to a larger configuration to ferry 787 Dreamliner sub-assemblies. Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation of Taiwan was contracted to complete modifications of 747-400s into Dreamlifters in Taoyuan. The aircraft flew for the first time on September 9, 2006 in a test flight.[164] Modification of four aircraft was completed by February 2010.[165] The Dreamlifters have been placed into service transporting sub-assemblies for the 787 program to the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington, for final assembly.[162] The aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers.[166]",
