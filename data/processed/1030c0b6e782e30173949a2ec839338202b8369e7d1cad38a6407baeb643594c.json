				"previous": "Given an odd prime number p, let q = pe for some positive integer e. A non-zero element of the field Fq with q elements is a quadratic residue if it is has a square root in Fq. Otherwise, it is a quadratic non-residue. There are (q â 1)/2 quadratic residues and (q â 1)/2 quadratic non-residues; zero is not counted in either class. The quadratic residues form a group under multiplication. The properties of quadratic residues are widely used in number theory.",
