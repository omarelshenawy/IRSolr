				"after": "During the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France, Luftwaffe fightersâprimarily the Messerschmitt Bf 109âheld air superiority, and the Luftwaffe played a major role in German victories in these campaigns. During the Battle of Britain, however, British Hurricanes and Spitfires proved roughly equal to Luftwaffe fighters. Additionally Britain's use of radar and the advantages of fighting above Britain's home territory allowed the RAF to deny Germany air superiority, saving Britain from German invasion and dealing the Axis a major defeat early in the Second World War.",
