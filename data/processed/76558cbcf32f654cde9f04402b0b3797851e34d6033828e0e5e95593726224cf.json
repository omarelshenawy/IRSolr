				"previous": "Air from the \"mix manifold\" is directed to overhead distribution nozzles [1] in the various \"zones\" of the aircraft. Temperature in each zone may be adjusted by adding small amounts of \"trim air\", which is low-pressure, high-temperature air tapped off the A/C pack upstream of the TCV. Air is also supplied to individual gaspers: small, circular vents above each passenger seat that can be adjusted by passengers for their personal comfort. A revolving control on the vent can be turned to adjust ventilation between no air output at all and a fairly substantial breeze.",
				"after": "Gaspers usually receive their air from the air conditioning packs aboard the aircraft, which in turn receive compressed, clean air from the compressor stages of the aircraft's jet engines or when on the ground from the auxiliary power unit (APU) or a ground source. A master control for gaspers is located in the cockpit, and gaspers may be temporarily turned off during certain phases of flight, when the load on the engines from bleed-air demands must be minimized (e.g. take-off and climb).",
