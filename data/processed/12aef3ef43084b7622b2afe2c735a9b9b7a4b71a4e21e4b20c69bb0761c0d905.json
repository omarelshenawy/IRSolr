				"after": "The HH-65A's minimum equipment requirements exceeded anything previously packaged into a helicopter weighing less than 10,000 pounds. 75% of the HH-65's structure â including rotorhead, rotor blades and fuselage â consists of corrosion-resistant composite materials. Some Coast Guard pilots have nicknamed the Dolphin as \"Tupperwolf\", a portmanteau of tupperware (because of the aircraft's high composites content)[2] and Airwolf (from the 1980s TV series).",
