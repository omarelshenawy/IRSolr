				"previous": "Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and NACA (later NASA). A total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968, resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft (current as of 2014[update]), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273Â km/h).[20] The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96Â km).[21] Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force astronaut wings for flying above 260,000 feet (80Â km), and two flights by Joseph A. Walker exceeded 100 kilometers (330,000Â ft), qualifying as spaceflight according to the International Aeronautical Federation. The X-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later manned spaceflight programs, including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft, space suits, and horizon definition for navigation.[21] The reentry and landing data collected were valuable to NASA for designing the Space Shuttle.[19]",
				"after": "NASA has made use of technologies such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which is a type of Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator used on space missions[136]",
