One notable individual is \"Nandi\", a manta ray which was accidentally caught in shark nets off Durban, South Africa, in 2007. Rehabilitated and outgrowing her aquarium at uShaka Marine World, Nandi was moved to the larger Georgia Aquarium in August 2008, where she resides in its 23,848-m3 (6,300,000-US gal) \"Ocean Voyager\" exhibit.[50] A second manta ray joined that aquarium's collection in September 2009,[51] and a third was added in 2010.[52]",
