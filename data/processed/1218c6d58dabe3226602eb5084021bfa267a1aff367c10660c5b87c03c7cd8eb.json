				"Moving Pictures is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush. The album was recorded and mixed October to November 1980 at Le Studio, Morin Heights, Quebec and released March 12, 1981.",
				"Moving Pictures became the band's biggest selling album in the U.S., hitting #3, and remains the band's most popular and commercially successful studio recording to date. The album was certified quadruple-platinum with four million copies sold on January 27, 1995. Following the formula of their previous album, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures follows a more radio-friendly format and includes the hit single \"Tom Sawyer\", as well as radio standards \"Red Barchetta\" and \"Limelight\". Moving Pictures is one of two Rush albums listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2112 is the other)."
