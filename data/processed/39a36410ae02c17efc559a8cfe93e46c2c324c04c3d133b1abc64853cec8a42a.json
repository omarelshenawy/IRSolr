				"previous": "Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: Bezirksversammlung) and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: Bezirksamtsleiter). The boroughs are not independent municipalities: their power is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Hamburg. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by Hamburg's Senate.[38] The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.",
				"after": "In 2008, the boroughs were Altona, Bergedorf, EimsbÃ¼ttel, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord, Harburg and Wandsbek.[41]",
