				"after": "The idea of building a memorial to honor soldiers killed in action during the Latvian War of Independence first emerged in the early 1920s. On July 27, 1922, the Prime Minister of Latvia, ZigfrÄ«ds Anna Meierovics, ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a \"memorial column\". The winner of this contest was a scheme proposing a column 27 meters (89Â ft) tall with reliefs of the official symbols of Latvia and bas-reliefs of KriÅ¡jÄnis Barons and Atis Kronvalds. It was later rejected after a protest from 57 artists.[1] In October 1923, a new contest was announced, using for the first time the term \"Freedom Monument\". The contest ended with two winners, and a new closed contest was announced in March 1925, but, due to disagreement within the jury, there was no result.[1]",
