				"previous": "At 11.35Â am (11.20Â am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25Â pm (12.20Â pm on Sundays).[90][note 13]",
				"after": "On arrival at North or South station coffins would usually be unloaded onto a hand-drawn bier and pulled by LNC staff to the appropriate chapel.[91] While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station.[92] On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried).[91] For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.[78]",
