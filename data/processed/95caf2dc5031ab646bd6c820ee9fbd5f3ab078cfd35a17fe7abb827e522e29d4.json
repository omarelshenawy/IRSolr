				"Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including TaÃ­no (Amerindians), Spanish, African, European and, more recently, North American.",
				"From the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On March 12, 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organism that was founded in Fajardo three years before."
