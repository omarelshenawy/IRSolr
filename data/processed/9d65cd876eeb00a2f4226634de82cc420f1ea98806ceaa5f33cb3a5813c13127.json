(BKS were the founders' initials - i.e. James Barnby, Thomas Keegan and Cyril Stevens.[1]) Further Dakotas were bought in 1952. For a couple of years it flew charters and freight until 1953, when it was granted permission to operate scheduled services between Newcastle, the Isle of Man and Jersey. The Dakotas continued in operation with BKS until the last of eight was sold in 1967.[2] The airline's name was changed to BKS Air Transport at the end of 1953.[3]",
