Nehemiah 2:7-9, dating from approximately 450 BC, states that Nehemiah, an official serving King Artaxerxes I of Persia, asked permission to travel to Judea; the king granted leave and gave him a letter \"to the governors beyond the river\" requesting safe passage for him as he traveled through their lands.",
