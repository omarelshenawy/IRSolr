				"after": "Nauru reed warbler nests are cup-shaped and woven from grasses and twigs. They sometimes include Cassytha filiformis vine or Casuarina equisetifolia needles.[7] The nests are bound to upright stems in a way typical of warblers.[9] Buden reported that the warblers nest in trees and shrubs at a height of 2 to 8 metres (6.6 to 26.2Â ft). The species may also nest on the ground; the young in ground nests may be more vulnerable to predation by rats. Eggs have variously been reported in December and July, and ornithologist A. Pearson suggested that the species may nest all year round.[7] The clutch size has been reported as two or three eggs.[7][8] Incubation and fledgling periods are unknown.[8] Pearson reported lower nesting than Buden, recording nests in bushes and undergrowth between 45 and 300 centimetres (18 and 118Â in) from the ground, especially in forked branches of hibiscus and lime.[9] Buden reported that the birds were more vocal in December than in March and April.[7] The song has been described as similar to that of a song thrush, common blackbird,[8] or willie wagtail, and it is delivered both day and night.[20]",
