				"after": "A machine fills cups with a liquid, and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250Â g of liquid. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250Â g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be normally distributed (although this assumption is not necessary for the theory to work) around the desired average of 250Â g, with a standard deviation, Ï, of 2.5Â g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of nÂ =Â 25 cups of liquid are chosen at random and the cups are weighed. The resulting measured masses of liquid are X1,Â ...,Â X25, a random sample fromÂ X.",
