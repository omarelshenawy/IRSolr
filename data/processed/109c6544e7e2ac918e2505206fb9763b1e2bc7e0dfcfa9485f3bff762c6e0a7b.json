				"previous": "A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story is a made-for-television movie that recounts the life of the late Buccaneer running back Ricky Bell. The movie takes place through a dramatic reenactment of the 1981 season, including actual footage of gameplay around the dramatized role by Mario Van Peebles playing Bell himself. Bell finds himself befriending an impaired child who inspire each other to become better in their own ways. It also includes other former Buccaneer players, like Lee Roy Selmon, Charley Hannah, and Doug Williams (only through gameplay footage).",
				"after": "The Bucs created an official cheerleading squad in their first season, called the \"Swash-Buc-Lers.\" In 1999, they were renamed as the \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers Cheerleaders.\"[54]",
