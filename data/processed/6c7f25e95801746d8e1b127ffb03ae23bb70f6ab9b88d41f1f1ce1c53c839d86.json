Solid objects that are large enough to see and handle are rarely composed of a single crystal, except for a few cases (gems, silicon single crystals for the electronics industry, certain types of fiber, single crystals of a nickel-based superalloy for turbojet engines, and some ice crystals which can exceed 0.5 meters in diameter[4]). Most materials are polycrystalline; they are made of a large number of single crystals â crystallites â held together by thin layers of amorphous solid. The crystallite size can vary from a few nanometers to several millimeters.",
