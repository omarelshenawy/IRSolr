				"previous": "The city gained the reputation as one of the most active and growing gay communities in the Northeast;[98][99] the rate of reported gay and lesbian relationships is 75% higher than the national average[100] and Providence has been named among the \"Best Lesbian Places to Live\".[99] The former mayor, David Cicilline, won his election running as an openly gay man, making him the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.[80] Former Mayor Cianci instituted the position of Mayor's Liaison to the Gay and Lesbian community in the 1990s.[99] Providence is home to the largest gay bathhouse in New England.[101]",
				"after": "During the summer months, the city regularly hosts WaterFire, an environmental art installation that consists of about 100 bonfires that blaze just above the surface of the three rivers that pass through the middle of downtown Providence.[102] There are multiple Waterfire events that are accompanied by various pieces of classical and world music. The public art displays, most notably sculptures, change on a regular basis.",
