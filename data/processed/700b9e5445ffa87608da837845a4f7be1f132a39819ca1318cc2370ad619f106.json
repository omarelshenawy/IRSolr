John told host Carson Daly that Madonna \"hasn't got a fucking chance\" of winning the award.[19] When Madonna later had her red carpet interview with Daly, she took swipes at John's masculinity first, asking about his wardrobe: \"Was he wearing a dress?\" and after being informed of his comments stating, \"May the best man win\".[19]",
