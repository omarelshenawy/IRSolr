				"after": "Author Susan McClary in Culture/power/history reviewed the song saying that, it was more upbeat than previous single \"Live to Tell\" and \"the play with closure in 'Open Your Heart' creates the image of open ended jouissanceâan erotic energy that continually escapes containment\".[9] Author Taraborrelli called it as one of her most \"earnest\" songs and compared it with Aretha Franklin's song \"Respect\" as well as Barbra Streisand's \"A House is Not a Home\". According to him \"it was a tune people could understand and latch on to, which is what makes a pop song memorable\".[4][10] The New York Times writer Stephen Holden compared the song with sweeter post-Motown valentine songs.[11] Houston Chronicle writer Joey Guerra called the song \"perfect\" for dancefloor strut.[12] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it a perfect dance song with deepened dance grooves.[13] Slant Magazine named the song as one of Madonna's most \"robust\" songs.[14] Robert Christgau said of the song, \"I'm not saying her flair is pleasurelessâthe generosity she demands in the inexhaustible 'Open Your Heart' is a two-way street and then some.\"[15]",
