				"after": "Externally generated hot gas in situ technologies use hot gases heated above-ground and then injected into the oil shale formation. The Chevron CRUSH process, which was researched by Chevron Corporation in partnership with Los Alamos National Laboratory, injects heated carbon dioxide into the formation via drilled wells and to heat the formation through a series of horizontal fractures through which the gas is circulated.[50] General Synfuels International has proposed the Omnishale process involving injection of super-heated air into the oil shale formation.[10][36] Mountain West Energy's In Situ Vapor Extraction process uses similar principles of injection of high-temperature gas.[10][51]",
