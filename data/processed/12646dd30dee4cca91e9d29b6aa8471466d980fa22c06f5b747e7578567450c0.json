				"after": "The monument is located in the center of Riga on BrÄ«vÄ«bas bulvÄris (English: Freedom Boulevard), near the old town of Riga.[4] In 1990 a section of the street around the monument, about 200 meters (660Â ft) long, between Rainis and Aspazija boulevards, was pedestrianized, forming a plaza. Part of it includes a bridge over the city's canal, once a part of the city's fortification system, which was demolished in the 19th century to build the modern boulevard district.[7] The canal is 3.2 kilometers (2.0Â mi) long and surrounded by parkland for half of its length.[2] The earth from the demolition of the fortifications was gathered in the park and now forms an artificial hill with a cascade of waterfalls to the north of the monument.[1] The Boulevard district east of the park is the location of several embassies and institutions, of which the closest to the Freedom Monument are the German and French embassies, the University of Latvia and Riga State Gymnasium No.1.[8]",
