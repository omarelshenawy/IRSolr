The first controlled experiments in human metabolism were published by Santorio Santorio in 1614 in his book Ars de statica medicina.[135] He described how he weighed himself before and after eating, sleep, working, sex, fasting, drinking, and excreting. He found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called \"insensible perspiration\".",
