				"after": "In 1985, The Lords of the New Church recorded \"Like a Virgin\" for their compilation album Killer Lords. Gary Hill from Allmusic called the composition as \"very funny and obnoxious\".[70] The same year, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic parodied the song with his single \"Like a Surgeon\" from the album Dare to Be Stupid. Eugene Chadbourne from Allmusic commented: \"Turning the tacky Madonna hit inside out and upside down, Yankovic comes up with a hilarious satire of the medical profession.\"[71] In 1991, Glaswegian band Teenage Fanclub covered \"Like a Virgin\" on their second album, The King.[72] The song also appears on the soundtrack of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge! and is sung by the characters Harold Zidler, played by Jim Broadbent, and The Duke of Monroth, played by Richard Roxburgh.[73] In 2004, The Meat Purveyors covered the song in a bluegrass medley, pairing it with Madonna's \"Lucky Star\" and \"Burning Up.\"[74]",
