				"after": "Terminal 5 opened in 2008 for JetBlue Airways, the manager and primary (then only) tenant of the building, and serves as the base of their large JFK hub. This particular terminal handles (except for Aer Lingus flights to Ireland) exclusively North American regional flights- American domestic flights, Caribbean flights and Hawaiian Airlines flights to Honolulu, Hawaii. The terminal was re-designed by Gensler and constructed by Turner Construction, and it is known for its many gift shops and gourmet restaurants, including a steak house and a sushi restaurant. It sits behind the preserved Eero Saarinen-designed terminal originally known as the TWA Flight Center, which is now connected to the new structure and is considered part of T5. The Saarinen building is currently closed for refurbishment; it is unclear when the building will reopen or what purpose it will have. Saarinen also designed the terminal at Washington Dulles International Airport. The active T5 building (including the international arrivals section named T5i) has 29 gates (26 until November 2014): 1â12 and 14â30 (with gates 25-30 handling international flights that are not precleared; gates 28-30 opened in November 2014).[65] The terminal is also used by Hawaiian Airlines, which partnered with JetBlue and began service in Terminal 5 in June 2012,[66] and Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, whose flights arriving into JFK have already been pre-cleared in Ireland. Aer Lingus previously used Terminal 4 prior to the introduction of preclearance in Ireland, moving to T5 on April 3, 2013.[67] On November 12, 2014, JetBlue opened the International Arrivals Concourse (T5i) at the terminal.[68] Airspace Lounge opened an airport lounge near Gate 24 in July 2013 [69] and Aer Lingus is scheduled to open an airport lounge in 2015.[70]",
