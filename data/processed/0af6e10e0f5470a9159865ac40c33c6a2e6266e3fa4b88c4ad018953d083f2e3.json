				"after": "After the end of the Second World War, military activities on Melville ended; the land was initially awarded to the Naval Sailors Association, a decision that prompted some disagreement among members of Parliament.[10] Haligonians pushed for the area to be repurposed for recreation, partially due to anxieties about its use as a storage facility for potentially toxic chemicals.[110] In 1947, the Canadian Army leased Melville Island to the Armdale Yacht Club for C$1 per year. The club demolished some of the buildings, renovated and expanded others, widened the road, and filled in a new embankment for boating.[111] Further renovations were done in 1952 and the 1960s, adding verandahs to the two clubhouses (one of which dates to 1808 and was used as a warden's house) and remodelling their interiors.[10][112] Though the club's lease was initially year-to-year, in 1956 it began a 99-year lease from the Department of National Defence.[112][113] The club dredged Melville Cove, added a \"marine railway\", and created a large marina, at which dozens of boats are now docked.[110]",
