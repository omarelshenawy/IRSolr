				"previous": "The captured lord was taken back to QuiriguÃ¡ and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual.[46][47] The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of QuiriguÃ¡ and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed QuiriguÃ¡ as the new capital of the south-eastern Maya region.[39][47] After this, QuiriguÃ¡ engaged in a major monument-building programme, closely mimicking the sculptural style of CopÃ¡n, possibly using captured CopÃ¡n sculptors to carry out the work.[46] The population of QuiriguÃ¡ and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738, although QuiriguÃ¡ was always a small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2,000.[48]",
				"after": "In the Late Classic (c. 600Â â c. 900), alliance with Calakmul frequently was associated with the promise of military support. The fact that CopÃ¡n, a much more powerful city than QuiriguÃ¡, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from QuiriguÃ¡ that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of CopÃ¡n. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while QuiriguÃ¡ gained its independence.[50][51]",
