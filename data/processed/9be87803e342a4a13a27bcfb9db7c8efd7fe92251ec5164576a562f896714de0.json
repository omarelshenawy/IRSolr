				"after": "A casemate was originally a vaulted chamber usually constructed underneath the rampart. It was intended to be impenetrable and could be used for sheltering troops or stores. With the addition of an embrasure through the scarp face of the rampart, it could be used as a protected gun position.[5] In the early 19th century, French military engineer Baron Haxo designed a free-standing casemate that could be built on the top of the rampart.[6] Casemates built in concrete were used in the Second World War to protect coastal artillery from air attack.[7]",
