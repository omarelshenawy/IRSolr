				"previous": "The first Myspace users were eUniverse employees. The company held contests to see who could sign up the most users.[20] eUniverse used its 20 million users and e-mail subscribers to breathe life into Myspace,[21] and move it to the head of the pack of social networking websites. A key architect was tech expert Toan Nguyen who helped stabilize the Myspace platform when Brad Greenspan asked him to join the team.[22] Co-founder and CTO Aber Whitcomb played an integral role in software architecture, utilizing the then superior development speed of ColdFusion over other dynamic database driven server-side languages of the time. Despite over ten times the number of developers, Friendster, which was developed in JavaServer Pages (jsp), could not keep up with the speed of development of Myspace and cfm.",
				"after": "The MySpace.com domain was originally owned by YourZ.com, Inc., intended until 2002 for use as an online data storage and sharing site. By 2004, it was transitioned from a file storage service to a social networking site. A friend, who also worked in the data storage business, reminded Chris DeWolfe that he had earlier bought the domain MySpace.com.[23] DeWolfe suggested they charge a fee for the basic Myspace service.[24] Brad Greenspan nixed the idea, believing that keeping Myspace free was necessary to make it a successful community.[25]",
