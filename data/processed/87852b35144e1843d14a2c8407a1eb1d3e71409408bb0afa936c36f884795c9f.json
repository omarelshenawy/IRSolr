				"previous": "The three new hubs were abandoned in the 1990s: some San Jose facilities were sold to Reno Air, and at Raleigh/Durham to Midway Airlines.[citation needed] Midway went out of business in 2001. American Airlines purchased Reno Air in February 1999 and integrated its operations on 31 August 1999,[citation needed] but did not resume hub operations in San Jose. American discontinued most of Reno Air's routes, and sold most of the Reno Air aircraft, as it did with Air California 12 years earlier. The only remaining route from the Air California and Reno Air purchases is from San Francisco to Los Angeles.",
				"after": "During this time concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices brought a warning from American's CEO Robert Crandall. \"I've never invested in any airline\", Crandall said. \"I'm an airline manager. I don't invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, 'This is not an appropriate investment. It's a great place to work and it's a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.'\" Crandall noted that since airline deregulation of the 1970s, 150 airlines had gone out of business. \"A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money\", he said.[33]",
