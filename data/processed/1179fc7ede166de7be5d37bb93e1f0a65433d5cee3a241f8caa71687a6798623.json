				"previous": "2005 estimates place Chad's population at 10,146,000; 25.8% live in urban areas and 74.8% in rural ones.[46] The country's population is young: an estimated 47.3% is under 15. The birth rate is estimated at 42.35 births per 1,000 people, the mortality rate at 16.69. The life expectancy is 47.2 years.[1]",
				"after": "Chad's population is unevenly distributed. Density is 0.1/km2 (0.26/sqÂ mi) in the Saharan Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region but 52.4/km2 (136/sqÂ mi) in the Logone Occidental Region. In the capital, it is even higher.[33] About half of the nation's population lives in the southern fifth of its territory, making this the most densely populated region.[47]",
