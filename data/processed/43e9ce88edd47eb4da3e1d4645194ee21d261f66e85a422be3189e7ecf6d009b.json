				"after": "The airline was founded in April 1992 by the late Pakistani American aerospace enthusiast Michael Chowdry, to specialize in the long-term contract outsourcing of its Boeing 747 aircraft based on the ACMI model. Under this new program, Atlas Air Cargo planes would be available to other airlines under long-term leases. It started operations in 1993 with one Boeing 747 contracted by China Airlines. In 1995, Atlas began trading publicly on NASDAQ and in 1997, appeared on the New York Stock Exchange. Also in 1997, Atlas placed an order for 10 new, more advanced Boeing 747-400 Freighters (Boeing 747-400F), increased to 12 in 1998. An initial public offering of 4 million shares was made in August 1998. In July 2004 the parent company completed its restructuring plan and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[4]",
