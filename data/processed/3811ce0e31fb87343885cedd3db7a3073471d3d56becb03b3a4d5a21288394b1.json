				"previous": "The NRHP nomination form lists two other structures on the property: a utility building made of brick and covered in stucco east of the house,[b] and a large barn to the southwest. Since the house's 1913 renovation, the only changes have been the installation of electrical wiring and modernization of the plumbing. The original hardware and woodwork are still present inside the house. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion \"is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture\" which \"represents the manifestations of one man's architectural dream preserved within the wilderness for over a century\".[2]",
