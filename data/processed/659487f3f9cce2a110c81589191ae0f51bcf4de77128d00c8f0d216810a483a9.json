In 1955, Evgeny Maleev, a Soviet paleontologist, made this specimen the holotype (PIN 551-1) of a new species, which he called Tyrannosaurus bataar.[9] The specific name is a misspelling of the Mongolian Ð±Ð°Ð°ÑÐ°Ñ/baatar (\"hero\").[5] In the same year, Maleev also described and named three new theropod skulls, each associated with skeletal remains discovered by the same expedition in 1948 and 1949. The first of these (PIN 551-2) was named Tarbosaurus efremovi, a new generic name composed of the Ancient Greek ÏÎ±ÏÎ²Î¿Ï/tarbos (\"terror\", \"alarm\", \"awe\", or \"reverence\") and ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï/sauros (\"lizard\"),[14] and the species named after Ivan Yefremov, a Russian paleontologist and science fiction author. The other two (PIN 553-1 and PIN 552-2) were also named as new species and assigned to the North American genus Gorgosaurus (G. lancinator and G. novojilovi, respectively). All three of these latter specimens are smaller than the first.[1]",
