				"previous": "SIA has taken advantage of liberal bilateral aviation agreements between Singapore and Thailand, and with the United Arab Emirates, to offer more onward connections from Bangkok and Dubai respectively.",
				"after": "AirAsia, a low-cost airline based in Malaysia, accused Singapore Airlines of double standards, when it claimed that the Government of Singapore has attempted to keep it out of the Singapore market,[19] although there has been no official word that Singapore Airlines has objected to the entry of AirAsia. Singapore Airlines has, instead, welcomed[20][21] the liberation of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route which it dominated together with Malaysia Airlines[22] for over three decades,[23] accounting for about 85% of the over 200 flight frequencies then operated.[24] A highly lucrative route for LCCs due to its short distance and heavy traffic as the fourth-busiest in Asia,[25][26] bringing Singapore Airline's capacity share on the route down to about 46.7%, Malaysia Airlines' down to 25.3%, and increase to 17.3% to the three LCCs now permitted on the route, and the remainder shared by three other airlines as of 22 September 2008.[27] Singapore Airline's capacity share will drop further from 1 December 2008 when the route is opened up completely to liberalisation, when it announced plans to share its capacity with sister airline SilkAir.[28] Malaysia Airlines, the main opponent to liberalisation of the route[29] and deemed to be the party which stands to lose the most, will continue to codeshare with both Singapore Airlines and SilkAir on the route.[30]",
