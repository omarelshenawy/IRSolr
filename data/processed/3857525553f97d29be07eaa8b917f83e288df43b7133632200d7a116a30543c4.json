				"previous": "The specific epithet bohemica refers to Bohemia (now a part of the Czech Republic),[9] where Krombholz originally collected the species.[2] The mushroom is commonly known as the \"early morel\",[10] \"early false morel\", or the \"wrinkled thimble-cap\".[11] Ptychoverpa is derived from the Ancient Greek ptyx (genitive form ptychos), meaning \"fold\", layer\", or \"plate\".[12]",
				"after": "The cap of this fungus (known technically as an apothecium) is 2 to 4Â cm (0.8 to 1.6Â in) in diameter by 2 to 5Â cm (0.8 to 2.0Â in) long, with a conical or bell shape. It is folded into longitudinal ridges that often fuse together (anastomose) in a vein-like network. The cap is attached to the stem at the top onlyâhanging from the top of the stipe, with the lobed edge free from the stemâand varies in color from yellowish-brown to reddish-brown; the underside of the cap is pale. The stem is 6 to 12Â cm (2.4 to 4.7Â in) long by 1 to 2.5Â cm (0.4 to 1.0Â in) thick, cream-white in color, and tapers upward so that the stem is thicker at the base than at the top.[13] Although the stem is initially loosely stuffed with cottony hyphae, it eventually becomes hollow in maturity; overall, the mushroom is rather fragile.[14] The spore deposit is yellow, and the flesh is white.[15]",
