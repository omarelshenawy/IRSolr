				"after": "The history of East Frisia is marked by centuries of struggle by its people against storms and flooding from the sea, by the emergence of the concept of \"Frisian freedom\" in the Middle Ages and by the relative isolation of the region by moors. As a political entity the County of East Frisia appeared in 1464 on the imperial stage. After 1744 it belonged in succession to Prussia, the Kingdom of Holland, France, the Kingdom of Hanover and again to Prussia. Since 1946 the region has been part of the state of Lower Saxony. The dissolution of the province of Aurich in 1978 ended the history of East Frisia as a political and administrative unit.",
