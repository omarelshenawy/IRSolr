				"previous": "China, and many other Asian countries, share a long history of conservative and patriarchal view of marriage and the family structure including marrying at a young age and hypergamy.[5][20][22] The pressure from society and family has been the source criticism, shame, social embarrassment and social anxiety for many women who are unmarried.[5] Chen, another women interviewed by the BBC, said the sheng nu are \"afraid their friends and neighbours will regard me as abnormal. And my parents would also feel they were totally losing face, when their friends all have grandkids already\".[1] Similar sentiment has been shared amongst other women in China, particularly amongst recent university graduates. A report by CNN cited a survey of 900 female university graduates across 17 Chinese universities where approximately 70 percent of those surveyed said \"their greatest fear is becoming a 3S lady\".[23]",
				"after": "The increasing popularity of unwed women in China has been largely accredited to the growing educated middle class.[8] Women are more free and able to live independently in comparison to previous generations.[8] Forbes reported that in 2013, \"11 of the 20 richest self-made women in the world are Chinese\".[24] In addition, it cites that Chinese female CEOs make up 19 percent of women in management jobs making it the second highest worldwide after Thailand.[25] Another noted outcome has been the reluctance amongst male partners to date women who are professionally more successful than they or unwilling to give up work or both.[20] A rapidly growing trend in premarital sex has been commonly surveyed and noted amongst women in China.[22] In 1989, 15% of Chinese women engaged in premarital sex against 2013 where between 60-70% had done so.[22] Chinese Academy of Social Sciences professor Li states that this shows an increase in the types of relationships amongst new generations in China.[22]",
