Pinafore and The Mikado into children's books called The Pinafore Picture Book and The Story of The Mikado giving, in some cases, backstory that is not found in the librettos.[157][158][159] Many other children's books have since been written retelling the stories of the operas or adapting characters or events from them.[160] In the 19th century, the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan songs and music were adapted as dance pieces.[161]",
