				"previous": "In 1909, Holden won the design competition for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Subsequently dedicated to the memory of King Edward VII (died 1910), the extension (1911â12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey loggias, and are a further simplification of Holden's style.[43][note 8]",
				"after": "The practice became Adams & Holden in 1907 when Holden became a partner and Adams, Holden & Pearson when Lionel Pearson became a partner in 1913.[25] In 1913, Holden was awarded the RIBA's Godwin medal and Â£65 to study architecture abroad. He travelled to America in April 1913 and studied the organisation of household and social science departments at American universities in preparation for his design of the Wren-influenced Kings College for Women, Kensington.[25][44] Other buildings by Holden before the First World War include modernist office buildings in Holborn[45] and Oxford Street,[46] an extension in red brick of Alfred Waterhouse's Shire Hall in Bedford,[47] and Arts and Crafts Sutton Valence School, Kent.[25]",
