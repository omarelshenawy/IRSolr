				"previous": "Historically, extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing at different times on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber.[186] With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand.[187] High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s.[188] In 1973 New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community[189] and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression.[190] Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank.[191] Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a highly protectionist economy to a liberalised free-trade economy.[192][193]",
				"after": "Unemployment peaked above 10 percent in 1991 and 1992,[194] following the 1987 share market crash, but eventually fell to a record low of 3.4 percent in 2007 (ranking fifth from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations).[195] However, the global financial crisis that followed had a major impact on New Zealand, with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive quarters, the longest recession in over thirty years,[196][197] and unemployment rising back to 7 percent in late 2009.[198] At May 2012, the general unemployment rate was around 6.7 percent, while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 21 was 13.6 percent.[199] In the September 2014 quarter, unemployment was 5.4%.[200] New Zealand has experienced a series of \"brain drains\" since the 1970s[201] that still continue today.[202] Nearly one quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain, which is the largest proportion from any developed nation.[203] In recent years, however, a \"brain gain\" has brought in educated professionals from Europe and lesser developed countries.[204][205]",
