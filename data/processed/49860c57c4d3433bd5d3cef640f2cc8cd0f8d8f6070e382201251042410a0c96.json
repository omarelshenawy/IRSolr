This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft.[33] The company changed its name to Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations in 1973.[34] A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with initial operational capability set for 1979.[35]",
