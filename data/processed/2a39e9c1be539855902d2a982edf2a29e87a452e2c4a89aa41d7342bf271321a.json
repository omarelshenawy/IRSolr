				"after": "During the post-Euromaidan Ukrainian crisis of 2014, a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 was scrambled to intercept Russian fighter jets that violated Ukraine's airspace twice over the Black Sea on 3 March to prevent any possible \"provocative actions\".[43] With no Air to Air opposition and other aircraft available for Air to Ground duties, Ukrainian Su-27s played a little role in the 2014â15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Ukrainian Su-27s were recorded performing low fly passes and were reported flying top covers, combat air patrols and eventual escort or intercept of civil aviation traffic over Eastern Ukraine.[44][45] During one of these flights, the claim about the downing of an Ukrainian Su-27 surfaced on 15 April 2014, but the video proved to be fake, taken from a previous video of the Syrian civil war. Videos of the Su-27s involved in the operation performing low fly passes revealed they were armed with R-27 and R-73 Air to Air missiles.[46]",
