The state of Utah maintains a Sensitive Species List that includes \"those species for which there is credible scientific evidence to substantiate a threat to continued population viability.\"[64] The Lyrate mountainsnail[65] and the western pearlshell mussel,[66] both native to the Jordan River watershed, are found on this list.[67][68] A 2007 survey of invertebrates and their response to pollution stated that the Jordan River was substantially to severely impaired with organic pollution and that it contained reduced levels of dissolved oxygen.[69]",
