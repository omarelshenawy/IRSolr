In addition to its distribution, B.Â kermesinus can be distinguished from B.Â frostii by having flesh that does not bruise blue and a stem in which the reticulum is not as deep and coarse.[22] B.Â pseudofrostii, found in Belize, produces smaller caps that are 1.7 to 2.0Â cm (0.7 to 0.8Â in) in diameter.[23] Boletus russelli, found in eastern North America, has a red to reddish-brown cap and reticulate stem, but its pore surface is yellow, and the fruit body does not bruise blue.[17]",
