Airline services exist to many destinations in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than any other airport in Britain).[107] A second runway was opened in 2001 and there have been continued terminal improvements. The airport has the highest rating available: \"Category 10\", encompassing an elite group of airports which are able to handle \"Code F\" aircraft including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8.[108] From September 2010 the airport became one of only 17 airports in the world and the only UK airport other than Heathrow Airport to operate the Airbus A380.[109]",
