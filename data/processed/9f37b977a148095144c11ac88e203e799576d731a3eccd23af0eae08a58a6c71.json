				"BushidÅ (wiktionary:æ­¦å£«é,?) literally \"the way of the warrior\", is a Japanese word for the way of the samurai life, loosely analogous to the concept of chivalry.",
				"\"Bushido\" is a modern term rather than a historical one. The \"way\" itself originates from the samurai moral values, most commonly stressing some combination of frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honor unto death. Born from Neo-Confucianism during times of peace in Tokugawa Japan and following Confucian texts, Bushido was also influenced by Shinto and Zen Buddhism, allowing the violent existence of the samurai to be tempered by wisdom and serenity. BushidÅ developed between the 16th and 20th centuries, debated by pundits who believed they were building on a legacy dating back to the 10th century, although some scholars have noted that the term bushidÅ itself is \"rarely attested in premodern literature\".[1]"
