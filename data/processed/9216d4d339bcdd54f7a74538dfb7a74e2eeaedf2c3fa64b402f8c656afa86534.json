				"previous": "The folds of the bed sheets echo the goddess's physical form, and are rendered to emphasise the sweeping curves of her body.[5] The composition mainly uses shades of red, white, and grey, which are used even in Venus's skin; although the effect of this simple colour scheme has been much praised, recent technical analysis has shown that the grey sheet was originally a \"deep mauve\", that has now faded.[14] The luminescent colours used in Venus's skin, applied with \"smooth, creamy, blended handling\",[15] contrast with the dark greys and black of the silk she is lying on, and with the brown of the wall behind her face.",
				"after": "The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by VelÃ¡zquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel.[17] These records mention \"a reclining Venus\", Venus and Adonis, and a Psyche and Cupid.[18]",
