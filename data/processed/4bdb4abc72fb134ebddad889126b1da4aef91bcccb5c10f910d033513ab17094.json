However, the history of the Jewish people is said to repeat events that occurred in the lives of its biblical forefathers; peopleâs lives in the next world, or after death, are to some extent spiritual repetitions of what they did in this world; and some kabbalists wrote[4] that time is composed of seven cycles, which repeat every seven thousand years (a view rejected by Isaac Luria). These concepts give human choices to do good deeds in Olam HaZeh â \"this world\" - some of what Nietzsche called the eternal recurrence's \"infinite weight\".[5]",
