				"previous": "(Additivity implies homogeneity for any rational Î±, and, for continuous functions, for any real Î±. For a complex Î±, homogeneity does not follow from additivity; for example, an antilinear map is additive but not homogeneous.) The conditions of additivity and homogeneity are often combined in the superposition principle",
