				"after": "Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage and the third most popular drink after water and tea. It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsâthe most common of which is malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavored with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavorings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. Alcoholic beverages distilled after fermentation, fermented from non-starch sources such as grape juice (wine) or honey (mead), or fermented from un-malted starches (rice wine) are not classified as beer.",
