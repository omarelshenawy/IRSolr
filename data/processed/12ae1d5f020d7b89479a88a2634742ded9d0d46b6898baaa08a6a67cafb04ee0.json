				"previous": "The observed velocities predicted by the MichaelisâMenten equation can be used to directly model the time course disappearance of substrate and the production of product through incorporation of the MichaelisâMenten equation into the equation for first order chemical kinetics. This can only be achieved however if one recognises the problem associated with the use of Euler's number in the description of first order chemical kinetics. i.e. eâk is a split constant that introduces a systematic error into calculations and can be rewritten as a single constant which represents the remaining substrate after each time period.[11]",
