More specific terms are colt for a male foal and filly for a female foal, but these terms are used until the horse is age three or four. When the foal is nursing from its dam (mother), it may also be called a suckling. After the young horse has been weaned from its dam, it may be called a weanling. When a mare is pregnant, she is said to be \"in foal.\" When the mare gives birth, she is \"foaling\" and the impending birth is usually stated as \"to foal.\" A newborn horse is \"foaled.\"",
