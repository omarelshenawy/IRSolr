				"after": "Following the downfall of Henry the Lion (1129-1195, Duke of Saxony 1142-1180), and the subsequent splitting of the Saxon tribal duchy into several territories, the name of the Saxon duchy was transferred to the lands of the Ascanian family. This led to the differentiation between Lower Saxony, lands settled by the Saxon tribe, and Upper Saxony, the lands belonging to the House of Wettin. When Upper Saxony dropped the Upper designation[when?], a different region became known as \"Saxony\", ultimately usurping the name's original meaning. The area formerly known as Upper Saxony now lies in Central Germany.",
