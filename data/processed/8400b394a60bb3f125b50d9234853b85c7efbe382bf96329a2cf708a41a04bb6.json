				"previous": "During his time abroad, Cooper stayed with the Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about good food and vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe's nobility and upper classes.[81] After guiding him through the great art museums and galleries of Italy,[81] she accompanied him on a ten-week big-game hunting safari on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa,[82] where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes.[83][84] His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness.[84] After returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras.[85] Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932[86] and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.[87]",
				"after": "In 1932, after completing Devil and the Deep with Tallulah Bankhead to fulfill his old contract,[88] Cooper appeared in A Farewell to Arms,[89] the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel.[90] Co-starring Helen Hayes, a leading New York theatre star and Academy Award winner,[91] and Adolphe Menjou, the film presented Cooper with one of his most ambitious and challenging dramatic roles,[91] playing an American ambulance driver wounded in Italy who falls in love with an English nurse during World War I.[89] Critics praised his highly intense and emotional performance,[92][93] and the film became one of the year's most commercially successful pictures.[91] In 1933, after making Today We Live with Joan Crawford and One Sunday Afternoon with Fay Wray, Cooper appeared in the Ernst Lubitsch comedy film Design for Living, based on the successful NoÃ«l Coward play.[94][95] Co-starring Miriam Hopkins and Fredric March,[96] the film received mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office.[97] Cooper's performanceâplaying an American artist in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a beautiful womanâwas singled out for its versatility[98] and revealed his genuine ability to do light comedy.[99] Cooper changed his name legally to \"Gary Cooper\" in August 1933.[100]",
