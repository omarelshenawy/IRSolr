				"previous": "In an article in Communications of the ACM in April 2013, Web technologist Nicholas C. Zakas, noted that mobile phones in use in 2013 were more powerful than Apollo 11's 70Â lb (32Â kg) Apollo Guidance Computer used in the July 1969 lunar landing.[6][7][8] However, in spite of their power, in 2013, mobile devices still suffer from Web performance with slow connections similar to the 1996 stage of Web development.[7][8] Mobile devices with slower download request/response times, the latency of over-the-air data transmission,[7][8] with \"high-latency connections, slower CPUs, and less memory\" force developers to rethink Web applications created for desktops with \"wired connections, fast CPUs, and almost endless memory.\"[7][8]",
