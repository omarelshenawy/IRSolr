				"previous": "On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth television broadcast.[45] This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space. When they finished broadcasting they found a small present from Deke Slayton in the food locker: a real turkey dinner with stuffing, in the same kind of pack that the troops in Vietnam received.[46] Another Slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy, that Borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed. They remained unopened, even years after the flight.[47] There were also small presents to the crew from their wives. The next day, at about 124Â hours into the mission, the sixth and final TV transmission showed the mission's best video images of the earth, in a four-minute broadcast.[48]",
				"after": "After two uneventful days the crew prepared for re-entry. The computer would control the re-entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude, blunt end forward.[49] If the computer broke down, Borman would take over.[49]",
