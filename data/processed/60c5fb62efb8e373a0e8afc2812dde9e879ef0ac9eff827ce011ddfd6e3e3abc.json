				"previous": "With the collapse of the market for musicals, Warner Bros., under Zanuck turned to more socially realistic storylines. For its many films about gangsters;[18] Warner Bros. soon became known as a \"gangster studio\".[19] The studio's first gangster film, Little Caesar, was a great box office success[HBTN 25] and Edward G. Robinson starred in many of the subsequent Warner gangster films.[cph 20] The studio's next effort, The Public Enemy,[HBTN 26] made James Cagney arguably the studio's new top star,[cph 21] and Warner Bros. made more gangster films.[HBTN 26]",
				"after": "Another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, based on a true story and starring Paul Muni,[cph 22] joining Cagney and Robinson as one the studio's top gangster stars[HBTN 27] after appearing in the successful film,[HBTN 26] which convinced audiences to question the American legal system.[20] By January 1933, the film's protagonist Robert Elliot BurnsÂ â still imprisoned in New JerseyÂ â and other chain gang prisoners nationwide appealed and were released.[21] In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold HardyÂ â who was also made into a character in the filmÂ â sued the studio for displaying \"vicious, untrue and false attacks\" against him in the film.[22] After appearing in the Warner's film The Man Who Played God, Bette Davis became a top star.[cph 23]",
