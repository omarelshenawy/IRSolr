				"previous": "Muhammad expelled from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, one of three main Jewish tribes,[14] but some historians contend that the expulsion happened after Muhammad's death.[127] According to al-Waqidi, after Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy spoke for them, Muhammad refrained from executing them and commanded that they be exiled from Medina.[128] Following the Battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances with a number of Bedouin tribes to protect his community from attacks from the northern part of Hejaz.[14]",
				"after": "The Meccans were eager to avenge their defeat. To maintain economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their prestige, which had been reduced at Badr.[130] In the ensuing months, the Meccans sent ambush parties to Medina while Muhammad led expeditions against tribes allied with Mecca and sent raiders onto a Meccan caravan.[131] Abu Sufyan gathered an army of three thousand men and set out for an attack on Medina.[123][132]",
