				"after": "The cuisine of Gyeongju is generally typical of the cuisine elsewhere in Gyeongsang province: spicy and salty.[110][111][112] However, it has distinctive tastes according to region and several local specialties known nationwide.[112] The most famous of these is \"Gyeongju bread\" or \"Hwangnam bread\", a red-bean pastry first baked in 1939 and now sold throughout the country.[113][114] Chalboribbang, made with locally produced glutinous barley, is also a pastry with a filling of red bean paste.[115][116] Local specialties with a somewhat longer pedigree include beopju, a traditional Korean liquor produced by the Gyeongju Choe in Gyo-dong. The brewing skill and distill master were designated as Important Intangible Cultural Properties by South Korea government.[117][118][119]",
