				"after": "Despite the purchase of its Britannias and inauguration of non-stop transatlantic flights the airline remained unprofitable.[14] When Efraim Ben-Arzi took over the company in the late 1950s, the Britannias were replaced by the Boeing 707 jet airliner. The first year that El Al turned a profit was 1960. That year, more than 50 percent of the passengers flying into Israel arrived on El Al flights.[14] On 15 June 1961, the airline set a world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight: an El Al Boeing 707 flew from New York to Tel Aviv, covering 5,760 miles (9,270Â km) in 9 hours and 33 minutes.[17] By this time, El Al was carrying 56,000 passengers a yearâon a par with Qantas and ahead of established airlines like LoftleiÃ°ir. In 1961, El Al ranked 35th in the world in accumulated passenger distance.[21] El Al's success continued into the late 1960s. In 1968, regular flights to Bucharest were inaugurated, and cargo flights began to Europe and the United States. The airline also established a catering subsidiary, Teshet Tourism and Aviation Services Ltd. All these ventures brought in a profit of $2 million that year.[14]",
