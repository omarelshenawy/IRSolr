				"after": "Armillaria gallica is a weaker pathogen than the related A.Â Mellea or A.Â Solidipes, and is considered a secondary parasiteâtypically initiating infection only after the host's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation, drought, or infection by another fungus.[67] Fungal infection can lead to root rot or butt rot.[68] As the diseased trees die, the wood dries, increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning. The resulting forest fire may in turn kill the species that killed the trees.[69] Plants that are under water stress caused by dry soils or waterlogging are more susceptible to infection by A.Â gallica.[70] It has been shown to be one of several Armillaria species responsible for widespread mortality of oak trees in the Arkansas Ozarks.[71] The fungus has also been shown to infect Daylily in South Carolina,[72] Northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) in Italy[73][74] and vineyards (Vitis species) of RÃ­as Baixas in northwestern Spain. The latter infestation \"may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites\".[75] When A.Â solidipes and A.Â gallica co-occur in the same forest, infection of root systems by A.Â gallica may reduce damage or prevent infection from A.Â solidipes.[76]",
