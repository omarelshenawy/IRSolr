				"after": "In the years after the 1918 Armistice, Pankhurst continued to promote her nationalist vision of British unity. She maintained a focus on women's empowerment, but her days of fighting with government officialdom were over. She defended the presence and reach of the British Empire: \"Some talk about the Empire and Imperialism as if it were something to decry and something to be ashamed of. [I]t is a great thing to be the inheritors of an Empire like oursÂ ... great in territory, great in potential wealth.Â ... If we can only realise and use that potential wealth we can destroy thereby poverty, we can remove and destroy ignorance.\"[109] For years she travelled around England and North America, rallying support for the British Empire and warning audiences about the dangers of Bolshevism.[110]",
