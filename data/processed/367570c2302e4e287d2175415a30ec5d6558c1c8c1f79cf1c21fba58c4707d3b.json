				"Consider the lower triangular matrix A,",
				"A matrix with elements above the main diagonal that are all zeros is described as a triangular matrix, or in this case, lower triangular. If the elements below the main diagonal are all zeros then the matrix is upper triangular. The eigenvalues of triangular matrices are the elements of the main diagonal, in the same way as for diagonal matrices."
