				"previous": "In contrast, Pevsner called the reredos \"heavily gorgeous\".[3] One chaplain in the 20th century covered up the reredos with curtains, describing the brown and white marbling as looking like \"corned beef\".[73] Betjeman, however, was heard when showing a group around the college to describe the altar as \"delicious\";[73] he also wrote that the chapel's \"fine classic screen\" had \"somehow survived a fearful 'restoration'\".[6] The curtains around the altar and a carpet covering the tiling in the aisle were removed when the new organ was installed in 1994, following the organ builder's advice that these items detracted from the chapel acoustics.[73] The work proved to be Street's only commission at the university, although he built or restored a number of churches in the city. In his biography of his father, Arthur Street said that it was possible that George Street's \"very decided adherence to the earlier phase of Gothic, and the eagerness with which he argued that Oxford had already enough of debased types, and should revert to the purity of the early forms, may have frightened the authorities\".[82] Casson, although referring to the chapel and other parts of the college from the Victorian era as \"mostly pretty dull\", thought that the \"sturdy pews with their flatly modelled leafy finials hold their own\".[53]",
				"after": "The woodwork removed by Street was sold for a nominal sum, with a condition that it could only be used for a hall, chapel or library.[83] Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow, east London (an institution that previously had no link to the college).[84] Panels under the communion rail were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some of the woodwork was transferred to St Edern's Church, Bodedern, in Anglesey, which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920.[84] Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.[85][86]",
