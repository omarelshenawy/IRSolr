				"previous": "After the renovation was finished, UNESCO listed Borobudur as a World Heritage Site in 1991.[4] It is listed under Cultural criteria (i) \"to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\", (ii) \"to exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design\", and (vi) \"to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance\".[4]",
				"after": "Following the major 1973 renovation funded by UNESCO,[39] Borobudur is once again used as a place of worship and pilgrimage. Once a year, during the full moon in May or June, Buddhists in Indonesia observe Vesak (Indonesian: Waisak) day commemorating the birth, death, and the time when SiddhÄrtha Gautama attained the highest wisdom to become the Buddha Shakyamuni. Vesak is an official national holiday in Indonesia,[41] and the ceremony is centered at the three Buddhist temples by walking from Mendut to Pawon and ending at Borobudur.[42]",
