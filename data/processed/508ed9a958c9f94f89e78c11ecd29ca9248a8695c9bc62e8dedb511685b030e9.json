				"after": "As with all journals of the Public Library of Science, PLOS ONE is financed by charging authors a publication fee. The \"author-pays\" model allows PLOS journals to provide all articles to everybody for free (i.e., open access) immediately after publication. As of July 2010, PLOS ONE charged authors US$1,350[20] to publish an article. Depending on circumstances, it may waive or reduce the fee for authors who do not have sufficient funds.[21] This model has drawn criticism, however. In 2011 Richard Poynder posited that journals such as PLoS ONE that charge authors for publication rather than charging users for access may produce a conflict of interest that reduces peer review standards (accept more articles, earn more revenue).[22] Stevan Harnad instead argues for a \"no fault\" peer-review model, in which authors are charged for each round of peer review, regardless of the outcome, rather than for publication.[23] PLoS had been operating at a loss until 2009 but covered its operational costs for the first time in 2010,[24] largely due to the growth of PLOS ONE.",
