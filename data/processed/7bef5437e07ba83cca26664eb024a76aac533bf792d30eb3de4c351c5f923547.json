				"after": "The Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what CoinAge magazine termed \"near-heroic measures on the part of the Mint\", the piece did not circulate.[45] In a 1974 article for CoinAge, numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, \"the circulation value of the coin has been nil\".[42] Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors.[46] Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected.[47] More than 11,000,000 of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7,000,000 in proof.[37] In May 1972, Treasury Secretary John Connally, testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as \"just unconscionable\", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.[48]",
