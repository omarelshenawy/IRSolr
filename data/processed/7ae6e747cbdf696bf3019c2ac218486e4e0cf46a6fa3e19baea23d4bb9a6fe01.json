				"after": "The invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, started the war in Europe, and the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. Poland fielded the third biggest army[48] among the European Allies, after the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, but before France. The country never officially surrendered to the Third Reich, nor to the Soviet Union, primarily because either of the totalitarian powers did not request an official surrender, and continued the war effort under the Polish government in exile. However, the Soviet Union unilaterally considered the flight to Romania of President Ignacy MoÅcicki and Marshal Edward Rydz-ÅmigÅy on 17Â September as an evidence of debellatio causing the extinction of Polish State, and consequently declared itself allowed to invade (according to Soviet position: \"to protect\") Eastern Poland starting from the same day.[49] It must be noted that the Red Army had invaded the Second Polish Republic several hours before Polish president fled to Romania. The Soviets invaded on Sept. 17 at 3 a.m.,l [50] while president MoÅcicki crossed the Polish-Romanian border at 21:45 on the same day.[51] The Polish military continued to fight, and the last major battle of the war, the battle of Kock, ended at 1 a.m. on October 6, 1939 with the Independent Operational Group \"Polesie,\" a field army, surrendering due to lack of ammunition.",
