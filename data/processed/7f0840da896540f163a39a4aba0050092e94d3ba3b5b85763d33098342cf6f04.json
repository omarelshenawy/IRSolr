The core of the region comprises the lands between the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea, along with the Arabian and Sinai peninsulas. Sometimes, it is used in a broader sense which can include areas stretching from North Africa in the west to Pakistan in the east and the Caucasus and/or Central Asia in the north. The media (such as the BBC) and various organisations usually consider the Middle East to be Southwest Asia (including Cyprus) plus all of Egypt and minus the Caucasus.",
