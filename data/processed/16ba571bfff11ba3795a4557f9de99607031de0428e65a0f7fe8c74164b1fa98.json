				"after": "It was not until the 1965â66 season that color became the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks. ABC, meanwhile, remained in third place and still needed money to grow itself into a major competitor. However, ABC's issues with its transition to color became secondary compared to the network's financial problems; in 1964, the network found itself, as Goldenson later wrote in the 1991 book \"Beating the Odds: The Untold Story Behind the Rise of ABC\", \"in the middle of a war [where] the battlefield was Wall Street\".[84] Many companies sought to takeover ABC, including Norton Simon,[78] General Electric, International Telephone and Telegraph[85] and Litton Industries.[86]",
