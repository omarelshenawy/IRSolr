				"previous": "In the far north of Shoshone National Forest a small portion of the Beartooth Mountains are located north of the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River. The Beartooths are composed of Precambrian granitic rocks that are amongst the oldest found on Earth.[77] Although often considered a part of the Absaroka Mountains, the Beartooths are distinct in appearance and geologic history.[72] Uplifted approximately 70Â million years ago during the Laramide orogeny, the Beartooths consist of vast windswept plateaus and rugged peaks with sheer cliff faces. The Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212) crosses 10,974-foot (3,340Â m) Beartooth Pass, and from there descends to the northeast entrance to Yellowstone National Park.",
				"after": "The Wind River Range is in the southern portion of the forest and is composed primarily of Precambrian granitic rock.[78] Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming, is in the northern part of the range. Altogether eight peaks exceed 13,500Â ft (4,100Â m) and 119 rise at least 12,000Â ft (3,700Â m) above sea level.[79] Fremont Peak, the second highest peak in the range, was originally believed to be the tallest mountain in the Rocky Mountains due to its prominence when viewed from the Oregon Trail by early pioneers.[80] The Wind River Range is popular with mountain climbers because of its solid rock and variety of routes.[81] The Cirque of the Towers in the Popo Agie Wilderness is one of the more popular climbing and hiking destinations, and an estimated 200 different climbing routes are located within the peaks that surround the cirque.[80]",
