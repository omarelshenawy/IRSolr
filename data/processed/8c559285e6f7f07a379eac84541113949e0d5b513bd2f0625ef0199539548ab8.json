				"The concept of Degree Elevation can be repeated on a control polygon R to get a sequence of control polygons R,R1,R2, and so on. After r degree elevations, the polygon Rr has the vertices P0,r,P1,r,P2,r,...,Pn+r,r given by [12]"

The numerator is a weighted Bernstein-form BÃ©zier curve and the denominator is a weighted sum of Bernstein polynomials. Rational BÃ©zier curves can, among other uses, be used to represent segments of conic sections exactly, including circular arcs.[13]",
