				"previous": "McKinley made himself available to the public every day except Sunday, receiving delegations from the front porch of his home. The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion ratesâthe pro-silver Cleveland Plain Dealer disgustedly stated that going to Canton had been made âcheaper than staying at homeâ.[100][101] Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinleyâs home on North Market Street. Once there, they crowded close to the front porchâfrom which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirsâas their spokesman addressed McKinley. The candidate then responded, speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation. The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks; even the spokesmanâs remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative. This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him.[100][102][103]",
				"after": "Most Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan, the major exception being the New York Journal, controlled by William Randolph Hearst, whose fortune was based on silver mines. In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport, Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat, trampling on labor. McKinley was drawn as a child, easily controlled by big business.[104] Even today, these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley: one as a heartless businessman, the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk.[105]",
