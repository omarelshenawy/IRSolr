				"previous": "William A. Scroggs, a student at Oklahoma A&M College, sought to establish an organization that would \"bind [dear] friendship together indefinitely\" and unite members across colleges and universities.[8][9] After some initial planning, he consulted band president A. Frank Martin and Bohumil Makovsky, director of bands at Oklahoma A&M, both of whom agreed to help with the creation of the fraternity.[8] From Makovsky's band, 10 members were selected as the first members of Kappa Kappa Psi: William Alexander Scroggs, Andrew Franklin Martin, Raymond David Shannon, Clyde DeWitt Haston, Clayton Everett Soule, Carl Anderson Stevens, William Houston Coppedge, Dick Hurst, George Asher Hendrickson, and Iron Hawthorne Nelson.[8] The founders accepted chemistry professor Hilton Ira Jones' suggestion to name the fraternity \"Kappa Kappa Psi.\"[8] It was organized on November 27, 1919, and Scroggs was unanimously elected to serve as the President.[9] Legal organization was completed on March 5, 1920, when the fraternity received its charter from the state of Oklahoma.[10] The formal organization of the fraternity was celebrated on either March 23 or 25, 1920, with the initiation of the first membership class and a banquet.[11]",
				"after": "The fraternity grew rapidly in its first years. Within ten years, there were 27 chapters[12] spanning from the University of Washington in the west to Duke University in the east. Only 14 were installed during the Great Depression, while World War II put a further damper on fraternal activities.[12]",
