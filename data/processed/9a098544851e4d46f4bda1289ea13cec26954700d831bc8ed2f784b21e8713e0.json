				"previous": "The Sunseeker II, built in 2002, was updated in 2005â2006 with a more powerful motor, larger wing, lithium battery packs and updated control electronics.[31] As of Dec, 2008 it was the only manned solar-powered airplane in flying condition and was flown regularly by Solar Flight.[30] In 2009 it became the first solar-powered aircraft to cross the Alps, 99 years after the first crossing of the Alps by an aircraft.[32][33]",
				"after": "China's first solar-powered aircraft \"Soaring\" was designed and built by Danny H. Y. Li and Zhao Yong in 1992. The body and wings are hand-built predominantly of carbon fiber, Kevlar and wood. The design uses winglets to increase the effective wing span and reduce induced drag.[34][35]",
