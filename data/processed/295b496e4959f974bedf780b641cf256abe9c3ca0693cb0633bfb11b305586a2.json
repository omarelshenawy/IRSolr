				"Conversely, when one wants to compute an arbitrary number (N) of discrete samples of one cycle of a continuous DTFT, Â Â  it can be done by computing the relatively simple DFT of sN[n], as defined above. Â In most cases, N is chosen equal to the length of non-zero portion of s[n]. Â Increasing N, known as zero-padding or interpolation, results in more closely spaced samples of one cycle of Â S1/T(Æ). Â Decreasing N, causes overlap (adding) in the time-domain (analogous to aliasing), which corresponds to decimation in the frequency domain. (see Sampling the DTFT) In most cases of practical interest, the s[n] sequence represents a longer sequence that was truncated by the application of a finite-length window function or FIR filter array."
