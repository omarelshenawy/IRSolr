				"previous": "Following the MexicanâAmerican War, California was annexed by the United States, becoming the 31stÂ state in 1850. In 1871, the first white settler along Aliso Creek, Eugene Salter, claimed 152 acres (0.62Â km2) along the lower creek, inside Aliso Canyon.[5] The following year the 152 acres (0.62Â km2) were acquired by George and Sarah Thurston, homesteaders who converted the mouth of the creek into an orchard irrigated by its waters for roughly the next half century.[5]",
				"after": "In 1895, Rancho Niguel was acquired by rancher Lewis Moulton (1854â1938) and his partner, Jean Pierre Daguerre (1856â1911). The rancho remained under their ownership for approximately thirty-eight years, and the rancho continued to be owned by the Moulton family until the 1960s. Rancho Niguel was eventually assimilated into Laguna Niguel, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Hills, and Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park.[4][55][56]",
