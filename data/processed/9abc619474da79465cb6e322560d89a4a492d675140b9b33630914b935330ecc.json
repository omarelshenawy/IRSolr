				"The most common simple time signatures are 2 4, 3 4, and 4 4.",
				"For instance, 2 4 means two quarter-note (crotchet) beats per barâ3 8 means three eighth-note (quaver) beats per bar."
			],
				"after": "In compound meter, subdivisions of the main beat (the upper number) split into three, not two, equal parts, so that a dotted note (half again longer than a regular note) becomes the beat unit. Compound time signatures are named as if they were simple time signatures, in which the one-third part of the beat unit is the beat, so the top number is commonly 6, 9 or 12 (multiples of 3). The lower number is most commonly an 8 (an eighth-note): as in 9 8 or 12 8.",
