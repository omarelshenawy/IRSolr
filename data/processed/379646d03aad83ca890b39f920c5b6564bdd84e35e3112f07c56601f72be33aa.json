				"after": "Austral became a government-owned company in 1980. After poor economic performances, there were two failed attempts to re-privatise Austral in 1981 and 1983. All that time Austral and AerolÃ­neas Argentinas were competitors on a number of domestic routes. Realizing that such a situation could not persist much longer, the government decided again to privatise Austral. This was much resisted by the AerolÃ­neas Argentinas' personnel, and more specifically its pilots, who claimed their salaries were lower than those of Austral's counterparts. AerolÃ­neas Argentinas' pilots union understood the government effort was not to solve their affiliates salary conflict, but to focus on privatising a loss-making carrier as Austral was instead. The consequence of this discrepance was the announcement that AerolÃ­neas Argentinas flights were to be indefinitely suspended effective 1 July 1986.[15] The strike affected both Aerolineas Argentinas' domestic and international operations. Argentine as well as foreign carriers were benefited from this strike. Ironically, Austral was included among that carriers, gaining the domestic market share AerolÃ­neas Argentinas lost.[16]",
