She starts singing the first verse of the song as her captivators laugh at her. An alternate scene shows two people fencing inside a white lit chamber, one in black cloths and one in white. Madonna continues groping with the different objects in the torture chamber and dancing. As she repeats the words \"Sigmund Freud\", the soldiers catch her again and douse her head in icy-water.",
