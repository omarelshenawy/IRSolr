				"previous": "The Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered.[276] To determine who should be killed, Himmler created the Volksliste, a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood.[277] He ordered that those of Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour.[278][279] The plan also included the kidnapping of children deemed to have Aryan-Nordic traits, who were presumed to be of German descent.[280] The goal was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the invasion failed, Hitler had to consider other options.[276][281] One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland, Palestine, or Madagascar.[272]",
				"after": "Somewhere around the time of the failed offensive against Moscow in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately.[282] Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europeâeleven million peopleâwere formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of Die EndlÃ¶sung der Judenfrage (the Final Solution of the Jewish question).[283] Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale.[284] By 1941, killing centres at Auschwitz concentration camp, Sobibor, Treblinka, and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing.[285] The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people,[223] including over a million children.[286] Twelve million people were put into forced labour.[248]",
