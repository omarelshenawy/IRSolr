This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions,[10] but in northwest Africa February to April is normal,[11] and in Asia nesting is from April to June.[30] Two broods are common, and three have been raised in a season.[27]",
