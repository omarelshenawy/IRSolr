				"after": "The Sunda rhino is smaller than the Indian rhinoceros, and is close in size to the black rhinoceros. It is the largest animal in Java and the second-largest animal in Indonesia after the Asian elephant. The body length of the Sunda rhino (including its head) can be up to 2 to 4Â m (6.6 to 13.1Â ft), and it can reach a height of 1.4â1.7Â m (4.6â5.8Â ft). Adults are variously reported to weigh between 900 and 2,300Â kg (2,000 and 5,100Â lb), although a study to collect accurate measurements of the animals has never been conducted and is not a priority because of their extreme conservation status.[23] No substantial size difference is seen between genders, but females may be slightly bigger. The rhinos in Vietnam appeared to be significantly smaller than those in Java, based on studies of photographic evidence and measurements of their footprints.[24]",
