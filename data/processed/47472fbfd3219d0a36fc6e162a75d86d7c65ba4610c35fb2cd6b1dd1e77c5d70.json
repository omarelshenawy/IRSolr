				"after": "Banksia speciosa grows as a shrub or small tree anywhere from 1 to 6 or rarely 8Â m (4â26Â ft) high.[2] It has an open many-branched habit, arising from a single stem or trunk with smooth grey bark. Unlike many banksias, it does not have a lignotuber.[3] The plant puts on new growth, which is covered in rusty-coloured fur, in summer.[4][5] The long thin leaves are linear, 20â45Â cm (8â18Â in) long and 2â4Â cm (0.8â1.6Â in) wide. They are bordered with 20 to 42 prominent triangular lobes that have a zigzag pattern. The lobes are 1â2Â cm (0.4â0.8Â in) long and 1â2.5Â cm (0.4â1Â in) wide, while the V-shaped sinuses between intrude almost to the midrib of the leaf. The leaf margins are slightly recurved. On the underside of each lobe, there are 3â10 nerves converging on the lobe apex. The midrib is raised on the leaf undersurface; it is covered with white hair when new but brownish hair when mature.[3]",
