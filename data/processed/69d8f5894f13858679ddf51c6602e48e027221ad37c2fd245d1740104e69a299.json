				"previous": "In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun on January 1, 2010, JAL president Haruka Nishimatsu stated his preference in forming a partnership with Delta over American,[58] and the Yomiuri Shimbun reported shortly thereafter that JAL and the Japanese government-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation would likely choose to form a business and capital tie-up with Delta, as part of which JAL would enter SkyTeam and reduce its international flight operations in favor of code-share agreements with Delta, and that American Airlines had begun procedures to end negotiations with JAL.[59] Both JAL and American denied the report.[60][61] The Wall Street Journal then reported that American Airlines raised its JAL investment offer by $300Â million, to $1.4Â billion, and in separate comments to the press, Delta president Ed Bastian said that Delta was \"willing and able to raise additional capital through third-party resources.\"[62]",
				"after": "After JAL filed for bankruptcy, there were further media reports that JAL would leave Oneworld in favor of SkyTeam,[63] but JAL president Masaru Onishi said on February 1 that the new JAL leadership was \"seriously reviewing the issue from scratch, without being influenced by previous discussions,\" and its decision on an alliance partner would be made soon.[64]",
