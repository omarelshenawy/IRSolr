They are predominantly non-volcanic, but include the stratovolcanoes Mount Baker and Glacier Peak, which are part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. The portion in Canada is known as the Canadian Cascades, although that term also includes the Coquihalla Range, which runs north alongside the east flank of the Fraser Canyon as far as Lytton, British Columbia.",
