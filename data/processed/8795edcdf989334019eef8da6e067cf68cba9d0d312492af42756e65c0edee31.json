In the summer of 1944 Hooker visited the USA and discovered that General Electric already had two engine types of 4,000Â lb thrust running. On returning to the UK Hooker decided to go for 5,000Â lb of thrust, and working with Lombard the B.40 was transformed into the B.41, later to be called the Nene.",
