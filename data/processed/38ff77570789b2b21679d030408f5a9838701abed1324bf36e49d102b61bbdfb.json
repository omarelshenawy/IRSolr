				"previous": "After the plane penetrated through the tower, part of the plane's landing gear and fuselage came out the north side of the tower and crashed through the roof and two of the floors of 45â47 Park Place, between West Broadway and Church Street, (600 feet (180 meters)) north of the former World Trade Center. The plane parts destroyed three-floor beams and severely compromised the building's internal structure.[22][26][27][28]",
				"after": "Unlike at the North Tower, initially, one of the three stairwells was still intact after FlightÂ 175 crashed into the South Tower. This was because the plane struck the tower offset from the center and not centrally as Flight 11 in the North Tower had done. Only 18 people passed the impact zone through the available stairway and left the South Tower safely before it collapsed. One of them, Stanley Praimnath, was on the 81st floor, and his office suffered a direct hit. He witnessed Flight 175 coming toward him.[16] One of the wings sliced through his office and wound up wedged in a doorway approximately 20 feet away from him.",
