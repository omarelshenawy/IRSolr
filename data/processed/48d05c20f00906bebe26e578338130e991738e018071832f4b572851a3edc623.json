				"previous": "On the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude (Ï) is therefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned. If the meridian distance is denoted by m(Ï) then",
				"after": "where R denotes the mean radius of the Earth. R is equal to 6,371Â km or 3,959Â miles. No higher accuracy is appropriate for R since higher precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model. With this value for R the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is 111.2Â km or 69Â miles. The length of 1 minute of latitude is 1.853Â km, or 1.15Â miles. (See nautical mile).",
