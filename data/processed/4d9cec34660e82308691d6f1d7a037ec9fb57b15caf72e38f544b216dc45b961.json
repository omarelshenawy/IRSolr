She was launched on 10 November 1909, and completed on 11 April 1910.[1] On 8 September 1910, the ship suffered an oil-tank explosion and fire while at sea. Six menâChief Watertenders August Holtz and Patrick Reid, Chief Machinist's Mates Thomas Stanton and Karl Westa, Machinist's Mate First Class Charles C. Roberts, and Watertender Harry Lipscombâeach received the Medal of Honor \"for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession\" during the fire.[3]",
