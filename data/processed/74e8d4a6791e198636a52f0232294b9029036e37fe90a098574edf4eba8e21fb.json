				"after": "In December 1595, Kepler was introduced to Barbara MÃ¼ller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Gemma van Dvijneveldt, and he began courting her. MÃ¼ller, heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler's nobility; though he had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium, but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, church officialsâwho had helped set up the matchâpressured the MÃ¼llers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597.[18]",
