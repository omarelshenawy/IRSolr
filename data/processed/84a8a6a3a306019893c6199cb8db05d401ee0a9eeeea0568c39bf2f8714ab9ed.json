				"after": "Miami has a tropical monsoon climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification Am)[36][37] with hot and humid summers and short, warm winters, with a marked drier season in the winter. Its sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the Tropic of Cancer, and proximity to the Gulf Stream shapes its climate. With January averaging 67.2Â Â°F (19.6Â Â°C), winter features mild to warm temperatures; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front, which produces much of the little amount of rainfall. Lows sometimes fall below 50Â Â°F (10Â Â°C), but very rarely below 35Â Â°F (2Â Â°C). Highs generally range between 70â77Â Â°F (21â25Â Â°C).",
