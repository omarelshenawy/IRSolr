				"after": "The Jewish Autonomous Oblast was formed in 1934 in the Russian Far East, with its capital city in Birobidzhan and Yiddish as its official language. The intention was for the Soviet Jewish population to settle there. Jewish cultural life was revived in Birobidzhan much earlier than elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Yiddish theaters began opening in the 1970s. The newspaper ××¢×¨ ×××¨×Ö¸×××××©×× ×¢×¨ ×©××¢×¨× (Der Birobidzhaner Shtern; lit: \"The Birobidzhan Star\") includes a Yiddish section.[32] Although the official status of the language was not retained by the Russian Federation, its cultural significance is still recognized and bolstered. The First Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched in 2007.[33]",
