				"after": "Cherry Springs State Park and the surrounding Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, the composition of the forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard.[10] Over 400Â species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186Â that breed in the state.[46] Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest,[3][20] and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.[47]",
