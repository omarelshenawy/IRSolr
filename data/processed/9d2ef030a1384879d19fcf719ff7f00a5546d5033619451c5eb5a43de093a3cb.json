				"after": "Christianity has the largest following in Peterborough, in particular the Church of England, with a significant number of parish churches and a cathedral. 56.7% of Peterborough's residents classified themselves as Christian in the 2011 Census.[110] Recent immigration to the city has also seen the Roman Catholic population increase substantially.[111] Other denominations are also in evidence; the latest church to be constructed is a Â£7Â million \"superchurch,\" KingsGate, formerly Peterborough Community Church, which can seat up to 1,800 worshippers.[112] In comparison with the rest of England, Peterborough has a lower proportion of Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews and Sikhs. The city has a higher percentage of Muslims than England as a whole (9.4% compared to 5% nationally).[110] The majority of Muslims reside in the Millfield and New England areas of the city, where two large mosques (including the Faidhan-e-Madina Mosque) are based. Peterborough also has both Hindu (Bharat Hindu Samaj) and Sikh (Singh Sabha Gurdwara) temples in these areas.",
