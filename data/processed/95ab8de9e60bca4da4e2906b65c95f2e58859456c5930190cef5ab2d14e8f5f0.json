				"after": "In prehistoric times montane forest occupied one-third of the territory of present-day Rwanda. Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly restricted to the three National Parks, with terraced agriculture dominating the rest of the country.[128] Nyungwe, the largest remaining tract of forest, contains 200 species of tree as well as orchids and begonias.[129] Vegetation in the Volcanoes National Park is mostly bamboo and moorland, with small areas of forest.[128] By contrast, Akagera has a savanna ecosystem in which acacia dominates the flora. There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including Markhamia lutea and Eulophia guineensis.[130]",
