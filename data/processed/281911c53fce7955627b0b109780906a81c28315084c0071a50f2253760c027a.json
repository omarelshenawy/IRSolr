				"previous": "Premium Laurel, EVA Air's existing business class cabin, was introduced in 2003 with the A330-200, and expanded to more destinations with the Boeing 777-300ER in 2005 and refitted Boeing 747-400 (replacing \"Super First\") in 2007. Seats are pitched at 1,549Â mm (61.0Â in) in Premium Laurel in a pod-style layout, and can convert to an angled lie-flat bed.[58] Laptop power is available. Premium Laurel class seating is in a 2â2â2 abreast arrangement on the Boeing 777,[83] Boeing 747 (2â2 in the forward nose section),[84] and A330.[85]",
				"after": "Elite Class, EVA Air's premium economy product, is offered in a dedicated cabin on the Boeing 777 and 747-400. Elite Class has wider seating and legroom (in a 2-4-2 layout), and a seat similar to short-haul business class with an extendable legrest, 970 to 1,020Â mm (38 to 40Â in) pitch, adjustable winged headrests, and laptop power.[58] Service levels in Elite Class are similar to Economy Class, but food and amenities are improved, along with the seating. Elite passengers further receive an amenity kit on most flights.[86]",
