				"previous": "Following the 1969 coup d'Ã©tat, the airline was renamed Libyan Arab Airlines,[8]:487 or Jamahiriya Libyan Air Lines, on 1 September.[7] The company suspended its operations for two weeks after the coup.[7] With Beirut and Geneva already being part of the route network by MarchÂ 1970Â (1970-03), nine international destinations were already served.[8]:487 In AugustÂ 1970Â (1970-08), Libyan Arab Airlines ordered two Boeing 727-200s for USD14Â million.[9] These two aircraft were part of the fleet by MayÂ 1971Â (1971-05), along with three Caravelles and two Fokker F27s.[10] Six Fokker F27s âfour Mk600s and two Mk400sâ were purchased in AprilÂ 1974Â (1974-04),[11] and in May the same year, three additional Boeing 727-200s were ordered,[12][13] aimed at replacing the Caravelles.[7] In 1975, Libyan Arab Airlines was made the only operator within the country. Furthermore, the government committed to cancel their debts with the company on a monthly basis, and any losses the airline would incur should be compensated by the state. Also in 1975, the six F27s ordered the previous year were delivered, and the three-strong Boeing 727 order was partly fulfilled when two of these aircraft were incorporated into the fleet.[7] By AprilÂ 1976Â (1976-04), there were 12 aircraft in the fleet, including four Boeing 727s, four Fokker F27-600s, two Fokker F27-400s, and two Falcon 20s; a Boeing 727-200 and a Boeing 737 were pending delivery.[14] Two more Boeing 727s were acquired in MayÂ 1976Â (1976-05);[15] in August that year, the carrier took delivery of a Boeing 707-320C to be used by the government.[16] The airline had 1,800 employees at AprilÂ 1977Â (1977-04); at this time, passenger and cargo flights radiating from Benghazi, Tripoli and Sebha to Athens, Algiers, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca, Damascus, Jeddah, Khartoum, London, Malta, Paris, Rome, Tunis and Zurich were operated.[17] During the year, the TripoliâFrankfurtâAthensâTunisâCasablanca and BenghaziâRomeâLondon routes were launched.[7]",
				"after": "The handover of two Boeing 727-200 Advanced aircraft, due to be delivered in June and JulyÂ 1978Â (1978-07),[18] was blocked due to concerns that Libya was supporting terrorism.[19] Despite the US State Department initially authorising the acquisition of three Boeing 747s and two Boeing 727s in March the following year,[20] the transaction was blocked in mid-1979 over concerns the Libyan government would use the aircraft to transport military material and personnel, as there were suspicions that Libya played a role in the deposition of Idi Amin in Uganda.[21] Also in 1979, a cargo subsidiary named Libyan Arab Air Cargo was set up. During the year, Madrid, Moscow, Sofia and Warsaw were included in the airline's list of destinations.[22]",
