				"previous": "In 1647 Charles, then a prisoner of Parliament, was brought to the castle for a period under arrest, before being moved to Hampton Court.[144] In 1648 there was a Royalist plan, never enacted, to seize Windsor Castle.[146] The Parliamentary Army Council moved into Windsor in November and decided to try Charles for treason.[146] Charles was held at Windsor again for the last three weeks of his reign; after his execution in January 1649, his body was taken back to Windsor that night through a snowstorm, to be interred without ceremony in the vault beneath St George's Chapel.[147]",
				"after": "The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 saw the first period of significant change to Windsor Castle for many years. The civil war and the years of the Interregnum had caused extensive damage to the royal palaces in England.[148] At the same time the shifting \"functional requirements, patterns of movement, modes of transport, aesthetic taste and standards of comfort\" amongst royal circles was changing the qualities being sought in a successful palace.[148] Windsor was the only royal palace to be successfully fully modernised by Charles II in the Restoration years.[148]",
