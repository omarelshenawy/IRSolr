Around 47% of plants are protected in conservation areas, while 13% are located on road verges.[2] It prefers deep white or grey sand, among tall shrubland, heath, mallee-heath, associated with such species as Banksia baxteri, B.Â speciosa, B.Â attenuata and Lambertia inermis, or low open woodland in the Stirling Range and near Albany, where it is found with Eucalyptus marginata, Banksia attenuata and B.Â ilicifolia.[3] Most of its range has a gently undulating topography, but it also occurs on a steep rocky slope at Ellen Peak in the Stirling Ranges.[2] The annual rainfall is 400â800Â mm (16â31Â in).[32]",
