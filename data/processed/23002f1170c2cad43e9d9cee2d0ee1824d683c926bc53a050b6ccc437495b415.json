				"previous": "The city of San Bernardino, California, occupies much of the San Bernardino Valley, which indigenous tribespeople originally referred to as \"The Valley of the Cupped Hand of God\". The Tongva Indians also called the San Bernardino area Wa'aach in their language.[15] Upon seeing the immense geological arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of the San Bernardino Mountains, they found the hot and cold springs to which the \"arrowhead\" seemed to point.",
				"after": "The city of San Bernardino is one of the oldest communities in the state of California. Named for Bernardino of Siena on May 20, 1810, San Bernardino, in its present-day location, was not largely settled until 1851, after California became a state. The first Anglo-American colony was established by pioneers associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who would be recalled by Brigham Young in 1857 due to the Utah War. The city was officially incorporated in the year 1857. Soon afterward, San Bernardino became an important trading hub in Southern California. The city already on the Salt Lake Road became the starting point for the Bradshaw Trail and Mojave Road to the mines along the Colorado River and within the Arizona Territory in the gold rush of 1862-1864.",
