				"after": "Instead of being hidden \"unmentionables\", Wonderbras became more visible icons of female sex-appeal. The company also used pricing to promote Wonderbra as a luxury product with the highest price of any mass-merchandised brand. This strategy also provided greater profits in a very competitive industry. The goal was to have women see their Wonderbras as a cosmeticâa beauty enhancerârather than a functional garment. Playtex, the leading brand at the time, promoted the ease of care and durability of their girdles and brassieres.",
