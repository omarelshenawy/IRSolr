Bioluminescent fungi are widespread, and over 70 species are known.[53] Although the intensity of their luminescence is generally low compared to many other bioluminescent organisms, fungi glow continuously for days, so their total emission is comparable with that of most brightly luminescent organisms, such as fireflies.[54] Luminous fungi are found growing on decaying wood, leading to the popular name of \"foxfire\" or \"glow wood\" when their glow is visible at night.[55] The responsible oxidative enzymesâknown generically as luciferasesâproduce light by oxidizing a pigment called a luciferin. In some areas, P.Â stypticus is bioluminescent, and the fruit bodies of these strains will glow in the dark when fresh or sometimes when revived in water after drying.[25]",
