				"after": "Rossier first arrived in Japan in 1859, at a time when early experiments in photography were being conducted in KyÅ«shÅ«, particularly in Nagasaki. The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J.Â L.Â C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography.[15] Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures.[16] Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio,[17] Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano TeizÅ, Maeda GenzÅ, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie KuwajirÅ, among others.[18]",
