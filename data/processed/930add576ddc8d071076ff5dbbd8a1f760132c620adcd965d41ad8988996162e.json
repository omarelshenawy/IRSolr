				"previous": "The camas pocket gopher is a mostly solitary herbivore which is active throughout the year and does not hibernate.[48] The gopher spends most of its time excavating tunnels in search of food,[49] and the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley pose a challenge.[10] Although the gopher's front claws are too weak to dig through the clay (particularly during dry seasons), its large incisors and strongly protuberant orientation are well-adapted for this purpose. Tunnel systems constructed by the camas pocket gopher can be complex, with some tunnels exceeding 240Â m (260Â yd) in length. About 90Â mm (3.5Â in) in diameter, the tunnels are up to 0.91Â m (3.0Â ft) deep.[10] When soils are damp the gopher constructs ventilation ducts or chimney mounds (possibly unique to the species),[49] to increase ventilation.[10] The chimney mounds rise vertically 15â25Â cm (6â10Â in), are open at the top and are thought to ventilate the burrows in accordance with Bernoulli's principle.[49] It is not known if adjacent gopher burrowing systems interconnect.[49] Reports differ about whether or not the ranges of the camas pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher overlap; if so, this refutes the previous belief that Oregon gopher ranges do not overlap.[10]",
				"after": "Although the species is primarily fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel.[10] Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material.[50] During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together.[51] Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing,[51] with the young twittering in response.[28]",
