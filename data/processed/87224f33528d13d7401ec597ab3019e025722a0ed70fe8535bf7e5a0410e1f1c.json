Discs are made from a 1.2Â mm thick disc of polycarbonate plastic, with a thin layer of aluminium to make a reflective surface. The most common size of CD-ROM is 120Â mm in diameter, though the smaller Mini CD standard with an 80Â mm diameter, as well as numerous non-standard sizes and shapes (e.g., business card-sized media) are also available.[citation needed]",
