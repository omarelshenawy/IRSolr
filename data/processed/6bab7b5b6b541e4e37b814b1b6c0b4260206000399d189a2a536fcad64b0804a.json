				"after": "Rahman was born in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India in a middle-class Tamil Mudaliar[10] family. His father, R. K. Shekhar, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films; Rahman assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard. After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.[11] Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi),[1] Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and Raja)[3] and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue.[12] He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the \"ideal combination of music and technology\".[13]",
