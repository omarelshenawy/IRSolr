				"previous": "In 1903, the Cooperative Wholesale Society (CWS), bought land at Trafford Wharf and set up a large food-packing factory and a flour mill.[33] Other companies arriving at about the same time included Kilverts (lard manufacturers), the Liverpool Warehousing Company, and Lancashire Dynamo & Crypto Ltd.[34]",
				"after": "The second major American company to set up a manufacturing base in Trafford Park was the Ford Motor Company, in 1911. Initially Ford used its factory as an assembly plant for the Model T, although other vehicles were assembled there in later years, before moving to a new factory at Dagenham, Essex, in 1931.[36] By 1915, 100Â American companies had moved into the park, peaking at more than 200 by 1933.[37] When the cotton industry began to decline in the early 20th century, Trafford Park and the Manchester Ship Canal helped ManchesterÂ â and to a lesser extent the rest of south LancashireÂ â to weather the economic depression from which the rest of Lancashire suffered.[38] During the First World War the park was used for the manufacture of munitions, chemicals and other materiel. Most firms at Trafford Park succeeded in avoiding bankruptcy during the Great Depression, unlike the rest of Lancashire.[39] Ford moved to Dagenham in 1931, but returned temporarily to Trafford Park during the Second World War.[40]",
