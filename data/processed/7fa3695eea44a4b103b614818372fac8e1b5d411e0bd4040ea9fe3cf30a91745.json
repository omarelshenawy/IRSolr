				"previous": "The Comet had a total of four hydraulic systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage.[41] The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump.[42] Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active.[18] The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay.[43] A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.[44]",
				"after": "The cockpit was significantly altered for the Comet 4's introduction, on which an improved layout focusing on the onboard navigational suite was introduced.[45] An EKCO E160 radar unit was installed in the Comet 4's nose cone, providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities,[38] and a radar interface was built into the Comet 4 cockpit along with redesigned instruments.[45]",
