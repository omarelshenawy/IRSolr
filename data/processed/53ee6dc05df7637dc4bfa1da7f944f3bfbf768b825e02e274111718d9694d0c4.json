It was still used as a threshold when Richard Dybeck visited it in 1871, and he arranged so that the entire inscription was made visible in order to make a cast copy.[76] In 1887, the parishioners decided to extract both U 540 and U 541 from the church and with financial help from the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities the stones were removed and attached outside the northern wall. The stone is of red sandstone and it is 1.50Â m (4Â ft 11Â in) high and 1.13Â m (3Â ft 8Â in) wide.[77] Several parts of the stone and its inscription have been lost, and it is worn down due to its former use as a threshold.[77]",
