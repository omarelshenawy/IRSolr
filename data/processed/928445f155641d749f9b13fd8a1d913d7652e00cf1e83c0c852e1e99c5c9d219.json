A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ.[110] The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14â16 weeks with a 4â6-week follicular phase and an 8â10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge.[111] Fertility rates in cows decline around 45â50 years of age.[102]",
