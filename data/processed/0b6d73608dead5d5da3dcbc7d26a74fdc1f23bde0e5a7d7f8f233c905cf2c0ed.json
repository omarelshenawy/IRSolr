Between 1990 and 1993, Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements showed a southward displacement of about 10 centimeters (four inches) per year.[11] Undersea measurements show that a \"bench\" has formed a buttress and that this buttress may tend to reduce the likelihood of future catastrophic detachment.[12][13]",
