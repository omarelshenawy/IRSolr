				"previous": "Females reach sexual maturity between one-and-a-half to three years of age. They typically average one litter every two to three years throughout their reproductive lives,[68] though the period can be as short as one year.[45] Females are in estrus for about 8 days of a 23-day cycle; the gestation period is approximately 91 days.[45] Females are sometimes reported as monogamous,[69] but this is uncertain and polygyny may be more common.[70] Copulation is brief but frequent. Chronic stress can result in low reproductive rates when in captivity as well as in the field.[71]",
