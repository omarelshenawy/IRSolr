				"after": "The oldest records regarding Weimar date to 899. Its name changed over the centuries from Wimares through Wimari to Wimar and finally Weimar; it is derived from Old High German wih- (holy) and -mari (standing water, swamp).[2] Another theory derives the first element from OHG win (meadow, pasture).[3] The place was the seat of the County of Weimar, first mentioned in 949, which was one of the mightiest actors in early-Middle Ages Thuringia. In 1062 it was united with the County of OrlamÃ¼nde to the new County of Weimar-OrlamÃ¼nde, which existed until the Thuringian Counts' War in 1346 and fell to the Wettins afterwards.",
