				"after": "\"I was born to devote myself to culture and sciences\", the Emperor remarked in his private journal during 1862.[98][99] He had always been eager to learn and found in books a refuge from the demands of his position.[100][101] Subjects which interested PedroÂ II were wide-ranging, including anthropology, history, geography, geology, medicine, law, religious studies, philosophy, painting, sculpture, theater, music, chemistry, physics, astronomy, poetry and technology, among others.[102][103] By the end of his reign, there were three libraries in SÃ£o CristÃ³vÃ£o palace containing more than 60,000 books.[104] A passion for linguistics prompted him throughout his life to study new languages, and he was able to speak and write not only Portuguese but also Latin, French, German, English, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Chinese, Occitan and Tupi.[105] He became the first Brazilian photographer when he acquired a daguerreotype camera in March 1840.[106][107] He set up one laboratory in SÃ£o CristÃ³vÃ£o devoted to photography and another to chemistry and physics. He also had an astronomical observatory constructed.[108]",
