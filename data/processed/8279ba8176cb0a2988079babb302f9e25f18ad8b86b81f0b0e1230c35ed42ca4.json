				"The Comtessa de Dia (Countess of Die),[1] probably named Beatritz or Beatriz (fl. c. 1175), was a trobairitz (female troubadour).",
				"She is only known as the comtessa de Dia in contemporary documents, but was almost certainly named Beatriz and likely the daughter of Count Isoard II of DiÃ¡ (a town northeast of Montelimar in southern France). According to her vida, she was married to William of Poitiers, but was in love with and sang about Raimbaut of Orange (1146-1173).[2] It has been hypothesised that she was in fact married to Guillem's son, Ademar de Peiteus, whose wife's name was Philippa de Fay, and that her real lover was Raimbaut de Vaqueiras.[3]"
