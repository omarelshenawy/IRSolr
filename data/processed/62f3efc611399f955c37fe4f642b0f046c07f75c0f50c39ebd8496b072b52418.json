Smith noted that in youth, they are \"difficult if not impossible to distinguish from each other, but this will cause no inconvenience to those collecting for the table, since both are edible.\"[30] In some areas the two species appear to intergrade, as specimens may be found whose spines turn brown but do not fall off.[11] Young specimens of L.Â pedicellatum may also be difficult to distinguish from L.Â echinatum, but the former has a smooth outer surface when mature, and has spores attached to a pedicel (a narrow extension of the basidium on which the sterigmata and spores are formed) that is about 4â5 times as long as the spore.[31] Lycoperdon compactum, found only in New Zealand, also resembles L.Â echinatum in appearance, but differs in having smaller spores, capillitia that are hyaline (translucent) and septate (with partitions that divide the capillitia into compartments).[32]",
