				"previous": "One story â an urban legend â states that when Lieutenant Schwieger of the U-20 gave the order to fire, his quartermaster, Charles Voegele, would not take part in an attack on women and children, and refused to pass on the order to the torpedo room â a decision for which he was court-martialed and imprisoned at Kiel until the end of the war.[34] This rumour persisted until 1972, when the French daily paper Le Monde published a letter to the editor.[35]",
