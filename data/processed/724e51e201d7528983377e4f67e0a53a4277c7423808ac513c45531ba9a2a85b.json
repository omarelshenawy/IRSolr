				"previous": "The Panorama is an 84-inch (210Â cm) panoramic photograph created by local photographer Tom Wall and set in acrylic on a steel stand in the cemetery's northwestern section. It sits at the edge of a bluff directly overlooking the grounds of Lansingburgh High School and Knickerbacker Middle School. The photograph spans a 100-mile (160Â km) view and contains labels and notesâreferred to by the Troy Cemetery Association as \"cliff notes\"âabout the history of objects shown in the photograph.[42] From this point, one can view Albany and the Empire State Plaza (most notably the Corning Tower and Alfred E. Smith Building), the Helderberg Escarpment, South Troy, downtown Troy, Lansingburgh, Watervliet, Green Island, Cohoes, the Cohoes Falls, Waterford, the Hudson River, the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers, and the eastern terminus of the Erie Canal. The Troy Cemetery Association claims that the view offers the \"most concentrated and complete overview of American history anywhere in America\".[5] It shows evidence of paleolithic rocks, Native Americans, the Dutch, the British, the French and Indian Wars, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the \"Way West\" movement resulting in the creation of the Erie Canal and Champlain Canal.[5]",
