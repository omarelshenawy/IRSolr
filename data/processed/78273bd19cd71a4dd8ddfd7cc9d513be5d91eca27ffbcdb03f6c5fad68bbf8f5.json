				"previous": "Chapman played no further Test cricket; in 26 Tests, he scored 925 runs at an average of 28.90 and held 32 catches.[122] He captained England in 17 matches, winning nine and losing two with the others drawn.[2] Under him the team achieved seven consecutive victories, equalling the English record, which was not surpassed until 2004.[123][124] His nine victories came in his first nine games as captain which remains the best record for a new captain in Test matches in 2012.[notes 6][125]",
				"after": "Although Chapman lost the England captaincy after the South African tour, he became official captain of Kent in 1931, having previously captained the side occasionally.[126] Wisden commented that Chapman \"exercised an invigorating influence\" on the side.[127] Before Chapman assumed the Kent captaincy, the county team was sharply divided along social lines and the amateur leadership was aloof from and often dismissive of the professional players.[128] Members of the team felt that he improved the atmosphere within the side and made the game enjoyable. Critics and players thought that he was past his best by the time he became captain, and already affected by alcoholism, but Chapman was successful as leader.[129] His fielding remained influential. However, his batting form was poor:[126] in 1931, he scored 662 runs at an average of 18.38.[17] Sections of the press thought he should remain England captain,[126] but he was replaced as Test captain by Jardine, who was not a popular choice; the selectors chose Jardine to exercise more discipline on the team than Chapman had done.[130] At the end of the season, Chapman toured Jamaica in a team captained by Lord Tennyson and scored 203 runs in first-class matches at 33.83.[17][131]",
