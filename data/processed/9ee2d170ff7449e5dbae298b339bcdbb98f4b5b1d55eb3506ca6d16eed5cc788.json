				"after": "From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia, and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it.[263][264] Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock),[265] particularly the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Small Faces,[266] with American influences, including post-grunge.[267][268] Drawn from across the United Kingdom (with several important bands emerging from the north of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centered on British, English and London life and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height.[269][270] This, beside a greater willingness to engage with the American press and fans, may have helped some of them in achieving international success.[271]",
