The church furnishings, such as pews, pulpit and communion rails, were added in the 18th century, although some of the pews are modern replacements after vandalism. It is a Grade I listed building, a national designation given to buildings of \"exceptional, usually national, interest\", because it is \"a very rare example of a virtually unrestored Medieval church of simple, rustic character\".",
