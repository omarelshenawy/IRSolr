				"previous": "The king vulture has the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures.[18] This bill has a hooked tip and a sharp cutting edge.[6] The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail.[27] The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera.[3] Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes.[30] It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.[27]",
				"after": "The vulture is minimally sexually dimorphic, with no difference in plumage and little in size between males and females.[3] The juvenile vulture has a dark bill and eyes, and a downy, gray neck that soon begins to turn the orange of an adult. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around five or six years of age.[27] Jack Eitniear of the Center for the Study of Tropical Birds in San Antonio, Texas reviewed the plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were the first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards, followed by wing feathers, until the full adult plumage was achieved. The final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in the otherwise white lesser wing coverts.[31]",
