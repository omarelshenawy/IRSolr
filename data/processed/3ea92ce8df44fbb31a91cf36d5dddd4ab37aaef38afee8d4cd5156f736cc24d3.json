				"Thus, the angular velocity of the carrier of a spur gear differential is the average of the angular velocities of the sun and annular gears.",
				"In discussing the spur gear differential, the use of the term annular gear is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the annular gear of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of an annular gear.[1]"
