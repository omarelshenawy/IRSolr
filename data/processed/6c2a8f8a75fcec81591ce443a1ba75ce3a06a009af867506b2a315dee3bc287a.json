				"previous": "The memories of that first flight in December 1962 are still present in the minds of those who have closely followed TAMEâs trajectory, the commercial airline that in its 46 years has become the most prestigious representative of airfreight of Ecuador at an international standard. The first flight was directed by Teodoro Malo, the route was Quito-Esmeraldas-BahÃ­a-Manta- Guayaquil-Cuenca-Quito. When the retired General Jose Montesinos talks about TAMEâs first years, he remembers with nostalgia how âIn 1960, we held the rank of Major, we were pilots of the Dakota C-47 plane, it had lateral seats and the noncommissioned officers worked as flight attendants.â",
				"after": "On December 4, 1962, Majors Luis A. Ortega, Hector Granja, Eduardo Sandoval, Alfredo Barreiro, Oswaldo Lara, Julio Espinosa, Teodoro Malo and Jose Montesinos were young pilots at the Ecuadorian Air Force when they flew TAMEâs inauguration flights. It seems quite surreal now to remember that the first reception lounge was made up of furniture which belonged to the officers' mess of the 1st air area.",
