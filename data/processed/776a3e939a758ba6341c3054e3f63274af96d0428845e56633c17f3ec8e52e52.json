At the highest level (in the context of Latin-script fonts), one can differentiate Roman, Blackletter, and Gaelic types. Roman types are in the most widespread use today, and are sub-classified as serif, sans serif, ornamental, and script types. Historically, the first European fonts were blackletter, followed by Roman serif, then sans serif and then the other types. The use of Gaelic faces was restricted to the Irish language, though these form a unique if minority class. Typefaces may be monospaced regardless of whether they are Roman, Blackletter, or Gaelic. Symbol typefaces are non-alphabetic. The Cyrillic script comes in two varieties, Roman type (called Ð³ÑÐ°Ð¶Ð´Ð°Ð½ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÑÑÐ¸ÑÑ graÅ¾danskij Å¡rift) and traditional Slavonic type (called ÑÐ»Ð°Ð²ÑÐ½ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÑÑÐ¸ÑÑ slavjanskij Å¡rift).",
