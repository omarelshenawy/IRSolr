U.S. Highways are also numbered in a grid: even numbered for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). Three-digit highways, also known as \"child routes,\" are branches off their main one- or two-digit \"parents\" (for example, U.S. RouteÂ 202 is a branch of U.S. Route 2). However, USÂ 101, rather than a \"child\" of USÂ 1, is considered a \"mainline\" U.S. Route.",
