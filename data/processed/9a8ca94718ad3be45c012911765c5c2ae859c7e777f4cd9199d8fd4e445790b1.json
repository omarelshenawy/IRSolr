				"previous": "In 1936 Larry Woodin of Wellsboro and other Tioga County business owners began a tourism campaign to promote the Pine Creek Gorge as \"The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania\". Greyhound Bus Lines featured a view of the canyon from a Leonard Harrison lookout on the back cover of its Atlantic Coast timetable. The bus line's Chicago to New York City tour had an overnight stay in Wellsboro and a morning visit to the canyon for $3. More than 300,000Â tourists visited the canyon by the autumn of 1936, and 15,000 visited Leonard Harrison over Memorial Day weekend in 1937.[22] That year more visitors came to the Pine Creek Gorge than to Yellowstone National Park. In response to the heavy use of the local roads, the CCC widened the highways in the area, and guides from the CCC gave tours of the canyon.[22][24] A PHMC state historical marker honoring the CCC's work in the park and county was dedicated on June 3, 1995.[18] Near the lookout over the gorge there is a bronze statue of a \"Tioga County CCC Worker\", unveiled on August 14, 1999, as a monument to the achievements of the CCC.[26][28][29]",
				"after": "After the Second World War the state took over operation of the park,[22] and expanded its size beyond the original land donated by Harrison: six purchases between 1946 and 1949 increased the park's area from 128 acres (52Â ha) to 585 acres (237Â ha) at a cost of $26,328.[24] The Pennsylvania Geographic Board dropped the word Forest and officially named it Leonard Harrison State Park on November 11, 1954.[20] The park was improved in the following decade with the completion of new latrines (1963) and a new concession stand and visitor center (1968).[24] Pine Creek was named a state scenic river on December 4, 1992, which ensured further protection of Pine Creek Gorge in its natural state.[30] In 1997 the park's Important Bird Area (IBA) was one of the firstÂ 73 IBAs established in Pennsylvania.[31] In 2000 the park became part of the Hills Creek State Park complex, an administrative grouping of eight state parks in Potter and Tioga counties.[32] In 2005 the state began a $1.2Â million upgrade of park facilities, including a new maintenance building, the replacement of three pit latrines at the overlook and campground, the addition of showers at the campground, and the conversion of all restrooms to flush toilets.[33]",
