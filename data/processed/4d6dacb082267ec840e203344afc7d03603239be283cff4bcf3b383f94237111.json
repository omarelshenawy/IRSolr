				"after": "There was a long and somewhat controversial tradition of using manuscripts of the gospel of John, or extracts such as the opening verse, as a protective or healing amulet or charm, which was especially strong in early medieval Britain and Ireland. Manuscripts containing the text of one gospel only are very rare, except for those with lengthy explanatory glosses, and all the examples known to Julian Brown were of John.[101] Disapproving references to such uses can be found in the writings of Saints Jerome and Eligius, and Alcuin, but they are accepted by John Chrysostom, Augustine, who \"expresses qualified approval\" of using manuscripts as a cure for headaches, and Gregory the Great, who sent one to Queen Theodelinda for her son.[102] Bede's prose Life mentions that Cuthbert combated the use of amulets and charms in the villages around Melrose.[103] However, like many other leading figures of the church, he may have distinguished between amulets based on Christian texts and symbols and other types.[104]",
