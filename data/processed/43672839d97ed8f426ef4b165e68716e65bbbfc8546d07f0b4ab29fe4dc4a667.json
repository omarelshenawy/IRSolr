The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled \"Appalachian,\" it is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.[10]",
