				"after": "The most successful of the Savoy Operas was The Mikado (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters,[56] which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in \"human interest and probability\", as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, The Sorcerer. As dramatised in the film Topsy-Turvy,[57] the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884, when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.",
