				"previous": "At 8:46Â a.m., five hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern facade of the World Trade Center's North Tower (1Â WTC), and at 9:03Â a.m., another five hijackers crashed United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower (2Â WTC).[81][82] Five hijackers flew American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon at 9:37Â a.m.[83]",
				"after": "A fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, under the control of four hijackers, crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, southeast of Pittsburgh, at 10:03Â a.m. after the passengers fought the hijackers. Flight 93's target is believed to have been either the Capitol or the White House.[78] Flight 93's cockpit voice recorder revealed crew and passengers tried to seize control of the plane from the hijackers after learning through phone calls that Flights 11, 77, and 175 had been crashed into buildings that morning.[84] Once it became evident to the hijackers that the passengers might regain control of the plane, the hijackers rolled the plane and intentionally crashed it.[85][86]",
