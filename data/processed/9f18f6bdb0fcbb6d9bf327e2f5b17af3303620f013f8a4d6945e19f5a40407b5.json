				"previous": "Embraer considered producing an aircraft which was known as the E-195X, a stretched version of the E-195. It would have seated approximately 130 passengers. The E-195X was apparently a response to an American Airlines request for an aircraft to replace its McDonnell Douglas MD-80s.[37] Embraer abandoned plans for the 195X in May 2010, following concerns that its range would be too short.[38]",
