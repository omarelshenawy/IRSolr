				"previous": "In 1904, Rhodes took 131 wickets, the fewest in a season of his career to date.[15] He scored 1,537 runs, including two hundreds (the second and third of his career) to complete his second double.[16] He generally batted at number six or seven in the batting order, but in two games he opened the batting.[54] In 1905, Yorkshire won the Championship; Rhodes again completed the double, with 1,581 runs, his two hundreds including a double hundred.[16] He took 182 wickets,[15] but Wisden judged that he was not as dangerous a bowler on slow wickets as he had been.[55] Rhodes played in four of the five Tests against Australia that year. He scored 29 and 39 not out in the first Test,[56] but in the second, suffered an injured finger which reduced his effectiveness and caused him to miss the next Test.[57] In the fourth Test, Rhodes took five wickets in the match, including three for 36 in the second innings.[58] However, the England captain, Stanley Jackson, showed, in the words of Wisden, \"a curious want of faith in Rhodes\", even though he was bowling well.[59] His fielding was singled out for praise as he took four catches, two of them regarded as brilliant.[59] England eventually won the series 2â0; Rhodes contributed 146 runs, at an average of 48.66 and a top score of 39 not out,[60] and ten wickets at an average of 31.40.[41]",
				"after": "The relative deterioration in Rhodes's bowling continued into the 1906 season when Wisden commented that he had lost his sharp spin and was not dangerous on a hard wicket.[55] Rhodes scored 1,721 runs,[16] now regularly opening the batting, and completed another double with 128 wickets, but the Wisden correspondent did not believe this compensated for his lost bowling.[15][61] In 1907, Rhodes scored fewer runs and increased his bowling aggregate, securing 173 wickets in a wet season.[15] Wisden believed his greater bowling success was due to a reduced batting contribution, but he still completed the double by scoring 1,045 runs.[16][62] During that season, Rhodes was again asked to open the batting for Yorkshire and he was chosen as the permanent replacement for John Tunnicliffe as Yorkshire's opening batsman. Several batsmen had been tried in the position,[63] but Rhodes's superior defensive technique with the bat secured him the role.[64] Despite the increase in wickets, Rhodes was not picked for any of the Tests that year against South Africa, Colin Blythe being preferred.[65]",
