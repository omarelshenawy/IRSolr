				"previous": "The fundamental theorem is often employed to compute the definite integral of a function f for which an antiderivative F is known. Specifically, if f is a real-valued continuous function on [a, b], and F is an antiderivative of f in [a, b], then",
				"after": "The corollary assumes continuity on the whole interval. This result is strengthened slightly in the following part of the theorem.",
