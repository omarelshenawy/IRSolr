				"The monuments at QuiriguÃ¡ include unusually large stelae elaborately carved from single blocks of red sandstone, brought from quarries 5 kilometres (3Â mi) away.[39] The characteristics of this hard rock allowed the local sculptors to produce low-relief sculptures enhanced by three-dimensional faces, in contrast with the contemporary two-dimensional sculpture of the PetÃ©n region.[101] After the defeat and execution of the king of CopÃ¡n in 738, the sculptural style of QuiriguÃ¡ closely resembled that of its former overlord.[46] The enormous stelae at QuirigÃ¡ originally would have been visible from the Motagua River, which once flowed past the west side of the Great Plaza, announcing the new-found power of the city to passing traders.[102] The monuments include long panels of glyphic text that are considered among the most complex and beautiful of all Maya stone inscriptions. A characteristic of these texts is the use of full-figure glyphs in which the normal bar and dot number glyphs of Maya script are replaced with exquisitely carved representations of the deities.[57] However, by the latter part of the 8th century QuiriguÃ¡ had developed an original style with the production of boulders elaborately sculpted into the forms of composite mythological animals bearing elements of toads, jaguars, crocodiles, and birds of prey; these sculptures are referred to as zoomorphs and were completed by two later kings after the death of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 785.[46][57]"
