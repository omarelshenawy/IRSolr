				"previous": "Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, built by Aerospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at Filton, Bristol. Concorde 001 made its first test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by AndrÃ© Turcat,[35] and first went supersonic on 1 October.[36] The first UK-built Concorde flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, piloted by Brian Trubshaw.[37][38] Both prototypes were presented to the public for the first time on 7â8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show. As the flight programme progressed, 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971, which was also the first transatlantic crossing of Concorde.[39][40] Concorde 002 followed suit on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East.[41] Concorde 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973, landing at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airportâs opening.[42]",
				"after": "While Concorde had initially held a great deal of customer interest, the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations. The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraftÂ â the sonic boom, takeoff-noise and pollutionÂ â had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran.[43] Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made.[44]",
