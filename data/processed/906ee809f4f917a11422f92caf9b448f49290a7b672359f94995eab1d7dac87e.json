				"previous": "Unlike other whales, a right whale has distinctive callosities (roughened patches of skin) on its head, along with a broad back without a dorsal fin, occasionally with white belly patches, and a long, arching rostrum, or upper jaw, that begins above the eye. The callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (whale lice).[16][33] Each individual has a unique callosities pattern. Right whales are very large, robust whales that can grow up to more than 18Â m (59Â ft) long and weigh up to 100 short tons (91Â t; 89 long tons), almost as big as bowhead whales and much larger than other species with high dependencies on shallow waters. An unusually large 40% of their body weight is blubber, which is of relatively low density. Consequently, unlike many other species of whale, dead right whales tend to float.[34][35] Right whales swim slowly, reaching only 5Â kn (9.3Â km/h) at top speed. However, they are highly acrobatic and frequently breach (jump clear of the sea surface), tail-slap and lobtail.[22]",
