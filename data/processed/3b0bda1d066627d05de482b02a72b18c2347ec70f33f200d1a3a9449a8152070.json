				"after": "The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s,[93] both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product. At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower,[clarification needed] only 2.6 percent.[94] David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.[95] The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2â2.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields.[clarification needed][96] However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World (pre-Gorbachev era).[97]",
