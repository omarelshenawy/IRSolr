				"after": "Whatever his intentions, Wright did not return to Italy, rather he was joined in England by his family soon after. Despite his Roman Catholicism and the strong Protestantism of the Protectorate (1653â1659), Wright seems to have been able to find prestigious work. Indeed Waterhouse speaks of him engaging in \"the most deliberate and unblushing toadying to Cromwell\"[7] in his 1658 painting of a small posthumous portrait of Elizabeth Claypole, Oliver Cromwell's daughter (now in the National Portrait Gallery). This is an allegorical portrait depicting Elizabeth as Minerva, leaning on a carved relief representing the goddess springing from the head of Jove with the motto \"Ab Jove Principium\" â an allusion to Cromwell himself, whose cameo portrait she holds.[17] Seemingly, he was also willing to work the other side of the political divide: in 1659 he painted Colonel John Russell who was a player in the \"Sealed Knot\" conspiracy to restore Charles II to the throne.[6] That particular portrait is regarded by at least one critic as Wright's \"masterpiece\".[18]",
