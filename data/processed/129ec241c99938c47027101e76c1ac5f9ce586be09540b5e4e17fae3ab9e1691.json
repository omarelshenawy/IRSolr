				"previous": "Andrei N. Tupolev[1] continued to improve the Tu-144 with upgrades and changes on the Tu-144 prototype. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including such conical camber,[citation needed] and they added a simple but practical device: two small retractable canard surfaces, one on either side of the forward section on the aircraft, to increase lift at low speeds.",
				"after": "Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift (force), but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to 315â333Â km/h (196â207Â mph; 170â180Â kn), still faster than that of Concorde.[2] The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu-144LL test flights as 315â335Â km/h (196â208Â mph; 170â181Â kn), however these were approach speeds exercised during test flights specifically intended to study landing effects at maximum possible range of speeds, regardless of how hard and stable the landing can be. As to regular landings, FAA circular lists Tu-144S approach speed as 329Â km/h (204Â mph; 178Â kn), as opposed to Concorde's approach speed of 300Â km/h (190Â mph; 160Â kn), based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies.[3] It is open to argument how stable the Tu-144S was at the listed airspeed. In any event, when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu-144D to a Tu-144LL standard, the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu-144LL \"final approach speed... on the order of 360 km/hr depending on fuel weight.\"[4] Brian Calvert, Concorde's technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights, cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287â296Â km/h (178â184Â mph; 155â160Â kn).[5] The lower landing speed compared to Tu-144 is due to Concorde's more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise (aeronautics) performance â a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well.[6]",
