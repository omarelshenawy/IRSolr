				"previous": "The approach of different belligerents to fighter design varied widely, with the Japanese and Italians favoring lightly armed and armored but highly maneuverable designs such as the Japanese Nakajima Ki-27, Nakajima Ki-43 and Mitsubishi A6M Zero and Italy's Fiat G.50 and Macchi MC.200. In contrast, designers in Great Britain, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States believed that due to the increasing speed of fighter aircraft, the twisting and maneuvering typical of World War I dogfights would create g-forces unbearable to pilots. These nations' fighters instead were optimized for speed and firepower to allow pilots to quickly engage, dispatch and disengage with opposing aircraft. While light, highly maneuverable aircraft did have some advantages in fighter-versus-fighter combat, those could usually be overcome by sound tactical doctrine, and the design approach of the Italians and Japanese made their planes ill-suited as interceptors or attack aircraft.",
