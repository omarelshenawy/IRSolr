				"after": "4chan was started in 2003 in the bedroom of a then-15-year-old student from New York City named Christopher Poole, who posts as \"moot\".[8] Prior to starting 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the Something Awful forums.[9] He intended 4chan to be a place to discuss Japanese comics and anime, an American counterpart to the popular Japanese Futaba Channel (\"2chan\") imageboard.[10][11] Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using Altavista's Babelfish online translator.[12][13] When he first created the website, it had only two boards: \"/a/ â Anime/General\" and \"/b/ â Anime/Random\"; over time more boards were created, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply \"/b/ â Random\".[12][13]",
