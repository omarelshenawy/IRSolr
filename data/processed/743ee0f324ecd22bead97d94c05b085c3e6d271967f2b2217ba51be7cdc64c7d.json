It was incorporated as a joint stock company on 28 December 1990 and was the first private company approved for scheduled passenger services in the Soviet Union. Its first charter service was Moscow to Tel Aviv on 5 November 1991. In July 1992, Transaero received its own Ilyushin Il-86. It became the first privately owned airline to operate scheduled flights in Russia when it launched its MoscowâNorilsk flight in January 1993 followed by Kiev, Sochi and Almaty later the same year. Its first international scheduled route from Moscow to Tel Aviv was inaugurated in November 1993.",
