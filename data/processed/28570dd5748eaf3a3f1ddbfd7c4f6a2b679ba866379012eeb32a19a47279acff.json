				"after": "Like a directional T interchange, a semi-directional T interchange uses flyover/under ramps in all directions at a three-way interchange. However in a semi-directional T some of the splits and merges are switched to avoid ramps to and from the passing lane, eliminating the major disadvantage of the directional T. Semi-directional T interchanges are generally safe and efficient, though being three-level interchanges they do require more land and cost more than trumpets. Semi-directional T interchanges are built as two or three level stacks. Three-level stacks may use an underpass and overpass at a single point. Two-level stacks have a longer bridge or two shorter bridges on the same roadway.",
