				"previous": "GÃ©ricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820, where it was shown at William Bullock's Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, from June 10 until the end of the year, and viewed by about 40,000 visitors.[51] The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in French art. In part, this was due to the manner of the painting's exhibition: in Paris it had initially been hung high in the Salon CarrÃ©âa mistake that GÃ©ricault recognised when he saw the work installedâbut in London it was placed close to the ground, emphasising its monumental impact. There may have been other reasons for its popularity in England as well, including \"a degree of national self-congratulation\",[53] the appeal of the painting as lurid entertainment,[53] and two theatrical entertainments based around the events on the raft which coincided with the exhibition and borrowed heavily from GÃ©ricault's depiction.[54] From the London exhibition GÃ©ricault earned close to 20,000Â francs, which was his share of the fees charged to visitors, and substantially more than he would have been paid had the French government purchased the work from him.[55] After the London exhibition, Bullock brought the painting to Dublin early in 1821, but the exhibition there was far less successful, in large part due to a competing exhibition of a moving panorama, \"The Wreck of the Medusa\" by the Marshall brothers firm, which was said to have been painted under the direction of one of the survivors of the disaster.[56]",
				"after": "The Raft of the Medusa was championed by the curator of the Louvre, comte de Forbin who purchased it from GÃ©ricault's heirs after his death in 1824 for the museum, where the painting now dominates its gallery.[13] The display caption tells us that \"the only hero in this poignant story is humanity.\"[3]",
