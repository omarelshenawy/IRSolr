The next time you beat any registered Wikipedian or administrator at reverting vandalism or revert vandalism too quickly, you will be blocked from editing in order for you to stop editing and admire the 2,499 Tesla Roadsters you will recieve, and be praised repeatedly and excessively without further notice.--Gg53000 (talk) 13:31, 8 January 2014 (UTC)"
