				"after": "The road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The M50 motorway, a semi-ring road which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes to the rest of the country. In 2008, the West-Link toll bridge was replaced by the eFlow barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration. The toll is currently â¬2.10 for vehicles with a pre-paid tag, â¬2.60 for vehicles whose number plates have been registered with eFlow, and â¬3.10 for unregistered vehicles.[47]",
