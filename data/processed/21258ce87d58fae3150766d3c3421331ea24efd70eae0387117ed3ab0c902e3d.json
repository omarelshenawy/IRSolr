				"previous": "The airline was established as Aeronaves de MÃ©xico on 15 September 1934,[11] by Antonio DÃ­az Lombardo. The first plane was a Stinson SR. Julio Zinser piloted the maiden flight on the Mexico City - Acapulco route on 14 September 1934.",
				"after": "When World War II began, the airline continued to grow with the help of Pan Am, which owned 25% of the new Mexican airline. AeromÃ©xico saw few changes for the next two decades. However, during the 1950s, renovation began, and the airline took over various small competitor companies across the country, including AerovÃ­as Guest (the second airline of the country at that time) that held the routes to Madrid and Paris. AeromÃ©xico added aircraft including the Douglas DC-3 and its successor, the Douglas DC-4.",
