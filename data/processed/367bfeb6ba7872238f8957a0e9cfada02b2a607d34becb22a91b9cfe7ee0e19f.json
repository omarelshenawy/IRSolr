				"previous": "The next Ashes series was held in 1897â98 with Stoddart again assembling an English team to tour Australia. The team included players such as K.S. Ranjitsinhji and George Hirst. The touring team's first match on arrival was against South Australia and Hill batted well, scoring exactly 200.[16] The First Test was played in Sydney and a minor controversy ensued when officials abandoned the first day's play due to earlier heavy rain without consulting the two captains.[17] The delay did not seem to affect the English who batted first and scored 551, including centuries by Ranjitsinhji and Archie MacLaren. The Australians were forced to follow-on after making 237. Batting again, Hill scored 96 but England managed to win the match by nine wickets.[18] The Second Test was played in Melbourne and Australia fought back, winning by an innings and 55Â runs with Hill scoring 58.[19] Another innings victory in the Third Test in Adelaide saw Australia leading the series two Tests to one.[16]",
				"after": "The teams returned to Melbourne for the Fourth Test. England started the match brilliantly, reducing Australia to 6/58[20] on a pitch that assisted the bowlers.[4] Hill, aged just 20, was watching at the non-striker's end as the wickets fell. Hugh Trumble came to join him and together they began to rescue the Australian innings. When Hill reached his maiden Test century, he had scored all but 42 of his side's runs.[4] Hill played balls pitched outside leg stump particularly well and drove beautifully throughout the innings.[21] At the tea interval, Hill, feeling refreshed, mentioned to Trumble that he thought he would \"have a go at them now\". The experienced Trumble cautioned Hill, replying \"You young devil, you have to stop there. Go along as you have been doing.\"[4] Hill and Trumble made 165Â runs batting together, still a record for a seventh wicket partnership in Ashes Tests.[21] Hill was 182Â notÂ out at the end of the day's play, the highest first-day innings against England in Australia, and leaving the ground was greeted by a barrage of photographers. After a rest day, Hill added only six more runs before being dismissed at last by Hearne. His innings remains the highest in Ashes Tests by a player under 21.[4] Batting for 294Â minutes he gave only the one chance at dismissal.[21] The journalist and former Test player Tom Horan wrote \"Hill's innings will be talked of when the smallest boy who saw it will be white with the snows of time.\"[4] Australia won the Test by 8Â wickets to recover the Ashes.[22] That summer, Hill scored 1,196Â runs in 19Â innings including five centuries, the first Australian to score 1,000Â runs in a home season.[4]",
