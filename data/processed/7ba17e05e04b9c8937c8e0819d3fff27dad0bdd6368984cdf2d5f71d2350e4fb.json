				"after": "The 1970s brought dramatic changes for AeromÃ©xico. In 1970, under a government plan, Mexican domestic airlines were nationalized into an integrated air transport system under the control of Aeronaves de MÃ©xico. The system included eight smaller carriers, although these were later disbanded.[11] During the early-1970s, the remaining Douglas DC-6 and Bristol Britannia aircraft were retired. A new color scheme (orange and black) was introduced and the airline changed its name from \"Aeronaves de MÃ©xico\" to its current, shortened version of AeromÃ©xico in February 1972.",
