Festivities included services at which the Bishops of Armidale and Bathurst were special preachers, music, processions, a lantern lecture on \"Old Sydney\" by the municipal librarian, and social events such as a ferry outing and a luncheon at which the chief guest was the Governor Sir Walter Davidson accompanied by his wife Lady Davidson.[52] Also scheduled was a welcome to soldiers returned from the Great War.[11][57] An illustrated historical memoir was produced and sold for two shillings.[58]",
