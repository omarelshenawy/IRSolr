				"previous": "Slow lorises range in weight from the Bornean slow loris at 265 grams (9.3Â oz) to as much as 2,100 grams (74Â oz) for the Bengal slow loris.[67] Slow lorises have stout bodies,[58] and their tails are only stubs and hidden beneath the dense fur.[7][58] Their combined head and body lengths vary by species, but range from 18 to 38Â cm (7.1 to 15.0Â in) between all species.[58] The trunk is longer than in other living strepsirrhines[68] because they have 15â16 thoracic vertebrae, compared to 12â14 in other living strepsirrhines.[69] This gives them greater mobility when twisting and extending towards nearby branches.[60] Their other vertebrae include seven cervical vertebrae, six or seven lumbar vertebrae, six or seven sacral vertebrae, and seven to eleven caudal vertebrae.[69]",
				"after": "Unlike galagos, which have longer legs than arms, slow lorises have arms and legs of nearly equal length.[7] Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, indicating that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs.[58] As with the slender lorises, their arms are slightly longer than their body,[69] but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.[58]",
