				"after": "Zapiekanki first appeared in the streets of Polish towns in the 1970s. Under Edward Gierek's Polish United Workers' Party leadership, Poland's Communist authorities allowed a degree of private enterprise in the catering industry. This move led to quick proliferation of small family-owned foodservice establishments, known in Polish as maÅa gastronomia, or \"small gastronomy\". Their spread continued during the food shortages of the following decade. They usually took the form of stands or travel trailers serving zapiekanki along with simple dishes of Polish cuisine, such as kieÅbasa sausage, boiled ham hock or tripe soup, and American fast food staples, like hot dogs, hamburgers and French fries.[5][6] The American journalist Anne Applebaum, who first came to Poland in 1988, described the zapiekanka of that time as \"a pizzalike substance\" and \"a poor relative of its distant Italian cousin\", \"a mushy white sandwich roll\" with \"a few overcooked mushrooms\" beneath \"melted cheese and a squeeze of ketchup\", which she ate nonetheless because little else was available.[7]",
