				"previous": "In 2012, the urban section of Little Sugar Creek Greenway was completed. Inspired in part by the San Antonio River Walk, and integral to Charlotte's extensive urban park system, it is \"a huge milestone\" according to Gwen Cook, greenway planner for Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation.[27]",
				"after": "Park Road and the SouthPark area have an extensive array of shopping and dining offerings, with SouthPark essentially serving as a second urban core. Blossoming neighborhoods like Sedgefield, Dilworth and South End are great examples of that. A prominent feature of the SouthPark neighborhood is the 120âacre Park Road Park.[28] Far South Boulevard is home to a large Hispanic community. Many students, researchers, and affiliated professionals live near UNCÂ Charlotte in the northeast area known as University City.",
