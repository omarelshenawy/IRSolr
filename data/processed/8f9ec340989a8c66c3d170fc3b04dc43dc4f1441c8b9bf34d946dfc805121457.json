				"previous": "Structure 11 has been excavated. It was covered with rounded boulders held together with clay.[19] It is located to the west of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.[55]",
				"after": "Structure 12 lies to the east of StructureÂ 11.[88] It has also been excavated and, like StructureÂ 11, it is covered with rounded boulders held together with clay.[19] It lies to the east of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.[55] The structure is a three-tiered platform with stairways on the east and west sides. The visible remains date to the Early Classic but they overlie Late Preclassic construction. A row of sculptures lines the west side of the structure, including six monuments, a stela and an altar.[55] Further monuments line the east side, one of which may be the head of a crocodilian, the others are plain. SculptureÂ 69 is located on the south side of the structure.[88]",
