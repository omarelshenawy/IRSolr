				"previous": "Except in the Northern Hemisphere summer season, the predominant winds over Hispaniola are the northeast trade winds. As in Jamaica and Cuba, these winds deposit their moisture on the northern mountains and create a distinct rain shadow on the southern coast, where some areas receive as little as 400 millimetres (16Â in) of rainfall and have semi-arid climates. Annual rainfalls under 600 millimetres (24Â in) also occur on the southern coast of Haitiâs northwest peninsula and in the central AzÃºa region of the Plaine du Cul-de-Sac. In these regions, moreover, there is generally little rainfall outside hurricane season from August to October and droughts are by no means uncommon when hurricanes do not come.[27]",
				"after": "On the northern coast, in contrast, rainfall may peak between December and February, though some rain falls in all months of the year. Annual amounts typically range from 1,700 to 2,000 millimetres (67 to 79Â in) on the northern coastal lowlands;[26] there is probably much more in the Cordillera Septentrional, though no data exist.",
