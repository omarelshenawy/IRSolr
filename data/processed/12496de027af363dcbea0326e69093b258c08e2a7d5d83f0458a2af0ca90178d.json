				"after": "The clear-cutting of forests in the 19th century adversely affected the ecology of the Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality.[39] Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries.[13][26][40] As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine.[41] Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) are 25Â mg/L, while fecal coliform bacteria count limits are 200 per 100Â mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100Â mL in October through April.[42]",
