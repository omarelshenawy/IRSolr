				"previous": "On August 20, 1393âwhen the Signoria, at the suggestion of Coluccio Salutati, voted to erect a marble statue of Hawkwood in the Duomo, \"that brave men may know that the commune of Florence recompenses true service\"âHawkwood was liquidating his Tuscan properties and preparing to return to England.[33] It was unprecedented for the Signoria to vote to erect a monument to a living person in the cathedral.[15] The ambiguous plans of the Signoriaâwhich likely was aware of Hawkwood's health statusâmight well have been for a tomb rather than a cenotaph; Hawkwood died soon after, on March 17, 1394.[34] The Signoria went to great lengths (unsuccessfully) to entice Donnina to remain in the cityâvoting to transfer various sums of money to her (in exchange for Hawkwood's Tuscan fortress), despite \"thorny legal issues\" which required multiple acts of the city councilâindicating to some extent the market value of Hawkwood's symbolic capital.[35]",
				"after": "Hawkwood's March 20 funeral began in the Piazza della Signoria, continued to the Battistero di San Giovanni, where his body was placed on the baptismal font for public viewing, and culminated in the Cathedral, at a cost of 410Â florins, not counting the substantial expenses of the Guilds.[36]",
