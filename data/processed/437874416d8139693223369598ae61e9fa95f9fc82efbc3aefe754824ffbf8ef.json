				"after": "The New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), once endemic to New Zealand, has spread widely and has become naturalised and an invasive species in many areas including: Australia, Tasmania, Asia (Japan[74]), in the Garmat Ali River in Iraq since 2008[75]), Europe (since 1859 in England), and North America (U.S. and Canada: Thunder Bay in Ontario since 2001, British Columbia since July 2007[74]), most likely inadvertently during human activity.[76] It can reach concentrations greater than 500,000 per mÂ², endangering the food chain by outcompeting native snails and water insects for food, leading to sharp declines in native populations.[77] There is evidence North American fishes are unable to digest the tiny but hard shells of the mud snail, and that their presence may result in poor growth outcomes for rainbow trout.[78]",
