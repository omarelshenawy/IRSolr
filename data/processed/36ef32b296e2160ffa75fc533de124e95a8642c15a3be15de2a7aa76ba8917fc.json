				"previous": "Another approach is to use differential air braking to affect the drag directly. This technique is suited to Electronic flight controls, as on the Northrop Grumman B-2 flying wing.[26]",
				"after": "On some aircraft, horizontal and vertical stabilizers are combined in a pair of surfaces named V-tail. In this arrangement, two stabilizers (fins and rudders) are mounted at 100 - 120Â° to each other,[note 1] giving a larger horizontal projected area than vertical one as in the majority of conventional tails. The moving control surfaces are then named ruddervators.[27][note 2] The V-tail thus acts both as a yaw and pitch stabilizer.",
