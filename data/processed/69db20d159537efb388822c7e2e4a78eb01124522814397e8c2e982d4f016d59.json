If the value of this integral is zero the transition is forbidden. In practice, the integral itself does not need to be calculated to determine a selection rule. It is sufficient to determine the symmetry of transition moment function, . If the symmetry of this function spans the totally symmetric representation of the point group to which the atom or molecule belongs then its value is (in general) not zero and the transition is allowed. Otherwise, the transition is forbidden.",
