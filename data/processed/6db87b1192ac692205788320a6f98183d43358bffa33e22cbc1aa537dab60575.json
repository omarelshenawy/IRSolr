				"previous": "The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD, largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions.[81] The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d.Â 184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d.Â 216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD.[82] Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings.[83] Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.[84]",
				"after": "General-in-Chief He Jin (d.Â 189 AD), half-brother to Empress He (d. 189 AD), plotted with Yuan Shao (d.Â 202 AD) to overthrow the eunuchs by having several generals march to the outskirts of the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution.[86] After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao (ä½è) rescind the order.[87] The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu (d.Â 199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed.[88] Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao (r.Â 189 AD) and his brother Liu Xieâthe future Emperor Xian of Han (r. 189â220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.[89]",
