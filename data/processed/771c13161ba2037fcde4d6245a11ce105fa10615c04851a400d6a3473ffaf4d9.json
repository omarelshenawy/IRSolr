				"after": "Since the arrival of the 747-400, several stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed. Boeing announced the larger 747-500X and -600X preliminary designs in 1996.[84] The new variants would have cost more than US$5Â billion to develop,[84] and interest was not sufficient to launch the program.[85] In 2000, Boeing offered the more modest 747X and 747X stretch derivatives as alternatives to the Airbus A3XX. However, the 747X family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production. A year later, Boeing switched from the 747X studies to pursue the Sonic Cruiser,[86] and after the Sonic Cruiser program was put on hold, the 787 Dreamliner.[87] Some of the ideas developed for the 747X were used on the 747-400ER, a longer range variant of the 747-400.[88]",
