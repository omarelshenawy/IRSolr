				"previous": "In more recent times, massive ice sheets at least one kilometer thick ravaged the landscape of the state and sculpted its current terrain.[13] The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago.[13] These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift.[16] Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50Â feet (15Â m) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling.[13] Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, and most of them are minor.[17]",
				"after": "The state's high point is Eagle Mountain at 2,301Â feet (701Â m), which is only 13 miles (21Â km) away from the low of 601Â feet (183Â m) at the shore of Lake Superior.[15][18] Notwithstanding dramatic local differences in elevation, much of the state is a gently rolling peneplain.[13]",
