				"after": "When Madonna was five years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, died of breast cancer at the age ofÂ 30.[1] Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's behavior and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons.[2] Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. \"I remember feeling stronger than she was\", Madonna recalled, \"I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child.\"[2] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. \"There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.Â ... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also.\"[3]",
