LabillardiÃ¨re described it in his 1805 work Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, giving it its current name Epacris impressa.[1] The Latin specific epithet impressa (meaning \"impressed\" or \"indented\") alludes to the indentations on the floral tube.[11] The original mounted specimen is currently held at the National Herbarium of Victoria at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne.[12]",
