				"As with much of Haringey, Noel Park is now one of the most ethnically diverse areas in the world. In 2002, 86% of pupils attending Noel Park School were from ethnic minorities.[1]",
				"In line with the original principles of the Artizans Company, there are still no public houses in Noel Park. In 2008 parts of Noel Park and the surrounding area were declared a Controlled Drinking Zone, allowing police to confiscate alcohol from those engaged in anti-social behaviour.[63]"
