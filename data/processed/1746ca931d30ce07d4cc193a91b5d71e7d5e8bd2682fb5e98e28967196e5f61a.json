				"previous": "Open content is a neologism coined by David Wiley in 1998[1] which describes a creative work that others can copy or modify. The term evokes open source software, which is a related concept in software.[2]",
				"after": "When the term OpenContent was first used by Wiley, it described works licensed under the Open Content License (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and perhaps other works licensed under similar terms.[2] It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The openness of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law.[3] Unlike open source and free content, there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.",
