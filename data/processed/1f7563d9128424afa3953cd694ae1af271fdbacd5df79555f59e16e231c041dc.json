				"previous": "Usually a power trio, MotÃ¶rhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, its follow on, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented MotÃ¶rhead's reputation as one of Britain's foremost heavy metal groups. More recent exposure has included providing wrestler Triple H's entrance music, and performing live at WrestleMania events; and in 2004, contributing the song, \"You Better Swim\", to the soundtrack of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. In 2005 the band received their first Grammy.",
				"after": "While MotÃ¶rhead are typically classified as heavy metal, speed metal or thrash metal (and often regarded as a foundational influence on the latter two syles); Lemmy dislikes such labels, preferring to describe the band's music simply as \"rock and roll\". MotÃ¶rhead's approach has remained the same over the band's career, preferring to play what they enjoy and do best, their like for the early rock and roll is reflected in some of their occasional cover songs. MotÃ¶rhead's lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and \"life on the road\". World-wide the band has sold more than 41 million albums.",
