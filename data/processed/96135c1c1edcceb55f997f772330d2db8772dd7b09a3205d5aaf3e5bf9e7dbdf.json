				"after": "Hilberg argued against overstating the extent of Jewish resistance, or using all-encompassing definitions of it like that deployed by Gilbert. \"When relatively isolated or episodic acts of resistance are represented as typical, a basic characteristic of the German measures is obscured\", namely that the merciless slaughter of peaceable innocent people is turned into some kind of battle. \"The inflation of resistance has another consequence which has been of concern to those Jews who have regarded themselves as the actual resisters. If heroism is an attribute that should be assigned to every member of the European Jewish community, it will diminish the accomplishment of the few who took action.\" Finally, the blending of the passive majority with the active few was \"not merely a form of dilution, which blurred the multitudinous problems of organizing a defense in a cautious, reluctant Jewish community; it was also a way of shutting off a great many questions about that community, its reasoning and survival strategy.\" Without posing these questions, Jewish history could not be written.[226]",
