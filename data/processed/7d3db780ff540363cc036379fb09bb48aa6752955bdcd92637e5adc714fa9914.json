				"previous": "The youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains, the Teton Range began forming between 6 to 9Â million years ago.[56] It runs roughly north to south and rises from the floor of Jackson Hole without any foothills along a 40Â mi (64Â km) long by 7 to 9Â mi (11 to 14Â km) wide active fault-block mountain front.[52] The range tilts westward, rising abruptly above Jackson Hole valley which lies to the east but more gradually into Teton Valley to the west. A series of earthquakes along the Teton Fault slowly displaced the western side of the fault upward and the eastern side of the fault downward at an average of 1 foot (30Â cm) of displacement every 300â400Â years.[56] Most of the displacement of the fault occurred in the last 2Â million years.[57] While the fault has experienced up to 7.5âearthquake magnitude events since it formed, it has been relatively quiescent during historical periods, with only a few 5.0âmagnitude or greater earthquakes known to have occurred since 1850.[58]",
				"after": "In addition to 13,775Â ft (4,199Â m) high Grand Teton, another nine peaks are over 12,000Â ft (3,700Â m) above sea level.[59] Eight of these peaks between Avalanche and Cascade Canyons make up the often-photographed Cathedral Group.[60] The most prominent peak north of Cascade Canyon is the monolithic Mount Moran (12,605Â ft (3,842Â m)) which rises 5,728Â ft (1,746Â m) above Jackson Lake.[61] To the north of Mount Moran, the range eventually merges into the high altitude Yellowstone Plateau. South of the central Cathedral Group the Teton Range tapers off near Teton Pass and blends into the Snake River Range.[62]",
