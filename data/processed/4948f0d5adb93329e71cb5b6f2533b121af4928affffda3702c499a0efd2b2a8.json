				"previous": "There is a native Christian community in Bahrain. Non-Muslim Bahraini citizens may number around 1,000 people, most of which are Christians.[243][note 1] Expatriate Christians make up the majority of Christians in Bahrain, while native Christian Bahrainis (who hold Bahraini citizenship) make up a smaller community. Alees Samaan, the current Bahraini ambassador to the United Kingdom is a native Christian. Bahrain also has a native Jewish community numbering thirty-seven Bahraini citizens.[244] Various sources cite Bahrain's native Jewish community as being from 36 to 50 people,[245]",
				"after": "Due to an influx of immigrants and guest workers from Southern Asian countries, such as India, Philippines and Sri Lanka, the overall percentage of Muslims in the country has declined in recent years.[246] According to the 2001 census, 81.2% of Bahrain's population was Muslim, 10% were Christian, and 9.8% practised Hinduism or other religions.[1] The 2010 census records that the Muslim proportion had fallen to 70.2% (the 2010 census did not differentiate between the non-Muslim religions).[7] Bahrain government officials rejected reports from Bahraini opposition that the administration was trying to alter the country's demographics by naturalizing Sunni Syrians.[247] Baha'is constitute approximately 1% of Bahrain's total population.[248]",
