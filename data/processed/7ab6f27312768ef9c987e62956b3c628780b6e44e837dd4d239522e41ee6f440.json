After an inbound aircraft arrives it is the lav agent's job to flush the lavatory system. In stations with higher volumes of passenger traffic, lavatory agents will usually utilize trucks adapted with large tanks on board that do not need to be emptied as often. These are also configured to facilitate access to the waste ports of the aircraft, which can be out of reach by other means. In places where fewer or smaller aircraft are being serviced a \"lav cart\" (essentially a small lav truck pulled behind a tug) is used to service the lavatories.",
