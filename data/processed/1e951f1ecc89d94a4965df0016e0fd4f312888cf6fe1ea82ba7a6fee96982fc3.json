				"after": "Landscape was a secondary concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare and when they did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations;[J] the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes.[166] Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.Â 1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435â40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.[102]",
