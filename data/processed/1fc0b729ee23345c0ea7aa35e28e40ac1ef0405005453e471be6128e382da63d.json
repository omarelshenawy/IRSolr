				"previous": "The shape of the cap of the young fruit body ranges from a half sphere to convex, later becoming broadly convex to flat or shallowly depressed, with a diameter of 5â15Â cm (2.0â5.9Â in).[12] The edge of the cap is curved inward, although as it ages it can uncurl and turn upward. In moist conditions, the cap surface is sticky as a result of its cuticle, which is made of gelatinized hyphae. If the fruit body has dried out after a rain, the cap is especially shiny,[4] sometimes appearing finely areolate (having a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked, dried mud).[12] Young mushrooms have a whitish bloom on the cap surface.[13]",
				"after": "The color is bright red initially, but fades with age. The flesh is up to 2.5Â cm (1.0Â in) thick, and ranges in color from pallid to pale yellow to lemon yellow.[12] The flesh has a variable staining reaction in response to bruising, so some specimens may turn deep blue almost immediately, while others turn blue weakly and slowly.[4]",
