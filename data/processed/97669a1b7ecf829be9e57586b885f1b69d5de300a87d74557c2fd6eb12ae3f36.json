				"previous": "In November 2009, FedEx Express purchased 51 gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles from Azure Dynamics. The new trucks will be put into service in The Bronx, New York City. The Bronx will be FedEx's first all hybrid station. The addition will bring FedEx Expressâ fleet of hybrid electric and electric vehicles to 325.[48]",
			"after": [
				"FedEx Express has set a goal of getting 30 percent of its jet fuel from petroleum alternatives by 2030.[49]",
				"FedEx phased out its last Boeing 727s in 2013 replacing them with Boeing 757s; the airline says the 757s are 47 percent more fuel-efficient. FedEx will eventually switch from MD-11s to Boeing 777s for its long-range, international routes, freeing up the MD-11 fleet to fly shorter routes currently flown by the DC-10.[49]"
