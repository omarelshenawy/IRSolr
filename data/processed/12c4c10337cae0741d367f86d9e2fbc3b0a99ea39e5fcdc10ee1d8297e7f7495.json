				"after": "The human use of fungi for food preparation or preservation and other purposes is extensive and has a long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering drugs. More recently, methods have been developed for genetic engineering of fungi,[183] enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species[184]âwhich are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vesselsâhas opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.[185]",
