				"after": "In MayÂ 2008Â (2008-05), an initial agreement between the Argentine government and Grupo Marsans in which the latter would decrease its participation in the airline to 35% was announced; in reducing their holding, Marsans would make room for new private investors as well as for the government of Argentina to increase its stake in the airline from 5% to 20%.[85][86] Amid accusations from Marsans[87] and following the disclosure of an agreement,[88][89][90] the Argentine Government took the airline back into state control in JulyÂ 2008Â (2008-07) after acquiring 99.4% of the stake for an undisclosed price; the remaining 0.6% continued being owned by the company's employees.[6][91] At this time, the company had 40% of its fleet grounded.[92] The Act renationalising AerolÃ­neas Argentinas and its subsidiary Austral LÃ­neas AÃ©reas was passed by the Chamber of Deputies in August 2008,[93] and became law in SeptemberÂ 2008Â (2008-09) following the 46-21 vote in the Argentine Senate.[94][95][96] There were disagreements regarding the value to be paid by Grupo Marsans to the government.[97] Negotiations fell through, and an administrator was appointed by an Argentine court in November that year in order to oversee the running of the company.[98] A vote by both the lower and the upper houses of the Argentine congress in support of taking over the company and its subsidiaries took place in December,[99] when the Chamber of Deputies voted 152-84 in favor of the expropriation,[100] and the Senate approved the bill by a 42-20 vote.[101][102]",
