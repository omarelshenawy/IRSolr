				"after": "Historically political sociology concerned the relations between political organisation and society. A typical research question in this area might be: \"Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?\"[147] In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical survey research by Paul Lazarsfeld. A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyse socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of Max Weber and Moisey Ostrogorsky.[148]",
