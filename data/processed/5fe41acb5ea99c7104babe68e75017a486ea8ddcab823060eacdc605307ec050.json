				"previous": "The titles of a number of scenes link pairs or larger groups, even if the scenes themselves are not related. Examples include plates 2 and 3 (With or without reason and The same), 4 and 5 (The woman are courageous and And they are fierce), and 9, 10 and 11 (They do not want to, Nor these and Or these). Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates 46 and 47 (This is bad and This is how it happened), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.[48]",
				"after": "The BermÃºdez album was borrowed by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed,[a 8] one plate had work added, and the printing was carried out with much more ink on the plates (producing \"surface tone\") than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste.[49] The BermÃºdez set is considered \"uniquely importantÂ ... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, and the way he intended the plates to be printed\".[46] There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small Prisioneros).",
