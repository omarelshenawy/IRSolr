				"The following is a list of seaplanes and amphibious aircraft, which includes floatplanes and flying boats. This list does not include ekranoplans, 'Wing-In-Ground-effect' (WIG), water-skimmers, wingships or similar vehicles reliant on ground effect. Seaplanes are any aircraft that has the capability of landing on water while amphibians are equipped with wheels to alight on land, as well as being able to land on the water. Flying boats rely on the fuselage or hull for buoyancy, while floatplanes rely on external pontoons or floats. Some experimental aircraft used specially designed skiis to skim across the water but did not always have a corresponding ability to float."
