				"after": "Small-scale lumbering continued in the watershed in the 20th century, but the last logs were floated under the bridge down Plunketts Creek to Loyalsock Creek in 1905.[7] In 1918, a flood on the creek damaged the road for 100 feet (30Â m) on both sides of the bridge, and caused \"settling and cracking of the bridge itself\".[2] The bridge had needed repairs and reconstruction. In 1931, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed legislation that gave the state responsibility for the costs of road and bridge maintenance for many highways belonging to local municipalities. This took effect in 1932, relieving Plunketts Creek Township and Lycoming County of the responsibility.[2]",
