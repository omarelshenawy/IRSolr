				"previous": "The B-52B was the first version to enter service with the USAF on 29 June 1955 with the 93rd Bombardment Wing at Castle AFB in California.[218] This version included minor changes to engines and avionics, enabling an extra 12,000 pounds of thrust using water injection.[220] Temporary grounding of the aircraft after a crash in February 1956 and again the following July caused training delays, and at mid-year there were still no combat-ready B-52 crews.[116]",
