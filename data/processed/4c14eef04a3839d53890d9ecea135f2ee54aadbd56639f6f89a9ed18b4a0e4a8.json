				"previous": "If , then is said to be a semisimple eigenvalue.",
				"after": "The roots of this polynomial, and hence the eigenvalues, are 2 and 3. The algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue is 2; in other words they are both double roots. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue 2 is only 1, because its eigenspace is spanned by the vector , and is therefore 1-dimensional. Similarly, the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue 3 is 1 because its eigenspace is spanned by . Hence, the total algebraic multiplicity of A, denoted , is 4, which is the most it could be for a 4 by 4 matrix. The geometric multiplicity is 2, which is the smallest it could be for a matrix which has two distinct eigenvalues.",
