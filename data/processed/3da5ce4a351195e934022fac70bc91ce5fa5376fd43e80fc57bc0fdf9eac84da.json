				"previous": "The scientific subjects of Wright's paintings from this time were meant to appeal to the wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the Lunar Society: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who later commissioned paintings from him.[36] The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like The Orrery, Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates, who already owned Wright's Gladiator. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: PdÂ£200 is shown in one place and Â£210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for Â£130, stating that the low price \"might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum.\"[37] Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received Â£30 in part payment.[38]",
				"after": "Wright exhibited the painting at the Society of Artists exhibition in 1768 and it was re-exhibited before Christian VII of Denmark in September the same year. Viewers remarked that it was \"clever and vigorous\",[27] while Gustave Flaubert, who saw it on a visit to England in 1865â66, considered it \"charmant de naÃ¯vetÃ© et profondeur\".[26] It was popular enough that a mezzotint was engraved from it by Valentine Green which was published by John Boydell on 24 June 1769,[38] and initially sold for 15 shillings. This was reprinted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, in increasingly weak impressions.[39] Ellis Waterhouse called it \"one of the wholly original masterpieces of British art\".[40]",
