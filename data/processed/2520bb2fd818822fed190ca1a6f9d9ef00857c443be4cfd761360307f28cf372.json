				"previous": "MIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs.[288][289] Â MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III, the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, the New England Football Conference, the Pilgrim League for men's lacrosse, NCAA's Division I Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges (EAWRC) for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). In April 2009, budget cuts lead to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed menâs and womenâs teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and menâs programs in golf and wrestling.[290][291]",
				"after": "The Institute's sports teams are called the Engineers, their mascot since 1914 being a beaver, \"nature's engineer\". Lester Gardner, a member of the Class of 1898, provided the following justification: \"The beaver not only typifies the Tech, but his habits are particularly our own. The beaver is noted for his engineering and mechanical skills and habits of industry. His habits are nocturnal. He does his best work in the dark.\"[292]",
