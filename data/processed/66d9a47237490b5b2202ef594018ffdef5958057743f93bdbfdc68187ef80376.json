				"previous": "Henry Finch Rix and Elizabeth Sutton, each of whom had migrated to Australia as children with their families, met and married in Victoria in 1876. They had two daughters, Elsie Bertha, born in 1877, and Emily Hilda (known ubiquitously just as Hilda), born in Ballarat on 1Â SeptemberÂ 1884.[2][3] The Rix children grew up in a gifted and energetic family. Henry, a mathematics teacher, was appointed a district Inspector of Schools in the 1880s; he was also a poet who wrote in support of Australian Federation, and he played Australian rules football for the Carlton Football Club.[4][5] Elizabeth had grown up assisting in her parents' thriving music business in Ballarat, and was a singer who performed with the Ballarat Harmonic Society.[5] In addition, she was an artist who had a studio in Melbourne's Flinders Street, and a committee member of the Austral Salon, \"a meeting place for intellectual women interested in the fine arts.\"[4] She painted in an academic style, generally choosing still lifes and flowers as subjects, though she also painted some large landscapes in the Beechworth region.[6]",
				"after": "Hilda Rix and her sister Elsie both played musical instruments as children, and would perform songs or dances at regional shows.[4] Elsie was a singer and actor who performed at the meetings of the Austral Salon, and the sisters collaborated in designing posters to advertise the Salon's activities.[7] As a child, Hilda was enthusiastic about drawing.[4] Her artistic efforts drew praise while she was attending high school at Melbourne Girls Grammar (known as Merton Hall),[1] though in most other respects Rix was not an outstanding student. Both Elsie and Hilda took some art lessons with a Mr Mather, before Hilda went on to study at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Jessie Traill, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey.[8] Rix would subsequently be critical of McCubbin's approach to teaching, referring to his methods as \"vague persuasions\". Nevertheless, the author of the only comprehensive biography of Rix, John Pigot, considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways: he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting; he modelled the importance of nationalistic ideas and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting; and his work emphasised the painting's subject over technical considerations.[9]",
