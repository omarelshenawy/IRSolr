				"after": "Existing air cargo derivatives of passenger airplanes have been very fitting. For example, the Boeing-747-200F has proven to be the big payload toiler of the air cargo fleet and could continue unmodified for a number of years. Each derivative freighter has the benefit of having most of its development costs already assessed against the transaction of its passenger equivalent. Furthermore, the financial arrangements for buying the airplane have already been established and there is a quite short lead time before production (as compared to all new aircraft). A main drawback of existing air cargo aircraft is that they represent older technology; thus their direct operating costs are higher than what might be achieved with current technology. Additionally, since they generally have not been designed specifically for air cargo, loading and unloading can cause problems; the aircraft may be pressurized more than necessary, and there may be apparatus manufactured for passenger safety that is not necessary for cargo.",
