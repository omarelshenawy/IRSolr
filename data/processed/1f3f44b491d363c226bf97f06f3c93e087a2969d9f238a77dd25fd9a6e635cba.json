				"after": "After Andrianampoinimerina reunited the divided and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he successfully pursued an expansionist policy that saw his authority extended over a large portion of Madagascar by the time of his death in 1810. Having captured Antananarivo by 1793[18] and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year,[19] Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana (\"Where It is Pleasant to Rule\"),[20] Besakana, Manatsaralehibe (\"Vast Improvement\", also called Manatsara)âwhich he alone was authorised to enterâand Marivolanitra (\"Beneath the Heavens\"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.[21]",
