				"after": "The Levels are mainly flat areas of inland plains and a coastal sand and clay barrier, roughly west of the M5 motorway. There are some slightly raised parts, called \"burtles\",[6] as well as higher ridges and hills. The Levels are about 20 feet (6Â m) above mean sea level (O.D.). The general elevation inland is 10 to 12 feet (3 to 4Â m) O.D. with peak tides of 25 to 26 feet (8 to 8Â m) O.D. recorded at Bridgwater and Burnham-on-Sea.[7] Large areas of peat were laid down in the Brue Valley during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted.[6] The area's topography consists of two basins mainly surrounded by hills, the runoff from which forms rivers that originally meandered across the plain but have now been controlled by embanking and clyses (the local name for a sluice).[8] The area is prone to winter floods of fresh water and occasional salt water inundations. The worst in recorded history was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, which resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2,000 or more people, houses and villages swept away, an estimated 200 square miles (518Â km2) of farmland inundated, and livestock killed.[9] Another severe flood occurred in 1872â1873, when over 107 square miles (277Â km2) were underwater from October to March.[10]",
