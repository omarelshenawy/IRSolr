				"after": "The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature length film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era.[318] After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry,[319] and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased.[320] With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring the nation's colonial past, such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Breaker Morant,[321] while the so-called Ozploitation genre produced international blockbusters, including the Mad Max series.[322] More recent successes included Shine and Rabbit-Proof Fence.[323][324] Notable Australian actors include Errol Flynn, Judith Anderson, Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett.[325]",
