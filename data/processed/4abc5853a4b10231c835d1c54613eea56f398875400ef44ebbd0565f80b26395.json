				"after": "The rocks underlying Ganoga Lake are from the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is a \"light-gray to buff or light-olive-gray, medium-grained, crossbedded sandstone\", with some siltstone and conglomerates.[42] The Pocono Formation formed more than 340Â million years ago, when the land was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found at the lake and in the drainage basin for Kitchen Creek: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.[43] In 1894 R. Bruce Ricketts planned to mine yellow ocher near the lake.[44]",
