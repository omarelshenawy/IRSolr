				"previous": "The A340 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane, the wing itself is virtually identical to that of the A330. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.[57][Nb 1] The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86.[59][60] The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty.[61] For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8â9 per cent.[61] Each wing also has a 2.74Â m (9.0Â ft) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft.[62] The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 \"SuperFan\", which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate.[62][63] Originally designed with a 56Â m (184Â ft) span, the wing was later extended to 58.6Â m (192Â ft) and finally to 60.3Â m (198Â ft).[62] At 60.3Â m (198Â ft), the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747-200, but with 35 percent less wing area.[59][60]",
				"after": "The flight deck of the A340 is a glass cockpit, based upon the control systems first used on the smaller A320. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls. The main instrument panel is dominated by a total of six cathode ray tube monitors which display information to the flight crew; on later aircraft these monitors have been replaced by liquid crystal displays.[54] Flight information is directed via the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) and systems information through the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM).[64][65] The aircraft monitoring system is connected to various sensors throughout the aircraft and automatically alerts the crew to any parameters detected outside of their normal range; pilots can also manually inspect systems of their choosing at any time. The information display system is designed to be easily interpreted and give a clear picture of the aircraft's operational status.[54] Instead of paper manuals, electronic CD-ROM-based manuals are used; Airbus offers web-based updates to electronic documentation as an option.[66]",
