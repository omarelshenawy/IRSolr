				"previous": "The Paleo-Balkan tribes of Thracians and Dacians ruled this area prior to the Roman conquest.[23] Belgrade was inhabited by a Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi;[6] after the Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci took the city, naming it \"SingidÅ«n\" (dÅ«n, fortress).[6] In 34â33 BC the Roman army led by Silanus reached Belgrade. It became the romanized Singidunum in the 1st century AD, and by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (highest city class) by the end of the century.[7] Apart from the first Christian Emperor of Rome who was born on the territory in modern Serbia in Naissus â Constantine I known as Constantine the Great[24] â another early Roman Emperor was born in Singidunum: Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), the restorer of Christianity.[25] Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395Â AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire.[26] Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.[27]",
