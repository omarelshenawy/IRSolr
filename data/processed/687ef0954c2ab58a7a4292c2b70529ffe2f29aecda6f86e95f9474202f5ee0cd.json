				"previous": "When a pair of organisms reproduce sexually, their offspring randomly inherit one of the two alleles from each parent. These observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as Mendel's first law or the Law of Segregation.",
			"after": [
				"Geneticists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance. A gene is represented by one or a few letters. Often a \"+\" symbol is used to mark the usual, non-mutant allele for a gene.[38]",
				"In fertilization and breeding experiments (and especially when discussing Mendel's laws) the parents are referred to as the \"P\" generation and the offspring as the \"F1\" (first filial) generation. When the F1 offspring mate with each other, the offspring are called the \"F2\" (second filial) generation. One of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross-breeding is the Punnett square."
