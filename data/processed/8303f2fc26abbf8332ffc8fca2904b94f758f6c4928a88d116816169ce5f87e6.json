				"previous": "A cam version leaked soon after the premiere of Steal This Film (Part 2) in Berlin.[25] Part 2 had its theatrical (rather than viewed online) premiere at the openly organised Who Makes And Owns Your Work artistic seminar in Stockholm 2007.[26] Despite the principles of the seminar itself (organised via public wiki in a year-long process), the involvement of Piratbyran roused the funders of the seminar, the Swedish Arts Grants Committee, to prohibit Piratbyran's logo on the seminar marketing materials alongside its own.[27] The seminar initiators' solution was to add a black sticker dot over the logo, which was easily peeled off. Another condition given by the Committee was that a moderator or an anti-piracy spokesperson be present to balance the debate.[28]",
				"after": "The documentary was officially released for peer-to-peer filesharing using peer-to-peer networks on December 28, 2007 and, according to the filmmakers, downloaded 150,000 times in the first three days of distribution.[29] Pirate Bay encouraged the downloading of Steal This Film Two, announcing its release on its blog.[30] Steal This Film Part 2 was also screened by the Pirate Cinema Copenhagen in January 2008.[31] The documentary can also be downloaded on the official Steal This Film website.[32]",
