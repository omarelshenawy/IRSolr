				"previous": "Killer whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals[156] (after Sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent,[157][158] although defining and measuring \"intelligence\" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioral strategies are very different from those of humans.[158]",
				"after": "Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed.[128][136]",
