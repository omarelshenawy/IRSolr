				"previous": "The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius, a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. The population of Pons Aelius at this period was estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are still visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the \"Roman Wall\" can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsendâthe \"wall's end\"âand to the supply fort Arbeia in South Shields. The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117Â km), spanning the width of Britain; the wall incorporated Agricola's Ditch[13] and was constructed primarily for defence, to prevent unwanted immigration and incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, not as a fighting line for a major invasion.[14]",
