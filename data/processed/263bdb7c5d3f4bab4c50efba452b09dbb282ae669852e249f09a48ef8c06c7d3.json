Many parts of the Eastern Roman Empire are considered Western today, but were Eastern in the past. Geographically, the \"West\" of today would include Europe (especially the European Union countries) together with extraeuropean territories belonging to the Anglosphere, as well as the Hispanidad, the Lusosphere or the Francophonie in the wider context. Since the context is highly biased and context-dependent, there is no agreed definition what the \"West\" is.",
