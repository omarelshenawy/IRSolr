				"previous": "The Super Seventies were a great success: roughly 70% quieter than the 60-Series and, at the time of their introduction, the world's quietest four-engined airliner. As well as being quieter and more powerful, the CFM56 was roughly 20% more fuel efficient than the JT3D, which reduced operating costs and extended the range.[citation needed]",
				"after": "By 2002, of the 1,032 707s and 720s manufactured for commercial use, just 80 remained in service â though many of those 707s were converted for USAF use, either in service or for spare parts. Of the 556 DC-8s made, around 200 were still in commercial service in 2002, including about 25 50-Series, 82 of the stretched 60-Series, and 96 out of the 110 re-engined 70-Series. Most of the surviving DC-8s are now used as freighters. In May 2009, 97 DC-8s were in service following UPS's decision to retire their remaining fleet of 44.[8] In January 2013, an estimated 36 DC-8s were in use worldwide.[9] As a result of aging, increasing operating costs and strict noise and emissions regulations, the number of active DC-8s continues to decline.",
