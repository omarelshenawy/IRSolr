				"previous": "This widespread species has occurred as a vagrant in many locations in Eurasia outside its normal range, but records from North America are normally considered to involve escapees, including, for example, the 1971 bird in Quebec.[26] However, a 1994 record from Bonavista, Newfoundland has been accepted as a genuine wild bird,[6] and the species is therefore on the North American list.[27]",
