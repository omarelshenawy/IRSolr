				"The Eastern Air Lines Group has placed orders[when?] for 10 Boeing 737-800 models, with the rights to purchase an additional 10 737 MAX 8 aircraft. The company announced in July 2014 that it had placed an order for 20 Mitsubishi MRJ90s, with rights to an additional 20 of the regional jet.[5][6] The first Boeing 737-800, previously operated by Kenya Airways, was delivered in December 2014.[3] It is named the Spirit of Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, after the early leader of the original Eastern Air Lines.[7] Prior to the arrival of the new planes, expected in 2017, Eastern will add five to seven used 737-800 aircraft by the end of 2015, and another five in 2016.[3]"
