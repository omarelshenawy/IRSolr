				"previous": "The fruit body is 1â8Â cm (0.4â3.1Â in) in diameter from tip to tip when expanded.[25] The exoperidium is thick, and the rays are typically areolate (divided into small areas by cracks and crevices) on the upper surface,[26] and are dark grey to black. The spore case is sessile (lacking a stalk), light gray to tan color and 1 to 3Â cm (0.4 to 1.2Â in) broad with a felt-like or scurfy (coated with loose scaly crust) surface; the top of the spore case is opened by an irregular slit, tear or pore.[27] The interior of the spore case, the gleba, is white and solid when young, and divided into oval loculesâa characteristic that helps to distinguish it from Geastrum.[28] The gleba becomes brown and powdery as the specimen matures.[29] Small dark hairlike threads (rhizomorphs) extend from the base of the fruit body into the substrate. The rhizomorphs are fragile, and often break off after maturity.[4]",
				"after": "The spores are spherical or nearly so, reddish-brown, thick-walled and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7â11Â Âµm;[30] the warts are about 1Â Âµm long.[31] The spores are non-amyloid, and will not stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent.[10] The use of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the spines are 0.90â1.45Â Âµm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top.[15] The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5â6.5Â Âµm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent).[4] The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored,[4] with very short sterigmata.[32] The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11â15 by 18â24Â Âµm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3â5.5Â Âµm thick.[4] The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4â6Â Î¼m in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6â8Â Î¼m diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3â4Â Î¼m diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3â6Â Î¼m in diameter.[33]",
