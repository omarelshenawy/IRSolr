				"previous": "The Mint's location occupies a prominent place in civic history. It sits at one of the two River corners of the French Quarter, which was formerly the entire city, or Vieux CarrÃ©, of New Orleans. Under French and Spanish rule this location was home to one of the city's defensive fortifications. In 1792 the Spanish governor, Francisco Luis HÃ©ctor de Carondelet, erected Fort San Carlos (later Fort St. Charles) here. The fort was demolished in 1821; and the nearby area was later named Jackson Square in honor of Andrew Jackson. As a general in the United States Army, Jackson's leadership had saved the city from invading British forces during December of 1814 and through January 8, 1815, the date of the famous Battle of New Orleans, the last significant battle of the War of 1812.[13]",
				"after": "The Mint building, which was constructed in red brick, was designed by architect William Strickland in the Greek Revival style, like most 19th-century public buildings in the United States.[14] Strickland was a student of the architect Benjamin Latrobe, a disciple of Neoclassicism who had helped design the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Strickland himself, based in Philadelphia, had already designed the Philadelphia Mint building and the Second Bank of the United States, and would go on to design the Charlotte and Dahlonega facilities, making him the architect of the first four U.S. mint buildings.[15] Martin Gordon supervised the building's construction, which was undertaken by Benjamin F. Fox, the master carpenter and joiner, and John Mitchell, the master stonemason and builder.[16]",
