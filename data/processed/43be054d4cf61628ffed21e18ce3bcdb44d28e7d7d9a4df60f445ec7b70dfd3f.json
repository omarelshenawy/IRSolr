The western narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) has been described as having a gait that is \"a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length\".[90] In an experiment, Fowler's toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.[91]",
