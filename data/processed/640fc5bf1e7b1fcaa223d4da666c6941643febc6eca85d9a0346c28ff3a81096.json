				"after": "These techniques combine the principles of both A-B and X-Y (coincident pair) techniques. For example, the ORTF stereo technique of the Office de Radiodiffusion TÃ©lÃ©vision FranÃ§aise (Radio France) calls for a pair of cardioid microphones placed 17Â cm apart at a total angle between microphones of 110Â°, which results in a stereophonic pickup angle of 96Â° (Stereo Recording Angle, or SRA).[59] In the NOS stereo technique of the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Holland Radio), the total angle between microphones is 90Â° and the distance is 30Â cm, thus capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as level information. It is noteworthy that all spaced microphone arrays and all near-coincident techniques use a spacing of at least 17Â cm or more. 17Â cm roughly equals the human ear distance and therefore provides the same interaural time difference (ITD) or more, depending on the spacing between microphones. Although the recorded signals are generally intended for playback over stereo loudspeakers, reproduction over headphones can provide remarkably good results, depending on the microphone arrangement.",
