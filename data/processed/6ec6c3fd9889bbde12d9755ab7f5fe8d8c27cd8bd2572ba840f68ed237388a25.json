				"after": "As the \"Provincial Architect\"âa newly created position to which Mountfort was appointed in 1864[31]âMountfort designed a wooden church for the Roman Catholic community of the city of Christchurch. This wooden erection was subsequently enlarged several times until it was renamed a cathedral.[4] It was eventually replaced in 1901 by the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, a more permanent stone building by the architect Frank Petre, though the cenotaph by Mountfort was preserved.[32] Mountfort often worked in wood, a material he in no way regarded as an impediment to the Gothic style,[33] though he was unique in this respect as Gothic buildings were often created from stone and mortar.[34] Between 1869 and 1882 he designed the Canterbury Museum and subsequently Canterbury College and its clock tower in 1877.[4]",
