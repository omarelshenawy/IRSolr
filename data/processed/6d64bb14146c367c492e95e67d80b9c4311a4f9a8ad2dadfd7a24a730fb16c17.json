				"As of March 2015, UPS Airlines has an active fleet of 238 aircraft.[9] In addition, the airline charters 293 aircraft.[1]",
				"In January 2005, UPS Airlines placed an order for 10 freighter versions of the Airbus A380 with an option for 10 more; as part of the deal, the airline reduced an existing commitment for 90 Airbus A300 freighters to 53.[10] In March 2007, the order was cancelled, citing production delays that pushed the initial delivery date beyond 2012.[11] In August 2005, the airline ordered 8 Boeing 747-400's to increase capacity on its major trunk routes to Europe, Asia, and North America. Deliveries of these started in June 2007.[12] UPS Airlines placed a firm order for 27 additional Boeing 767â300 Freighters in February 2007 to be delivered 2009 to 2013.[13]"
