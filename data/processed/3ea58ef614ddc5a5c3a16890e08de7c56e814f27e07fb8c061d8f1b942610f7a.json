				"after": "Goodall described Warkworth's keep as \"a masterpiece of medieval English architecture\". Built in the last quarter of the 14thÂ century, it was probably designed by John Lewyn. It was laid out in the form of a Greek cross and originally it was crested with a battlement, and perhaps decorative statues. Around the top of the building survive carvings of angels carrying shields. A large lion representing the Percy's coat of arms overlooked the town from the north side of the keep. The lion and sculptures were probably originally painted and would have stood out from the rest of the building.[58] Archaeologist Oliver Creighton suggests that the rebuilding of the keep and other reconstruction work were meant to suggest the enduring lordship of the owners.[59] On top of the keep is a lookout tower, which would have been less prominent before the keep's roof was removed.[60]",
