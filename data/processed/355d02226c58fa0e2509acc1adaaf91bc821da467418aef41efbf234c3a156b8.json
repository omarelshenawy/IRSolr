				"after": "The peacetime training regimen for Arkansas consisted of individual training, an annual fleet maneuver, and periodic maintenance in drydock. She also participated in gunnery and engineering competitions. After returning to the United States, Arkansas went into drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for an extensive overhaul. She then rejoined the fleet to conduct training exercises off Cuba, after which she crossed the Atlantic, bound for Europe. She reached Plymouth on 12 May 1919, and then took weather observations on 19 May and later served as a reference vessel to guide the Navy Curtiss NC flying boats flying from Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland to Europe. After completing that task, she steamed to Brest on 10 June and picked up Admiral William S. Benson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and his wife. Arkansas carried them back to New York after Benson was finished at the Peace Conference in Paris, arriving on 20 June.[1]",
