				"after": "Operation Downfall was the overall Allied plan for the invasion of Japan at the end of World War II, but was ultimately never used. It was scheduled to occur in two parts â Operation Olympic, the invasion of KyÅ«shÅ«, set to begin in November, 1945; and later Operation Coronet, the invasion of HonshÅ« near Tokyo, scheduled for the spring of 1946. KyÅ«shÅ« was to be invaded at three points â Miyazaki beach, Ariake beach, and Kushikino beach. Southern KyÅ«shÅ« would become a staging ground for operation Coronet, and would give the Allies a valuable airbase from which to operate. Following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Soviet declaration of war against Japan, the Japanese surrendered and the operation was cancelled. If the operation had gone ahead Australia was to play a part. The 20 squadrons strong First Tactical Air Force was earmarked to take part in both Olympic and Coronet, while a planned Australian 10th Division was to land during Coronet. Any Invasion of Japan would have also seen the Royal Australian Navy play a role.",
