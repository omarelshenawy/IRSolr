				"previous": "The primary buildings on the Jones Beach site are the two enormous bathhouses (west and east) and the 231-foot (70Â m) water tower,[19] all built to Moses' specifications. After rejecting a number of submissions by architects for the bathhouses, he selected the designs of the young and relatively inexperienced Herbert Magoon. Moses also picked out building materials - Ohio Sandstone and Barbizon brick - two of the most expensive materials available.[10] Another prominent structure is the Jones Beach Marine Theater, today known as the Nikon at Jones Beach Theater.",
