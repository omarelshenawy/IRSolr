				"previous": "In English the term intellectual identifies a \"literate thinker\"; its earlier usage, as in the book title The Evolution of an Intellectual (1920), by John Middleton Murry, denotes literary activity, rather than the activities of the public intellectual.[16]",
				"after": "In the late 19th century, when literacy was relatively uncommon in European countries, such as the United Kingdom, the \"Man of Letters\" (littÃ©rateur)[17]) denotation broadened, to mean \"specialised\", a man who earned his living writing intellectually, not creatively, about literature the essayist, the journalist, the critic, et al. In the 20th century, such an approach was gradually superseded by the academic method, and the term \"Man of Letters\" became disused, replaced by the generic term \"Intellectual\", comprehending intellectual men and women. In the late 19th century, the term intellectual became a common usage to denote the defenders of the falsely accused artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus.[18]",
