				"after": "Construction began on the freeway in 1958. The first section, between Flintridge (now La CaÃ±ada Flintridge) and Canada Avenue in Pasadena, was opened in 1966; it was then signed as State Route 118. In 1968, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway depot at Santa Anita, a historic structure built in 1890, was moved to the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden to make way for a section of the freeway passing through Arcadia.[7][8] The section from State Route 134 to the Kellogg Interchange with Interstate 10 at Pomona was completed in 1976.[9] The section between the Kellogg interchange and Glendora is no longer part of I-210. In 2003, this piece was renumbered as part of State Route 57, known as the Orange Freeway.",
