				"after": "Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire. The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions.[36] The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion. Portuguese traders took over their trade.[36] Between 1687 and 1731, Egypt experienced six famines.[38] The 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.[39]",
