He notes that these works, the \"enamelled brilliance\" of which has become apparent through cleaning, are unique in European art and deserve respect. They were produced chiefly by the workshops of Peake, Gheeraerts the Younger, and De Critz.[4] Sheeran detects the influence of Hilliardâs brightly patterned and coloured miniatures in Peakeâs work and places Peake firmly in the \"iconic tradition of late Elizabethan painting\".[38] He employed techniques from European Mannerism and followed the artificial and decorative style characteristic of Elizabethan painting.[53] By the time he was appointed serjeant-painter in 1607, his compelling and semi-naive style was somewhat old fashioned compared with De Critz and other contemporaries.[54][55] However, Peake's portraits of Prince Henry are the first to show his subject in âactionâ poses.[56]",
