				"The Il-46S swept winged version was designed concurrently, but construction was not started to ensure that resources were not diverted from the Il-46.",
				"Flight tests and State acceptance trials were successful, with the Il-46 meeting all requirements. Production was not ordered because the Tupolev Tu-88 proved to have better performance, and was ordered into production as the Tu-16."
