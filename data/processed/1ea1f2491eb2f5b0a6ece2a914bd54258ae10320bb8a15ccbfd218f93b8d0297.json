				"previous": "Prior to 2014, only three California-bred horses had won the Kentucky Derby: Morvich in 1922, Swaps in 1955, and Decidedly in 1962.[4] Besides Swaps,[95] the only other horses to win both the Santa Anita Derby and the Kentucky Derby were I'll Have Another, Sunday Silence, Winning Colors, Affirmed,[96] and Majestic Prince.[97] Steve Coburn predicted that the horse was going to win: \"I'm not being cocky, just positive\", he said.[6]",
				"after": "Prior to the May 3 race, rival trainer Bob Baffert compared California Chrome favorably to War Emblem.[98][d] Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who had no entries in the 2014 Derby, told a reporter that he intended to bet on the horse and commented, \"He's looked like the real dealÂ ... I like everything about him.\"[100] On the other hand, Dallas Stewart, trainer of rival Commanding Curve, dismissed California Chrome's chances due to his pedigree and the supposed lack of competition in his prior races.[101] Others doubted his ability because the colt had never raced outside California.[102] In contrast to the critics, reports surfaced that the owners had turned down a new offer of $10Â million.[103]",
