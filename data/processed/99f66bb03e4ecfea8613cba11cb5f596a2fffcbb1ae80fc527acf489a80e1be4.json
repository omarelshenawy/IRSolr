				"previous": "Following a long period of uneventful development flying trials and the fitting of a modified Proteus 765 series engine that greatly reduced breakdowns, a full Certificate of Airworthiness was awarded at the end of 1955.[27] The first two Model 102s were delivered to BOAC on 30 December 1955 for crew training.[37] The Model 102 began scheduled service on 1 February 1957 with a BOAC flight from London to Johannesburg,[38] flights to Sydney following in March and to Tokyo in July. By August 1957, the first 15 Model 102 aircraft had been delivered to BOAC.[39] The last 10 aircraft of the order were built as Series 300 aircraft for transatlantic flights.[39] In April 1959, a Model 102 Britannia was leased by BOAC to Ghana Airways for flights between Accra and London, and several more Britannias were purchased by the airline in the early 1960s.[40] The Model 102 was eventually made available to other BOAC associates, including Cathay Pacific, Central Africa, East African, Nigeria and Malayan airlines.[41]",
				"after": "The next production series was based on the long-range, mixed passenger/freight Model 200 series that was intended for civil airline use but ultimately Bristol offered the series to the Royal Air Force (RAF) instead.[41] The production series of three Model 252 and 20 Model 253 aircraft were purchased by RAF Transport Command in 1959, assigned the designation Britannia C.2 (first Model 252 series) and C.1 (Model 253 series).[42] Those in RAF service were allocated the names of stars, such as \"Arcturus\", \"Sirius\" and \"Vega\". On retirement from the RAF in 1975, many Model 200 series were subsequently used by independent civil operators for cargo operations, harkening back to their original intended role.[4][43]",
