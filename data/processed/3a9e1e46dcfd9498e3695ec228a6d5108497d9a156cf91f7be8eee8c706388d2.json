				"after": "Reviewing the 1925 season, Wisden commented on Rhodes's age and reduced performance. \"In the nature of things, Rhodes, approaching the completion of his 48th year, could not be expected to prove very deadly in a dry summerÂ ... If less effective in bowling, he did fine work with the bat\".[157] However, in 1926, Wisden reported that, despite his age and in contrast to the other bowlers in the team, Rhodes \"came out in wonderful formÂ ... [His] triumph delighted everybodyÂ ... He not only accomplished skilful work in bowling but made his thousand runs [in county matches] with an average of 40.\"[157] Rhodes doubled his wicket tally from 1925, taking 115 at an average of 14.86.[15] In all first-class matches he scored 1,132 runs (average 34.30), the final time he passed 1,000 runs in a season, and completed his 16th and final double.[16]",
