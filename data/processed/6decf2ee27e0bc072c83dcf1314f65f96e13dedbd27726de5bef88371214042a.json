On 7 September 2013 he landed back in Australia, making him the youngest pilot to navigate around the world at the time. The SR-22 \"Spirit of the Sapphire Coast\" was modified by removing three seats and adding a 160 U.S. gallons (610Â L; 130Â impÂ gal) fuselage tank for a total of 250 U.S. gallons (950Â L; 210Â impÂ gal) usable.[23]",
