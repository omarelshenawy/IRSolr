				"previous": "The original Indian plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[116] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[117] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6Â° 44' and 35Â° 30' north latitude[e] and 68Â° 7' and 97Â° 25' east longitude.[118]",
				"after": "India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700Â mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400Â mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300Â mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[119] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[119]",
