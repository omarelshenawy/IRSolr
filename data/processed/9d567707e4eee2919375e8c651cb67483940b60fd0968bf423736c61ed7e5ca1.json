				"after": "Birmingham rose to national political prominence in the campaign for political reform in the early 19th century, with Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham Political Union bringing the country to the brink of civil war during the Days of May that preceded the passing of the Great Reform Act in 1832.[69] The Union's meetings on Newhall Hill in 1831 and 1832 were the largest political assemblies Britain had ever seen.[70] Lord Durham, who drafted the Act, wrote that \"the country owed Reform to Birmingham, and its salvation from revolution\".[71] This reputation for having \"shaken the fabric of privilege to its base\" in 1832 led John Bright to make Birmingham the platform for his successful campaign for the Second Reform Act of 1867, which extended voting rights to the urban working class.[72]",
