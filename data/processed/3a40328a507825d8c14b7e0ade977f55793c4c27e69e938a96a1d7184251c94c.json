				"after": "Garden warblers first breed when they are one year old, and are mainly monogamous, although the male at least may sometimes deviate from this.[14] When males return to their breeding areas, they establish a territory.[14] Sylvia warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other species in their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same woods, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap.[20][21] Similar songs are a feature of the Sylvia warblers as a group, and it has been suggested that this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species.[22][23] However, it appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle differences in habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.[24] There are typically 3â9 territories per hectare (1.2â3.6 per acre), but in prime habitat, such as moist willow or birch woodland or young deciduous regrowth, there may be more than 10 pairs per hectare (4 per acre).[17] Individual territories are similar in size to those of blackcaps at 0.2â0.76Â ha (0.08â0.3Â acres).[25]",
