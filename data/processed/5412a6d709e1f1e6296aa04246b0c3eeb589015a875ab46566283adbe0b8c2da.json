				"after": "Even before the independence of the USA, American English was highly homogeneous. Early American authors commented on the lack of significant linguistic variation across the colonised area of the Eastern seaboard. Today there is more variation, yet two thirds of Americans speak a broad dialect known as General American (GA), although as with RP in Britain there are different accents also within it. Separate from GA is Southern American English (SAE), widely spoken in the Southern states, and African American Vernacular English (AAVE) spoken by African Americans in most major cities. Some dialectologists also recognise midlands and western dialects of American English.[225][226][227][228] Canadian English, except for the maritime East Coast varieties, is mostly similar to GA, but has some distinct traits, such as the Canadian vowel raising, as well as distinct norms for written and formal language.[229]",
