				"after": "The opening of Terminal 2 in 1998 saw the first step of phase 1 of the new development master plan launched in 1997. As the second stage, Concourse 1 opened in April 2000 under the name of Sheikh Rashid Terminal. The concourse is 0.8Â km (0.50Â mi) in length and connects to the check-in area by a 0.3Â km (0.19Â mi) underground tunnel containing moving walkways (conveyor belt/travelators). It also contains a hotel, business centre, health club, exchanges, dining and entertainment facilities, internet services, medical centre, post office, prayer room. The next step was the reconfiguration of the runway system, already part of phase 2, and aprons and taxiways were expanded and strengthened in 2003â2004. In addition, the Dubai Flower Centre opened in 2005 as part of the development. The airport saw the need for this as the city is a hub for import and export of flowers and the airport required a specialist facility since flowers need special conditions.[26][27]",
