It would carry a payload of some 20,000Â lb (9,100Â kg) or some 70 passengers over up to 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres), weigh about 100,000Â lb (45,000Â kg), use 6,000Â ft (1,800Â m) runways, cruise at a very high speed of 610 to 620Â mph (980 to 1,000Â km/h) and have \"more than two engines\".[5][N 2][6] While not an express requirement, commentators ever since have taken these figures to constitute a definite call to industry.[5]",
