				"after": "The Ann Arbor News, owned by the Michigan-based Booth Newspapers chain, was the major daily newspaper serving Ann Arbor and the rest of Washtenaw County. The newspaper ended its 174-year print run in 2009, due to economic difficulties. It was replaced by AnnArbor.com,[121] which ceased publication in 2013. Another Ann Arbor-based publication that has ceased production was the Ann Arbor Paper, a free monthly.[122] Ann Arbor has been said to be the first significant city to lose its only daily paper.[123] The Ann Arbor Chronicle, an online newspaper, covered local news, including meetings of the library board, county commission, and DDA until September 3, 2014.[124]",
