				"after": "At the end of hostilities in the European theater in May 1945 various warships of the Allied nations, including Brazil's, were assigned to patrol in the Atlantic as rescue ships, standing by near routes frequented by military transport aircraft carrying personnel from Europe to the continuing war in the Pacific.[6][40] Bahia was one such ship;[40] on 4 July 1945, she was stationed northeast of Brazil around 0Â°N 30Â°Wï»¿ / ï»¿0Â°N 30Â°Wï»¿ / 0; -30, near the ArquipÃ©lago de SÃ£o Pedro e SÃ£o Paulo (Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago).[3][4][6] For anti-aircraft target practice, crewmen were firing the ship's 20Â mm guns at a kite that was being towed behind the ship. One of them shot it down, but also accidentally hit the depth charges on the sternâa direct consequence of the lack of guide rails that would normally prohibit the guns from being aimed at the ship.[4][6] The resulting explosion knocked out all power on the ship and sank her in about three minutes.[1][4][41]",
