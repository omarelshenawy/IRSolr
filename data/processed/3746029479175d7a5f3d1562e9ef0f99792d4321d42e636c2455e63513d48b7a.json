				"previous": "The AS 365 is equipped with the Starflex main rotor which, in combination with the aircraft's Fenestron tail rotor, is reportedly responsible for providing a low-vibration flight experience for those onboard. While equipped with a two-man cockpit, the Dauphin can be readily controlled by a single pilot while being flown under instrument flight rules, this is in part due to the use of avionics to reduce pilot workload.[5]",
				"after": "The Dauphin is flown by a range of private operators, companies, emergency services, government agencies and air charter companies.",
