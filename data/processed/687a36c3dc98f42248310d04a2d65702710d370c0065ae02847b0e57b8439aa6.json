				"previous": "The film tells the story of a street gang of children who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood, at one point brutalizing a blind man[140] and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on a dolly, which they toss down a hill.[141] Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director: \"visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama. BuÃ±uel's street children are not 'ennobled' by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims\".[142]:p.91 The film was made quickly (18 days) and cheaply (450,000 pesos), with BuÃ±uel's fee being the equivalent of $2,000.[103]:pp.210â211 During filming, a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways: one technician confronted BuÃ±uel and asked why he didn't make a \"real\" Mexican movie \"rather than a miserable picture like this one\",[22]:p.200 the film's hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist's mother refuses to give him food (\"In Mexico, no mother would say that to her son.\"),[143]:p.99 another staff member urged BuÃ±uel to abandon shooting on a \"garbage heap\", noting that there were many \"lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas\" that were available,[143]:p.99 while Pedro de Urdimalas, one of the scriptwriters, refused to allow his name in the credits.[144]",
				"after": "This hostility was also felt by those who attended the movieâs premiÃ¨re in Mexico City on 9 November 1950, when Los olvidados was taken by many as an insult to Mexican sensibilities and to the Mexican nation.[87]:p.67 At one point, the audience shrieked in shock as one of the characters looked straight into the camera and hurled a rotten egg at it, leaving a gelatinous, opaque ooze on the lens for a few moments.[146] In his memoir, BuÃ±uel recalled that after the initial screening, painter Diego Rivera's wife refused to speak to him, while poet LeÃ³n Felipe's wife had to be restrained physically from attacking him.[22]:pp.200â201 There were even calls to have BuÃ±uel's Mexican citizenship revoked.[34]:p.61 Dancigers, panicked by what he feared would be a complete debacle, quickly commissioned an alternate \"happy\" ending to the film,[147] and also tacked on a preface showing stock footage of the skylines of New York, London and Paris with voice-over commentary to the effect that behind the wealth of all the great cities of the world can be found poverty and malnourished children, and that Mexico City \"that large modern city, is no exception\".[148] Regardless, attendance was so poor that Dancigers withdrew the film after only three days in theaters.[149]",
