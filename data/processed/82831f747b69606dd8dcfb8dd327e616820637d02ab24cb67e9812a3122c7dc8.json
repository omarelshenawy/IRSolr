				"after": "Eastern Air Lines operated the first commercial 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route.[39] On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets.[46] Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year.[47] Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners.[47] Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose.[47] Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn and the use of a two-crew member flight deck.[47] Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40Â percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.[12]",
