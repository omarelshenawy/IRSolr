				"after": "In its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth, The Raft of the Medusa was a landmark in the emerging Romantic movement in French painting, and \"laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution\"[61] against the prevailing Neoclassical style. GÃ©ricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular history painting genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style.[62] In France, both history painting and the Neoclassical style continued through the work of Antoine-Jean Gros, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, FranÃ§ois GÃ©rard, Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson, Pierre-Narcisse GuÃ©rinâteacher of both GÃ©ricault and Delacroixâand other artists who remained committed to the artistic traditions of David and Nicolas Poussin.",
