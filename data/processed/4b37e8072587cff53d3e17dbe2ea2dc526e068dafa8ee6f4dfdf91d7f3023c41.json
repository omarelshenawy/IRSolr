				"previous": "Incubation lasts 72â80Â days in the wild[44] and for a similar period in artificial conditions.[48] In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth.[52] Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though.[44] Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey[53] typically arrange themselves symmetrically[54] in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.[44]",
				"after": "The hatchling's ability to survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive extended periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground.[53] The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.[44]",
