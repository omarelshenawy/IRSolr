At any given place, the water rises over the course of the tidal cycle to a maximum height known as \"high tide\" before ebbing away again to a minimum \"low tide\" level. As the water recedes, it uncovers more and more of the foreshore or intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the tidal range or tidal amplitude.[56][57] Tidal bores can occur at the mouths of rivers, where the force of the incoming tide pushes waves of seawater upstream against the current. At Hangzhou in China, the bore can reach 9 meters (30Â ft) high and travel up to 40Â km (25Â mi) per hour.",
