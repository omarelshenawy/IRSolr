Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island mainly ate the nuts of the bois dâolive tree (Cassine orientale).[3] It may have fed on leaves as the related Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula echo) does. The fact that Newton's parakeet survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.[11]",
