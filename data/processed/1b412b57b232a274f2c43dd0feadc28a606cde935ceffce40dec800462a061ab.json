				"previous": "The Department of the Interior regained control of the territory, as it holds the reservation in trust for the Menominee. During the next dozen years it reduced the cutting of salable timber to 30 percent, which allowed the forest to regenerate. In 1934, the Menominee filed suit in the United States Court of Claims against the Forest Service, saying that its policy had heavily damaged their resource. The court agreed and settled the claim finally in 1952, awarding the Menominee $8.5 million.[18]",
			"after": [
				"The Menominee were among the Native Americans who participated as soldiers in World War II with other United States citizens.",
				"During the 1940s, federal Indian policy envisioned termination of the \"special relationship\" between the United States government and those tribes considered \"ready for assimilation\" to mainstream culture. The Menominee were identified for termination, which would end their status as a sovereign nation. At the time, the Klamath people in Oregon were the only other tribal group identified for termination. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) believed the Menominee were sufficiently economically self-reliant on their timber industry to be successful independent of federal assistance and oversight. Before termination, they were one of the wealthiest American Indian tribes."
