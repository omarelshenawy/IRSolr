				"Hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, denoted 1 H, 2 H and 3 H. Other, highly unstable nuclei (4 H to 7 H) have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature.[45][46]",
				"Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of 2 H and 3 H) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, P, is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium.[56] In its nomenclatural guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry allows any of D, T, 2 H, and 3 H to be used, although 2 H and 3 H are preferred.[57]"
