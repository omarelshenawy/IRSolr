				"after": "A visa (from the Latin charta visa, meaning \"paper which has been seen\"),[1] is a conditional authorization given by a competent authority of a country for a person who is not a citizen of that country to enter its territory and to remain there for a limited duration. Each country typically attaches to its visas such conditions as duration of stay, territory covered by the visa, dates of validity, and number of visits for which the visa is valid. Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter a country and thus are, in some countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country. In each instance, a visa is subject to permission by an immigration official at the time of actual entry and can be revoked at any time.",
