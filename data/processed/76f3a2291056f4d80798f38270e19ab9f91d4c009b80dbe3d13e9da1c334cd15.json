				"after": "Gendun Drup was born in a cowshed in Gyurmey Rupa, near Sakya in the Tsang region of central Tibet, the son of Gonpo Dorjee and Jomo Namkha Kyi, nomadic tribespeople. He was raised as a shepherd until the age of seven. His birth name was Pema Dorje (Tibetan: à½à½à¼à½à¼à½¢à¾¡à½¼à¼à½¢à¾à½ºà¼,Â Wylie: pad ma rdo rje, Vajra Lotus/Lotus Vajra) . Later, he was placed in Nartang (Nar-thang) monastery. In 1405 he took his novice vows from the abbot of Narthang, Khenchen Drupa Sherab. When he was 20, about 1411, he became fully ordained into the monkhood. He received the name Gendun Drubpa upon taking the vows of a fully ordained monk (gelong) from the abbot of Narthang monastery. At twenty years of age he became a disciple of Tsongkhapa (1357 â 1419) and the first abbot of Ganden Monastery, founded by Je Tsongkhapa himself in 1409.",
