				"previous": "During the late 1960s Shimer experienced a period of internal unrest known as the Grotesque Internecine Struggle, with disputes over curriculum changes, the extent to which student behavior should be regulated and inadequate fundraising by president Francis Joseph Mullin. Half the faculty and a large portion of the student body left as a result.[31][32] Its financial problems worsened, and the school's survival was uncertain. Although Shimer's trustees voted to close the college at the end of 1973, the school was saved by intense student and faculty fundraising.[33][34] Its trustees voted three times in the next four years to close the school, only to reverse themselves each time.[35] In the school's 1977 bankruptcy filing the trustees, in the words of board chair Barry Carroll, \"put responsibility for the school's continuing on the shoulders of a very dedicated faculty of 12 and students who volunteered\".[35]",
				"after": "During the 1978 Christmas break, the faculty and 62 students borrowed trucks and moved the college into two \"run-down\"[38] homes in Waukegan, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago. Shimer emerged from bankruptcy in 1980.[39] During the next 25 years, the college purchased 12 surrounding homes to form a makeshift campus and slowly progressed towards financial stability.[40] By 1988 its enrollment had grown from a low of 40 to 114, and income exceeded expenses. In 1991, Shimer received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities with the help of NEH chair and core-curriculum advocate Lynne Cheney; the grant revitalized the school's fundraising, helping it raise $2Â million.[40][41] In 2006, struggling with a stagnant enrollment, Shimer again moved to the campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago. Although the institutions operate independently, they cooperate closely under a long-term agreement.[42][43]",
