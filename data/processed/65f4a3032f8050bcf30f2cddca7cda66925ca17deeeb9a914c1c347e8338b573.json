				"after": "Seawater is invariably salty and, although its degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% of the water in the ocean has 34â35 g (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%.[27] To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (â°) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34â° mark, while those in the South are closer to 35â°.[5] The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor.[28] The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans:[26][29] sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SOâ), carbonate (COâ), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline;[d] similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.",
