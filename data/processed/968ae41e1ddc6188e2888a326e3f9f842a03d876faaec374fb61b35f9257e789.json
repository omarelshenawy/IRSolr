				"previous": "One of the most distinctive Canadian phrases is the spoken interrogation eh, which is commonly mocked by films such as South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut, and treated more warm-heartedly within Canada itself by programmes such as The Red Green Show and The Royal Canadian Air Farce. The only usage of eh exclusive to Canada, according to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, is for \"ascertaining the comprehension, continued interest, agreement, etc., of the person or persons addressed\" as in, \"It's four kilometres away, eh, so I have to go by bike.\" In that case, eh? is used to confirm the attention of the listener and to invite a supportive noise such as mm or oh or okay. This usage is also common in Queensland, Australia and New Zealand. Other uses of ehÂ â for instance, in place of huh? or what? meaning \"please repeat or say again\"Â â are also found in parts of the British Isles and Australia.",
				"after": "The term Canuck simply means Canadian in its demonymic form, and, as a term used even by Canadians themselves, it is not considered derogatory. In the 19th century and early 20th century it tended to refer to French-Canadians, while the only Canadian-built version of the popular World War I-era American Curtiss JN-4 Jenny training biplane aircraft, the JN-4C, got the \"Canuck\" nickname, 1,260 of which were built. The nickname Janey Canuck was used by Anglophone women's rights writer Emily Murphy in the 1920s and the Johnny Canuck comic book character of the 1940s. Throughout the 1970s, Canada's winning World Cup men's downhill ski team was called the \"Crazy Canucks\" for their fearlessness on the slopes.[79] It is also the name of the Vancouver Canucks, the National Hockey League team of Vancouver.",
