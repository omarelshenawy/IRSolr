In addition to providing the building's utilities, the power plant originally housed five workshops: an electrical shop, a mechanical shop, a metal shop, a printing shop, and a wood shop.[28] It currently houses the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello community corporation headquarters. Only the main building is in academic use by the school. Both buildings were designed by the architecture firm of Buckler and Fenhagen. Just south of the main building is Alumni Field, the school's stadium, which serves as home to the football, boys and girls lacrosse and track teams. During a major building renovation in 1978 a modern gymnasium was added to the southwest corner of the main building.",
