				"previous": "The procellariids are small- to medium-sized seabirds. The largest, the giant petrels with a wingspan of 81 to 99Â cm (32 to 39Â in), are almost as large as albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan of 23 to 28Â cm (9.1 to 11.0Â in),[11] are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter.[12] Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction.[13] This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).",
				"after": "The technique of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared to an average bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore they must maintain a high speed in order to remain in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring.[14] Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water.[15] Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.",
