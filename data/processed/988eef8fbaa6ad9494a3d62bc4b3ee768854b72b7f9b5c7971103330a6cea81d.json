An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV.[13] The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.",
