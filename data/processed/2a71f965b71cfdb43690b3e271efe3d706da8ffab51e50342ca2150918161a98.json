				"after": "Librettists have historically received less prominent credit than the composer. In some 17th century operas still being performed, the name of the librettist was not even recorded. As the printing of libretti for sale at performances became more common, these records often survive better than music left in manuscript. But even in late 18th century London, reviews rarely mentioned the name of the librettist, as Lorenzo da Ponte lamented in his memoirs.",
