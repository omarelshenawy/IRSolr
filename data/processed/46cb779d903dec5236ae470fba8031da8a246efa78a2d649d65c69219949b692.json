Let Î¶ be a root of the polynomial ; in order to prove the inequality |Î¶| â¤ Rp we can assume, of course, |Î¶| > 1. Writing the equation as , and using the HÃ¶lder's inequality we find . Now, if p = 1, this is , thus . In the case 1 < p â¤ â, taking into account the summation formula for a geometric progression, we have",
