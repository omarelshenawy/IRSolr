Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime-time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the first Fox series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season.",
