				"previous": "When de Havilland Canada asked for a much larger engine, roughly twice the power of the PT6 Large, Pratt & Whitney Canada responded with a new design initially known as the PT7. During development this was renamed to become the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100. Turboprops such as the PT6 and PW100 may have a bypass ratio over 50,[9][10][11] although propeller airflow is slower than for turbofans.[12][13]",
				"after": "The PT6A family is a series of free turbine turboprop engine providing 500 to 1,940 shp (433 to 1,447Â kW).",
