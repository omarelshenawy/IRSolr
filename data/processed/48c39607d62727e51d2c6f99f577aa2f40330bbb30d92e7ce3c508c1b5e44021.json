				"after": "Binter Canarias began operations with a fleet of 4 CN-235, which ceased operating on the islands in 1997,[6] and from 1995 to 1998 leased 3 DC-9s from Iberia. Its fleet has been reduced in recent years to a single ATR 72 500 series (EC-JQL). Formerly Naysa only performed the low density routes to La Gomera and El Hierro using 2 Beechcraft 1900 D aircraft. The franchisee has since been providing an increasing number of Binter operations, enabled through the acquisition of 3 ATR 72(EC-GQF, EC-GRP, EC-GRU), which were transferred in 2007 from Binter, and eight ATR 72 with registration EC-KGI, EC-KGJ, EC-KRY, EC-KSG, EC-KYI, EC-LAD, EC and EC-LFA-LGF.",
