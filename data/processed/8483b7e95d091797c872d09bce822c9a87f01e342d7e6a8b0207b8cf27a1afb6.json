				"after": "Columbus' remains were first interred at Valladolid, then at the monastery of La Cartuja in Seville (southern Spain) by the will of his son Diego, who had been governor of Hispaniola. In 1542 the remains were transferred to Colonial Santo Domingo, in the present-day Dominican Republic. In 1795, when France took over the entire island of Hispaniola, Columbus' remains were moved to Havana, Cuba. After Cuba became independent following the SpanishâAmerican War in 1898, the remains were moved back to Spain, to the Cathedral of Seville,[82] where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque.",
