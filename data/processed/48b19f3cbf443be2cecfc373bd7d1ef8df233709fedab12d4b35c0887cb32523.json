				"previous": "Much of the original Amador Valley High School building was reconstructed in 1968. The following year, the school reached its maximum capacity, about 1,895Â students. To accommodate the larger student population, Dublin High School was founded. Both schools held classes on the Amador Valley campus during the 1968â69 school year.[25] A continued influx of families to the Pleasanton region prompted the foundation of another high school, Foothill, in 1973.[6]",
				"after": "Starting November 3 in 1986, Amador Valley teachers went on a rolling strike to \"protest a breakdown in negotiations for a new contract.\"[27] The school brought in substitutes to replace the picketing teachers.[27] Amador Valley teachers are unionized under the California Teachers Association and the National Education Association.[28]",
