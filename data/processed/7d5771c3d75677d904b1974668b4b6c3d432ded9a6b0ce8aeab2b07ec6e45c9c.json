				"previous": "where the modifying factors Î± and Î±' are defined by the inhibitor concentration and its two dissociation constants",
				"after": "Thus, in the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (Î±/Î±')Km and (1/Î±')Vmax, respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants. In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.",
