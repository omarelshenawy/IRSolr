				"previous": "At 11Â p.m. on 14 November,[162] Deodoro took command of 600 men, the majority of whom either had no idea of what was occurring or believed that they were organizing a defence against the National Guard or the Black Guard.[163] A few republicans yelled \"Hail to the Republic\" but Deodoro ordered them to be silent.[163]",
				"after": "Upon learning of the revolt, the Viscount of Ouro Preto and the other Cabinet ministers went to Army Headquarters, located at the Field of Santana in the heart of the capital.[162][163][164] The supposedly loyal troops there outnumbered and were better equipped than the rebel force.[164] The adjutant-general (Commander) of the Army, Field Marshal Floriano Peixoto guaranteed his men's loyalty to Ouro Preto, but he was secretly in alliance with the rebels.[163] Floriano and the Minister of the War Rufino EnÃ©ias, Viscount of MaracajÃº (a cousin of Deodoro) ignored repeated orders from Ouro Preto to attack the rebels who were approaching the headquarters.[162][163] He tried to convince them, recalling the acts of bravery by the Brazilian military in the Paraguayan War. But Floriano replied to him that, \"in front of us there were enemies, and here we are all Brazilians\", which finally brought him to a realization of how far the mutiny had spread among the officer corps.[164][165]",
