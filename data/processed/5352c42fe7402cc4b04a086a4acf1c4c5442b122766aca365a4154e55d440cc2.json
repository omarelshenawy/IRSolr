				"after": "New Zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans. Radiocarbon dating, evidence of deforestation[22] and mitochondrial DNA variability within MÄori populations[23] suggest New Zealand was first settled by Eastern Polynesians between 1250 and 1300,[17][24] concluding a long series of voyages through the southern Pacific islands.[25] Over the centuries that followed these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as MÄori. The population was divided into iwi (tribes) and hapÅ« (subtribes) who would sometimes cooperate, sometimes compete and sometimes fight with each other. At some point a group of MÄori migrated to the Chatham Islands (which they named RÄkohu) where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.[26][27] The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862, largely because of Taranaki MÄori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s, although European diseases also contributed. In 1862 only 101 survived and the last known full-blooded Moriori died in 1933.[28]",
