				"previous": "In late 1977, the Philippine government purchased 35 secondhand U.S. Navy F-8Hs that were stored at Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona.[31] Twenty-five of them were refurbished by Vought and the remaining 10 were used for spare parts.[31] As part of the deal, the U.S. would train Philippine pilots in using the TF-8A.[31] They were mostly used for intercepting Soviet bombers.[31] The F-8s were grounded in 1988 and were finally withdrawn from service in 1991 after they were badly damaged by the Mount Pinatubo eruption, and have since been offered for sale as scrap.",
