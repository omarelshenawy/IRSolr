				"previous": "The city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa MarÃ­a La Menor, called La Catedral Primada de AmÃ©rica, America's First Cathedral, which states its distinction; the AlcÃ¡zar de ColÃ³n, America's first castle, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego ColÃ³n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the PantÃ©on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.",
				"after": "On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de EspaÃ±a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The AlcÃ¡zar de ColÃ³n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus familyâbeginning with his son Diegoâis now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.",
