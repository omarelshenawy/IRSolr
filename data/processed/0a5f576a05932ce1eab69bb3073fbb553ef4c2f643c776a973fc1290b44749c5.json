				"In 2008, 11 singles topped the chart. Although 12 singles claimed the top spot in 52 issues of the magazine, Timbaland's \"Apologize\" featuring OneRepublic began its peak position in late 2007, and is thus excluded.[4] Katy Perry and Lady Gaga each earned two number-one singles as a lead artist. Three number-one singles tied for the longest-running chart-topping single of 2008, for nine weeks: Madonna's \"4 Minutes\" featuring Justin Timberlake, Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", and Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\", which held the number one spot through the end of January 2009. Both \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Poker Face\" had consecutive runs, while \"4 Minutes\" had a non-consecutive run.[5] Other chart-topping singles from 2008 include Flo Rida's \"Low\" featuring T-Pain, which stayed at number one for eight straight weeks. Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" is noted for its jump from seventieth to first place on the Canadian Hot 100, which was the largest upward movement to number one at the time.[6] Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\" made her the first non-North American act to reach number-one on the chart.[7]"
