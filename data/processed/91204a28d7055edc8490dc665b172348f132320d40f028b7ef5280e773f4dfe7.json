				"previous": "The work purchased by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia, a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth, with a panoramic backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape. His stance is casual, self-assured and heroic, consistent with the up-beat nationalism of Australia at the time.[87][88]",
				"after": "In 1925 there were further exhibitions, including at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and the Royal Academy of Art, both in London.[89] Also in London, a solo exhibition was held at the Beaux Arts Gallery in December, which displayed her painting His Land. The work was described by one reviewer as having \"the rare quality of conveying the spirit of life in the Commonwealth as well as portraying that life pictoriallyÂ ... the whole picture seems to convey the sunny heat-laden atmosphere of Australia\".[90] Like In Australia, this work also suggested the elemental strength and vitality that Rix Nicholas advocated should pervade Australian painting.[77]",
