When news arrived that his younger daughter, the 23-year-old Leopoldina, had died in Vienna of typhoid fever on 7 February, he finally had a pressing reason to venture outside the Empire.[210] Upon arriving in Lisbon, Portugal, he immediately went to the Janelas Verdes palace, where he met with his stepmother AmÃ©lie of Leuchtenberg. The two had not seen each other in forty years, and the meeting was emotional. PedroÂ II remarked in his journal: \"I cried from happiness and also from sorrow seeing my Mother so affectionate toward me but so aged and so sick.\"[211]",
