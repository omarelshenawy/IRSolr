He regularly flew Boeing 757s in his role as captain for the now-defunct UK charter airline Astraeus,[116] which, from 16 September 2010, employed him as Marketing Director.[117] One of his key roles in that position was to promote Astraeus' services by increasing their number of videos,[118] leading to the UK Civil Aviation Authority releasing a video featuring Dickinson on aircraft loading safety in June 2011.[119]",
