				"after": "The isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons, due to its ease of fission and availability. Encasing the bomb's plutonium pit in a tamper (an optional layer of dense material) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core. This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16Â kg to 10Â kg, which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters (4Â in).[92] This critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-235.[5]",
