				"previous": "The output for the orientation tensor is in the three orthogonal (perpendicular) axes of space. The three eigenvectors are ordered by their eigenvalues ;[30] then is the primary orientation/dip of clast, is the secondary and is the tertiary, in terms of strength. The clast orientation is defined as the direction of the eigenvector, on a compass rose of 360Â°. Dip is measured as the eigenvalue, the modulus of the tensor: this is valued from 0Â° (no dip) to 90Â° (vertical). The relative values of , , and are dictated by the nature of the sediment's fabric. If , the fabric is said to be isotropic. If , the fabric is said to be planar. If , the fabric is said to be linear.[31]",
