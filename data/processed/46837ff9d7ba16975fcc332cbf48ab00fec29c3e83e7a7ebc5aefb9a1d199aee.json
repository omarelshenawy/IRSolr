				"previous": "Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where the gills curve up to join the stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and initially narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges.[13] Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted on the walls of the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible.[16] The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe,[14] and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).[15] The cylindrical stipe is 3â6Â cm (1.2â2.4Â in) long by 0.1â0.2Â cm (0.04â0.08Â in) thick, hollow, and stiff but flexible;[13] it is somewhat thicker at the base.[17] It has a brownish to grayish-olive color that is sometimes tinged with shades of orange. The surface is smooth except for orange powder near the top, while the base is covered with stiff orange hairs. Smith reports the mushroom tissue to have no distinctive taste or odor,[13] while Aronsen says the odor is \"very conspicuous; sweet, fruity, often experienced as farinaceous or faintly of anise\".[14] Like many small Mycena species, the edibility of the mushroom is unknown, as it is too insubstantial to consider collecting for the table.[16]",
				"after": "The spores are elliptic, smooth, and amyloid, with dimensions of 7â9 by 4â5Â Î¼m.[13] The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25â32 by 5.5â7Â Î¼m.[14] Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are abundant and similar in morphology: club-shaped to somewhat capitate (with a head),[13] the tops sparsely to densely covered with small spines (said to resemble a mace[18]), filled with a bright orange pigment, and measuring 28â36 by 7â12Â Î¼m. The flesh of the cap is covered with a cuticle, on the surface of which are found scattered cystidia similar to those on the gills. Directly beneath the cuticle is a layer of enlarged cells, and beneath this are filamentous hyphae.[13] Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.[14]",
