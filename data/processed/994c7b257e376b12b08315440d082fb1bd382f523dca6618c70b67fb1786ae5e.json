Supersonic aircraft were developed in the second half of the twentieth century and have been used almost entirely for research and military purposes. Only two, Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144, were ever designed for civil use as airliners. Fighter jets are the most common example of supersonic aircraft, although they don't always travel at supersonic speed.",
