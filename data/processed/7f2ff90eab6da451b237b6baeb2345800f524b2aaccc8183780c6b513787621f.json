				"after": "Karluk had been chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000.[8][n 3] Stefansson was advised by Pedersen that, of four ships that were available, Karluk was \"the soundest and best adapted for our purpose\",[24] but Bartlett had deep reservations about her fitness for prolonged Arctic service. The ship, a 29-year-old brigantine, was 129 feet (39Â m) in length with a beam of 23 feet (7.0Â m). She had been built for the Aleutian fishing industry (karluk is the Aleut word for \"fish\") and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with 2-inch (51Â mm) Australian ironwood. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings,[25] she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice.[17] Writer and journalist Jennifer Niven, in her account of the expedition, describes Karluk as \"far from the powerful Arctic ice vessel many of the men had expected\".[8]",
