				"after": "A shorter range variant was created based on the GIV and given the G300 designation in 2002.[5] The G400 has a large cabin, long range of 4,350 nautical miles (8,060Â km) and the same comfort and design that characterize the G series. Typical cruise height and speed are 45,000Â ft and Mach 0.88. Earlier models were fitted with Honeywell's SPZ 8000 Avionics package. The SPZ 8400 Avionics Package was an option, becoming standard on later models. It costs about $15 million at 2009 prices.[6]",
