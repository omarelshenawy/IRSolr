The heavy competition among the top few manufacturers only adds to the aggressiveness in shrinking the design rule or process technology node.[28] While the expected shrink timeline is a factor of two every three years per original version of Moore's law, this has recently been accelerated in the case of NAND flash to a factor of two every two years.",
