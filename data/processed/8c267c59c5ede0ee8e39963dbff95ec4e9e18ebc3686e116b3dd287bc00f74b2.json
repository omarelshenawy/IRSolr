Rutsen was a merchant, and the son of a Dutch immigrant, from Albany; he founded the first settlement in what is now the town of Rosendale, New York, in the late 17thÂ century.[2][3] The spelling of the mountain's name has been disputed,[4] and has been rendered as Joppenberg[5] and Joppenburgh.[6] It has also been called Jacob's Nose,[7] Jacob's Mount,[2] and, in an early 18th-century deed, Jobsenbright.[8]",
