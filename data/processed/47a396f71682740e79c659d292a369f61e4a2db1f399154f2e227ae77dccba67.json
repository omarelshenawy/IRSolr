				"after": "The last aircraft was withdrawn from commercial service by major operators in 1975. There were only nine airframes left in the world as of December 2005 â five in the United States, and one each in Haiti, Portugal, Venezuela and South Africa. None are airworthy, and only one is properly preserved: Elvis Presley's Lisa Marie (named after his daughter), at Graceland in Memphis. It was formerly in commercial service with Delta.[11] In January 2015 it was put up for sale.[12] One of the other four U.S. aircraft was subsequently cut up for scrap in April 2007, although the forward fuselage is being saved for use in a museum. The one existing in Portugal was placed near Lisbon Airport and converted into a strip club until being sold for scrap. It was destroyed on April 28, 2008.[13] In addition, the forward fuselage of former TWA Convair 880 N803TW (MSN 3) is being restored at the Aviation Hall of Fame and Museum of New Jersey for eventual display.[14]",
