				"after": "Boletus badius fruit bodies have a chestnut to dark brown cap, which is almost spherical in young specimens before broadening and flattening out to a diameter of up to 15Â cm (6Â in). The cap margin is acute, and cap surface velvety when young and slightly sticky when wet or old.[19] The cap cuticle is difficult to separate from the flesh underneath.[20] On the cap undersurface, the pores are initially cream to pale yellow, but become greenish yellow or olive with age. They stain dull blue to bluish-grey when bruised or cut, and are easily removed from the flesh.[19] The pores are initially circular, becoming more angular with age,[21] and number about one or two per millimetre. The tubes are 0.8â1.5Â cm (0.3â0.6Â in) long,[22] and are adnate to depressed around the area of attachment to the stipe.[23]",
