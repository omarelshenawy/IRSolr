				"previous": "Bede is very uncomplimentary about the indigenous British clergy: in his Historia ecclesiastica he complains of their unspeakable crimes, and that they did not preach the faith to the Angles or Saxons.[64] Pope Gregory sent Augustine in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons, but Bede says the British clergy refused to help Augustine in his mission.[65][66] Despite Bede's complaints, it is now believed that the Britons played an important role in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons.[67] On arrival in the south east of England in 597, Augustine was given land by King Ãthelberht of Kent to build a church; so in 597 Augustine built the church and founded the See at Canterbury.[68] He baptised Ãthelberht in 601, then continued with his mission to convert the English.[69] Most of the north and east of England had already been evangelised by the Irish Church. However, Sussex and the Isle of Wight remained mainly pagan until the arrival of Saint Wilfrid, the exiled Archbishop of York, who converted Sussex around 681 and the Isle of Wight in 683.[70][71][72]",
				"after": "It remains unclear what \"conversion\" actually meant. The ecclesiastical writers tended to declare a territory as \"converted\" merely because the local king had agreed to be baptised, regardless of whether, in reality, he actually adopted Christian practices; and regardless, too, of whether the general population of his kingdom did.[73] When churches were built, they tended to include pagan as well as Christian symbols, evidencing an attempt to reach out to the pagan Anglo-Saxons, rather than demonstrating that they were already converted.[74][75]",
