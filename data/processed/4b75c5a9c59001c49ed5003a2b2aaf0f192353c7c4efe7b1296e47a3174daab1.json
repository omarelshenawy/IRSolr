The size of the excluded population was generally separately estimated. \"Half-caste aboriginal natives\" were shown separately up to the 1966 census, but since 1971 there has been no provision on the forms to differentiate 'full' from 'part' Indigenous or to identify non-Indigenous persons who are accepted by Indigenous communities but have no genetic descent.[131]"
