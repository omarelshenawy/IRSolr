The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with nÂ <Â pÂ <Â 2nÂ âÂ 2, for any natural numberÂ nÂ >Â 3. However, computing A or Î¼ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with.[26] Another formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.",
