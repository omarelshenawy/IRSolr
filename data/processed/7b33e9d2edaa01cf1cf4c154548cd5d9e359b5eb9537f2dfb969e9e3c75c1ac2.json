Many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them.[40] Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible, traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals (comparable to earthworms).[39]",
