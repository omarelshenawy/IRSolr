				"previous": "The rotary engine, popular during World War I, quickly disappeared, having reached its peak as rotational forces prevented more fuel and air from being delivered to the cylinders, which limited horsepower. They were replaced chiefly by the stationary radial engine though major advances led to inline engines, which gained ground with several exceptional enginesâincluding the 1,145Â cuÂ in (18.76Â l) V-12 Curtiss D-12. Aircraft engines increased in power several-fold over the period, going from a typical 180Â hp (130Â kW) in the 1918 Fokker D.VII to 900Â hp (670Â kW) in the 1938 Curtiss P-36. The debate between the sleek in-line engines versus the more reliable radial models continued, with naval air forces preferring the radial engines, and land-based forces often choosing in-line units. Radial designs did not require a separate (and vulnerable) cooling system, but had increased drag. In-line engines often had a better power-to-weight ratio, but there were radial engines that kept working even after having suffered significant battle damage.",
				"after": "Some air forces experimented with \"heavy fighters\" (called \"destroyers\" by the Germans). These were larger, usually twin-engined aircraft, sometimes adaptations of light or medium bomber types. Such designs typically had greater internal fuel capacity (thus longer range) and heavier armament than their single-engine counterparts. In combat, they proved vulnerable to more agile single-engine fighters.",
