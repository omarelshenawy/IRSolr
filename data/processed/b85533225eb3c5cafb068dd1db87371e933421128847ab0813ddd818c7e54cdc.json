				"after": "The building was first shown on a 1586 map of the Blakeney and Cley area, apparently drawn to be used in evidence in a legal case regarding the rights to \"wreck and salvage\", the outcome of which is unknown. The original map disappeared in the 19th century, but a number of copies still exist.[8][9] In this map, the building on the Eye is shown as intact and roofed, but it has no name. A map by the Cranefields from 1769 has the building as \"Eye House\", but by 1797 cartographer William Faden's map of Norfolk shows the \"chapel ruins\", a description that was then consistently used from the 19th century onwards. Some maps, including Faden's, show a second ruined chapel across the Glaven on Cley Eye, but no other documentation exists for that building.[2]",
