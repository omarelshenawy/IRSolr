				"after": "In 2005, Iron Maiden co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath. Lead singer Ozzy Osbourne's wife, Sharon, encouraged family friends and members of other bands to sabotage Iron Maiden's last performance at Hyundai Pavilion in San Bernardino, California on 20 August,[73] in an attack which Rod Smallwood criticised as \"vile, dangerous, criminal and cowardly\", as well as disrespectful to fans who had paid to see the band perform \"a full unhindered performance\".[74] Osbourne ordered interference with the band's PA, delayed the entrance of Eddie, the band's mascot,[75] and encouraged members of the Osbourne camp to throw eggs, lighters and bottle tops from the front of the audience.[76] According to Dickinson, the attack was in response to his \"disparaging remarks about reality-TV shows that she took personally\",[76] although The Guardian reported that he slated the Osbournes' reality series and accused Ozzy Osbourne of using a teleprompter.[75] Dickinson has since denied making comments against Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath,[77] but admitted that he criticised Ozzfest throughout the tour, attacking their \"corporate\" seating layout and the fact that \"Most of the bands are there because they paid to be there.\"[78]",
