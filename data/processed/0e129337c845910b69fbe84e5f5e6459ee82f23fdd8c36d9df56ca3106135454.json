				"after": "The Comet 2 had a slightly larger wing, higher fuel capacity and more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon engines, which all improved the aircraft's range and performance;[149] its fuselage was 3Â ft 1Â in (0.94Â m) longer than the Comet 1's.[150] Design changes had been made to make the aircraft more suitable for transatlantic operations.[149] Following the Comet 1 disasters, these models were rebuilt with heavier gauge skin and rounded windows, and the Avon engines featuring larger air intakes and outward-curving jet tailpipes.[N 22][151] A total of 12 of the 44-seat Comet 2s were ordered by BOAC for the South Atlantic route.[152] The first production aircraft (G-AMXA) flew on 27 August 1953.[153] Although these aircraft performed well on test flights on the South Atlantic, their range was still not suitable for the North Atlantic. All but four Comet 2s were allocated to the RAF with deliveries beginning in 1955. Modifications to the interiors allowed the Comet 2s to be used in a number of different roles. For VIP transport, the seating and accommodations were altered while provisions for carrying medical equipment including iron lungs were incorporated. Specialised ELINT and electronic surveillance capability was later added to some airframes.[154]",
