				"According to the official Bundeswehr website, the brigade has a current strength of 6,500 soldiers.[2]",
				"Honouring tradition, upon the creation of the Bundeswehr in 1956, the mountain infantry returned as a distinctive arm of the West German army. Until 2001, they were organized as the 1. Gebirgsdivision, but this division was disbanded in a general reform. The successor unit is GebirgsjÃ¤gerbrigade 23 which has its headquarters in Bad Reichenhall. The battalions of these mountain infantry are deployed in southern Bavaria as this is the only high mountain area in Germany touching the Northern Alps. Since 2008 the unit is officially called \"GebirgsjÃ¤gerbrigade 23 Bayern (Bavaria)\" as a commendation of the close relationship between the state and the GebirgsjÃ¤ger."

				"after": "The soldiers of the mountain infantry wear a grey cap (BergmÃ¼tze) with an edelweiÃ on its left side, stem to the front. This distinguishes them from all other German army soldiers who wear berets and the Austrian army, whose edelweiÃ has its stem to the back. The formal uniform, which is based on traditional alpine mountain climbing trekking outfits (Berganzug), is also different from the standard mainstream German army uniform, and consists of a light-weight grey ski blouse (Skibluse), black Stirrup trousers (Keilhose) or especially during the summer periods \"Culottes\" knee-breeches (kniebundhose) similar to knickerbockers, and ankle-height mountaineering boots (Bergstiefel) or dual-use mountaineering ski boots. A soldier is allowed to wear the edelweiÃ on the forage cap after he has completed the \"EdelweiÃmarsch\". This honor is only allowed for the mountain infantry.",
