				"after": "Malta is an archipelago in the central Mediterranean (in its eastern basin), some 80Â km (50Â mi) south of the Italian island of Sicily across the Malta Channel. Only the three largest islandsÂ â Malta (Malta), Gozo (GÄ§awdex) and Comino (Kemmuna)Â â are inhabited. The smaller islands (see below) are uninhabited. The islands of the archipelago lie on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a land bridge between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last Ice Age.[85] The archipelago is therefore situated in the zone between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates.[86][87]",
