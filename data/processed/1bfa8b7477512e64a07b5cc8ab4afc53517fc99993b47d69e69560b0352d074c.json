				"after": "Beyond the military applications of UAVs with which \"drones\" became most associated, numerous civil aviation uses have been developed, including aerial surveying of crops,[32] acrobatic aerial footage in filmmaking,[32] search and rescue operations,[32] inspecting power lines and pipelines,[33] counting wildlife,[33] delivering medical supplies to remote or otherwise inaccessible regions,[34] with some manufacturers rebranding the technology as \"unmanned aerial systems\" (UASs) in preference over the military-connotative term \"drones.\"[32] Further uses include reconnaissance operations,[35] border patrol missions,[35][36] forest fire detection,[35] surveillance,[35] coordinating humanitarian aid,[37] search & rescue missions,[35] detection of illegal hunting,[38] land surveying,[39] fire and large-accident investigation,[39] landslide measurement,[39] illegal landfill detection,[39] and crowd monitoring.[39]",
