				"after": "By 1991, Fokker had produced 70 units and had orders for more than 230. An extended-range version with additional fuel tanks in the wings was introduced in 1993, and a quick-change passenger/freighter version in 1994, the 100QC. A shorter version was introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the earlier F28, known as the Fokker 70, which removed 4.70Â m (15.42Â ft) of the fuselage and reduced seating to 80. Studies on the 130 seat Fokker 130 and the Fokker 100QC (freighter) did not reach further stages of development. A Fokker 100EJ (Executive Jet) was introduced in 2003 as a conversion from used Fokker 100 aircraft.",
