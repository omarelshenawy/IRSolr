				"after": "On September 20, 1967, two Bureau of Forestry employees attempted to remove a metal ladder from a 20,000-US-gallon (76,000Â l; 17,000Â impÂ gal) metal storage tank for jet fuel at the northern jet engine test cell. Both were killed in an explosion when the acetylene torch cut through the tank wall and ignited fumes inside it. A tract within the Elk State Forest at the northern edge of the wild area is known as Noble-Chambers Memorial Forest in their memory.[28][56][57] Although Fergus reports entering a bunker in his 2002 book,[7] and Young describes a bunker's slit windows in his 2008 book,[48] as of 2010 the southern bunker is covered with earth, while the northern bunker is still completely intact and enter-able.",
