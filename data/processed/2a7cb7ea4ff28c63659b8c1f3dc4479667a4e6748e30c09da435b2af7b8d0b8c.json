				"after": "The ATR 42-500 is the current production version. The first delivery was in October 1995. It is a completely new design with many new improvements for performance and passenger comfort. It has new engines, new propellers, a newly designed cabin and increased weight capacity. It has six-bladed propellers turned by PW127E engines rated at 2,400Â shp (1,800Â kW) for improved hot and high performance and greatly increased cruise speed. The engines are flat rated for +45C. Propellers are electrically controlled and are made from composite. It has an increased maximum takeoff weight, allowing for more cargo and greater range (up to 1,500Â nm). Due to the six-bladed propellers and better insulation, it has a much reduced noise level inside the cabin. The newest version have CATII capability and dual Honeywell HT1000 FMS installation.[4][6]",
