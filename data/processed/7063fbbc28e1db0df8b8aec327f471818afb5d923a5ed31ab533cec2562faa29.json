				"after": "The Atlanta chapter of the UDC in 1927 published a brochure accusing the Association of wrongfully firing Borglum and wasting between a quarter and a half million dollars.[60] An audit of the Association's books was performed in 1928; the examiners found its records in good order, excepting those regarding the Harvest Campaign, which were inadequate. The audit found that for every three dollars of revenue brought in from the half dollars, two were paid out in expenses, a ratio Hyder and Colbert called \"incredible\".[61] Of the total sum raised by the Association, only 27 cents of each dollar went to the carving.[62] Venable stated that the Stone Mountain monument had \"developed into the most colossal failure in history\".[60][63]",
