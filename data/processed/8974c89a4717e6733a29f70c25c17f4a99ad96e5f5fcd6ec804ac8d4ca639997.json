				"previous": "Consider, for instance, particles suspended in a viscous fluid in a gravitational field. Gravity tends to make the particles settle, whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them, driving them into regions of smaller concentration. Under the action of gravity, a particle acquires a downward speed of v = Î¼mg, where m is the mass of the particle, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and Î¼ is the particle's mobility in the fluid. George Stokes had shown that the mobility for a spherical particle with radius r is , where Î· is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, the particles are distributed according to the barometric distribution",
				"after": "where ÏâÏ0 is the difference in density of particles separated by a height difference of h, kB is Boltzmann's constant (namely, the ratio of the universal gas constant, R, to Avogadro's number, N), and T is the absolute temperature. It is Avogadro's number that is to be determined.",
