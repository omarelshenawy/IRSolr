				"previous": "Glam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge,[187] but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie.[188] A few new, unambiguously metal bands had commercial success during the first half of the decadeâPantera's Far Beyond Driven topped the Billboard chart in 1994âbut, \"In the dull eyes of the mainstream, metal was dead\".[189] Some bands tried to adapt to the new musical landscape. Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative musical festival Lollapalooza founded by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell. While this prompted a backlash among some long-time fans,[190] Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century.[191]",
				"after": "Like Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term \"alternative metal\".[192] Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as Soundgarden, credited as making a \"place for heavy metal in alternative rock\",[193] and Alice in Chains were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal, and hip hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal, and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails began incorporating metal into their industrial sound, and vice versa, respectively; and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombieâalso identified with alt-metalâsignificant, if partial, exceptions).[192] Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented \"the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world.\"[194]",
