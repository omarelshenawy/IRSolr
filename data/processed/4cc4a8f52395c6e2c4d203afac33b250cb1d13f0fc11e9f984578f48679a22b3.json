				"after": "The first regular season NFL game played there was a 42â0 Dolphins victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on October 11, 1987. The game was in the middle of the 1987 NFL strike, and was played with replacement players. The stadium hosted its first Monday Night Football game there on December 7 of that year, a 37â28 Dolphins victory over the New York Jets. In addition to the Super Bowl, several other playoff games have been played in the stadium, including the 1992 AFC Championship Game, which the Dolphins lost to the Buffalo Bills, 29â10. The Dolphins are 5â3 in playoff games held here, losing the most recent one in January, 2009, against the Baltimore Ravens.",
