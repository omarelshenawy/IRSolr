				"after": "The cap of this mushroom is 7â30Â cm (3â12Â in) broad at maturity. Slightly sticky to touch, it is convex in shape when young and flattens with age. The colour is generally reddish-brown fading to white in areas near the margin, and continues to darken as it matures. The stipe, or stem, is 8â25Â cm (3.5â10Â in) in height, and up to 7Â cm (2.8Â in) thickârather large in comparison to the cap;[31] it is club-shaped, or bulges out in the middle. It is finely reticulate on the upper portion, but smooth or irregularly ridged on the lower part. The under surface of the cap is made of thin tubes, the site of spore production; they are 1 to 2Â cm (0.4 to 0.8Â in) deep, and whitish in colour when young, but mature to a greenish-yellow.[32] The angular pores, which do not stain when bruised, are small â roughly 2 to 3 pores per millimetre.[33] In youth, the pores are white and appear as if stuffed with cotton (which are actually mycelia); as they age, they change colour to yellow and later to brown. The spore print is olive brown. The flesh of the fruit body is white, thick and firm when young, but becomes somewhat spongy with age. When bruised or cut, it either does not change colour, or turns a very light brown or light red.[34] Fully mature specimens can weigh about 1Â kg (2.2Â lb); a huge specimen collected on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in 1995 bore a cap of 42Â cm (16.5Â in), with a stipe 18Â cm (7.1Â in) in height and 14Â cm (5.5Â in) wide, and weighed 3.2Â kg (7.1Â lb).[31] A similarly sized specimen found in Poland in 2013 made international news.[35]",
