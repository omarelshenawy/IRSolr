				"after": "Now the question remained open as to which formulation applies to bodies at rest. This was tackled by Einstein in his paper \"Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?\". Einstein used a body emitting two light pulses in opposite directions, having energies of E0 before and E1 after the emission as seen in its rest frame. As seen from a moving frame, this becomes H0 and H1. Einstein obtained:",
