				"after": "Wrigley Square is a public square located in the northwest corner of Millennium Park near the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan, across from the Historic Michigan Boulevard District.[159] It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Greek Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park between 1917 and 1953.[159] The square also contains a large lawn and a public fountain. The William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation contributed $5Â million for the monument and square, which was named in its honor.[160] The pedestal of the Millennium Monument's peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors who made the 91 contributions of at least $1Â million each to help pay for Millennium Park.[161]",
