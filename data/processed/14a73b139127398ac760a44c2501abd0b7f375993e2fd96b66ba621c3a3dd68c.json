				"previous": "The collection was at first housed in SigurÃ°ur's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in ReykjavÃ­k and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to support the opening of a museum in August 1997.[8] By 2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered it to the city of ReykjavÃ­k as a gift.[9] However, he was unsuccessful in obtaining financial support from the state or city. When he retired in 2004, he could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises.[10]",
				"after": "After his retirement, he moved along with his collection to HÃºsavÃ­k, a fishing village with a population of about 2,200 people located 298 miles (480Â km) northeast of the capital. The museum was housed in a small building, formerly a restaurant,[10] that was marked with a giant wooden penis and a stone phallus standing outside on the street. The village's inhabitants were at first skeptical of the new arrival, but came to accept it when they were persuaded that there was nothing pornographic about the museum.[2]",
