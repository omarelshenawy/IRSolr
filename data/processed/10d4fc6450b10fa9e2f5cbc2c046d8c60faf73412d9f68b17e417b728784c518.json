				"after": "The Madrid region experiences a Mediterranean climate[53] (KÃ¶ppen Csa)[54] with continental characteristics, with cool to cold winters due to its altitude of 667Â m (2,188Â ft) above sea level and distance to the sea, including sporadic snowfalls and minimum temperatures often below freezing. Summers are hot with average July temperatures ranging from 32 to 33Â Â°C (90 to 91Â Â°F) depending on location. Summer temperatures occasionally climb over 35Â Â°C (95Â Â°F) during the city's heatwaves. Due to Madrid's altitude and dry climate, diurnal ranges are often significant during the summer. The highest recorded temperature was on 24 July 1995 with 42.2Â Â°C (108.0Â Â°F), and the lowest recorded temperature was on 16 January 1945 with â10.1Â Â°C (13.8Â Â°F). Although this records were registered at the airport, not at the city.[55] Precipitation is concentrated in the autumn and spring. It is particularly sparse during the summer, taking the form of about two showers and/or thunderstorms a month.",
