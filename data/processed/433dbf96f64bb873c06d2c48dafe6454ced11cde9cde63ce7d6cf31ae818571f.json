				"Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language is an American dictionary first published in 1951 and currently published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[1]",
				"The first edition was published by the World Publishing Company of Cleveland, Ohio, in two volumes or one large volume, including a large encyclopedic section. In 1953, World published a one-volume college edition, without the encyclopedic material. It was edited by Joseph H. Friend and David B. Guralnik and contained 142,000 entries, said to be the largest American desk dictionary available at the time."
