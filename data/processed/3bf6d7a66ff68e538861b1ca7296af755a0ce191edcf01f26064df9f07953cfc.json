				"after": "Jardine approached the tour with a competitive attitude and made thorough preparations.[89] The match attendances were high and the public followed the cricket very closely.[90] Verity enjoyed the tour and established a lasting friendship with Charlie Barnett; Verity helped Barnett to overcome his homesickness and to develop his understanding of cricket.[91] Verity was the leading first-class wicket-taker on the tour, although he was second in the team averages, with 72Â wickets at an average of 15.54.[30][90] In the first match of the tour against Sind, he took six for 46 and 10 wickets in the game. His best figures were seven for 37 against the Viceroy's XI and he took five wickets in an innings on five occasions.[27][30] Against an Indian XI, he achieved his then-highest first-class score of 91Â not out.[27] On the same ground, in the second Test match, Verity took eight wickets in the drawn game and scored 55Â not out, his maiden Test fifty.[92] As England had won the first Test, the third and final match would decide the series. Verity was again successful with the bat, scoring 42 and sharing a partnership of 97 with Jardine. Then with the ball, Verity took seven for 49 as the Indian batsmen struggled against his accuracy.[93] Four wickets in the second innings gave him eleven wickets for 153 in the match, the first time he had taken 10 or more wickets in a Test match.[27][93] In the three Tests, Verity took 23 wickets at an average of 16.82, leading the bowling averages for the series.[82][94]",
