				"previous": "In 2009, the decisions to construct Sweden's two largest scientific installations, the synchrotron radiation facility MAX IV and the European Spallation Source, were taken.[191][192] Both installations will be built in Lund. The European Spallation Source, costing some SEK 14 billion to construct,[193] will be operational in 2019 and will give an approximately 30 times stronger neutron beam than any of today's existing neutron source installations.[194] The MAX IV, costing some SEK 3 billion, will be operational in 2015. Both facilities have strong implications on material research.",
			"after": [
				"In the 18th century Sweden's scientific revolution took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe.",
				"In 1739, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was founded, with people such as Carolus Linnaeus and Anders Celsius as early members. Many of the companies founded by early pioneers still remain major international brands. Gustaf DalÃ©n founded AGA, and received the Nobel Prize for his sun valve. Alfred Nobel invented dynamite and instituted the Nobel Prizes. Lars Magnus Ericsson started the company bearing his name, Ericsson, still one of the largest telecom companies in the world. Jonas WenstrÃ¶m was an early pioneer in alternating current and is along with Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla credited as one of the inventors of the three-phase electrical system.[195]"
