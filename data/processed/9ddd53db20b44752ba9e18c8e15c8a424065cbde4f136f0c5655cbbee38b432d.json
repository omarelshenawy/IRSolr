				"previous": "Following his year off, Macartney returned to full-time cricket in 1925â26. He re-established himself in his first match, scoring 114 and taking a total of 4/49 as New South Wales crushed Western Australia by an innings and 235 runs.[12] Macartney then scored 84 and 28 to help the Rest of Australia defeat the national team by 156 runs.[12] He then scored two centuries as New South Wales won all four of their Sheffield Shield matches, three by an innings. Up to this point, Macartney had scored 582 runs at 72.75 and taken 20 wickets at 20.30.[12] This was enough for him to be selected for the 1926 tour of England.[12][15] His most notable performance with the ball was his 7/85 and 2/16 in an innings victory over arch-rivals Victoria.[12] His wickets included batsmen Bill Woodfull (twice), Bill Ponsford, Jack Ryder and all rounder Hunter Hendry, who played alongside him in the 1926 Tests.[13] Following his selection for the England tour, Macartney warmed up by scoring 66 and 163 not out and taking a total of 4/48 in consecutive innings victories for the Australian touring party over Tasmania.[12]",
			"after": [
				"Macartney's international farewell on the 1926 tour of England saw him at the peak of his batting powers.[48][49] Unlike the previous tour in 1921, Macartney was also prominent with the ball.[12]",
				"During the opening first-class fixture against Leicestershire, Macartney scored only two but took 5/9 in a rain-affected draw. In the next match against Essex, another rain-affected draw, he starred with the bat, scoring 148.[12] In the third match, another draw against Surrey, Macartney combined both of his skills and scored 53 and took 6/63 in the first innings.[12] His victims included English Test batsmen Jack Hobbs and Percy Fender.[13] He then took 3/21 and 4/57 as Australia beat Hampshire to record their first win of the season.[12] In nine matches before the First Test, Macartney scored 379 runs at 42.11 and took 30 wickets at 13.20.[12]"
