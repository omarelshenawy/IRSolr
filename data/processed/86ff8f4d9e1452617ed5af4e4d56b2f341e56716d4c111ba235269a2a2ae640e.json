Terminal 3 opened in 1961 and was Trans World Airlines' terminal. The terminal was expanded in 1970 to accommodate widebody operations and between 1980 and 1987, which included a new passenger connector building and baggage system connected to the original satellite.[44] It formerly housed some American Airlines flights after that airline acquired Reno Air and TWA in 1999 and 2001, respectively. Eventually, all American flights were moved to TerminalÂ 4. As of November 2014, Allegiant Air,[45] Frontier Airlines,[46] JetBlue Airways, Spirit Airlines, and Virgin America use TerminalÂ 3. US Airways moved operations to Terminal 6 on November 6, 2014.[47]",
