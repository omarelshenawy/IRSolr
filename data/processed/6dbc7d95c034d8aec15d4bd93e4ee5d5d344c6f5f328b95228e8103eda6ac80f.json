				"after": "The modern meaning of the word occult is: \"to be associated with magic, ritual and esoteric sub-culture\". The modern meaning given here is what anthropologists call an associative definition. This is not terribly precise. Actually the word \"occult\" is taken from the Latin and means literally \"to hide\" or \"hidden\". It is an adverb and has no philosophical connotations. For verification pick up any Latin grammar. This portal will concentrate on occult authors, practitioners, philosophy, rituals, and the related field of magic(k). Most often this is referred to either as; the Western Esoteric Tradition, Western mystery tradition, the Western Mystery Schools, or Western Thought. Interpretation of occultism and its concepts can be found in the belief structures of the modern pagan witchcraft religion of Wicca",
