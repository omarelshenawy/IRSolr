				"after": "The opera is named after the Emperor of Japan using the term mikado (å¾¡é or å¸ or ã¿ãã©), literally meaning \"the honorable gate\" of the imperial palace, referring metaphorically to its occupant and to the palace itself. The term was commonly used by the English in the 19th century but became obsolete.[37] To the extent that the opera portrays Japanese culture, style and government, it is a fictional version of Japan used merely to provide a picturesque setting and to capitalise on Japonism and the British fascination with Japan and the Far East and in the 1880s.[17] Gilbert wrote, \"The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.\"[38] The Mikado \"was never a story about Japan but about the failings of the British government\".[39]",
