				"The Six Ministries and their respective areas of responsibilities were as follows:",
				"In order not to let the routine administration take over the running of the empire, the Qing emperors made sure that all important matters were decided in the \"Inner Court,\" which was dominated by the imperial family and Manchu nobility and which was located in the northern part of the Forbidden City. The core institution of the inner court was the Grand Council.[g] It emerged in the 1720s under the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor as a body charged with handling Qing military campaigns against the Mongols, but it soon took over other military and administrative duties and served to centralize authority under the crown.[73] The Grand Councillors[h] served as a sort of privy council to the emperor."
