				"previous": "Various theories have been proposed for the word Kilda's origin, which dates from the late 16th century. No saint is known by the name.[14] Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name St Kilda first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666, and that it may have been derived from Norse sunt kelda (\"sweet wellwater\") or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring Tobar Childa was dedicated to a saint. (Tobar Childa is a tautological placename, consisting of the Gaelic and Norse words for well, i.e., \"well well\").[3] Martin Martin, who visited in 1697, believed that the name \"is taken from one Kilder, who lived here; and from him the large well Toubir-Kilda has also its name\".[15][16]",
				"after": "Maclean (1972) similarly suggests it may come from a corruption of the Old Norse name for the spring on Hirta, Childa, and states that a 1588 map identifies the archipelago as Kilda. He also speculates that it may refer to the Culdees, anchorites who may have brought Christianity to the island, or be a corruption of the Gaelic name for the main island of the group, since the islanders tended to pronounce r as l, and thus habitually referred to the island as Hilta.[17] Steel (1988) adds weight to the idea, noting that the islanders pronounced the H with a \"somewhat guttural quality\", making the sound they used for Hirta \"almost\" Kilta.[18] Similarly, St Kilda speakers interviewed by the School of Scottish Studies in the 1960s show individual speakers using t-initial forms, leniting to /h/, e.g. ann an t-Hirte ([ËanÌªË ÉnÌªË  ËtÊ°Ê²irË ÊtÌªÊ²É]) and gu Hirte ([kÉ ËhirË ÊtÌªÊ²É]).[19]",
