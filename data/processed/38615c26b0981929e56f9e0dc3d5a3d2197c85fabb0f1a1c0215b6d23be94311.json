				"previous": "In 1874, Enomoto was given the rank of vice-admiral in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy. The following year, he was sent to Russia as a special envoy to negotiate the Treaty of St. Petersburg. The successful conclusion of the treaty was very well received in Japan and further raised Enomoto's prestige within the ruling circles, and the fact that Enomoto had been chosen for such an important mission was seen as evidence of reconciliation between former foes in the government.[2]",
				"after": "In 1880, Enomoto became Navy Minister (æµ·è»å¿?). In 1885, his diplomatic skills were again called upon to assisting ItÅ Hirobumi in concluding the Convention of Tientsin with Qing China. Afterwards, Enomoto held a series of high posts in the Japanese government. He was Japan's first Minister of Communications (1885â1888) after the introduction of the cabinet system in 1885. He was also Minister of Agriculture and Commerce from 1894â1897, Minister of Education from 1889â1890 and Foreign Minister from 1891-1892.[3]",
