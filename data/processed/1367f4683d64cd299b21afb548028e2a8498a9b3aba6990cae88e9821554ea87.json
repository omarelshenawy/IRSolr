				"previous": "In most theories up to the eighteenth century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by RenÃ© Descartes (1637),[30] Robert Hooke (1665),[31] and Christiaan Huygens (1678);[32] however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due to the influence of Isaac Newton.[33] In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted.[34] In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction[35] that light was an electromagnetic waveâwhich was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves[36]âseemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.",
				"after": "The Maxwell wave theory, however, does not account for all properties of light. The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only on its intensity, not on its frequency; nevertheless, several independent types of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to atoms depends only on the light's frequency, not on its intensity. For example, some chemical reactions are provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain threshold; light of frequency lower than the threshold, no matter how intense, does not initiate the reaction. Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by shining light of sufficiently high frequency on it (the photoelectric effect); the energy of the ejected electron is related only to the light's frequency, not to its intensity.[37][Note 4]",
