				"previous": "On October 12, 1969, the Glens Natural Area and its waterfalls was named a National Natural Landmark, and it became a Pennsylvania State Park Natural Area in 1993, which guarantees it \"will be protected and maintained in a natural state\".[3][14] In 1987 the park's ten cabins opened.[61] In 1997 the park was named one of the firstÂ 73 Important Bird Areas in the state by the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Audubon Society.[62] That same year heavy rains washed out two bridges on the Falls Trail; because of the difficulty of transporting materials on the trail, an Army National Guard helicopter dropped 36-foot (11Â m) poles into the glens to rebuild the bridges in early 1997.[63] In the winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in the Ganoga Glen section of the park for the first time.[64] That same year training was undertaken by local fire companies to rescue people injured in the park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them especially treacherous.[65] In 1998 a project to \"repair and improve the Falls Trail\" began, with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize the trail, fix steps, cut down on erosion, and repair some bridges. Originally planned to take four years; it ended up taking six years to complete and cost nearly $1Â million.[32][66]",
				"after": "In September 1999 the remnants of Hurricane Floyd caused massive damage to the park, temporarily closing it and downing thousands of trees. The DCNR hired Carson Helicopters to salvage timber from the downed beech, cherry, maple, and oak trees for $994,000; a crew of 36Â workers spent several months cutting the fallen trees into manageable logs, then helicopters flew the logs to the Hayfield area of the park. The salvage operation ran until the fall of 2001, and yielded 3,500,000 board feet (8,300Â m3) of lumber. The operation had revenue of almost $7Â million, and had the ecological advantage of not requiring heavy logging equipment or new roads in the park.[67][68][69][70]",
