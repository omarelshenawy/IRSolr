				"previous": "Louis-FranÃ§ois Bertin was 66 in 1832, the year of the portrait.[1] He had befriended Ingres either through his son Ãdouard Bertin, a student of the painter,[2] or via Ãtienne-Jean DelÃ©cluze, Ingres' friend and the Journal's art critic.[3] In either case the genesis of the commission is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis-Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des dÃ©bats became the recognised organ of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin himself was a patron and collector who cultivated friendships with writers, painters and other artists.[4] Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by the possibilities of Bertin's personality to accept the commission.[2]",
				"after": "The painting was completed within a month, during Ingres' frequent visits to Bertin's estate of retreat, Le ChÃ¢teau des Roches, in BiÃ¨vres, Essonne. Ingres made daily visits, as Bertin entertained guests such as Victor Hugo and his mistress Juliette Drouet, Hector Berlioz, and later Franz Liszt and Charles Gounod.[5] Ingres later made drawings of the Bertin family, including a notable depiction of his host's wife, and sketches of their son Armand and daughter-in-law, CÃ©cile. The portrait of Armand shows his physical resemblance to his father.[6]",
