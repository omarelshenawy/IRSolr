				"previous": "Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationshipsâboth of similitude (ÙØ±Ø§Ø¹Ø§Øª ÙØ¸ÙØ± mura'Ã¢t-i nazÃ®r / ØªÙØ§Ø³Ø¨ tenÃ¢sÃ¼b) and opposition (ØªØ¶Ø§Ø¯ tezÃ¢d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was lyric in nature: either gazels (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kasÃ®des. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnevÃ®, a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry; the two most notable examples of this form are the Leyli and Majnun of FuzÃ»lÃ® and the HÃ¼sn Ã¼ AÅk of Åeyh GÃ¢lib.",
				"after": "Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (Ø³Ø¬Ø¹, also transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose,[162] a type of writing descended from the Arabic saj' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was MuhayyelÃ¢t (\"Fancies\") by Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi, a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867.",
