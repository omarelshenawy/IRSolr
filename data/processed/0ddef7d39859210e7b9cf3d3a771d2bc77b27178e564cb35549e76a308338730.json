				"previous": "Temperatures in the region are fairly constant, with both the daily temperature range and the seasonal range varying only slightly. February is the hottest month, averaging 25Â Â°C (77Â Â°F), while August is the coolest, averaging 19Â Â°C (66Â Â°F).[16] Climbing the peaks, temperature decreases by 1Â Â°C per 200Â m of increased altitude (1Â Â°F per 360Â ft), and temperatures on the summit decline to 1.5Â Â°C (34.7Â Â°F) in July.[20] The relative humidity for the region hovers around 87% throughout most of the year, although it rises to 97% between March and April.[16] Rain falls every month on the southern side of the mountain, with the region receiving at least 2,300Â mm (91Â in) of rain annually,[13] making it one of the wettest areas in Madagascar.[16][18] The northern side of the mountain is more tropical, with a 6-month dry season, and receives about 1,500Â mm (59Â in) of rain per year.[13] The general region receives the most rainfall during the warm season, from November through April, when heavy rain and occasional cyclones are delivered from the northwest by monsoons. During the cooler season, between May and October, lighter rains are delivered by winds from the southeast.",
				"after": "Both temperature and rainfall vary significantly by location within the park. Lower temperatures are found at higher elevations,[16] and the eastern slopes of the massif receive the most of the rainfall, since the western slopes lie in the rain shadow of the mountain and consequently experience a prolonged dry period.[16][17] The tops of the ridges experience strong winds and offer poor soil conditions. The effect can be seen in the plant life and their growth rates. The wide range in elevations and the rugged topography also play a crucial role in creation of the varied habitats distributed across the mountain slopes by affecting air temperature, fluctuations in temperature, and humidity levels. The interplay between these factors impacts the growth and development of plants, which form the foundation of the ecosystem. The result is an extremely varied and unevenly distributed forest that covers 90% of the park.[17]",
