				"after": "After power shortages in the Northwest during the 1960s, it was determined that the six remaining planned pumps be pump-generators. When energy demand is high, the pump-generators can generate electricity with water from the Banks Lake feeder canal adjacent to the dam at a higher elevation.[67] By 1973, the Pump-Generating Plant was completed and the first three generators were operational. In 1983, two more generators went online, and by January 1984 the final was operational. The six pump-generators added 314Â MW to the dam's capacity.[68] In May 2009, the Pump-Generating Plant was officially renamed the John W. KeysÂ III Pump-Generating Power Plant after John W. KeysÂ III, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's commissioner from 2001 to 2006.[69]",
