				"after": "In the first half of the 17th century, RenÃ© Descartes' mechanical philosophy encouraged the use of the metaphor of the universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution.[34] Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as BenoÃ®t de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance.[35] In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process.[36] In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.[37]",
