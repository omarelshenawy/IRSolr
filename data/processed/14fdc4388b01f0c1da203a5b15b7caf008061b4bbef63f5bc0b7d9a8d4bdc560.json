One study of nine females indicated that they begin egg development between the ages of 9 and 12Â years, but do not reach reproductive maturity until they are 15Â years old. Reproduction does not take place every year; the average interval between spawnings is three years, although other studies suggest an interval as long as ten years.[23][24] Spawning usually takes place between the months of May and July.[25]",
