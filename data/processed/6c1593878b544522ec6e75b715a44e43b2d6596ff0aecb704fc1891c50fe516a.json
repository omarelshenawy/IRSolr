				"previous": "This second formation was numbered the 6th Airborne Division, and commanded by Major General Richard Nelson Gale, who had previously raised the 1st Parachute Brigade.[5] [nb 2] Under his command would be the existing 3rd Parachute Brigade, along with two battalions (2nd Ox and Bucks and 1st Ulster Rifles) transferred from the 1st Airborne Division, to form the nucleus of the new 6th Airlanding Brigade.[4] The airlanding brigade was an important part of the airborne division, its strength being almost equal to that of the two parachute brigades combined,[7] and the glider infantry battalions were the heaviest armed infantry units in the British Army.[8] At the same time several officers who were all combat veterans from the 1st Airborne Division, were posted to the division as brigade and battalion commanders.[9] Between May and September, the remainder of the divisional units were formed, including the 5th Parachute Brigade, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery and the division's Pathfinders the 21st Independent Parachute Company.[10]",
				"after": "From June to DecemberÂ 1943, the division prepared for operations, training at every level from section up to division by day and night.[11] Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy, who would be equipped with artillery and tanks. Training was therefore designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness, with emphasis given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft.[12] A large part of the training consisted of assault courses and route marching. Military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications.[12] At the end of most exercises, the troops would march back to their barracks, usually a distance of around 20 miles (32Â km).[11] An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected; airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of 50 miles (80Â km) in 24Â hours, and battalions 32 miles (51Â km).[12]",
