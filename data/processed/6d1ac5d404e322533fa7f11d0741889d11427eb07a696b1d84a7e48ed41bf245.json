Several other scholars would visit the stone during the following centuries, such as Rhezelius in 1667, PeringskiÃ¶ld in 1694, and Olof Celsius in 1726 and in 1738. In 1864, Richard Dybeck noted that the runestone was one of several in the vicinity that had been raised anew during the summer.[98]",
