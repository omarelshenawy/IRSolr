				"after": "In most populations both sexes grow antlers and it is the only cervid species in which females grow them as well as males.[29] In the Scandinavian populations, old males' antlers fall off in December, young males' fall off in the early spring, and females' fall off in the summer. The antlers typically have two separate groups of points, a lower and upper. There is considerable subspecific variation in the size of the antlers (e.g., rather small and spindly in the northernmost subspecies),[30] but, on average, the bull reindeer's antlers are the second largest of any extant deer, after the moose. In the largest races, the antlers of big males can range up to 100Â cm (39Â in) in width and 135Â cm (53Â in) in beam length. They have the largest antlers relative to body size among living deer species.[29]",
