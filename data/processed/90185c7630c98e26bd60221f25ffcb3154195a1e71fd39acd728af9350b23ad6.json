				"after": "The causes of supercontinent assembly and dispersal are thought to be driven by processes in the mantle.[2] Approximately 660Â km into the mantle, a discontinuity occurs, affecting the surface crust through processes like plumes and \"superplumes\". When a slab of crust that is subducted is denser than the surrounding mantle, it sinks to the discontinuity. Once the slabs build up, they will sink through to the lower mantle in what is known as a \"slab avalanche\". This displacement at the discontinuity will cause the lower mantle to compensate and rise elsewhere. The rising mantle can form a plume or superplume.",
