				"after": "According to the Joan MirÃ³ Foundation, \"MirÃ³'s despondency brought about by the moral tragedy of the war can be seen in the violent metamorphosis of the figure, in her heavy limbs and in the effort involved in climbing.\"[4] At the top right is a kind of window or box where light rays can be seen entering the room. The woman is using her right arm to try to grab a ladder â this was a symbol that MirÃ³ used in several of his works to represent evasion or escape. The external genitals of the woman are similar to those of the woman in Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement as they are exaggerated in size.[5] This work is said to be related to Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, made by Marcel Duchamp, although here the woman is ascending. The distortion and effort of the figure are interpreted as mirroring the Spanish Civil War.[4] Interestingly Duchamp's painting was not wholly original; it alluded to the earlier photographs by Eadweard Muybridge[6] which were amongst the first to record animal locomotion. MirÃ³ first saw this work by Duchamp in 1912, during the Cubist art exhibition held at the Dalmau Gallery (Galeries Dalmau) in Barcelona.[7][8]",
