				"previous": "One particular weapon developed by the Soviet Union (Fractional Orbital Bombardment System) had a partial orbital trajectory, and unlike most ICBMs its target could not be deduced from its orbital flight path. It was decommissioned in compliance with arms control agreements, which address the maximum range of ICBMs and prohibit orbital or fractional-orbital weapons.",
			"after": [
				"Russia, the United States, China and India are the only countries currently known to possess land-based ICBMs, Israel has also tested ICBMs but is not open about actual deployment.[21][22]",
				"The United States currently operates 450 ICBMs in three USAF bases. The only model deployed is LGM-30G Minuteman-III."
