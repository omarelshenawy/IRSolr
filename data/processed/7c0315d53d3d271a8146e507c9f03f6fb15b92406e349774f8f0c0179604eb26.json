				"after": "The peregrine falcon has a body length of 34Â to 58Â cm (13â23Â in) and hi wingspan from 74Â to 120Â cm (29â47Â in).[4][15] The male and female have similar markings and plumage, but as in many birds of prey the peregrine falcon displays marked sexual dimorphism in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male.[16] Males weigh 330Â to 1,000Â g (0.73â2.20Â lb) and the noticeably larger females weigh 700Â to 1,500Â g (1.5â3.3Â lb). In most subspecies, males weigh less than 700Â g (1.5Â lb) and females weigh more than 800Â g (1.8Â lb), with cases of females weighing about 50% more than their male breeding mates not uncommon.[5][17][18] The standard linear measurements of peregrines are: the wing chord measures 26.5â39Â cm (10.4â15.4Â in), the tail measures 13â19Â cm (5.1â7.5Â in) and the tarsus measures 4.5 to 5.6Â cm (1.8 to 2.2Â in).[11]",
