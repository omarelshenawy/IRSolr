				"after": "Hawaii's climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east. Summer highs usually reach around 88Â Â°F (31Â Â°C) during the day and 75Â Â°F (24Â Â°C) at night. Winter day temperatures are usually around 83Â Â°F (28Â Â°C); at low elevation they seldom dip below 65Â Â°F (18Â Â°C) at night. Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at 13,800Â feet (4,200Â m) on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on Hawaii Island in some winter months. Snow rarely falls on HaleakalÄ. Mount WaiÊ»aleÊ»ale on KauaÊ»i has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about 460Â inches (12,000Â mm) per year. Most of Hawaii experiences only two seasons; the dry season runs from May to October and the wet season is from October to April.[54]",
