				"previous": "Another factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the codex, which had originated in the Roman period.[24] Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the ancient scroll at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).[25] The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both recto and verso could be used for writing â and printing.[26]",
				"after": "A fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,[27] allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese[28] and Muslim papermaking.[29] Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.[30]",
