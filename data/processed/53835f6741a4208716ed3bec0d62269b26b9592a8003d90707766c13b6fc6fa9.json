These fossils are found in Laurasia,[84] the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas) diverged from other placental mammals during the Cenozoic and the rodents and lagomorphs radiated around the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.[85] Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are in agreement with the fossil record.[86][87]",
