				"after": "Unlike the Ming emperors, who named their eldest legitimate son heir apparent whenever possible and forbade other sons from participating in politics, the Qing monarchs did not choose their successors according to primogeniture.[2] When in 1622 Nurhaci (1559â1626) was asked which one of his sons he had chosen to succeed him as khan of the Jurchens, he refused to answer, telling his sons that they should determine after his death who among them was the most qualified leader.[2] His answer reflected the fact that in Jurchen society, succession as tribal chieftain was usually determined by merit, not descent.[2] When Nurhaci died in 1626, a committee of Manchu princes selected Hong Taiji (1592â1643) as his successor.[3] Hong Taiji's death in 1643 caused another succession crisis, because many of Nurhaci's other sons appeared to be qualified leaders. As a compromise, the Manchu princes chose Hong Taiji's four-year-old son Fulin (the Shunzhi Emperor, r. 1643â1661) as his successor, marking the adoption of father-son succession in the Qing imperial line.[4]",
