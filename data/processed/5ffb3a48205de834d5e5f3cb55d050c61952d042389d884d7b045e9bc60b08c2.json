				"previous": "As noted, an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen (see the filled Ï* orbitals in the diagram), orbitals which are of equal energyâi.e., degenerateâis a configuration termed a spin triplet state. Hence, the ground state of the O 2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.[13][a] The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two.",
				"after": "In the triplet form, O 2 molecules are paramagnetic. That is, they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O 2 molecules.[clarification needed][14] Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.[15][b]",
