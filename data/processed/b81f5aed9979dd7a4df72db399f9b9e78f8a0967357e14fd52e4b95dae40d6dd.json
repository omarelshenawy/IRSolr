				"after": "Elida formed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on July 13. The wave moved uneventfully through the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, emerging over the Pacific Ocean on July 21. The wave began organizing the next day, becoming Tropical Depression Six-E on July 23 while 350Â mi (560Â km) south-southeast of Puerto Escondido, Mexico.[1] The depression was predicted to move westward due to the presence of a ridge of high pressure which was also controlling the movement of Hurricane Douglas.[2] Due to low shear and warm ocean waters, it was predicted that the depression would reach hurricane strength in 48Â hours.[2] The depression began rapid intensification while moving westward,[1] and only sixÂ hours after being recognized as a depression, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Elida while displaying banding features and a central dense overcast. The forecast was revised, now predicting the storm to attain hurricane strength the next day.[3]",
