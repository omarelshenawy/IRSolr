				"previous": "When strong wind deviates, the change of wind direction implies a change in the wind speed. A stream of wind can change its direction by differences of pressure. CAT appears more frequently when the wind is surrounding a low pressure region, especially with sharp troughs that change the wind direction more than 100Â°. Extreme CAT has been reported without any other factor than this.",
				"after": "Mountain waves are formed when four requirements are met. When these factors coincide with jet streams, CAT can occur:",
