Anarcho-capitalists argue for a society based in voluntary trade of private property in order to maximize individual liberty and prosperity. In the place of the state's tax-funded, centrally controlled security, infrastructure, banking and other services, an anarcho-capitalist society relies on individuals to voluntarily fund socially desirable services through the self-regulated free market.",
