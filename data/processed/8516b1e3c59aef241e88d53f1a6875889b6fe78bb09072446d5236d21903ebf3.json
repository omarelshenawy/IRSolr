				"previous": "On 26 June 1988, a chartered Air France Airbus A320-111 (F-GFKC)[43] crashed into trees at the end of runway at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport. Three out of 130 passengers were killed.[43] In February 1990 another A320, flown by Indian Airlines, crashed landed short of the airport runway in Bangalore. The ensuing fire contributed to the casualty count of ninety-two, out of 146 on board.[44] The press and media later questioned the fly-by-wire flight control system.[43] Subsequent investigations by commission of inquiry found \"no malfunction of the aircraft or its equipment which could have contributed towards a reduction in safety or an increase in the crew's workload during the final flight phaseÂ ... the response of the engines was normal and in compliance with certification requirement\" .[43]",
				"after": "In 2009, Airbus required about eight months to build one A320.[45] Components from various Airbus plants are transported to the final assembly plant at Hamburg Finkenwerder for the A318/A319/A320/A321[46] and to Toulouse Blagnac for the A320. Nearly all assemblies are moved using Airbus' A300-600ST Beluga outsized transporters. Airbus A320s sold to Chinese airlines scheduled for delivery between 2009 and 2012 are being assembled in Tianjin, China.[47]",
