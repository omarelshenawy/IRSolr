				"after": "The Stuart or English Baroque period (1666â1713) saw more expansion of the city. Large mansions such as Kings Weston House[33] and Goldney Hall[34] were constructed. The needs of the poor and destitute became the responsibility of institutions such as Colstons[35] and the Merchant Venturers Almshouses.[36] The King Street area was developed outside the \"Back Street Gate\" of the city, home to the King William and Naval Volunteer Public Houses.[37] The nearby Queen Square was planned during this era. In 1669, a series of four flights of steps, now called Christmas Steps, was constructed to replace a steep, muddy, and narrow street formerly known as Queene Street.[38][39] Many of the larger houses of this period, including Queen Square, were built for merchant families who were heavily involved in the slave triangle, importing goods from slave plantations. A few African and creole (American/Caribbean-born) slaves came to Bristol as servants.[40]",
