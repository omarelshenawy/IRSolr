				"after": "Myotis alcathoe is the smallest European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below.[3] Younger animals may be completely gray-brown.[17] The brown fur distinguishes adult M.Â alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified on the basis of morphology.[18] M.Â alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.Â emarginatus in color.[19] On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8Â mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.[5]",
