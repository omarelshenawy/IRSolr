				"previous": "Despite the Soviet government's efforts, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people rallied to commemorate the victims of Soviet deportations.[1] This event, organized by the human rights group Helsinki-86, was the first time after the Soviet occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities.[1][21] In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place. Helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year to commemorate the anniversary of the MolotovâRibbentrop Pact, at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water.[22] Yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to more than half a million participants (about one quarter of Latvia's population) and three years later, on May 4, 1990, the re-establishment of the independence of Latvia was declared.[23]",
				"after": "Since the re-establishment of independence the monument has become a focal point for a variety of events. One of these â on March 16, the commemoration day of veterans of the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS, who fought the Soviet Union during World War II â has caused controversy.[24] The date was first celebrated by Latvians in exile before being brought to Latvia in 1990 and for a short time (1998â2000) was the official remembrance day.[24][25] In 1998 the event drew the attention of the foreign mass media and in the following year the Russian government condemned the event as a glorification of Nazism.[24] The event evolved into a political conflict between Latvians and Russians, posing a threat to public safety.[13][26]",
