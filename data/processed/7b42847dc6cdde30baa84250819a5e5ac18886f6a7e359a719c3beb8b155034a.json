				"previous": "Like clergy, civilians were executed in Republican territories. Some civilians were executed as suspected Falangists.[255] Others died in acts of revenge after Republicans heard of massacres carried out in the Nationalist zone.[256] Air raids committed against Republican cities were another driving factor.[257] Shopkeepers and industrialists were shot if they didn't sympathize with the Republicans, and were usually spared if they did.[258] Fake justice was sought through a commission, known in Russia as checas.[255]",
				"after": "As pressure mounted with the increasing success of the Nationalists, many civilians were executed by councils and tribunals controlled by competing Communist and anarchist groups.[255] Some members of the latter were executed by Soviet-advised communist functionaries in Catalonia,[259] as recounted by George Orwell's description of the purges in Barcelona in 1937 in Homage to Catalonia, which followed a period of increasing tension between competing elements of the Catalan political scene. Some individuals fled to friendly embassies, which would house up to 8,500 people during the war.[256]",
