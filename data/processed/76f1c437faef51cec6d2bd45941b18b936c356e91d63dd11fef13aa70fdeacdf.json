				"after": "Boeing later introduced the 737-900, the longest and most powerful variant to date. Alaska Airlines launched the 737-900 in 1997 and accepted delivery on May 15, 2001. Because the -900 retained the same number of emergency exits as the -800, the maximum seating capacity was the same as the -800 at 189. The 737-900 also retained the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) and fuel capacity of the -800, trading range for payload. These shortcomings, until recently, prevented the 737-900 from effectively competing with the Airbus A321.[citation needed]",
