The ratio of the surface exchange coefficients, , is typically taken to be 1. However, observations suggest that the drag coefficient varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane.[33] Additionally, may vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of sea spray on evaporation within the boundary layer.[34]",
