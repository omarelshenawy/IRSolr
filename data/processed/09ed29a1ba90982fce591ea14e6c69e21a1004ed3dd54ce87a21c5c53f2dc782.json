				"previous": "The Cayman Islands are in the western Caribbean Sea and are the peaks of a massive underwater ridge, known as the Cayman Ridge (or Cayman Rise). This ridge flanks the Cayman Trough, 6,000Â m (20,000Â ft) deep[15] which lies 6Â km (3.7Â mi) to the south.[16] The islands lie in the northwest of the Caribbean Sea, east of Quintana Roo, Mexico and the Yucatan Mexico, south of Cuba and west of Jamaica. They are situated about 700Â km (430Â mi) south of Miami,[17] 750Â km (470Â mi) east of Mexico,[18] 366Â km (227Â mi) south of Cuba,[19] and about 500Â km (310Â mi) northwest of Jamaica.[20] Grand Cayman is by far the biggest, with an area of 197Â km2 (76Â sqÂ mi).[21] Grand Cayman's two \"Sister Islands\", Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, are about 120Â km (75Â mi) east north-east of Grand Cayman and have areas of 38 and 28.5Â km2 (14.7 and 11.0Â sqÂ mi)[22] respectively.",
				"after": "All three islands were formed by large coral heads covering submerged ice age peaks of western extensions of the Cuban Sierra Maestra range and are mostly flat. One notable exception to this is The Bluff on Cayman Brac's eastern part, which rises to 43Â m (141Â ft) above sea level, the highest point on the islands.[23]",
