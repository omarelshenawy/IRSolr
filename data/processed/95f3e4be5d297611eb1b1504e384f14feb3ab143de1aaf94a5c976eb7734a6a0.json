				"after": "The ruff is a migratory species, breeding in wetlands in colder regions of northern Eurasia, and spends the northern winter in the tropics, mainly in Africa. Some Siberian breeders undertake an annual round trip of up to 30,000Â km (18,500Â mi) to the West African wintering grounds.[19] There is a limited overlap of the summer and winter ranges in western Europe.[3] The ruff breeds in extensive lowland freshwater marshes and damp grasslands.[3] It avoids barren tundra and areas badly affected by severe weather, preferring hummocky marshes and deltas with shallow water. The wetter areas provide a source of food, the mounds and slopes may be used for leks, and dry areas with sedge or low scrub offer nesting sites.[20] A Hungarian study showed that moderately intensive grazing of grassland, with more than one cow per hectare (2.5Â acres), was found to attract more nesting pairs.[21] When not breeding, the birds use a wider range of shallow wetlands, such as irrigated fields, lake margins, and mining subsidence and other floodlands. Dry grassland, tidal mudflats and the seashore are less frequently used.[20] The density can reach 129 individuals per square kilometre (334 per square mile), but is usually much lower.[22]",
