				"after": "The wood of B.Â integrifolia is pink to red, with inconspicuous rings and conspicuous rays. It is spongy and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33Â lb/ftÂ³). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying,[25] has poor load-bearing qualities, and is susceptible to termite attack;[37] it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental turnery, and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees.[40] It is a useful firewood.[41]",
