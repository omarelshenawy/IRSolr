				"In terms of aesthetic values, Italo Calvino cited the fairy tale as a prime example of \"quickness\" in literature, because of the economy and concision of the tales.[18]",
				"Steven Swann Jones identified the presence of magic as the feature by which fairy tales can be distinguished from other sorts of folktales.[16] Davidson and Chaudri identify \"transformation\" as the key feature of the genre.[5] From a psychological point of view, Jean Chiriac argued for the necessity of the fantastic in these narratives.[17]"
			],
				"after": "Originally, stories that we would now call fairy tales were not marked out as a separate genre. The German term \"MÃ¤rchen\" stems from the old German word \"MÃ¤r\", which means story or tale. The word \"MÃ¤rchen\" is the diminutive of the word \"MÃ¤r\", therefore it means a \"little story\". Together with the common beginning \"once upon a time\" it means a fairy tale or a mÃ¤rchen was originally a little story from a long time ago, when the world was still magic. (Indeed one less regular German opening is \"In the old times when wishing was still effective\".)",
