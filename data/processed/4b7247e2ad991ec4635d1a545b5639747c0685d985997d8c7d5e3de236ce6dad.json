				"previous": "The flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its capabilities in terms of airspeed and load factor or altitude.[4][5] The term can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability. When a craft is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown \"outside the envelope\", something considered unsafe.",
				"after": "The range is the distance an aircraft can fly between takeoff and landing, as limited by the time it can remain airborne.",
