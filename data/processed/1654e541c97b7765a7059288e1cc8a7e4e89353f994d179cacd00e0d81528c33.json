				"after": "Mushroom polysaccharides from a number of species have attracted research interest for their immunomodulatory and antitumor properties.[47] Extracts from A.Â hygrometricus containing the polysaccharide named AE2 were found to inhibit the growth of several tumor cell lines in laboratory tests,[48][49] and stimulated the growth of splenocytes, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells from mice. The extract also stimulated mouse cells associated with the immune system; specifically, it enhanced the activity of mouse natural killer cells, stimulated macrophages to produce nitric oxide, and enhanced production of cytokines.[38][50][51][52] The activation of macrophages by AE2 might be mediated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway of signal transduction.[53][54] AE2 is made of the simple sugars mannose, glucose, and fucose in a 1:2:1 ratio.[37]",
