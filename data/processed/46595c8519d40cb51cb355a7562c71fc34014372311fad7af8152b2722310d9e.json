				"previous": "The Germans were using layers of rubber laid over leather hide with a treated fibre inner surface for the self-sealing tanks on their Junkers Ju 88 bombers early in the war.[2]",
				"after": "In the US, Ernst Eger of United States Rubber Company (later Uniroyal) patented[3] a self-sealing fuel tank design in 1941; one of many companies involved in developing this technology during the war. Goodyear chemist James Merrill filed a patent in 1941 (published in 1947) for refining and successfully testing his method for manufacturing self-sealing tanks using a two-layer system of rubber compounds encased in a metal outer shell or the wing lining of the aircraft.[4] In 1942, he received a War Production Board citation from President Roosevelt and the Goodyear tanks were subsequently placed in service in Goodyear-produced Corsair fighters, as well as other aircraft. By 1942 Fireproof Tanks had developed the first flexible fuel bladders as range extender tanks for the MkIX Spitfire. These tanks were flexible containers, made of a laminated self-sealing material like vulcanized rubber and with as few seams as possible to minimize leak paths.",
