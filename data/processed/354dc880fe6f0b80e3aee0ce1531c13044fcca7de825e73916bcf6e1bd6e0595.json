				"previous": "The city, in combination with localities forming the wider metropolitan area, is home to over 15Â million as of 2013[update].[74] The population is growing by an estimated 4.2% per year, one of the highest rates amongst Asian cities.[69] The continuing growth reflects ongoing migration from rural areas to the Dhaka urban region, which accounted for 60% of the city's growth in the 1960s and 1970s. More recently, the city's population has also grown with the expansion of city boundaries, a process that added more than a million people to the city in the 1980s.[69] According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, Dhaka will be home to 25 million people by the year 2025.[75]",
