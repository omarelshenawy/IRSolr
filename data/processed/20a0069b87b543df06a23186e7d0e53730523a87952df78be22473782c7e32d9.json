				"Recently, the article 2010 Public van accident on Uttraphimuk Flyover brings about a debate as to juvenile offender. According to Thailand's Juvenile and Family Courts and Juvenile and Family Case Procedure Act, BE 2553 (2010), the name and other information of a juvenile offender must not be disclosed unless the court so permits. The article contains quite detailed information about a girl offender who causes death to nine van passengers and causes another six to sustain serious injuries in the accident. Several editors demand for removal of such information, and others argue that censorship should not take place in the Thai Wikipedia. The dispute is left unsolved and the article still contains that information (see its talk page)."
