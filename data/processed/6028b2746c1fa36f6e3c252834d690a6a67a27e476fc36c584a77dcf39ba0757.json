				"previous": "These years were a period of intense self-education. Cardus became an habituÃ© of the local libraries, and extended his reading from Dickens to include many of the masters of literature: Fielding, Thackeray, Conrad andâwith more reservationâHardy and Henry James.[20] In due course he added philosophy and metaphysics to his curriculum; this began with his discovery of George Henry Lewes, which led him on to the works of Kant, Hume, Berkeley and, eventually, Schopenhauer.[21] He supplemented these studies by attending free lectures at Manchester University,[22] and met regularly with a group of like-minded autodidacts at Alexandra Park or, in the winter, at the Lyons cafÃ© in Albert Square, to discuss and debate for whole afternoons. At first Cardus's schedule of self-improvement was random; eventually he compiled what he called a \"cultural scheme\" whereby he devoted a set weekly number of hours to different subjects.[23]",
				"after": "Cardus's interest in music began with the popular tunes sung by his mother and her sisters in the family home. He remembered hearing for the first time the melody of the \"Vilja\" song from Franz LehÃ¡r's operetta The Merry Widow, which \"curled its way into my heart to stay there for a lifetime\".[25] In April 1907 he was \"sweptÂ ... into the seven seas of music\" by a performance of Edward German's operetta Tom Jones.[26] \"I am unable to explain\", Cardus wrote many years later, \"why it should have been left to Edward Germanâof all composersâto release the flood\".[27] He began going to the HallÃ© Orchestra's concerts at the Free Trade Hall where, on 3 December 1908, he was present at the premiere of Elgar's first symphony, under Hans Richter.[23] He regularly attended the fortnightly concerts at the Royal Manchester College of Music, where students' performances were assessed by the principal, Adolph Brodsky.[28] As part of his scheme of study, Cardus briefly took singing lessons, his only formal instruction in music.[29] In 1912 Cardus published his first musical article, \"Bantock and Style in Music\", in Musical Opinion.[30][n 2]",
