				"after": "In the first volume of the 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758), Carl Linnaeus, the founder of modern binomial nomenclature, created the genus Lemur to include three species: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), Lemur catta (the ring-tailed lemur), and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).[12] Although the term \"lemur\" was at first intended for lorises, it was soon applied to the endemic Malagasy primates, which have been known as \"lemurs\" ever since.[13][14] The name derives from the Latin term lemures, which refers to the \"spirits of the dead\" from Roman mythology.[1] According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris.[14] Being familiar with the works of Virgil and Ovid and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term \"lemur\" for these nocturnal primates.[15] However, it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, reflective eyes, and ghostly cries of lemurs.[14] It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that the some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors,[16] but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India.[14]",
