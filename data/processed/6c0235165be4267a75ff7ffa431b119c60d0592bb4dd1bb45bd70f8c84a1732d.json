				"previous": "In the United States and Canada, a townhouse has two connotations. The older predates the automobile and denotes a house on a small footprint in a city, but because of its multiple floors (sometimes six or more), it has a large living space, often with servants' quarters. The small footprint of the townhouse allows it to be within walking or mass-transit distance of business and industrial areas of the city yet luxurious enough for wealthy residents of the city.[2]",
			"after": [
				"Townhouses are expensive where detached single-family houses are uncommon, such as in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.",
				"\"Rowhouses\" are similar and consist of several adjacent (next-to), uniform units originally found in older, pre-automobile urban areas such as Baltimore, Charleston (South Carolina), Savannah, and New Orleans but now found in lower-cost housing developments in suburbs as well. A townhouse is where there is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses, but some have a double wall with inches-wide air space in between on a common foundation. A rowhouse will generally be smaller and less luxurious than a dwelling called a townhouse."
