				"after": "Glaciers are among the most conspicuous and dynamic geologic features on Mount Rainier. They erode the volcanic cone and are important sources of streamflow for several rivers, including some that provide water for hydroelectric power and irrigation. Together with perennial snow patches, the 26 major glaciers cover about 36 square miles (93Â km2) of the mountain's surface and have a volume of about 1 cubic mile (4.2Â km3).[20][21]",
