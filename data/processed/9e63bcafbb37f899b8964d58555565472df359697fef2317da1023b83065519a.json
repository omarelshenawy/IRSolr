They live alone, and, apart from the burrow created for rearing young, they have no fixed shelter or nest site. They do not have a home territory they defend against other echidnas, but range over a wide area.[30] The range area has been observed to be between 21 and 93Â ha, although one study in Kangaroo Island found the animals there covered an area between 9 and 192Â ha.[30] Overall, the mean range areas across the various regions of Australia were 40â60Â ha. There was no correlation between gender and range area, but a weak one with size.[30] Echidnas can share home ranges without incident, and sometimes share shelter sites if not enough are available for or each animal to have one individually.[66]",
