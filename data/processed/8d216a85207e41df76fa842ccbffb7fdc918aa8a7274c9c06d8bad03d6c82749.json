				"previous": "In January 1968, the United Kingdom terminated its F-111K order,[110] citing higher cost; increased costs along with devaluation of the pound had raised the cost to around Â£3 million each.[111] The first two F-111Ks (one strike/recon F-111K and one trainer/strike TF-111K) were in the final stages of assembly when the order was canceled.[110] The two aircraft were later completed and accepted by the USAF as test aircraft with the YF-111A designation.[109]",
				"after": "The FB-111A was a strategic bomber version of the F-111 for the USAF Strategic Air Command. With Air Force's Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft program proceeding slowly, and concerns of fatigue failures in the B-52 fleet, the service needed an interim bomber quickly. The FB-111A was selected in 1965 to replace the supersonic Convair B-58 Hustler and early B-52 variants.[112] The Air Force signed a contract for the FB-111A in 1966. In 1968, plans called for 263 FB-111s, but the total was cut to 76 in 1969. The first production aircraft flew in 1968. Deliveries ended in June 1971.[113]",
