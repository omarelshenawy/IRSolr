				"previous": "Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement of B.Â grossa was the same as in 1981, except that B.Â telmatiaea was moved to set between it and B.Â leptophylla. The placement of B.Â grossa in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows:[4]",
				"after": "Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very different from George's arrangement. Banksia grossa was inferred to be sister to a polytomous clade consisting of B.Â leptophylla, B.Â telmatiaea, B.Â scabrella and B.Â lanata:[8][9][10]",
