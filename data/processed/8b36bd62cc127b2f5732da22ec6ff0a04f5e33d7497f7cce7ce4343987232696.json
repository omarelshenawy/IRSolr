In June, July and August, the Grammy-nominated Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus performs free classical concerts at the Grant Park Music Festival.[65] The festival, a Chicago tradition since 1931, remains the nation's only free, outdoor classical music series.[66][67] Although the Music Festival shares pavilion space with several other program series and annual performances, its concerts most Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evenings throughout the heart of the summer are the core of the pavilion's offerings.[17] Travel guide Frommer's lists the park, pavilion, and these free concerts as some of the best free things to do in Chicago.[68] In summer the pavilion also hosts a series of jazz concerts,[69] and the Great Lawn hosts yoga and pilates workouts on Saturday mornings.[70]",
