				"after": "On February 29, 2000, Boeing launched its next-generation twinjet program,[82] initially called 777-X,[77] and began issuing offers to airlines.[70] Development was slowed by an industry downturn during the early 2000s.[72] The first model to emerge from the program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France,[83] along with additional commitments.[70] On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004.[84] The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004.[72] The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s,[85] benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.[86]",
