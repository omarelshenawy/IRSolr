				"after": "American paddlefish are among the largest and longest lived freshwater fishes in North America.[20] They have a shark-like body, average 1.5 metres (4.9Â ft) in length, weigh 27 kilograms (60Â lb), and can live in excess of thirty years.[21] For most populations the median age is five to eight years and the maximum age is fourteen to eighteen years.[20] The age of American paddlefish is best determined by dentary studies, a process which usually occurs on fish harvested during snagging season, a popular sport fishing activity in certain parts of the U.S. The dentary is removed from the lower jawbone, cleaned of any remaining soft tissue, and cross-sectioned to expose the annual rings. The dentary rings are counted in much the same way a tree is aged. Dentary studies suggest that some individuals can live 60 years or longer, and that females typically live longer and grow larger than males.[22]",
