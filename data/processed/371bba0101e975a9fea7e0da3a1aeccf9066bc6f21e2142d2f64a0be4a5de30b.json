				"previous": "In December 2006, Eurocopter president Fabrice BrÃ©gier stated that between 30 to 40 Dauphins were being delivered each year.[3] By 2011, more than 1,000 AS365/366/565 versions had been produced; Indian operator Pawan Hans took delivery of the 1,000th Dauphin produced in April 2011, at which point the type was reportedly in service with over 300 operators worldwide.[1]",
				"after": "The AS365 Dauphin is a twin-engine helicopter capable of travelling long ranges, and well suited to operating in climates of a high ambient temperature or at locations of significant altitude. The main cabin area can accommodate a total of 11 passengers, or up to seven when using a more spacious VIP configuration. Access to the cabin is via large sliding doors on either side of the helicopter, built-in boarding steps are typically installed to ease the boarding of passengers.[4]",
