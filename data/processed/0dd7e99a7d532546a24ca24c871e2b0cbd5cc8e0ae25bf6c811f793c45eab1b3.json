It is unclear why he included RÃ©union, but he also combined accounts about the Rodrigues solitaire and a third bird (\"oiseau de Nazareth\", now thought to be a dodo) under the same section.[2] English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland discussed the old descriptions of the RÃ©union solitaire in his 1848 book The Dodo and Its Kindred, and concluded it was distinct from the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.[3] Baron Edmond de SÃ©lys Longchamps coined the scientific name Apterornis solitarius for the RÃ©union solitaire in 1848, apparently making it the type species of the genus, in which he also included two other Mascarene birds only known from contemporary accounts, the red rail and the RÃ©union swamphen.[8] As the name Apterornis had already been used for a different bird by Richard Owen, and the other former names were likewise invalid, Bonaparte coined the new binomial Ornithaptera borbonica in 1854 (Bourbon was the original French name for RÃ©union).[9] In 1854, Hermann Schlegel placed the solitaire in the same genus as the dodo, and named it Didus apterornis.[10] He restored it strictly according to contemporary accounts, which resulted in an ibis or stork-like bird instead of a dodo.[2] As it was considered congeneric with the dodo, the RÃ©union solitaire was long believed to also be a member of the Dididae family of pigeons.[11]",
