				"after": "The airline was first established in December 1990 under the name of OceanAir and in 1991 was authorized to operate air transport services as a non-scheduled carrier. SATA Air AÃ§ores became the major shareholder when OceanAir suspended flying in 1994 and later became the sole owner. On 20 February 1998 it was renamed SATA International and started operations on 8 April 1998. The airline is 100% owned by SATA Air AÃ§ores. SATA owns two tour operators in North America: SATA Express in Canada and Azores Express in the United States.[3] Following its bid by public tender, SATA International was awarded scheduled routes from Ponta Delgada to Lisbon, Madeira Island and Porto. Today SATA operates a number of transatlantic routes such as Faro to Toronto nonstop.",
