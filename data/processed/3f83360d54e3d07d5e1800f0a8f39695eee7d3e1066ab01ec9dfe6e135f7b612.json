				"previous": "In NOR flash, each cell has one end connected directly to ground, and the other end connected directly to a bit line. This arrangement is called \"NOR flash\" because it acts like a NOR gate: when one of the word lines (connected to the cell's CG) is brought high, the corresponding storage transistor acts to pull the output bit line low. NOR flash continues to be the technology of choice for embedded applications requiring a discrete non-volatile memory device. The low read latencies characteristic of NOR devices allow for both direct code execution and data storage in a single memory product.[20]",
				"after": "A single-level NOR flash cell in its default state is logically equivalent to a binary \"1\" value, because current will flow through the channel under application of an appropriate voltage to the control gate, so that the bitline voltage is pulled down. A NOR flash cell can be programmed, or set to a binary \"0\" value, by the following procedure:",
