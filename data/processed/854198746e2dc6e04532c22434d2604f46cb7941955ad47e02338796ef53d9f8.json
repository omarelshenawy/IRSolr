				"previous": "Traditionally theatre and stage lighting has been of the \"generic\" type. These are lights which are focussed, geled, and then simply dimmed to give the effect the designer wants. In recent years the emergence of moving lights (or automated lights) has had a substantial impact of theatre and stage lighting.",
				"after": "A typical moving light allows the designer to control the position, color, shape, and strobing of the light beam created. This can be used for exciting effects for the entertainment or dancefloor use. Moving lights are also often used instead of having a large number of \"generic\" lights. This is because one moving light can do the work of several generics.",
