The eggs are laid near the water so the hatchlings can return to the sea.[49] The loggerhead's sex is dictated by the temperature of the underground nest. Incubation temperatures generally range from 26-32Â°C (79-90Â°F). Sea turtle eggs kept at a constant incubating temperature of 32Â°C become females. Eggs incubating at 28Â°C become males. An incubation temperature of 30Â°C results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings.[50] Hatchlings from eggs in the middle of the clutch tend to be the largest, grow the fastest, and be the most active during the first few days of sea life.[41]",
