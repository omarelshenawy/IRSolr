				"after": "In 1913, Bethlehem Steel Corporation purchased the yard for $4.8Â million (equivalent to $115Â million in today's dollars),[2] as Charles M. Schwab was looking to diversify the company. At the time, the yard was constructing 23 vessels and doing a business of $20Â million (equivalent to $477Â million in today's dollars)[2] a year. The yard was 110 acres (45Â ha; 0.17Â sqÂ mi) in size, and had a capacity for 60,000 short tons (54,000Â t). At this time, Bethlehem decided to construct a drydock, although it would take into the 1920s to make this happen. Finally, immediate improvements were made to the yard to improve its financial well-being.[1]",
