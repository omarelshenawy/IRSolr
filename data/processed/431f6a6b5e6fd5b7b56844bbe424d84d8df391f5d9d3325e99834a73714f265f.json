				"after": "For the first time under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team travelled to Australia for the 1903â04 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two.[42] Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276Â runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings.[43] In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a \"very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [crowd] demonstration\".[44] Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground.[2] The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting \"Crock!, Crock!, Crock!\"[4] Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground.[4] Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216Â runs.[45]",
