				"after": "The long-tailed ground roller's silhouette is highly distinctive due to its long tail and plump silhouette.[12] The bird is 34 to 47 centimeters (13 to 19Â in) long, although its tail can contribute up to 30 centimeters (12Â in) of the length, which makes it the longest tail of any of the ground rollers.[11][12] This ground roller has short wings and long, pinkish-brown legs.[13] The male has a sandy buff crown and dark brown upperparts with black streaks.[11] Its supercilium is a pale buff color, while the ear-coverts are brown.[11] The eyes are brown, while the short and stout beak is black.[1][11] Its tongue is long with a brush-like tip to help it collect insects.[4] A white stripe is present at the base of the bill and is surrounded by brown and black malar stripes. These malar stripes and the black breastband frame a white throat.[11] The tail has 15 to 20 dark brown bars marking it, while the outer rectrices are sky blue; this sky blue is also present on the wing-coverts.[11] In flight, the bird's two black and white bands on the primaries and secondaries are conspicuous.[11] The underparts are a light gray, and the breast white.[11] The toes are zygodactylous, with the first and fourth toes turned outwards and the middle two toes turned inwards.[13] The female resembles the male, but is smaller and has a narrower chestband and a shorter tail.[11][14] Also, the female loses her tail while nesting.[13] These differences make the long-tailed ground roller the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism.[4] Juveniles of both sexes resemble the adult female, but have duller plumage, particularly in the black bands on the chest, neck, and eyes.[12]",
