				"previous": "One of the most complex characters found in modern Chinese dictionaries[g] is é½ (U+9F49) (nÃ ng, Â listenÂ (helpÂ·info), pictured below, middle image), meaning \"snuffle\" (that is, a pronunciation marred by a blocked nose), with \"just\" thirty-six strokes. However, this is not in common use. The most complex character that can be input using the Microsoft New Phonetic IME 2002a for traditional Chinese is é¾ (dÃ¡, \"the appearance of a dragon flying\"). It is composed of the dragon radical represented three times, for a total of 16 Ã 3 = 48 strokes. Among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in frequent modern use are ç±² (yÃ¹, \"to implore\"), with 32 strokes; é¬± (yÃ¹, \"luxuriant, lush; gloomy\"), with 29 strokes, as in æé¬± (yÅuyÃ¹, \"depressed\"); è± (yÃ n, \"colorful\"), with 28 strokes; and é (xÃ¬n, \"quarrel\"), with 25 strokes, as in æé (tiÇoxÃ¬n, \"to pick a fight\"). Also in occasional modern use is é±» (xiÄn \"fresh\"; variant of é®® xiÄn) with 33 strokes.",
				"after": "The most complex Chinese character still in use may be[according to whom?] biÃ¡ng (pictured right, bottom), with 57 strokes, which refers to Biang biang noodles, a type of noodle from China's Shaanxi province. This character along with the syllable biang cannot be found in dictionaries. The fact that it represents a syllable that does not exist in any Standard Chinese word means that it could be classified as a dialectal character.",
