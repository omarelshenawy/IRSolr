				"after": "Gangtok features a monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate. Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, temperate climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, monsoons, autumn, winter and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of 22Â Â°C (72Â Â°F) in summer to an average minimum of 4Â Â°C (39Â Â°F) in winter.[16] Summers (lasting from late April to June) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing 25Â Â°C (77Â Â°F). The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-monsoon in May, and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of 649.6Â mm (25.6Â in).[16] In winter temperature averages between 4Â Â°C (39Â Â°F) and 7Â Â°C (45Â Â°F).[16] Snowfall is rare, and in recent times Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005 and January 2011.[15] Temperatures below freezing are also rare.[15] During this season the weather can be unstable, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours. During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild. Owing to its elevation, Gangtok is often enveloped in fog during the monsoon and winter months.",
