				"after": "In January 2009, The Register reported on an ongoing case involving Scientology before Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee, \"According to site administrators, several pro-Scientology accounts have been editing the site using Scientology-owned computers.\"[35] The Arbitration Committee on Wikipedia is composed of a group of volunteers voted upon by other users in order to resolve conflict on the site.[36][37] During the Arbitration case, the page about Scientology was modified by members of the organization.[35][38] Scientology members had doctored entries in order to advertise for their cause.[39] The Register noted that one of the Wikipedia users admitted he had edited from computers operated by the Scientology organization, \"One of these pro-Scientology editors â who once used the handle 'COFS' â has admitted as much. And he vows to continue editing Scientology articles from Scientology computers.\"[35] The Register quoted the \"COFS\" user as saying, \"I am not going to leave voluntarily and I will continue to use a) my own computer, b) public computers, c) my wireless laptop, d) computers in the Church of Scientology and any station I please\".[35] The Guardian cited The Register, and noted, \"The technology news website The Register alleges the church has an organised operation to challenge internet criticism.\"[40]",
