				"previous": "Feminist economics call attention to the importance of non-market activities, such as childcare and domestic work, to economic development.[15][16] This stands in sharp contrast to neoclassical economics where those forms of labor are unaccounted for as \"non-economic\" phenomena.[3] Including such labor in economic accounts removes substantial gender bias because women disproportionately perform those tasks.[17] When that labor is unaccounted for in economic models, much work done by women is ignored, literally devaluing their effort.",
				"after": "More specifically, for example, Nancy Folbre examines the role of children as public goods and how the non-market labor of parents contributes to the development of human capital as a public service.[18] In this sense, children are positive externality which is under-invested according to traditional analysis. Folbre indicates that this oversight partially results from failing to properly examine non-market activities.",
