				"after": "The guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; as many as five litters can be produced per year.[12] The gestation period lasts from 59â72 days, with an average of 63â68 days.[49] Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight;[60] they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three;[35] the largest recorded litter size is 17.[69]",
