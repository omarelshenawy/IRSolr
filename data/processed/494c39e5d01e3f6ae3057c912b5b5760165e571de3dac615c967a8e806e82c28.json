Dreadnought mounted ten 12-inch (305Â mm) guns. 12-inch guns had been standard for most navies in the pre-dreadnought era and this continued in the first generation of dreadnought battleships. The Imperial German Navy was an exception, continuing to use 280-millimetre (11.0Â in) guns in its first class of dreadnoughts, the NassauÂ class.[36]",
