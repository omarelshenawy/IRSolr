				"after": "The only supersonic airliner in direct competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144, nicknamed \"Concordski\" by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde.[217] It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts had resulted in the theft of Concorde blueprints, ostensibly to assist in the design of the Tu-144.[218] As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde, due to its low-bypass turbofan engines.[219] The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design; in addition the Tu-144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti-lock brakes.[220] The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the 1973 Paris Air Show,[221][222] and another during a pre-delivery test flight in May 1978.[223][224]",
