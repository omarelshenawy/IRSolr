				"previous": "When working with digital audio, digital signal processing techniques are commonly used to implement compression via digital audio editors, or dedicated workstations. Often the algorithms used emulate the above analog technologies.",
				"after": "A compressor reduces the level of an audio signal if its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. It is commonly set in decibels dB, where a lower threshold (e.g. -60Â dB) means a larger portion of the signal will be treated (compared to a higher threshold of e.g. â5Â dB).",
