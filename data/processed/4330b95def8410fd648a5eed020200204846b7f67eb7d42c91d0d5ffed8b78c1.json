				"previous": "Hamburg has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles and only a few skyscrapers. Churches are important landmarks, such as St Nicholas', which for a short time in the 19th century was the world's tallest building. The skyline features the tall spires of the most important churches (Hauptkirchen) St Michael's (nicknamed âMichel\"), St Peter's, St James's (St. Jacobi) and St. Catherine's covered with copper plates, and the Heinrich-Hertz-Turm, the radio and television tower (no longer publicly accessible).",
				"after": "The many streams, rivers and canals are crossed by over 2400 bridges, more than London, Amsterdam and Venice put together.[42][43] Hamburg has more bridges inside its city limits than any other city in the world and more canals than Amsterdam and Venice combined.[44] The KÃ¶hlbrandbrÃ¼cke, Freihafen ElbbrÃ¼cken, and LombardsbrÃ¼cke and KennedybrÃ¼cke dividing Binnenalster from Aussenalster are important roadways.",
