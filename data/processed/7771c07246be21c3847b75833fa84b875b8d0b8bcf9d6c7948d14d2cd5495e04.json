				"previous": "In 1934, a statue of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was declared an obstruction to traffic and removed.[67] A proposal that it be installed in front of the Bank of England fell through, and in 1952 it was erected in Postman's Park.[67] In 1971 the Metropolitan Police requested that the statue be moved to the new Peel Centre police training complex, and the Corporation of London agreed.[67] In place of Peel's statue, a large bronze sculpture of the Minotaur by Michael Ayrton was unveiled in 1973.[68] Dominating the small park, in 1997 the Minotaur sculpture was moved to a new position on the raised walkway above London Wall.[68]",
				"after": "On 5Â June 1972, the western entrance of Postman's Park and the elaborate Gothic drinking fountain attached to the railings were Grade II listed, protecting them from further development.[69] At this time, the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice itself was also Grade II listed; although considered of little architectural merit, the register notes that it is \"listed as a curiosity\".[70]",
