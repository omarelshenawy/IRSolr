				"previous": "In 1997, a piece of mammoth tusk was discovered protruding from the tundra of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia, Russia. In 1999, this 20,380 year old carcass and 25 tons of surrounding sediment were transported by an Mi-26 heavy lift helicopter to an ice cave in Khatanga. The specimen was nicknamed the \"Jarkov mammoth\". In October 2000, the careful defrosting operations in this cave began with the use of hair dryers to keep the hair and other soft tissues intact.[112][113]",
				"after": "In 2007, the carcass of a female calf nicknamed \"Lyuba\" was discovered near the Yuribey River, where it had been buried for 41,800 years.[54][114] By cutting a section through a molar and analysing its growth lines, they found that the animal had died at the age of one month.[61] The mummified calf weighed 50Â kg (110Â lb), was 85Â cm (33Â in) high and 130Â cm (51Â in) in length.[115][116] At the time of discovery, its eyes and trunk were intact and some fur remained on its body. Its organs and skin are very well preserved.[117] \"Lyuba\" is believed to have been suffocated by mud in a river that its herd was crossing.[54][118] After death, its body may have been colonised by bacteria that produce lactic acid, which \"pickled\" it, preserving the mammoth in a nearly pristine state.[54]",
