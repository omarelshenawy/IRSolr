				"previous": "The Los Angeles basin is still active tectonically and the region continues to experience earthquakes as a result. Due to the number of faults and fault splays, seismic activity is not concentrated in one particular area.[9] The cities that are overlain by the Newport-Inglewood and Whittier fault zones have a higher probability of experiencing seismic activity. The region experiences earthquakes are mostly mild (magnitude â¤2.25). However moderate earthquakes (magnitude 4.9 to 6.4) have been reported. Earthquakes of moderate magnitude are very infrequent.[9]",
				"after": "This fault zone is the most notable feature within the basin that is a single strand with local (fault) splays.[10] The fault zone is also marked by low hills, scarps, and ten anticlinal folds in a right-stepping en echelon pattern.[17] It is located in the southwest portion of the basin and is a strike-slip margin. There are several oil fields that run parallel to this fault.",
