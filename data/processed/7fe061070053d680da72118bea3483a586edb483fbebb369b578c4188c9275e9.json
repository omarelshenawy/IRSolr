				"after": "Defining propaganda has always been a problem. The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of persuasion, and avoiding a biased approach (\"what they do is propaganda, what we do is education\"). Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell have provided a concise, workable definition of the term: \"Propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist.\"[4] More comprehensive is the description by Richard Alan Nelson: \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for ideological, political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels. A propaganda organization employs propagandists who engage in propagandismâthe applied creation and distribution of such forms of persuasion.\"[5]",
