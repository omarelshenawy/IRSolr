				"previous": "Various British newspapers also cried foul. The Evening Standard believed that as \"Argentina's greatest creditor and greatest client\",[24] Britain ought to have been awarded the two ships. The Times took a different track, accusing American shipbuilders of slashing prices to an obscene degree,[H] and accusing the government of exerting undue diplomatic pressure to obtain the contracts.[24]",
				"after": "New Zealand's Evening Post noted that the United States had previously built major warships for other countries, including Russia, and Britain's ally Japan, and commented, \"The severity of the blow to England rests in ... the amount of English capital in [Argentina]\", possibly echoing the Evening Standardââ'âs argument. They referred to a \"startling\" fact printed by the Daily Mail: the steel used for the armor of the American design was obtained for a much lower price. With Bethlehem's ability to produce it at Â£8 less per ton than British foundries, a cost savings of more than 10% in steel over the British ship could be realized.[30]",
