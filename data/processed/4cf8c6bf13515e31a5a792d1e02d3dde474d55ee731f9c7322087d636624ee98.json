				"after": "\"Nothing Fails\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. O'Brien listed it as a \"hymn of devotion\" and \"the most majestic song on American Life\". She complemented the \"dramatic, theatrical air\" of the song and noted that the addition of the choir made the song revelatory and ecstatic.[1] J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book, Madonna: An Intimate Biography, that although the album was not a strong, cohesive package, \"Nothing Fails\" stood out as one of the few gems.[18] In an review for the album as a whole, Michael Paoletta from Billboard called it a highlight of American Life, describing the song as \"tear-inducing\".[19] Entertainment Weeklyââ'âs Ken Tucker called it \"lovely\" and named it, among other songs from the album \"refreshingly â hell, shockingly â earnest\".[20] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian praised its choral finale.[21] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani labeled it one of the moments of greatness on the album.[22] Ian Youngs from BBC Music gave a positive review for \"Nothing Fails\", writing that less is more when it comes to Mirwais' electronic tricks.[23] Johnny Davis from NME commented that \"only 'Nothing Fails' and 'Intervention' dip beneath the frenetically poppy, with neither a 'Ray of Light'-style glitterball stomper, nor a big ballad to act as a breather\".[24] Josh Tyrangiel from Time found Madonna's singing in \"Nothing Fails\" as relaxed and woeful, consisting of \"plenty of soul\".[25] A review in the Telegram & Gazette complimented the song for successfully blending between the \"spiritual and the sensual\".[26]",
