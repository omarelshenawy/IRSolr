				"after": "In July 2006, the New Zealand Government signed a NZ$771 million (~â¬500M) contract to purchase eight NH90s (plus one extra for spares) to replace the Royal New Zealand Air Force's (RNZAF) fleet of 13 UH-1 Iroquois.[42][88] For ease of manufacture and logistics, New Zealand deliberately chose their NH90 configuration to be near-identical to the larger Australian fleet.[89] On 7 December 2011, deliveries to New Zealand formally began with the first two NH90s being airlifted by a leased Antonov An-124 cargo aircraft to RNZAF Base Ohakea. In February 2013, the first phase of the RNZAF's operational evaluation of the NH90 was completed, clearing the type to begin operational duties.[89]",
