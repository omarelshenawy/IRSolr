				"previous": "The story of Southwestâs legal fight was turned into a childrenâs book, Gumwrappers and Goggles by Winifred Barnum in 1983. In the story, TJ Love, a small jet, is taken to court by two larger jets to keep him from their hangar and to stop him from flying. In court, TJ Loveâs right to fly is upheld after an impassioned plea from a character referred to as \"The Lawyer\". While no company names are mentioned in the book, TJ Loveâs colors were those of Southwest Airlines, and the two other jets are colored in Braniff and Continental colors. The Lawyer resembles Herb Kelleher. The book was adapted into a stage musical, Show Your Spirit, sponsored by Southwest Airlines and played only in cities served by the airline.[11]",
				"after": "On March 29, 1971 Air Southwest Co. changed its name to Southwest Airlines Co.[5] with headquarters in Dallas. Southwest began scheduled flights on June 18, 1971, Dallas to Houston and Dallas to San Antonio with three 737-200s.[6] The OAG for 15 October 1972 shows 61 flights a week each way between Dallas and Houston Hobby, 23 each way between Dallas and San Antonio and 16 each way between San Antonio and Houston; no flights were scheduled on Saturdays.",
