				"previous": "Shortly after taking office, President John F. Kennedy tasked the Federal Aviation Administration with preparing a report on \"national aviation goals for the period between now and 1970\".[3] The study was prompted in the wake of several accidents, which led to the belief that the industry was becoming moribund. Two projects were started, Project Beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control, and Project Horizon on advanced civil aviation developments.",
				"after": "Only one month later the FAA's new director, Najeeb Halaby, produced the Commission on National Aviation Goals, better known as Project Horizon. Among other suggestions, the report was used as a platform to promote the SST. Halaby argued that a failure to enter this market would be a \"stunning setback\".[4] The report was met by skepticism by most others. Kennedy had put Lyndon Johnson on the SST file, and he turned to Robert McNamara for guidance. McNamara was highly skeptical of the SST project and savaged Halaby's predictions, and was afraid the project might be turned over to the DoD. So he was careful to press for further studies.[4]",
