				"after": "The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River in the 3.5 miles (5.6Â km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George and was strategically placed in conflicts over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow, oriented northâsouth, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains extending as far south as Georgia, creating the near-impassable mountainous terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \"Ticonderoga\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontarÃ³:ken, meaning \"it is at the junction of two waterways\".",
