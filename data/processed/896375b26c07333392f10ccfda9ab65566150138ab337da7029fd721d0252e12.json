In the 17th century, referring to multi-kilometer races, Cavendish said, \"They were so much faster than all other horses known at that time that none was ever seen to come close to them, even in the many remarkable races that were run.\"[66] In 1831, horses at five years old were expected to be able to gallop, without changing pace, four or five leagues, about 12 to 15 miles (19 to 24Â km). By 1925, the Portuguese military expected horses to \"cover 40 km over uneven terrain at a minimum speed of 10 km/h, and to gallop a flat course of 8 km at a mimimum speed of 800 metres per minute carrying a weight of at least 70 kg\", and the Spanish military had similar standards.[66]",
