				"after": "Saab decided to build the 2000 in December 1988 due to perceived demand for a high-speed turboprop which could approach the speeds of jet aircraft while retaining the efficiency provided by turboprop engines. The company had previously introduced the smaller Saab 340 twin-turboprop aircraft. The Saab 2000 first flew on 26 March 1992 and entered into scheduled airline service in 1994, a few months after its certification by the Joint Aviation Authorities in March and the Federal Aviation Administration in April.",
