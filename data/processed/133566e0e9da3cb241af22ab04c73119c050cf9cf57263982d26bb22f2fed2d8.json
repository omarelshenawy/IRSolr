				"previous": "This period, when Canaan formed part of the Egyptian empire corresponds in biblical accounts to Joshuaâs invasion.[76] In the Bible, Jerusalem is defined as lying within territory allocated to the tribe of Benjamin[77][78] though occupied by Jebusites. David is said to have conquered these in the Siege of Jebus, and transferred his capital from Hebron to Jerusalem which then became the capital of a united Kingdom of Israel,[79] and one of its several religious centres.[80] The choice was perhaps dictated by the fact that Jerusalem did not form part of Israelâs tribal system, and was thus suited to serve as the centre of its federation.[75] Opinion is divided over whether a Large Stone Structure and a nearby Stepped Stone Structure may be identified with King David's palace, or dates to a later period.[81][82]",
				"after": "According to the Bible, King David reigned for 40 years.[83] The generally accepted estimate of the conclusion of this reign is 970 BCE.[citation needed] The Bible states that David was succeeded by his son Solomon,[84] who built the Holy Temple on Mount Moriah. Solomon's Temple (later known as the First Temple), went on to play a pivotal role in Jewish history as the repository of the Ark of the Covenant.[85] On Solomon's death, ten of the northern Tribes of Israel broke with the United Monarchy to form their own nations, kings, prophets, priests, traditions relating to religion, capitals and temples in northern Israel. The southern tribes, together with the Aaronid priesthood, remained in Jerusalem, with the city becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.[86][87] Archeological remains from the ancient Israelite period also include Hezekiah's Tunnel, an aqueduct built by Judean king Hezekiah and decorated with ancient Hebrew inscription, known as Siloam Inscription,[88] Broad Wall a defensive fortification built in the 8th century BCE, also by Hezekiah,[89] Monolith of Silwan, Tomb of the Royal Steward, which were decorated with monumental Hebrew inscriptions,[90] and Israelite Tower, remnants of ancient fortifications, built from large, sturdy rocks with carved cornerstones.[91] A huge water reservoir dating from this period was discovered in 2012 near Robinson's Arch, indicating the existence of a densely built-up quarter across the area west of the Temple Mount during the Judean kingdom.[92]",
