				"after": "Susannah Maidment and colleagues in 2008 proposed extensive alterations to the taxonomy of Stegosaurus. They advocated synonymizing S.Â stenops and S.Â ungulatus (sometimes considered valid; see below) with S.Â armatus, and sinking Hesperosaurus and Wuerhosaurus into Stegosaurus, with their type species becoming Stegosaurus mjosi and Stegosaurus homheni, respectively. They regarded S.Â longispinus as dubious. Thus, their conception of Stegosaurus would include three valid species (S.Â armatus, S.Â homheni, and S.Â mjosi) and would range from the Late Jurassic of North America and Europe to the Early Cretaceous of Asia.[23] However, this classification scheme has not generally been followed by other researchers. Galton, for example, has stated that Wuerhosaurus differs enough from Stegosaurus to be retained as a distinct genus.[22]",
