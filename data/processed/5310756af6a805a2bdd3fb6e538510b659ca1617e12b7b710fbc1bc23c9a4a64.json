				"after": "The Conservative Party traces its origins to a faction, rooted in the 18th-century Whig Party, that coalesced around William Pitt the Younger (Prime Minister of Great Britain 1783â1801 and 1804â1806). Originally known as \"Independent Whigs\", \"Friends of Mr Pitt\", or \"Pittites\", after Pitt's death the term \"Tory\" came into use. This was an allusion to the Tories, a political grouping that had existed from 1678, but which had no organisational continuity with the Pittite party. From about 1812 on the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for the newer party.[11]",
