				"after": "In 1872, while work at Cardiff Castle was proceeding, Burges presented a scheme for the complete reconstruction of Castell Coch,[76] a ruined-thirteenth century fort on the Bute estate to the north of Cardiff. Burges's report on the possible reconstruction was delivered in 1872[93] but building was delayed until 1875, in part because of the pressure of works at Cardiff Castle and in part because of an unfounded concern on behalf of the Marquess's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy.[94] The exterior comprises three towers, described by Newman as \"almost equal to each other in diameter, [but] arrestingly dissimilar in height.\"[95] Burges's main inspiration was the work of the almost contemporaneous French architect EugÃ¨ne Viollet-le-Duc[96] who was undertaking similar restoration and building work for Napoleon III. Viollet-le-Duc's work at the ChÃ¢teau de Coucy, The Louvre and particularly at the ChÃ¢teau de Pierrefonds is echoed at Castell Coch, Burges's Drawing Room roof drawing heavily on the octagonal, rib-vaulted chambre de l'Imperatrice at Pierrefonds.[96] Burges's other main source was the ChÃ¢teau de Chillon, from which his conical, and conjectural, tower roofs are derived.[96]",
