				"after": "The Global 6000 (formerly marketed as the Global Express XRS) is an improved version of the original aircraft, (announced on October 6, 2003 during the NBAA Convention at Orlando, Florida) offering higher cruise speed, increased range, improved cabin layout and lighting. The range increase is achieved by addition of a 1,486Â lb (674Â kg) fuel tank at the wing root. The Global Express 6000 entered service in early 2006. The unit price is estimated to be $US45.5 million. Bombardier claims it takes 15 minutes less to fuel the Global 6000 than the original model thanks to improved computer systems and mechanical refinements.",
