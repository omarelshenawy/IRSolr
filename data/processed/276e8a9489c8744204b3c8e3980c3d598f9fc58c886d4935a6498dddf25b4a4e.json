				"after": "The manuscript itself carries no date but a rather precise dating has been given to it, based mainly on its palaeography or handwriting, and also the known facts of Cuthbert's burial. The script is the \"capitular\" form of uncial, with just a few emphasized letters at the start of sections in \"text\" uncial.[49] Close analysis of the changing style of details of the forms of letters allows the manuscript to be placed with some confidence within a chronological sequence of the few other manuscripts thought to have been produced at Wearmouth-Jarrow. The Northumbrian scribes \"imitate very closely the best Italian manuscripts of about the sixth century\",[50] but introduced small elements that gave their script a distinct style, which has always been greatly admired. However there were several scribes, seven different ones working on the Codex Amiatinus, whose scripts may not all have developed at the same pace.[51]",
