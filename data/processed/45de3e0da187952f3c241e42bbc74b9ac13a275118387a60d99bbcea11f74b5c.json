In the notation , the function on the right, f, acts first and the function on the left, g acts second, reversing English reading order. The notation can be memorized by reading the notation as \"g of f\" or \"g after f\". The composition is only defined when the codomain of f is the domain of g. Assuming that, the composition in the opposite order need not be defined. Even if it is, i.e., if the codomain of f is the codomain of g, it is not in general true that",
