However, archaeological and literary evidence shows that those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably.[107] In addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78â139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies.
