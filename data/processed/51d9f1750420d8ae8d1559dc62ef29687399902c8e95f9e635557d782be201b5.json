				"previous": "The influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting's scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant \"fruitful moment\"âthe first awareness of the approaching shipâis described.[23] In 1793, David also painted an important current event with The Death of Marat. His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the revolution in France, and it served as an important precedent for GÃ©ricault's decision to also paint a current event. David's pupil, Antoine-Jean Gros, had, like David, represented \"the grandiosities of a school irredeemably associated with a lost cause\",[41] but in some major works, he had given equal prominence to Napoleon and anonymous dead or dying figures.[31][42] GÃ©ricault had been particularly impressed by the 1804 painting Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Victims of Jaffa, by Gros.[7]",
				"after": "The young GÃ©ricault had painted copies of work by Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758â1823), whose \"thunderously tragic pictures\" include his masterpiece, Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime, where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously influenced GÃ©ricault's painting.[35]",
