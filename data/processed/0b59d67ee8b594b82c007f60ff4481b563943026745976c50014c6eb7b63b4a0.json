			"previous": [
				"In 1866, the Isle of Man obtained a nominal measure of Home Rule.",
				"English rule was delegated to a series of lords and magnates. The Tynwald passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the Lord of Mann."
			],
				"after": "The Isle of Man is located in the middle of the northern Irish Sea, almost equidistant from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland (closest), and Wales (furthest). It is 52 kilometres (32Â mi) long and, at its widest point, 22 kilometres (14Â mi) wide. It has an area of around 572 square kilometres (221Â sqÂ mi).[22] Besides the island of Mann itself, the political unit of the Isle of Man includes some nearby small islands: the seasonally inhabited Calf of Man,[23] Chicken Rock on which stands an unmanned lighthouse, St Patrick's Isle and St Michael's Isle. Both of the latter are connected to the mainland by permanent roads/causeways.",
