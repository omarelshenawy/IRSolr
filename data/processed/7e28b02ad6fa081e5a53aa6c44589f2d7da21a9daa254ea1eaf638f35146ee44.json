				"previous": "Bradman is immortalised in three popular songs from different eras, \"Our Don Bradman\" (1930s, by Jack O'Hagan),[212] \"Bradman\" (1980s, by Paul Kelly),[213] and \"Sir Don\", (a tribute by John Williamson performed at Bradman's memorial service).[214] Bradman recorded several songs accompanying himself and others on piano in the early 1930s, including \"Every Day Is A Rainbow Day For Me\".[215] In 2000, the Australian Government made it illegal for the names of corporations to suggest a link to \"Sir Donald Bradman\", if such a link does not in fact exist.[216] Other entities with similar protection are the Australian and foreign governments, Saint Mary MacKillop, the British Royal Family and the Returned and Services League of Australia.[217]",
