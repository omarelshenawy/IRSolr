				"If we have a product of vectors then we denote the reverse as",
				"Similar interpretations are true for any number of vectors spanning an n-dimensional parallelotope; the outer product of vectors a1, a2, ... an, that is , has a magnitude equal to the volume of the n-parallelotope. An n-vector doesn't necessarily have a shape of a parallelotope â this is a convenient visualization. It could be any shape, although the volume equals that of the parallelotope."

				"Scaling R so that RRâ  = 1 then",
				"so â  leaves the length of unchanged. We can also show that",
				"so the transformation RvRâ  preserves both length and angle. It therefore can be identified as a rotation or rotoreflection; R is called a rotor if it is a proper rotation (as it is if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of vectors) and is an instance of what is known in GA as a versor (presumably for historical reasons)."
