He ran in the Emsley Carr mile on 29 August 1977, out-sprinting Filbert Bayi of Tanzania in the home straight and winning in 3:57.7. Eleven days later, on 9 September 1977, he ran the 800m at the Coca Cola Games at Crystal Palace in a time of 1:44.95, beating Andy Carter's 1:45.12 time and claiming his first UK national record outdoors.",
