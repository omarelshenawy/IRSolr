In 1996 the district was included into the unitary Highland Council, (Comhairle na GÃ idhealtachd) based in Inverness and formed one of the new council's area committees.[85][86] Following the 2007 elections, Skye now forms a four-member ward called \"Eilean a' CheÃ²\"; it is currently represented by two independents, one Scottish National Party, and one Liberal Democrat councillor.[86]",
