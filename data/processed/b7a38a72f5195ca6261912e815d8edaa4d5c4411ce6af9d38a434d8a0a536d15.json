				"after": "In the 21st century, the palace gardens, once an irrigated oasis in the centre of parched farmland, are bounded by the \"Radial de Sintra\" motorway which feeds traffic towards Lisbon and away from Sintra. However, transportation and tourism have been the saviours of the palace. Since 1940 it has been open to the public as a museum. It houses much of the former royal collection, including furniture, Arraiolos carpets, paintings, and Chinese and European ceramics and porcelain.[2]",
