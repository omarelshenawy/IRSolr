				"Mycena haematopus can be parasitized by Spinellus fusiger, another fungal species which gives the mushroom a strikingly hairy appearance.[8][17]",
				"The mushroom flesh can range from pale to the color of red wine (vinaceous), and has no distinctive odor. It oozes a red latex when cut.[11] The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem, meaning they are more or less directly attached to it. They are initially whitish or \"grayish vinaceous\" in color, and can develop reddish-brown stains. Between 20 and 30 gills reach from the cap edge to the stem, resulting in a gill spacing that is described as \"close to subdistant\"âgaps are visible between adjacent gills. There are additional gills, called lamellulae, that do not extend directly from the margin to the stem; these are arranged in two or three series (tiers) of equal length. The stem is up to 9Â cm (3.5Â in) tall and 0.1 to 0.2Â cm (0.04 to 0.08Â in) thick, hollow and brittle, and a dark reddish-brown color. In young fruit bodies, the upper part of the stem is densely covered with a pale cinnamon-colored powder which wears off with age. The stem has a mass of coarse hairs at the base. Like the cap, the stem also bleeds a red latex when it is cut or broken.[15][16]"

				"after": "The spore print is white. The spores are elliptical, smooth, with dimensions of 8â11 by 5â7Â Âµm. They are amyloid, meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.[17] The spore-bearing cells (basidia) are 4-spored. Sterile cells called cystidia are numerous on the edges on the gills; they measure 33â60Â Âµm (sometimes up to 80) by 9â12Â Âµm. Cystidia that are present on the stipe (caulocystidia) appear in clusters, and clublike to irregular in shape, measuring 20â55 by 3.5â12.5Â Âµm.[18] The gill tissue contains numerous lactifers, cells that produce the latex that is secreted when it is cut.[16]",
