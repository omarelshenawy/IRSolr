				"after": "Upon his victory, Johnson settled in to the Mayoral offices at City Hall.[205] His first official engagement came several days after the election, when he appeared at the Sikh celebrations for Vaisakhi in Trafalgar Square.[206] His first policy initiative, issued that month, came as a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport.[207][208] He received criticism during the early weeks of his administration, largely because he was late to two official functions in his first week on the job, and because after three weeks he embarked on a holiday to Turkey.[209] In July 2008 Johnson visited Beijing to attend the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics as London's representative to receive the Olympic flag from Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing to announce formally London as Olympic host city. While taking on the Olympic flag, he offended his Chinese hosts by not having his jacket buttoned-up.[210][211]",
