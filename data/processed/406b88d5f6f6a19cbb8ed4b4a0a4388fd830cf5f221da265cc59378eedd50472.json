These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season orâin some casesâfor several years or until the death of one mate.[164] Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing.[165] Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common.[166] Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.[167] Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species.[168] Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.[169] Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.[170]",
