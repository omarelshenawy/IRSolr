				"previous": "More recent developments show that honeycomb structures are also advantageous in applications involving nanohole arrays in anodized alumina,[24] microporous arrays in polymer thin films,[25] activated carbon honeycombs,[26] and photonic band gap honeycomb structures.[27]",
				"after": "A honeycomb mesh is often used in aerodynamics to reduce or to create wind turbulence. It is also used to obtain a standard profile in a wind tunnel (temperature, flow speed). A major factor in choosing the right mesh is the length ratio (length vs honeycomb cell diameter) L/d.",
