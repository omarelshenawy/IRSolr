				"previous": "In June 1986, Boeing announced the development of the 737-400,[45] which stretched the fuselage a further 10Â ft (3.0Â m), increasing the passenger load to 170.[46] The -400s first flight was on February 19, 1988, and, after a seven-month/500-hour flight-testing run, entered service with Piedmont Airlines that October.[47]",
				"after": "The -500 series was offered, due to customer demand, as a modern and direct replacement of the 737-200. It incorporated the improvements of the 737 Classic series, allowing longer routes with fewer passengers to be more economical than with the 737-300. The fuselage length of the -500 is 1Â ft 7Â in (48Â cm) longer than the 737-200, accommodating up to 132 passengers. Both glass and older-style mechanical cockpits arrangements were available.[47] Using the CFM56-3 engine also gave a 25% increase in fuel efficiency over the older -200s P&W engines.[47]",
