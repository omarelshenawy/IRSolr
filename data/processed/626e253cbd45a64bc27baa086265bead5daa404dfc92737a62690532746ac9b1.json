				"after": "Until the standardization of the projection speed of 24 frames per second (fps) for sound films between 1926 and 1930, silent films were shot at variable speeds (or \"frame rates\") anywhere from 12 to 40Â fps, depending on the year and studio.[15] \"Standard silent film speed\" is often said to be 16Â fps as a result of the LumiÃ¨re brothers' CinÃ©matographe, but industry practice varied considerably; there was no actual standard. William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, an Edison employee, settled on the astonishingly fast 40 frames per second. [2] Additionally, cameramen of the era insisted that their cranking technique was exactly 16Â fps, but modern examination of the films shows this to be in error, that they often cranked faster. Unless carefully shown at their intended speeds silent films can appear unnaturally fast or slow. However, some scenes were intentionally undercranked during shooting to accelerate the actionâparticularly for comedies and action films.[15]",
