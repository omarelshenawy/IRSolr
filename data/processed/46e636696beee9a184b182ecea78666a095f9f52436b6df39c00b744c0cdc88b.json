				"previous": "Recognizing McKinleyâs potential, the Democrats, whenever they controlled the Ohio legislature, sought to gerrymander or redistrict him out of office.[63] In 1878, McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district; he won anyway, causing Hayes to exult, âOh, the good luck of McKinley! He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander! We enjoyed it as much as he did.â[64] After the 1882 election, McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party-line House vote.[65] Out of office, he was briefly depressed by the setback, but soon vowed to run again. The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.[66]",
				"after": "For 1890, the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley one final time, placing Stark County in the same district as one of the strongest pro-Democrat counties, Holmes, populated by solidly Democratic Pennsylvania Dutch. The new boundaries seemed good, based on past results, for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000. The Republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891, but they could throw all their energies into the district, as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide, and there was considerable attention paid to McKinleyâs race. The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton, including Blaine (then Secretary of State), Speaker Reed and President Harrison. The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues.[67] McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district, reaching out to its 40,000 voters to explain that his tariff",
