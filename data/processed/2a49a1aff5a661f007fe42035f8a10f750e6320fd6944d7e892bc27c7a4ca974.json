				"after": "Burges, who never married,[214] was considered by his contemporaries to be eccentric, unpredictable, over-indulgent and flamboyant.[133][215] He was also physically unprepossessing, described by the wife of his greatest patron as \"ugly Burges.\"[216] Short, fat, and so near-sighted that he once mistook a peacock for a man,[217] Burges appears to have been sensitive about his appearance and very few images of him exist.[218] The known portraits are: a painting of 1858 by Edward John Poynter on a panel of the Yatman Cabinet; a photograph from the 1860s, by an unknown author, showing Burges dressed as a court jester; a sketch of 1871 in The Graphic by Theodore Blake Wirgman; a pencil drawing in profile of 1875 by Edward William Godwin; three posed photographs from 1881 by Henry Van der Weyde[218] and a posthumous caricature by Edward Burne-Jones.[219]",
