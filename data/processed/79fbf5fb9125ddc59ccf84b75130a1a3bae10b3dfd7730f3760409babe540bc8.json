				"Chaos magic is a form of ritual magic with which practitioners claim they can shape reality.",
				"Although there are a few techniques unique to chaos magic (such as some forms of sigil magic), practices can be highly individualistic, borrowing liberally from other belief systems; in this light, chaos magic acts as a metabelief. Some common sources of inspiration and techniques include ceremonial magic, chaos theory, science fiction, OBEs, and divination."
