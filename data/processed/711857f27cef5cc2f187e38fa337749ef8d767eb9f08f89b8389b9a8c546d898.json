Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that \"appeal to the listener's sense of valor and loveliness\".[174] The prototype for the sound was established in the mid-to-late 1980s by Germany's Helloween, which combined the power riffs, melodic approach, and high-pitched, \"clean\" singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash's speed and energy, \"crystalliz[ing] the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal\".[175]",
