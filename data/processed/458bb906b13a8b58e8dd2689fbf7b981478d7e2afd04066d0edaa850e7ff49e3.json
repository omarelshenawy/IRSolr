				"previous": "Bartlett was disappointed with the damage to Jumbo's tusks. He had been hoping that Jumbo would grow to be a \"tusker\" â an elephant with huge tusks. After the surgery, Jumbo kept his tusks worn away by rubbing them against the walls of the Elephant House. They never grew more than a few inches long.[26]",
				"after": "When Jumbo was brought to the zoo in 1865, Bartlett had wanted to raise the elephant himself. He needed a keeper though who would obey him, and chose Scotty because he was rather inexperienced. Bartlett would be disappointed. Scotty had his own opinion on how to raise Jumbo. Bartlett despised the close relationship that grew between the keeper and the elephant. In 1882, Jumbo was the biggest elephant living in captivity.[27]",
