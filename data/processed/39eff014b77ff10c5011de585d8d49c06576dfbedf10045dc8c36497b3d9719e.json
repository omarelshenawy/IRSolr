				"previous": "The first DC-10 version was the \"domestic\" series 10 with a range of 3,800Â miles (3,300Â nmi, 6,110Â km) with a typical passenger load and a range of 2,710Â miles (2,350Â nmi, 4,360Â km) with maximum payload. The series 15 had a typical load range of 4,350Â miles (3,780Â nmi, 7,000Â km).[11][12] The series 20 was powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D turbofan engines, whereas the series 10 and 30 engines were General Electric CF6. Before delivery of its aircraft, Northwest's president asked that the \"series 20\" aircraft be redesignated \"series 40\" because the aircraft was much improved over the original design. The FAA issued the series 40 certificate on October 27, 1972.[13]",
				"after": "The series 30 and 40 were the longer-range \"international\" versions. The main visible difference between the models is that the series 10 has three sets of landing gear (one front and two main) while the series 30 and 40 have an additional centerline main gear. The center main two-wheel landing gear (which extends from the center of the fuselage) was added to distribute the extra weight and for additional braking. The series 30 had a typical load range of 6,220Â mi (10,010Â km) and a maximum payload range of 4,604Â mi (7,410Â km). The series 40 had a typical load range of 5,750Â miles (9,265Â km) and a maximum payload range of 4,030Â miles (3,500Â nmi, 6,490Â km).[11][14]",
