				"after": "The cap of the fruit body is thin and membranous, measuring 3 to 20Â mm (0.1 to 0.8Â in) in diameter.[24] It has a convex shape slightly depressed in the center, conspicuous furrows in an outline of the gills, and scalloped edges. Young, unexpanded caps are yellowish brown; as the cap expands, the color lightens to whitish or light pinkish-white,[25] often with a darker, sometimes brown center.[26] The variety fusca has brown caps.[14] The white or slightly yellowish flesh is very thin, reaching about 0.25â1.5Â mm thick in the central part of the cap, and even thinner at the margin.[27]",
