				"previous": "In contrast to the pointillist impressionism of George, the museum also features a \"fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism\",[54] according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), a recent addition, inspired this description by MOBA: \"We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt.\"[54] MOBA enjoys the mystery as much as any other aspect of art, however.[15]",
				"after": "Newman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a dachshund, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a hula skirt she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying \"I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you.\"[55]",
