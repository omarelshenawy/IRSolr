				"after": "The reworked fresco has been seen as \"classicizing\" the image of the condottieri, with the terra verde technique giving the conceit of an equestrian bronze statue.[73] The horse's proportions are based loosely upon those prescribed by Alberti in De equo animante, which in turn is based upon the anonymous Sonetto del Cavallo Perfetto;[74] however, in many ways the horse departs radically from Alberti's ideal of a harmonious and \"lithe\" creature in the style of Leonello d'Este's monument to NiccolÃ² III d'Este, Arco del Cavallo in Ferrara.[75] Furthermore, Uccello's perspective in the Hawkwood monument openly flaunted Alberti's conception of perspective as demarcated in De Pictura (1435, translated into Italian as Della Pittura in 1436): the vanishing point is at the eye-level of the spectator rather than within the field of the fresco, for example.[76] Alberti's De re aedificatoria also objected to statues of soldiers and/or lay burials in churches.[77] Although the fresco is often called \"monochrome\",[26] its background is dark red, the horse and tomb are accented in red, black, white, and orange.[40] The Trompe-l'Åil perspective from the base, the chiaroscuro relief-effect of the horse and the rider, and lighting from the left are similar to Masaccio's Holy Trinity.[75][78][79] The connection to Masaccio is so strong (or so often reported) that Francesco Albertini actually attributed the work to Massaccio in 1510.[69] However, Uccello's fresco has two viewpoints: the horse and rider are painted as if on level with the spectator, and the cenotaph is seen as if from below.[40]",
