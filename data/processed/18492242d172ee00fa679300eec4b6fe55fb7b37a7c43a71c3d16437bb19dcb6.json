				"previous": "A theory T is called model-complete if every substructure of a model of T which is itself a model of T is an elementary substructure. There is a useful criterion for testing whether a substructure is an elementary substructure, called the TarskiâVaught test. It follows from this criterion that a theory T is model-complete if and only if every first-order formula Ï(x1,...,xn) over its signature is equivalent modulo T to an existential first-order formula, i.e. a formula of the following form:",
				"after": "where Ï is quantifier free. A theory that is not model-complete may or may not have a model completion, which is a related model-complete theory that is not, in general, an extension of the original theory. A more general notion is that of model companions.",
