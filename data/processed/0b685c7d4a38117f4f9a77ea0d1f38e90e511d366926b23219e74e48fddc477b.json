				"previous": "Stravinsky had adapted to life in France, but moving to America at the age of 57 was a very different prospect. For a while, he maintained a circle of contacts and emigrÃ© friends from Russia, but he eventually found that this did not sustain his intellectual and professional life. He was drawn to the growing cultural life of Los Angeles, especially during World War II, when so many writers, musicians, composers and conductors settled in the area: these included Otto Klemperer, Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, George Balanchine and Arthur Rubinstein. Bernard Holland claimed Stravinsky was especially fond of British writers, who visited him in Beverly Hills, \"like W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, Dylan Thomas. They shared the composer's taste for hard spirits â especially Aldous Huxley, with whom Stravinsky spoke in French\".[64] Stravinsky and Huxley had a tradition of Saturday lunches for west coast avant-garde and luminaries.[65]",
				"after": "Stravinsky's unconventional dominant seventh chord in his arrangement of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" led to an incident with the Boston police on 15 January 1944, and he was warned that the authorities could impose a $100 fine upon any \"rearrangement of the national anthem in whole or in part\".[66][67] The police, as it turned out, were wrong. The law in question merely forbade using the national anthem \"as dance music, as an exit march, or as a part of a medley of any kind\", but the incident soon established itself as a myth, in which Stravinsky was supposedly arrested, held in custody for several nights, and photographed for police records.[68] A widely known photograph of Stravinsky, supposedly his mug shot, has been shown to be for a passport application.[citation needed]",
