				"previous": "Masturbation marathons are global events that provide a supportive, encouraging environment where masturbation can be performed openly among young and old without embarrassment. Participants may speak openly with onlookers while masturbating to share techniques and describe the pleasure and benefits.[120] Masturbate-a-thons are often charity events that are \"intended to encourage people to explore safer sex, talk about masturbation and lift the taboos that still surround the subject.\" May is considered \"Masturbation Month\" by sex-positive organizations and activists, including Betty Dodson, Joani Blank, Susan Block, and Carol Queen.",
				"after": "There are depictions of male masturbation in prehistoric rock paintings around the world. Most early people seem to have connected human sexuality with abundance in nature.[citation needed] A clay figurine of the 4th millennium BC from a temple site on the island of Malta depicts a woman masturbating.[121] However, in the ancient world depictions of male masturbation are far more common.[citation needed]",
