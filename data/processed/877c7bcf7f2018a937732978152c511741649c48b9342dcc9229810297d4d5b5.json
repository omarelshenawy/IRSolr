				"previous": "A male greater crested tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting, and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory. If the intruder is another male, it retaliates in kind, and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent. A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male's aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.[25]",
				"after": "The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping ground. It is often unlined, but sometimes includes stones or cuttlefish bones. One, sometimes two, eggs are laid and incubated by both parents for 25 to 30Â days prior to hatching.[14] The eggs are cream with blackish streaks.[26] Egg laying is synchronised within a breeding colony[27] and more tightly so within sub-colonies.[28] Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched chicks, but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two days-old, shortly before they begin to wander from the nest.[29] The precocial chicks, which are very pale with black speckling, are brooded and fed by both parents, but may gather in crÃ¨ches when older. The young terns fledge after 38 to 40Â days, but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until they are about four months old.[14]",
