				"after": "The emergence and development of the destroyer was related to the invention of the self-propelled torpedo in the 1860s. A navy now had the potential to destroy a superior enemy battle fleet using steam launches to launch torpedoes. Fast boats armed with torpedoes were built and called torpedo boats. The first seagoing vessel designed to fire the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo was HMSÂ Lightning. It was armed with self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes and had two drop collars to launch torpedoes; these were replaced in 1879 by a single torpedo tube in the bow. By the 1880s, these had evolved into small ships of 50â100 tons, fast enough to evade enemy picket boats.",
