				"Amtrak is no longer required by law, but is encouraged, to operate a national route system.[62] Amtrak has some presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states, all except Wyoming and South Dakota.",
				"Service on the Northeast Corridor, between Boston, and Washington, D.C., as well as between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, is powered by overhead electric wires; for the rest of the system, diesel locomotives are used. Routes vary widely in frequency of service, from three-days-a-week trains on the Sunset Limited route (Los Angeles, to New Orleans), to weekday service several times per hour on the NEC, (Boston to Washington, D.C.)[63] Amtrak also operates a captive bus service, Thruway Motorcoach, which provides connections to train routes. In addition, the company owns Passenger Railway Insurance."
