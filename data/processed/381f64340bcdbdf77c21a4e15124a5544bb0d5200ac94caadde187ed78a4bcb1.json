				"after": "The airline was established in 1991 and began operations in June 1992 as Iran's first private airline. The name of Mahan is taken from Historical city of Mahan in Kerman Province. The Airline joined the IATA in 2001 and is owned by Mol-Al-Movahedin Charity Institute (100%). As of March 2007 it has 2,511 employees. At its operational launch in May 1993, Mahan Air fleet consisted of two Tupolev 154 aircraft, with a staff of 99 and a route network from Tehran to two domestic destinations. Growth was initiated with the addition of Airbus A300 wide-body aircraft to the fleet in 1999 and the Airbus A310 in 2001.[3] This enabled the airline to reach beyond the regional destinations it served. Its route network now spans 50 destinations in 12 countries with a fleet of 38 Airbus and Boeing 747 aircraft. It holds 13% of all international flights from Iran,[4] and 8% of the domestic market.[citation needed]",
