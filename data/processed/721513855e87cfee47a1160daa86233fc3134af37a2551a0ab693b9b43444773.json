				"after": "Shostakovich was in many ways an obsessive man: according to his daughter he was \"obsessed with cleanliness\";[93] he synchronised the clocks in his apartment; he regularly sent cards to himself to test how well the postal service was working. Elizabeth Wilson's Shostakovich: A Life Remembered (1994 edition) indexes 26 references to his nervousness. Mikhail Druskin remembers that even as a young man the composer was \"fragile and nervously agile\".[94] Yuri Lyubimov comments, \"The fact that he was more vulnerable and receptive than other people was no doubt an important feature of his genius\".[95] In later life, Krzysztof Meyer recalled, \"his face was a bag of tics and grimaces\".[96]",
