				"after": "The most prominent road in Yorkshire, historically called the Great North Road, is known as the A1.[78] This trunk road passes through the centre of the county and is the prime route from London to Edinburgh.[79] Another important road is the more easterly A19 road which starts in Doncaster and ends just north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne at Seaton Burn. The M62 motorway crosses the county from east to west from Hull towards Greater Manchester and Merseyside.[80] The M1 carries traffic from London and the south of England to Yorkshire. In 1999 about 8 miles (13Â km) was added to make it swing east of Leeds and connect to the A1.[81] The East Coast Main Line rail link between Scotland and London runs roughly parallel with the A1 through Yorkshire and the Trans Pennine rail link runs east to west from Hull to Liverpool via Leeds.[82]",
