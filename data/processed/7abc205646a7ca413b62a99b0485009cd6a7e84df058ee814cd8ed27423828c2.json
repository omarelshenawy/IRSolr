				"The airline was established as Donavia following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. It absorbed the Rostov assets of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, and was one of many such \"Babyflots\" to emerge in the early 1990s. However, the airline was purchased by Aeroflot in 2000 and started operations under the Aeroflot-Don name on 13 April 2000. On 25 September 2009, the airline was once again renamed Donavia.[5]"
