				"William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman (November 29, 1895Â â July 23, 1971) was a Liberian politician. He was the 19th President of Liberia from 1944 until his death in 1971.",
				"He is regarded as the \"father of modern Liberia\"; his presidency was marked by the influx of foreign investment in his country and its modernization. During his tenure, Liberia experienced a period of prosperity. He also led a policy of national unity in order to reduce the social and political differences between his fellow Americo-Liberians and the indigenous Liberians. However, further into his years in power, his way of governing became increasingly dictatorial."
