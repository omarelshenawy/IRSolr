				"previous": "Outcrop coal was used in Britain during the Bronze Age (3000â2000 BC), where it has been detected as forming part of the composition of funeral pyres.[25][26] In Roman Britain, with the exception of two modern fields, \"the Romans were exploiting coals in all the major coalfields in England and Wales by the end of the second century AD\".[27] Evidence of trade in coal (dated to about AD 200) has been found at the Roman settlement at Heronbridge, near Chester, and in the Fenlands of East Anglia, where coal from the Midlands was transported via the Car Dyke for use in drying grain.[28] Coal cinders have been found in the hearths of villas and Roman forts, particularly in Northumberland, dated to around AD 400. In the west of England, contemporary writers described the wonder of a permanent brazier of coal on the altar of Minerva at Aquae Sulis (modern day Bath), although in fact easily accessible surface coal from what became the Somerset coalfield was in common use in quite lowly dwellings locally.[29] Evidence of coal's use for iron-working in the city during the Roman period has been found.[30] In Eschweiler, Rhineland, deposits of bituminous coal were used by the Romans for the smelting of iron ore.[27]",
				"after": "No evidence exists of the product being of great importance in Britain before the High Middle Ages, after about AD 1000.[31] Mineral coal came to be referred to as \"seacoal\" in the 13th century; the wharf where the material arrived in London was known as Seacoal Lane, so identified in a charter of King Henry III granted in 1253.[32] Initially, the name was given because much coal was found on the shore, having fallen from the exposed coal seams on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops,[31] but by the time of Henry VIII, it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to London by sea.[33] In 1257â59, coal from Newcastle upon Tyne was shipped to London for the smiths and lime-burners building Westminster Abbey.[31] Seacoal Lane and Newcastle Lane, where coal was unloaded at wharves along the River Fleet, are still in existence.[34] (See Industrial processes below for modern uses of the term.)",
