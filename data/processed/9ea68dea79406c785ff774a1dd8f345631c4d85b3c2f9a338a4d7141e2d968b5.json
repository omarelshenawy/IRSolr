Porcupines live in forests, deserts, rocky outcrops and hillsides. Some New World porcupines live in trees, but Old World porcupines stay on the rocks. Porcupines can be found on rocky areas up to 3,700Â m (12,100Â ft) high. Porcupines are generally nocturnal but are occasionally active during daylight.",
