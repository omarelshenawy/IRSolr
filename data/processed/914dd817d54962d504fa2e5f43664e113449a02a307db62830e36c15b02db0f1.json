				"previous": "By early 1809 he was seriously ill.[108] He had long suffered from kidney stones, which also lodged in the bladder, causing him great pain.[115] He died at Soho House on 17 August 1809.[108] He was buried in the graveyard of St. Mary's Church, Handsworth, in BirminghamÂ â the church was later extended over the site of his grave. Inside the church, on the north wall of the sanctuary, is a large marble monument to him, commissioned by his son, sculpted by the sculptor John Flaxman.[116] It includes a marble bust of Boulton, set in a circular opening above two putti, one holding an engraving of the Soho Manufactory.[116]",
				"after": "Boulton is recognised by several memorials and other commemorations in and around Birmingham. Soho House, his home from 1766 until his death, is now a museum,[117] as is his first workshop, Sarehole Mill.[118] The Soho archives are at the Birmingham City Archives.[42] He is recognised by blue plaques at his Steelhouse Lane birthplace and at Soho House.[119] A gilded bronze statue of Boulton, Watt and Murdoch (1956) by William Bloye stands outside the old Register Office on Broad Street in central Birmingham.[120] Matthew Boulton College was named in his honour in 1957.[121] The two-hundredth anniversary of his death, in 2009, resulted in a number of tributes. Birmingham City Council promoted \"a year long festival celebrating the life, work and legacy of Matthew Boulton\".[122]",
