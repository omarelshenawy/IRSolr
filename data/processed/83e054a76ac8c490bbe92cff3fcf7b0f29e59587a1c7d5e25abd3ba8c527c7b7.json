				"previous": "In October 2013, Emirates launched a frequent-flyer partnership with Virgin America. Members of both airlinesâ frequent-flyer programs will earn and redeem Emirates Skywards miles.[152]",
				"after": "The established network carriers in Europe and Australia, i.e. Air France-KLM, British Airways, Lufthansa, and Qantas, perceive Emirates' strategic decision to reposition itself as a global carrier as a major threat because it enables air travellers to by-pass traditional airline hubs such as London-Heathrow, Paris-CDG, and Frankfurt on their way between Europe/North America and Asia/Australia by changing flights in Dubai instead. These carriers also find it difficult to deal with the growing competitive threat Emirates poses to their business because of their much higher cost base.[153][154]",
