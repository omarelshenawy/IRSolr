				"after": "The Burys travelled north as second-class passengers on the steamer Cambria. They arrived at Dundee on the evening of 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street.[31] The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property.[32] Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day.[33] William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William.[34]",
