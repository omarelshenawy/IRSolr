				"previous": "Chetnik units engaged in mass murders and war crimes.[142] In 1991, the Croatian town of Erdut was forcefully taken over by the SDG and JNA[171] and annexed to the puppet state of Republic of Serbian Krajina. Croats and other non-Serbs were either expelled or killed with Serbs repopulating empty villages in the area.[172] On 1 April 1992, the SDG attacked Bijeljina and carried out a massacre of Muslim civilians.[173] On 4 April, Chetnik irregulars helped the JNA in shelling Sarajevo. On 6 April, Chetniks and the JNA attacked Bijeljina, FoÄa, Bratunac, and ViÅ¡egrad. On 9 April, the SDG and Å eÅ¡elj's Chetniks aided the JNA and special units of the Serbian security force in overtaking Zvornik and ridding it of its local Muslim population.[174] Reports sent by RaÅ¾natoviÄ to MiloÅ¡eviÄ, Ratko MladiÄ, and Blagoje AdÅ¾iÄ stated the plan was progressing, noting that the psychological attack on the Bosniak population in Bosnia and Herzegovina was effective and should continue.[175] Chetnik forces also engaged in mass murder in Vukovar and Srebrenica.[142] The White Eagles were responsible for atrocities and massacres in VoÄin, ViÅ¡egrad, FoÄa, Gacko, Sjeverin, and Å trpci,[163] and for terrorizing the Muslim population in SandÅ¾ak.[176] In September 1992, Chetniks attempted to force SandÅ¾ak Muslims in Pljevlja to flee by demolishing their stores and houses whilst shouting \"Turks leave\" and \"this is Serbia\". By mid-1993, they suffered over a hundred bombings, kidnappings, expulsions, and shootings. The SPO threatened Muslims with expulsion when reacting to requests for autonomy in SandÅ¾ak.[177] On 15 May 1993, Å eÅ¡elj proclaimed 18 Chetnik fighters as vojvodas, naming towns that were cleansed of non-Serbs in their citation, and they were blessed by an Orthodox priest afterwards.[178] Å eÅ¡elj came to be described as \"a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition.\"[139]",
				"after": "Later the SRS became a government coalition partner of MiloseviÄ and in 1998, ÄujiÄ publicly stated that he regretted awarding that title to Å eÅ¡elj. He was quoted as saying, \"I was naÃ¯ve when I nominated Å eÅ¡elj [as] Vojvoda; I ask my people to forgive me. The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ\"[138] and that he is \"disappointed in Å eÅ¡elj for openly collaborating with MiloÅ¡eviÄ's Socialist Party, with Communists who have only changed their name.Â ... Å eÅ¡elj has sullied the reputation of Chetniks and Serbian nationalism.\"[179] In 2000, RaÅ¾natoviÄ was killed before facing prosecution by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).[180] In 2003, Å eÅ¡elj surrendered himself to the ICTY to face war crimes charges.[181] NikoliÄ, who Å eÅ¡elj had in 1993 proclaimed vojvoda[182] and awarded the Order of Chetnik Knights for his subordinates' \"personal courage in defending the fatherland\",[183] took over the SRS.[181] He vowed to pursue a Greater Serbia \"through peaceful means\".[184] In 2005, it was alleged NikoliÄ was present during the massacre of Croatian civilians in Antin.[183] The Ministry of Interior of Croatia stated Croatian police had no reports of NikoliÄ participating.[185] In 2008, LukiÄ was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity and war crimes.[186]",
