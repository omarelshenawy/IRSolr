				"previous": "The Long Beach earthquake of 1933, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake, caused significant damage to the city and surrounding areas, killing a total of 120 people. Most of the damage occurred in unreinforced masonry buildings, especially schools. Pacific Bible Seminary (now known as Hope International University) was forced to move classes out of First Christian Church of Long Beach and into a small local home due to damage from the earthquake.[21]",
				"after": "The Ford Motor Company built a factory called Long Beach Assembly at the then address in 1929 as \"700 Henry Ford Avenue, Long Beach\" where the factory began building the Ford Model A. Production of Ford vehicles continued after the war until 1960 when the plant was closed due to a fire,[22] and January 1991 when the factory was demolished partially due to air quality remediation efforts. Ford had earlier opened a Factory in Los Angeles at the location of 12th Street and Olive, with a later factory built at East Seventh Street and Santa Fe Avenue after 1914.[23]",
