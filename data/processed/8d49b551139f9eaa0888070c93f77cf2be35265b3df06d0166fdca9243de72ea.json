				"after": "The Cessna Citation CJ1 (also Model 525) was developed as an improved version of the original CitationJet.[2] The CJ1 improved on the CitationJet by adding a more-modern EFIS avionics suite and a moderate increase in maximum takeoff weight. The CJ1 has been replaced by the CJ1+, which shares the same airframe but has an additional updated avionics package, and FADEC to allow the engines to be controlled by computer rather than mechanical controls. The GE Honda HF120 engine is offered as a retrofit to the CJ1.[3]",
