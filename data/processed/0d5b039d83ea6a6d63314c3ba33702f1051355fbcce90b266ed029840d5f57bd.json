				"after": "Tropical cyclones are areas of relatively low pressure in the troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centres of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level.[6] The environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as \"warm core\" systems.[7]",
