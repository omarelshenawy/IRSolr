				"after": "The following century saw two major German composers come to fame earlyâLudwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Beethoven, a student of Haydn's in Vienna, used unusually daring harmonies and rhythm and composed numerous pieces for piano, violin, symphonies, chamber music, string quartets and an opera. Schubert created a field of artistic, romantic poetry and music called lied; his lieder cycles included Die schÃ¶ne MÃ¼llerin and Winterreise.[4]",
