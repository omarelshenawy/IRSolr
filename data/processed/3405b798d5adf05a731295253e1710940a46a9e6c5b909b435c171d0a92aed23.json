				"The notices from critics were generally excellent in both New York and London in 1880.[44] In New York, the Herald and the Tribune both dedicated considerable space to their reviews. The Herald took the view that \"the new work is in every respect superior to the Pinafore, the text more humorous, the music more elegant and more elaborate.\"[45] The Tribune called it \"a brilliant and complete success\", commenting, \"The humor of the Pirates is richer, but more recondite. It demands a closer attention to the words [but] there are great stores of wit and drollery ... which will well repay exploration. ... The music is fresh, bright, elegant and merry, and much of it belongs to a higher order of art than the most popular of the tunes of Pinafore.\"[46] The New York Times also praised the work, writing, \"it would be impossible for a confirmed misanthrope to refrain from merriment over it\", though the paper doubted if Pirates could repeat the prodigious success of Pinafore.[39]"
