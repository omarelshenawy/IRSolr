				"after": "Gemini is a 2002 Indian Tamil-language film written and directed by Saran. The film features Vikram (pictured) in the title role of a small-time criminal and aspiring crime boss who, after falling in love, gives up his life of crime; Kiran Rathod plays his love interest. Murali stars as Singaperumal, a police officer who inspires and guides Gemini. Based on gang wars in Chennai, the film delves into the lives of outlaws and the roles the police and society play in their rehabilitation and acceptance. Shot mainly at the AVM Studios in Chennai, the film was released in 2002 to praise from critics for Vikram's performance, but not for Saran's script. Made at an estimated cost of â¹40 million (US$630,000), the film earned â¹210 million (US$3.3Â million) at the box office and became the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year. The film's success, largely attributed to the popularity of one of its songs, \"O Podu\", resurrected the Tamil film industry, which was experiencing difficulties after a series of box office failures. The film won three Filmfare Awards, three ITFA Awards and four Cinema Express Awards. Later that same year, Saran remade the film in Telugu. (FullÂ article...)",
