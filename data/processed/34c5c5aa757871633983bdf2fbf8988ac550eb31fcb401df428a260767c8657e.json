				"The Griffon was produced in approximately 50 different variants, the Griffon 130 being the last in the series. Details of representative variants are listed below:",
				"Some test Spitfire XIVs, 21s, and 24s were fitted with contra-rotating propellers, which eliminated the torque effect. Early problems with the complex gearbox that was required for contra-rotating propellers prevented them from ever becoming operational in Spitfires,[23] but they were used on later aircraft, including the Seafire FR. Mk 46 and F and FR.47, which were fitted with Griffon 87s driving contra-rotating propellers as standard equipment.[24] The Griffon 57 and 57A series, driving contra-rotating propellers, was used in the Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft.[25]"
