				"after": "A primate is a member of the biological order Primates, the group that contains lemurs, the aye-aye, lorisids, galagos, tarsiers, monkeys, and apes, with the last category including great apes. With the exception of humans, who inhabit every continent on Earth, most primates live in tropical or subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Asia. Primates range in size from the 30-gram (1Â oz) pygmy mouse lemur to the 200-kilogram (440Â lb) mountain gorilla. According to fossil evidence, the primitive ancestors of primates may have existed in the late Cretaceous period around 65Â mya (million years ago), and the oldest known primate is the Late Paleocene Plesiadapis, c. 55â58Â mya. Molecular clock studies suggest that the primate branch may be even older, originating in the mid-Cretaceous period around 85Â mya.",
