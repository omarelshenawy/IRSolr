				"The Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp was an American aircraft engine widely used in the 1930s and 1940s. Produced by Pratt & Whitney, it was a two-row, 14-cylinder, air-cooled radial design. It displaced 1,830Â cuÂ in (30.0Â L) and its bore and stroke were both 5.5Â in (140Â mm). A total of 173,618 R-1830 engines was built,[1] and from their use in two of the most-produced aircraft ever built, the B-24 bomber and DC-3 transport, more Twin Wasps may have been built than any other aviation piston engine in history. A \"bored-out\" version (to a 5.75 inch/146 mm cylinder bore) with a slightly higher power rating and other slight changes in detail design was produced as the R-2000."
