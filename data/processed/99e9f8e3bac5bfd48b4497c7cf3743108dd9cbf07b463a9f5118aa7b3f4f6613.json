				"after": "BuÃ±uel's style of directing was extremely economical; he shot films in a few weeks, rarely deviating from his script (the scene in Tristana where Catherine Deneuve exposes her breasts to Saturno â but not the audience â being a noted exception) and shooting in order as much as possible to minimize editing time.[251] He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated at the beginning of his career in 1928: \"The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and timeâin a word, the filmâwas first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker\".[94]:p.135 In this, BuÃ±uel has been compared with Alfred Hitchcock, another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, since each man would know, in BuÃ±uel's words, \"exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be\".[252] According to actress Jeanne Moreau: \"He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot. He had the film in his mind. When he said 'action' and 'cut,' you knew that what was in between the two would be printed.\"[221]",
