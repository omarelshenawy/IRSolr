They eat a wide range of small creatures (mostly insects such as ants, grasshoppers, shield bugs, flies, weevils and various larvae) as well as small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit.[51][57] Their foraging, termed 'hop-searching', occurs on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres high.[51] Because this foraging practice renders them vulnerable to predators, birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups. During winter, when food may be scarce, ants are an important 'last resort' food, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet.[58] Nestlings, in contrast to adult birds, are fed a diet of larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers.[59]",
