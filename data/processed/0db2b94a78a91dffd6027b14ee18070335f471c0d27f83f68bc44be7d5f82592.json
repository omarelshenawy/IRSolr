				"after": "Octagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing.[233] It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan.[233] The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom.[233] The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of Eight Banners.[234] When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells.[233] Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer.[233]",
