				"previous": "UCR's enrollment exceeded 1,000Â students by the time Clark Kerr became president of the UC system in 1958.[22] Anticipating a \"tidal wave\" in enrollment growth required by the baby boom generation, Kerr developed the California Master Plan for Higher Education and the Regents designated Riverside a general university campus in 1959.[23] UCR's first chancellor, Herman Theodore Spieth, oversaw the beginnings of the school's transition to a full university and its expansion to a capacity of 5,000Â students. UCR's second chancellor, Ivan Hinderaker led the campus through the era of the free speech movement and kept student protests peaceful in Riverside.[24] According to a 1998 interview with Hinderaker, the city of Riverside received negative press coverage for smog after the mayor asked Governor Ronald Reagan to declare the South Coast Air Basin a disaster area in 1971; subsequent student enrollment declined by up to 25% through 1979.[17][24][25] Hinderaker's development of innovative programs in business administration and biomedical sciences created incentive for enough students to enroll at Riverside to keep the campus open.[24][26]",
				"after": "In the 1990s, the UC experienced a new surge of enrollment applications, now known as \"Tidal Wave II\".[27] The Regents targeted UCR for an annual growth rate of 6.3%, the fastest in the UC system, and anticipated 19,900Â students at UCR by 2010.[28] By 1995, African American, American Indian, and Latino student enrollments accounted for 30% of the UCR student body, the highest proportion of any UC campus at the time.[29] The 1997 implementation of Proposition 209âwhich banned the use of affirmative action by state agenciesâreduced the ethnic diversity at the more selective UC campuses but further increased it at UCR.[30]",
