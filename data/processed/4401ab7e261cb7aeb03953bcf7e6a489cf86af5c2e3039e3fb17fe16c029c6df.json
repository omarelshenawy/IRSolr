Forest elephants mainly live in equatorial forests, but will enter gallery forests and ecotones between forests and savannahs.[21] Asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses, low woody plants and trees, primarily inhabiting dry thorn-scrub forests in southern India and Sri Lanka and evergreen forests in Malaya.[14] Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass and roots.[21] They are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers feces to digest vegetation.[88] African elephants are mostly browsers while Asian elephants are mainly grazers. They can consume as much as 150Â kg (330Â lb) of food and 40Â L (11Â USÂ gal) of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources.[21] Major feeding bouts take place in the morning, afternoon and night. At midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down.[77][89] Elephants average 3â4 hours of sleep per day.[90] Both males and family groups typically move 10â20Â km (6â12Â mi) a day, but distances as far as 90â180Â km (56â112Â mi) have been recorded in the Etosha region of Namibia.[91] Elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food, water and mates. At Chobe National Park, Botswana, herds travel 325Â km (202Â mi) to visit the river when the local waterholes dry up.[92]",
