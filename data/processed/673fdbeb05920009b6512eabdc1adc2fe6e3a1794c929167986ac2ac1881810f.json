				"after": "As the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first president in a half-century not to have been alive during World War II.[173] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward state Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning was a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[174][175] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president.\"[176] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[177] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[177] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[178] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88Â m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fourth-tallest president in the nation's history.[179][180] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed \"Bubba\", especially in the Southern U.S.[181] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog.\"[182][183] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely-publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[184][185]",
