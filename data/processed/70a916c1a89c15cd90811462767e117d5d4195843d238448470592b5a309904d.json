				"previous": "The Norman Cob is a mid-sized horse,[1] standing between 15.2Â 1â4Â hands (62.25Â inches, 158Â cm) and 16.3Â 1â2Â hands (67.5Â inches, 171Â cm) and weighing 550 to 900 kilograms (1,210 to 1,980Â lb).[2] The large variations in height and weight are explained by selection for a variety of uses within the breed.[3] The Norman Cob is elegant and closer in type to a Thoroughbred-cross than other French draft breeds.[4][5][6] Its conformation is similar to a robust Thoroughbred,[3] with a square overall profile and short back.[7] Selective breeding has been used to develop a lively trot,[8] with long strides.[9]",
				"after": "The head is well-proportioned[10] and similar to that of the Selle Francais,[5] with wide nostrils, small ears and a straight or convex facial profile.[3][7][10] The neck is thick,[11] muscular and arched.[5][10] The mane is sometimes roached.[3] The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep[5] and the withers pronounced.[3] The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back.[5][11][12] The hindquarters are powerful, although not so much as in heavy draft breeds,[11] and the croup muscular and sloping.[3][5] The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds.[3] The feet are round, wide and solid.[11]",
