				"after": "The giant elands are spiral-horned antelopes. Despite its common name, this species broadly overlaps in size with the common eland (Taurotragus oryx). However, the giant eland is somewhat larger on average than the common species and is thus the largest species of antelope in the world.[17][18][19][20] They are typically between 220 and 290Â cm (7.2 and 9.5Â ft) in head-and-body length and stand approximately 130 to 180Â cm (4.3 to 5.9Â ft) at the shoulder. Giant elands exhibit sexual dimorphism, as males are larger than females. The males weigh 400 to 1,000Â kg (880 to 2,200Â lb) and females weigh 300 to 600Â kg (660 to 1,320Â lb).[21] The tail is long, having a dark tuft of hair, and averages 90Â cm (35Â in) in length.[8] The life expectancy of giant elands is up to 25 years in the wild, and about 20 years in captivity.[21]",
