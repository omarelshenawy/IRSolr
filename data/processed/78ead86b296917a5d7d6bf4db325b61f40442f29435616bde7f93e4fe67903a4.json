				"previous": "The total estimate of Muslims killed by Chetniks is between 80,000 and 100,000, most likely about 86,000 or 6.7 percent of their population (8.1 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina).[119][120] According to World War II historian Vladimir Å½erjaviÄ, about 65,000 Croat and Muslim civilians were killed by Chetniks in the Independent State of Croatia.[118] In addition the Chetniks also completely destroyed 300 villages and small towns and a large number of mosques and Catholic churches.[118] Some historians contend genocide was committed against Muslims.[121]",
				"after": "The Partisans were also targets of terror tactics. In the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, apart from a few terrorist acts against NediÄ's and LjotiÄ's men, and in Montenegro against separatists, terror was directed solely against the Partisans, their families and sympathizers, on ideological grounds.[117] The goal, as repeatedly proven by Chetnik documents in general and specific orders, was for the complete destruction of the Partisans.[15] The Chetniks created lists of individuals that were to be liquidated and special units known as \"black trojkas\" were trained to carry out these acts of terror.[15] During the summer of 1942, using names supplied by MihailoviÄ, lists of individual NediÄ and LjotiÄ supporters to be assassinated or threatened were broadcast over BBC radio during news programming in Serbo-Croatian.[122] Once the British discovered this, the broadcasts of these lists were halted, although this did not prevent the Chetniks from continuing the assassinations.[122]",
