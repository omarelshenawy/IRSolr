				"previous": "The United States Navy acquired one 880-M in 1980 modifying it as an in-flight tanker. It had been purchased new from Convair by the FAA, and used for eighteen years.[7]Unofficially designated UC-880, it was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, and employed in Tomahawk Cruise Missile testing and aircraft refueling procedures.[8] Convair designed and manufactured the Tomahawk and Advanced Tomahawk Cruise Missile in San Diego where the 880 and 990 were produced. The sole UC-880 was damaged in a cargo hold explosive decompression test at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland in 1995.[9] The aircraft managed to remain theoretically controllable via backup systems unique to the 880 & 990.[10]",
