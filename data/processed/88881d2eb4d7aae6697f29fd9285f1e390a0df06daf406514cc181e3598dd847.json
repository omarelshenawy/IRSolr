Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins.[121][122] Three different designs were selected for the MonÃ©gasque coins.[123] However, In 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.[123][124]",
