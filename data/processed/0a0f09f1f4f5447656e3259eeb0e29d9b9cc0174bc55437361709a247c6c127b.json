As summer approached, Jumbo quickly became accustomed to crowds. Scotty even led him outside the Zoo to London's West End and the Thames. Here, Jumbo would bathe and play, shooting jets of water over Scotty. On his first anniversary with the London Zoo, Jumbo was critiqued by the keepers. The elephant was moody, and only happy in his outside pen or walking about through the crowds. His stable appeared to cause him anxiety, and he would react with rages. Several times he damaged the doors to the Elephant House by trying to break through.",
