When control of the body is mastered, practitioners are believed to free themselves from the duality of heat/cold, hunger/satiety, joy/grief, which is the first step toward the unattachment that relieves suffering.[10] This non-dualistic perspective comes from the Sankya school of the Himalayan Masters.[11]",
