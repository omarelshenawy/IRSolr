They are entirely absent from Indo-Malayan waters.[81] Monk seals and some otariids live in tropical and subtropical waters. Seals usually require cool, nutrient-rich waters with temperatures lower than 20Â Â°C (68Â Â°F). Even those that live in warm or tropical climates live in areas that become cold and nutrient rich due to current patterns.[81][82] Only monk seals live in waters that are not typically cool or rich in nutrients.[81] The Caspian seal and Baikal seal are found in large landlocked bodies of water (the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal respectively).",
