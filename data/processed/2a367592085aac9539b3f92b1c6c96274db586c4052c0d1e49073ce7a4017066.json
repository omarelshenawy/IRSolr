Typical Albertosaurus adults measured up to 9 metres (30 feet) long,[1][2] while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over 10 metres (33 feet) long.[3] Several independent mass estimates, obtained by different methods, suggest that an adult Albertosaurus weighed between 1.3Â tonnes (1.4Â short tons)[4] and 1.7Â tonnes (1.9Â tons).[5]",
