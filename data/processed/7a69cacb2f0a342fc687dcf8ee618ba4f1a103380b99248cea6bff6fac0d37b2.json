				"previous": "Mineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modelling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.",
				"after": "The geologic time scale encompasses the history of the Earth.[8] It is bracketed at the old end by the dates of the earliest Solar System material at 4.567 Ga,[9] (gigaannum: billion years ago) and the age of the Earth at 4.54 Ga[10][11] at the beginning of the informally recognized Hadean eon. At the young end of the scale, it is bracketed by the present day in the Holocene epoch.",
