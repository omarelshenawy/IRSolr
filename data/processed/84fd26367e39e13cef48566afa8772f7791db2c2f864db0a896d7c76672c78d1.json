				"previous": "Broadening more into an 8-foot (2.4Â m) deep channel about 100 yards (91Â m) wide, after leaving Lake Monroe, the St. Johns meets its most significant tributary in the middle basin, the spring-fed Wekiva River, discharging approximately 42,000,000 US gallons (160,000,000Â L) a day into the St. Johns.[22] Near this confluence are the towns of DeBary and Deltona. The forests surrounding the Wekiva River are home to the largest black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus) population in Florida, and several troops of Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) have adapted to the live near the river as well. The monkeys' introduction to Florida is unclear; they were reportedly brought to Florida either to serve in backdrop scenes of Tarzan movies filmed around the Silver River in the 1930s, or to lend an air of authenticity to \"jungle cruises\", provided by an enterprising boat operator around the same time.[23][24][25]",
				"after": "Of the most vital importance to marshes are invertebrate animals, which are the foundation of food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations.[26] Mosquitos are born in water; they are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next, or through drought and flood cycles.[27]",
