				"previous": "After appearing in AndrÃ© de Toth's Civil War drama Springfield Rifle (1952)[260]âa standard Warner Bros. film that was overshadowed by the success of its predecessor[261]âCooper made four films outside the United States.[262] In Mark Robson's drama Return to Paradise (1953), Cooper plays an American wanderer who liberates the inhabitants of a Polynesian island from the puritanical rule of a misguided pastor.[263] Cooper endured spartan living conditions, long hours, and ill health during the three-month location shoot on the island of Upolu in Western Samoa.[264] Despite its beautiful cinematography, the film received poor reviews.[265] Cooper's next three films were shot in Mexico.[262] In Hugo Fregonese's action adventure film Blowing Wild (1953) with Barbara Stanwyck, he plays a wildcatter in Mexico who gets involved with an oil company executive and his unscrupulous wife with whom he once had an affair.[266] In 1954, Cooper appeared in Henry Hathaway's Western drama Garden of Evil with Susan Hayward, about three soldiers of fortune in Mexico hired to rescue a woman's husband.[267] That same year, he appeared in Robert Aldrich's Western adventure Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster. In the film, Cooper plays an American adventurer hired by Emperor Maximilian I to escort a countess to Vera Cruz during the Mexican Rebellion of 1866.[268] All of these films received poor reviews but did well at the box-office.[269] For his work in Vera Cruz, Cooper earned $1.4 million in salary and percent of the gross.[270]",
				"after": "During this period, Cooper struggled with health problems. As well as his ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when he was hit by metal fragments from a dynamited oil well.[270] During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing.[270] In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters.[271] Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast,[272] and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality.[273] In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire.[274] Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty.[275] For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor.[276] The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.[275][277]",
