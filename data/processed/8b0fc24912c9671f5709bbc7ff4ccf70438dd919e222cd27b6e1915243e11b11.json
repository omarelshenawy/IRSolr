				"previous": "In 1967, JC-130A USAF 54-1626 was selected for conversion into the prototype AC-130A gunship (Project Gunship II). The modifications were done at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base by the Aeronautical Systems Division. A direct view night vision telescope was installed in the forward door, an early forward looking infrared (FLIR) in the forward part of the left wheel well, and Gatling guns fixed facing down and aft along the left side. The analog fire control computer prototype was handcrafted by RAF Wing Commander Tom Pinkerton at the USAF Avionics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB. Flight testing of the prototype was performed primarily at Eglin Air Force Base, followed by further testing and modifications. By September 1967, the aircraft was certified ready for combat testing and was flown to Nha Trang Air Base, South Vietnam for a 90-day test program.[6] The AC-130 was later supplemented by the AC-119 Shadow (Project Gunship III), which later proved to be underpowered.",
				"after": "Seven more warplanes were converted to the \"Plain Jane\" configuration like the AC-130 prototype in 1968,[8] and one aircraft received the \"Surprise Package\" equipment in 1969.[9] Surprise Package included the latest 20Â mm rotary cannons and 40 mm Bofors cannon but no 7.62Â mm close support armament. Surprise Package served as a test bed for the avionic systems and armament for the AC-130E.",
