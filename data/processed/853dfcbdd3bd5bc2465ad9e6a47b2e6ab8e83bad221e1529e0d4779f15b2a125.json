				"previous": "On April 19, 2010, the second flight-test aircraft was moved from Moses Lake to Palmdale to conduct tests on the aircraft's engines in preparation for obtaining a type certification for the aircraft. The remaining aircraft in the test fleet are scheduled to be moved to Palmdale during May.[49] It was reported on June 3, 2010, that an engine on the second 747-8F was struck by a tug during a ground move. The engine cowling was damaged, but there was no damage to the engine itself. After repairs the aircraft is to perform fuel efficiency testing.[50] It was announced on June 14, 2010, that the 747-8 had completed the initial phase of flight-worthiness testing and that the FAA had given Boeing an expanded type inspection authorization for the aircraft.[51]",
				"after": "By the end of June 2010, the three 747-8Fs that composed the flight-test program had flown a total of over 500Â hours and had completed hot-weather testing in Arizona.[52] In June 2010, Boeing determined that a fourth â8F aircraft was needed to help complete flight testing. It was decided to use the second production aircraft, RC503, to conduct the non-instrumented or minimally-instrumented tests, such as HIRF and Water Spray Certifications.[53][54] The aircraft, painted in delivery customer Cargolux's new livery, first flew on July 23, 2010.[55]",
