				"previous": "The power consumption of atomic clocks varies with their size. Atomic clocks on the scale of one chip require less than 30 milliwatt;[19] The United States Time Standard atomic clocks, NIST-F1 and NIST-F2, use far greater quantities of power.[12][20]",
				"after": "Most research focuses on the often conflicting goals of making the clocks smaller, cheaper, more accurate, and more reliable.",
