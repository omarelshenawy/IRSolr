				"after": "On June 1, Santa Anna boarded a ship to travel back to Mexico. For the next two days, crowds of soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution. Lamar, by now promoted to Secretary of War, gave a speech insisting that \"Mobs must not intimidate the government. We want no French Revolution in Texas!\", but on June 4 soldiers seized Santa Anna and put him under military arrest.[281] According to Lack, \"the shock of having its foreign policy overturned by popular rebellion had weakened the interim government irrevocably\".[282] A group of soldiers staged an unsuccessful coup in mid-July.[283] In response, Burnet called for elections to ratify the constitution and elect a Congress,[284] the sixth set of leaders for Texas in a twelve-month period.[285] Voters overwhelmingly chose Houston the first president, ratified the constitution drawn up by the Convention of 1836, and approved a resolution to request annexation to the United States.[286] Houston issued an executive order sending Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., and from there he was soon sent home.[287]",
