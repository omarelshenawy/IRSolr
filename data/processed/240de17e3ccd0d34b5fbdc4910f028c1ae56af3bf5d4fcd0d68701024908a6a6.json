				"previous": "Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80Â percent of the world's population[159] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[160] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95â0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.",
				"after": "In May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects,[161] and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[162]",
