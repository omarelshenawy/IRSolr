				"previous": "As already mentioned, the lexicographical work of Zodhiates says that, in the second of these two cases, Mark 7:4, the verb baptizein indicates that, after coming from the market, the Pharisees washed their hands by immersing them in collected water.[72] Balz & Schneider understand the meaning of Î²Î±ÏÏÎ¯Î¶Ï, used in place of á¿¥Î±Î½ÏÎ¯ÏÏÎ½ÏÎ±Î¹ (sprinkle), to be the same as Î²Î¬ÏÏÏ, to dip or immerse,[75][76][77] a verb used of the partial dipping of a morsel held in the hand into wine or of a finger into spilled blood.[78]",
				"after": "A possible additional use of the verb baptizein to relate to ritual washing is suggested by Peter Leithart (2007) who suggests that Paul's phrase \"Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead?\"[79] relates to Jewish ritual washing.[80] In Jewish Greek the verb baptizein \"baptized\" has a wider reference than just \"baptism\" and in Jewish context primarily applies to the masculine noun baptismos \"ritual washing\"[81] The verb baptizein occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of ritual washing, baptismos; Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity, Naaman washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy, etc.[82] Additionally, in the New Testament only, the verb baptizein can also relate to the neuter noun baptisma \"baptism\" which is a neologism unknown in the Septuagint and other pre-Christian Jewish texts.[83] This broadness in the meaning of baptizein is reflected in English Bibles rendering \"wash\", where Jewish ritual washing is meant: for example Mark 7:4 states that the Pharisees \"except they wash (Greek \"baptize\"), they do not eat\",[84] and \"baptize\" where baptisma, the new Christian rite, is intended.",
