				"previous": "There were many ways to die as reported by the runestones. The Ãda Runestone reports that BergviÃ°r drowned during a voyage to Livonia,[22] and the Sjonhem Runestone tells that the Gotlander HrÃ³Ã°fÃºss was killed in a treacherous way by what was probably a people in the Balkans.[28] The most famous runestones that tell of eastern voyages are the Ingvar Runestones which tell of Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to Serkland, i.e., the Muslim world. It ended in tragedy as none of the more than 25 runestones that were raised in its memory tells of any survivor.[29]",
				"after": "Other Vikings travelled westwards. The Anglo-Saxon rulers paid large sums, Danegelds, to Vikings, who mostly came from Denmark and who arrived to the English shores during the 990s and the first decades of the 11th century. What may be part of a Danegeld has been found submerged in a creek in SÃ¶dra Betby in SÃ¶dermanland, Sweden. At the location, there is also a runestone with the text: \"[...] raise the stone in memory of JÃ´rundr, his son, who was in the west with Ulfr, HÃ¡kon's son.\"[29][30] It is not unlikely that the voyage westwards is connected with the English silver treasure.[29] Other runestones are more explicit with the Danegelds. Ulf of Borresta who lived in Vallentuna travelled westwards several times,[29] as reported on the YttergÃ¤rde Runestone:",
