				"previous": "On 17 January 1945Â â after the beginning of the VistulaâOder Offensive of the Red ArmyÂ â Soviet troops entered the ruins of Warsaw, and liberated Warsaw's suburbs from German occupation.[38] The city was swiftly taken by the Soviet Army, which rapidly advanced towards ÅÃ³dÅº, as German forces regrouped at a more westward position.",
			"after": [
				"In 1945, after the bombing, the revolts, the fighting, and the demolition had ended, most of Warsaw lay in ruins.",
				"After the war, under a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets, the \"Bricks for Warsaw\" campaign was initiated, and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the housing shortage, along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city, such as the Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet Union. The city resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country's centre of political and economic life. Many of the historic streets, buildings, and churches were restored to their original form. In 1980, Warsaw's historic Old Town was inscribed onto UNESCO's World Heritage list.[39]"
