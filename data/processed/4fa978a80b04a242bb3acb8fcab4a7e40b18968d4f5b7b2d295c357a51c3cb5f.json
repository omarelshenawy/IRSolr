				"An ellipse in canonical position (center at origin, major axis along the X-axis) with semi-axes a and b can be represented parametrically as",
				"With this parametric equation, the point (-1, 0) is not represented by a real value of t, but by the limit of x and y when t tends to infinity."
			],
			"after": [
				"An ellipse in general position can be expressed as",
				"as the parameter t varies from 0 to 2Ï. Here is the center of the ellipse, and is the angle between the -axis and the major axis of the ellipse."
