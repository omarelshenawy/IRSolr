				"previous": "Even before the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan.[8] The operation had two parts: Operations Olympic and Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, KyÅ«shÅ«.[9] Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the KantÅ Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of HonshÅ« by the U.S. First, Eighth and Tenth Armies. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.[10]",
				"after": "Japan's geography made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation KetsugÅ, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of KyÅ«shÅ«, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations.[11] Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan,[12] and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defense, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions.[13] In all, there were 2.3Â million Japanese Army troops prepared to defend the home islands, backed by a civilian militia of 28Â million men and women. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral TakijirÅ Ånishi, predicted up to 20Â million Japanese deaths.[14]",
