				"after": "Volkswagen and Sanyo have teamed up to develop a battery system for hybrid cars.[89] Volkswagen head Martin Winterkorn has confirmed the company plans to build compact hybrid electric vehicles. He has stated \"There will definitely be compact hybrid models, such as Polo and Golf, and without any great delay\", with gasoline and diesel power. For example, Golf is the ideal model to go hybrid as the Golf 1.4 TSI was recently awarded the âAuto Environment Certificateâ by the Oko-Trend Institute for Environmental Research, and was considered as one of the most environmentally friendly vehicles of 2007.[90] Also underway at Volkswagen's Braunschweig R&D facilities in Northern Germany is a hybrid version of the next-generation Touareg.[91]",
