				"previous": "After QuiriguÃ¡'s pivotal victory over CopÃ¡n in 738, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat rebuilt the main group in the image of CopÃ¡n itself. Thus, the acropolis, palace, and ballcourt all lie at the southern end of the Great Plaza.[21] The ceremonial centre is laid out around three plazas, the northernmost is the Great Plaza. This plaza measures 325Â m (1,066Â ft) from north to south and is the largest plaza in the whole Maya region. At the southern end of the Great Plaza is the Ballcourt Plaza, surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis. The Acropolis Plaza is a fully enclosed plaza within the acropolis itself.[76][77] The area to the west of the Ballcourt Plaza was probably the riverside docking area and there is evidence that the southern part of the Great Plaza was a marketplace.[78] A number of ceramic-lined wells have been excavated close to the site core, these were all built in the 8thÂ century and although some continued in use into the 9th century, none are known to have been built that late.[79]",
