				"after": "The Air New Zealand head office, \"The Hub,\" is a 15,600 square metres (168,000Â sqÂ ft) office park located at the corner of Beaumont and Fanshawe Streets in Western Reclamation Precinct 2, Auckland City;[18][19] it includes two connected six level buildings.[19] The facility consists of a lot of glass to allow sunlight and therefore reduce electricity consumption. The building does not have cubicle walls. Lights automatically turn on at 7:30Â A.M. and turn off at 6Â P.M. Sensors throughout the building can turn on lights if they detect human activity, and turn off lights if human activity is not detected for 15Â minutes.[20] The building cost $60 million New Zealand dollars to build and develop. From late September to early October 2006 the airline moved 1,000 employees from four buildings in the Auckland CBD and some other buildings.[19] \"The Hub\" is owned by Macquarie Goodman Property Trust. In 2006 the airline took an initial 11-year lease for 4.1 million dollars each year; the rent cost is subject to a yearly review to account for increases in property value.[19]",
