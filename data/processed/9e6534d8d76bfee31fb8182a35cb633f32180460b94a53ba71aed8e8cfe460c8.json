				"previous": "R. B. Ricketts and his wife had three children; their son William Reynolds Ricketts lived in the house after his parents' deaths. Between 1920 and 1924 the Pennsylvania Game Commission bought 48,000Â acres (19,000Â ha) from the Ricketts heirs, via the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company. This became most of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13, west of the lake in Sullivan County.[36] These sales left the Ricketts heirs with over 12,000Â acres (4,900Â ha) surrounding Ganoga Lake and the glens with their waterfalls. The stone house was listed on the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1936, which gave its name as \"Ganoga\". The area was approved as a national park site in the 1930s,[22] and the National Park Service operated a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at \"Ricketts Glynn\" (sic).[37][38] Budget problems and World War II brought an end to national plans for development.[22][39]",
				"after": "In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261Â acres (510Â ha), including the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought a total of 16,000Â acres (6,500Â ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000Â acres (4,000Â ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000Â acres (1,200Â ha) acquired from others.[22][36] After World War II, William Reynolds Ricketts also sold the old-growth timber around Ganoga Lake to help pay property taxes.[40]",
