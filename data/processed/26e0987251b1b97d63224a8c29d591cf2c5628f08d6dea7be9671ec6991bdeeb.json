				"after": "The 787 is powered by two engines; these engines use all-electrical bleedless systems, eliminating the superheated air conduits normally used for aircraft power, de-icing, and other functions.[6] As part of its \"Quiet Technology Demonstrator 2\" project, Boeing adopted several engine noise-reducing technologies for the 787. These include an air inlet containing sound-absorbing materials and exhaust duct cover with a chevron-toothed pattern on the rim for a quieter mixing of exhaust and outside air.[180] Boeing expects these developments to make the 787 significantly quieter both inside and out.[218] The noise-reducing measures prevent sounds above 85 decibels from leaving airport boundaries.[178]",
