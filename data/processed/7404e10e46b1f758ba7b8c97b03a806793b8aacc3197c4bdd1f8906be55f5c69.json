				"after": "The St. Johns River lies within a humid subtropical zone. In summer months, the temperature ranges from 74 and 92Â Â°F (23 and 33Â Â°C), and between 50 and 72Â Â°F (10 and 22Â Â°C) in the winter, although drops may occur in winter months to below freezing approximately a dozen times. Water temperatures in the river correlate to the air temperatures. The average range of water temperatures is between 50 and 95Â Â°F (10 and 35Â Â°C), rising in the summer months.[73] Where the river widens between Palatka and Jacksonville, wind becomes a significant factor in navigation, and both whitecap waves and calm surface waters are common.[74]",
