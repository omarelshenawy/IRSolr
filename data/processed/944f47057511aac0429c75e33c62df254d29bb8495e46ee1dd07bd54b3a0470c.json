				"previous": "Spatial-D and G-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) are two of the most common causes of death from human factors in military aviation.[4] Spatial orientation in flight is difficult to achieve because numerous sensory stimuli (visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive) vary in magnitude, direction, and frequency. Any differences or discrepancies between visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory inputs result in a sensory mismatch that can produce illusions and lead to spatial disorientation.",
