				"after": "Following the end of the eruption, scientists established a grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change in the shape of the island. In the 20Â years following the end of the eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily slumping vertically and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of slumping was initially about 20Â cm (8Â in) per year but slowed to 1â2Â cm (0.4â0.8Â in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to the weight of the volcano.[14]",
