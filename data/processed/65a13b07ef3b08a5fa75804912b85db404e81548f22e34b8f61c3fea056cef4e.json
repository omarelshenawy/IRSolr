				"previous": "During his second season in Vienna, Mahler acquired a spacious modern apartment on the Auenbruggerstrasse and built a summer villa on land he had acquired next to his new composing studio at Maiernigg.[58] In November 1901, he met Alma Schindler, the stepdaughter of painter Carl Moll, at a social gathering that included the theatre director Max Burckhard.[87] Alma was not initially keen to meet Mahler, on account of \"the scandals about him and every young woman who aspired to sing in opera\".[88] The two engaged in a lively disagreement about a ballet by Alexander von Zemlinsky (Alma was one of Zemlinsky's pupils), but agreed to meet at the Hofoper the following day.[87] This meeting led to a rapid courtship; Mahler and Alma were married at a private ceremony on 9 March 1902. Alma was by then pregnant with her first child,[89] a daughter Maria Anna, who was born on 3 November 1902. A second daughter, Anna, was born in 1904.[67]",
				"after": "Friends of the couple were surprised by the marriage and dubious of its wisdom. Burckhard called Mahler \"that rachitic degenerate Jew\", unworthy for such a good-looking girl of good family.[90] On the other hand, Mahler's family considered Alma to be flirtatious, unreliable, and too fond of seeing young men fall for her charms.[91] Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarianâNatalie Bauer-Lechner, his earlier partner, said that living with him was \"like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves\".[92] Alma soon became resentful that, on Mahler's insistence that there could only be one composer in the family, she had given up her music studies. She wrote in her diary: \"How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived ofÂ ... things closest to one's heart\".[93] Mahler's requirement that their married life be organised around his creative activities imposed strains, and precipitated rebellion on Alma's part; the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion, particularly from Mahler.[n 7]",
