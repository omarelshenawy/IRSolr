				"after": "The Aztec /ËÃ¦ztÉk/ people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words aztecatl /asËtekatÍ¡É¬/ (singular) and aztecah /asËtekaÊ/ (plural) mean \"people from Aztlan\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \"Aztec\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as MÄxihcah Tenochcah /meËËÊiÊkaÊ teËnotÍ¡ÊkaÊ/ or CÅlhuah Mexihcah /ËkoËlwaÊ meËËÊiÊkaÊ/.",
