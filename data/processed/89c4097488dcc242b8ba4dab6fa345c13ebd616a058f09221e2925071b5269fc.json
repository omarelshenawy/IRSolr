				"after": "The Red Bed is a piece of painted furniture designed by the English architect and designer William Burges[1] made between 1865 and 1867. Built of mahogany, painted blood red and decorated with imagery of the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale,[1] it was made for Burges's rooms at Buckingham Street, and later moved to his bedroom at The Tower House, the home he designed for himself in Holland Park. Burges wanted to fill his home with furniture covered with paintings, both ornaments and subjects; it not only did its duty as furniture, but spoke and told a story.[2] Burges died in the bed, aged 53, on 20 April 1881.[3]",
