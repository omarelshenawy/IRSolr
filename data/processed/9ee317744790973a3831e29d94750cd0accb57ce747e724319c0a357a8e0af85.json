				"after": "Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.[41] Before that, mathematics was written out in words, a painstaking process that limited mathematical discovery.[42] Euler (1707â1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. It is extremely compressed: a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like musical notation, modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax (which to a limited extent varies from author to author and from discipline to discipline) and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way.",
