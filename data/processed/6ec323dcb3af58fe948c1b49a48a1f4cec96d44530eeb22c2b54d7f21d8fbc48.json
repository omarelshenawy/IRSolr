				"Orion (Greek: á½¨ÏÎ¯ÏÎ½ or Î©Î±ÏÎ¯ÏÎ½, Latin: Orion) was a giant huntsman of Greek mythology whom Zeus placed among the stars as the constellation of Orion.",
				"Ancient sources tell several different stories about Orion. There are two major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement."
