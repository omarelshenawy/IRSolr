				"after": "Oldham's Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo-classical town hall built in 1841,[88] eight years before Oldham received its borough status.[89] One of the last purpose-built town halls in northwest England,[25] it has a tetrastyle Ionic portico, copied from the temple of Ceres, on the River Ilissos, near Athens.[48] Winston Churchill made his inaugural acceptance speech from the steps of the town hall when he was first elected as a Conservative MP in 1900. A Blue Plaque on the exterior of the building commemorates the event.[90] Long existing as the political centre of the town, complete with courtrooms, the structure has stood empty since the mid-1980s and has regularly been earmarked for redevelopment as part of regeneration project proposals, but none have been actioned.[7][89][90][91]",
