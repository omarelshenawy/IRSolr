				"previous": "Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894â1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904â1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea, and the southern half of Sakhalin.[40] Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.[41]",
				"after": "The early 20th century saw a brief period of \"TaishÅ democracy\" overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World WarÂ I enabled Japan, on the side of the victorious Allies, to widen its influence and territorial holdings. It continued its expansionist policy by occupying Manchuria in 1931; as a result of international condemnation of this occupation, Japan resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany, and the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[42] In 1941, Japan negotiated the SovietâJapanese Neutrality Pact.[43]",
