				"previous": "The chancel, according to Hall, contains \"artistic work of a kind seldom seen anywhere\".[72] The raised tiled floor of the chancel curves outward into the body of the church, and is approached by seven marble steps. The sanctuary is raised further, and enclosed by a marble altar rail behind which is an altar carved from white Carrara marble by L.M. Avenali. The altar supports a \"simple unadorned brass cross that reflects the colors of the mosaics surrounding it.\"[78] The cross was made by William van Erp and was dedicated to the memory of Jane Stanford in 1948.",
				"after": "Behind the altar is a mosaic reproduction of Roselli's \"Last Supper\". Around the lower walls of the chancel are twelve niches decorated with golden mosaic tiles. They hold candles, but originally held statues of the twelve apostles, destroyed in 1906 and were never replaced. According to local legend, the cherubim carved in stone above the golden niches and in the pillars' capitals are illustrations of children living on campus at the time of the church's construction.[78] To the west side of the chancel stands brass lectern in the form of a reading angel, which Jane Stanford brought from Europe and dedicated to her husband on the anniversary of his birth in 1902.[79]",
