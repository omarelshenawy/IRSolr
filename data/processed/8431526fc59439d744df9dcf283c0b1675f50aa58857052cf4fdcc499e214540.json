				"after": "When his first film was released, BuÃ±uel became the first filmmaker to be officially welcomed into the ranks of the Surrealists by the movement's leader AndrÃ© Breton, an event recalled by film historian Georges Sadoul: \"Breton had convoked the creators to our usual venue [the CafÃ© Radio]... one summer's evening. DalÃ­ had the large eyes, grace, and timidity of a gazelle. To us, BuÃ±uel, big and athletic, his black eyes protruding a little, seemed exactly like he always is in Un Chien Andalou, meticulously honing the razor that will slice the open eye in two.\"[230] After he joined the Communist Party in Spain, however, it was quickly made clear to him that he could not be both a Communist and a Surrealist; his artistic collaborator Pierre Unik recounted in a letter of 30 January 1932 that \"a comrade from Agit-Prop\" called BuÃ±uel and others together to tell them that, \"Surrealism was a movement of bourgeois degeneration\", continuing, \"What will the rank-and-file comrades say the day I have to announce to them, 'Comrades, I no longer have the right to militate amongst you...because I'm a degenerate bourgeois?'\"[55]:p.97 In consequence, on 6 May 1932, BuÃ±uel wrote a letter to AndrÃ© Breton renouncing his membership in the Surrealist group: \"Given the current state of things there could be no question for a Communist of doubting for an instant between the choice of his party and any other sort of activity or discipline\".[231] He even went so far as to try to re-issue a drastically cut version of L'Age d'Or (over two-thirds of the original were eliminated) in response to complaints that the full 60-minute original was formally too difficult for the proletariat.[55]:p.138 Nonetheless, he retained a lifelong affinity with the Surrealist movement and longstanding friendships with many of the most prominent Surrealists.[232]",
