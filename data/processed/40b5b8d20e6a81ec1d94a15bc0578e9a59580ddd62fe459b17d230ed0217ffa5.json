				"previous": "Mines in Labrador, the iron ore mine at Wabush/Labrador City, and the nickel mine in Voisey's Bay produced a total of $3.3Â billion worth of ore in 2010.[90] A mine at Duck Pond (30Â km (18Â mi) south of the now-closed mine at Buchans), started producing copper, zinc, silver and gold in 2007, and prospecting for new ore bodies continues.[94] Mining accounted for 3.5% of the provincial GDP in 2006.[92] The province produces 55% of Canada's total iron ore.[95] Quarries producing dimension stone such as slate and granite, account for less than $10Â million worth of material per year.[96] Oil production from offshore oil platforms on the Hibernia, White Rose and Terra Nova oil fields on the Grand Banks was of 110,000,000 barrels (17,000,000Â m3), which contributed to more than 15% of the province's GDP in 2006. Total production from the Hibernia field from 1997 to 2006 was 733,000,000 barrels (116,500,000Â m3) with an estimated value of $36Â billion. This will increase with the inclusion of the latest project, Hebron. Remaining reserves are estimated at almost 2 billion barrels (320Ã10 ^6Â m3) as of December 31, 2006. Exploration for new reserves is ongoing.[92]",
				"after": "On June 16, 2009, provincial premier Danny Williams announced a tentative agreement to expand the Hibernia Oil Field. The government negotiated a 10-per-cent equity stake in the Hibernia South expansion, which will add an estimated $10Â billion to Newfoundland and Labrador's treasury.[97]",
