				"Another subspecies of Falco peregrinus, madens, has also sometimes been treated instead within a separately recognized F. pelegrinoides.[11]",
				"Barbary falcons have a red neck patch but otherwise differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity.[43] The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only the outer part of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced.[5] The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller.[30] Barbary falcons breed at different times of year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies,[5][30][27][23][24][44][45] but they are capable of interbreeding.[46] There is a 0.6â0.7% genetic distance in the peregine-Barbary falcon (\"peregrinoid\") complex.[27]"

				"after": "The peregrine falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and increasingly in cities.[11] In mild-winter regions, it is usually a permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, will remain on the breeding territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.[47]",
