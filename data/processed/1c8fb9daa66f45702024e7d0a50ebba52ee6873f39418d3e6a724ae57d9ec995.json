				"previous": "Inside Cloud Gate's polished exterior shell are several steel structures that keep the sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings.[27] The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing.[28] The supporting structural components were designed and constructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.[23]",
				"after": "When Cloud Gate's interior components were completed, construction crews prepared to work on the outer shell; this comprises 168Â stainless steel panels, each 3â8 inch (10Â mm) thick and weighing 1,000 to 2,000 pounds (450 to 910Â kg).[29] They were fabricated using three-dimensional modeling software.[23] Computers and robots were essential in the bending and shaping of the plates,[24] which was performed by English wheel and a robotic scanning device.[30] Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland.[23] The plates were polished to 98Â percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks.[31] Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442Â linear feet (744Â m) of welded seams.[29] Welders used keyhole welding machines rather than traditional welding guns.[6] The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position.[29]",
