				"after": "The second step of Remez' algorithm consists of moving the test points to the approximate locations where the error function had its actual local maxima or minima. For example, one can tell from looking at the graph that the point at â0.1 should have been at about â0.28. The way to do this in the algorithm is to use a single round of Newton's method. Since one knows the first and second derivatives of P(x)âf(x), one can calculate approximately how far a test point has to be moved so that the derivative will be zero.",
