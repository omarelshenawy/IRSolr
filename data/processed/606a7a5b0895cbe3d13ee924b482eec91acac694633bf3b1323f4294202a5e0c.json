				"after": "As of February 17, 2008, Boeing 40C c/n 1043 became the only airworthy example in the world. It also holds the title of the oldest flying Boeing in the world. In 1928, the aircraft was substantially damaged in a crash near Canyonville, OR. After being recovered, it was completely rebuilt[when?] over an eight-year period and an estimated 18,000 man hours by Pemberton and Sons Aviation[14] in Spokane, Washington. On May 8, 2010, this airplane had an aerial rendezvous with Boeing's newest passenger aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.[15] This aircraft spends its winters living at the Western Antique Aeroplane & Automobile Museum in Hood River, Oregon.",
