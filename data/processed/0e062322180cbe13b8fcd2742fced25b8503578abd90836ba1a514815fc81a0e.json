				"previous": "As will be mentioned again below, it follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra that every non-constant polynomial with real coefficients can be written as a product of polynomials with real coefficients whose degree is either 1 or 2. However, in 1702 Leibniz said that no polynomial of the type x4Â +Â a4 (with a real and distinct from 0) can be written in such a way. Later, Nikolaus Bernoulli made the same assertion concerning the polynomial x4Â âÂ  4x3Â +Â 2x2Â +Â 4xÂ +Â 4, but he got a letter from Euler in 1742[1] in which he was told that his polynomial happened to be equal to",
				"after": "where Î± is the square root of 4Â +Â 2â7. Also, Euler mentioned that",
