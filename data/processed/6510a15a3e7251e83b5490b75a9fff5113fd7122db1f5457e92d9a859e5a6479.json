				"after": "Standards for the breed are stipulated by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. The maximum height allowed is 14.2Â 1â4Â hands (58.25Â inches, 148Â cm). Although there is no minimum height standard, in practice New Forest ponies are seldom less than 12Â hands (48Â inches, 122Â cm). In shows, they normally are classed in two sections: competition height A, 138 centimetres (54Â in) and under; and competition height B, over 138 centimetres (54Â in). New Forest ponies should be of riding type, workmanlike, and strong in conformation, with a sloping shoulder and powerful hindquarters; the body should be deep, and the legs straight with strong, flat bone, and hard, rounded hooves.[2] Larger ponies, although narrow enough in the barrel for small children to ride comfortably, are also capable of carrying adults. Smaller ponies may not be suitable for heavier riders, but they often have more show quality. The New Forest pony has free, even gaits, active and straight, but not exaggerated, and is noted for sure-footedness, agility, and speed.[3]",
