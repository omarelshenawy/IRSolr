				"previous": "A second woodcut was executed by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg around the same time as DÃ¼rer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, but it is not clear whether he had access to a letter or sketch as DÃ¼rer did, perhaps even DÃ¼rer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal.[30] His image is truer to life, omitting DÃ¼rer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros;[30] however, DÃ¼rer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived,[31] whereas DÃ¼rer's print survives in many impressions. DÃ¼rer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading,[10] and many further printings followed after DÃ¼rer's death in 1528, including two printings in the 1540s, and a further two in the late 16th century.[32] Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.[10] A tone block was created around 1620 to create a chiaroscuro woodcut in two tones, (seen in the printing by Willem Janssen in Amsterdam).[32][33] The original woodblock continued to be used, even though later printings are marred by woodworm holes and a crack through the rhino's legs.[34]",
				"after": "Despite its errors, the image remained very popular,[5] and was taken to be an accurate representation of a rhinoceros until the late 18th century. DÃ¼rer may have anticipated this and deliberately chosen to create a woodcut, rather than a more refined and detailed engraving, as this was cheaper to produce and more copies could be printed.[34] Images derived from it were included in naturalist texts, including Sebastian MÃ¼nster's Cosmographiae (1544), Conrad Gessner's Historiae Animalium (1551), Edward Topsell's Histoire of Foure-footed Beastes (1607) and many others. A rhinoceros that was clearly based on DÃ¼rer's woodcut was chosen by Alessandro de' Medici as his emblem in June 1536, with the motto \"Non vuelvo sin vencer\" (old Spanish for \"I shall not return without victory\").[35] A sculpture of a rhinoceros based on DÃ¼rer's image was placed at the base of a 70-foot (21Â m) high obelisk designed by Jean Goujon and erected in front of the Church of the Sepulchre in the rue Saint-Denis in Paris in 1549 for the royal entry welcoming the arrival of the new King of France, Henry II.[36] A similar rhinoceros, in relief, decorates a panel in one of the bronze west doors of Pisa Cathedral. The rhinoceros was depicted in numerous other paintings and sculptures, and became a popular decoration for porcelain. The popularity of the inaccurate DÃ¼rer image remained undiminished despite an Indian rhinoceros spending eight years in Madrid from 1580 to 1588 (although a few examples of a print of the Madrid rhinoceros sketched by Philippe Galle in Antwerp in 1586, and derivative works, have survived), and the exhibition of a live rhinoceros in London a century later, from 1684â86, and of a second individual after 1739.[37]",
