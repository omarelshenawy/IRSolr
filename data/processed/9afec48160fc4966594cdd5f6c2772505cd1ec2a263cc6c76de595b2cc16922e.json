				"previous": "Bus transit is the most important mode of public transport in Chengdu. There are more than 400 bus lines in Chengdu. In addition, Chengdu BRT offers services on the Second Ring Road Elevated Road.",
				"after": "Historically, the Jin River was used for boat traffic in and out of Chengdu. However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time in history, the Silk River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Due to this reason, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River, or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, the port cities of Yibin and Luzhouâboth of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expresswaysâon the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.",
