				"previous": "Densities of giant clams reach up to four per square foot in parts of the lagoon.[2] The most common species is the âsmall giant clamâ Tridacna maxima and largest clam species, Tridacna gigas is also found in the lagoon.[2]",
				"after": "There is no standing fresh water on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses),[5] and wells have been built to tap drinking water for temporary settlements.[6] Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; but even in the oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, soils are only a few centimeters (one or two inches) thick.[4]",
