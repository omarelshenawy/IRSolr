				"Related to this is a bug strike: an impairment of an aircraft/groundcraft or aviator/driver by an airborne insect.",
				"Most accidents occur when there is a collision involving a bird (or birds) and the windscreen or a bird (or birds) is sucked into the engines of mechanical air craft. These cause annual damages that have been estimated at $400 million[3] within the United States of America alone and up to $1.2 billion to commercial aircraft worldwide.[6] In addition to property damage, collisions between man-made structures and conveyances and birds is a contributing factor, among many others, to the world wide decline of many avian species."
