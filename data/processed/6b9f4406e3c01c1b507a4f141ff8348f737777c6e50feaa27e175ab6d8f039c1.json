				"previous": "The Natural History is encyclopaedic in scope, but its format is unlike a modern encyclopaedia. A modern reader will not find dedicated articles on the natural history of the chameleon, the medical uses of cabbage, or the effects of goat's blood on diamond. The work does however have structure: Pliny uses Aristotle's division of nature (animal, vegetable, mineral) to recreate the natural world in literary form.[4] Rather than presenting compartmentalised, stand-alone entries arranged alphabetically, Pliny's ordered natural landscape is a coherent whole, offering the reader a guided tour: \"a brief excursion under our direction among the whole of the works of natureÂ ...\"[5] The work is unified but varied: \"My subject is the world of natureÂ ... or in other words, life,\" he tells Titus.[2]",
				"after": "Nature for Pliny was divine, a pantheistic concept inspired by the Stoic philosophy which underlies much of his thought. But the deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve the human race: \"nature, that is life\" is human life in a natural landscape. After an initial survey of cosmology and geography, Pliny starts his treatment of animals with the human race, \"for whose sake great Nature appears to have created all other things\".[6] This teleological view of nature was common in antiquity and is crucial to the understanding of the Natural History.[7] The components of nature are not just described in and for themselves, but also with a view to their role in human life. Pliny devotes a number of the books to plants, with a focus on their medicinal value; the books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in architecture, sculpture, painting and jewellery. If Pliny's premise seems remote from modern ecological theories, the result is a compendium of an entire culture.[8]",
