				"previous": "With the powers of the King's Clerk abolished, the bailiffs of Norwich set about regulating the operation of the market for what they felt was the greatest benefit to the city. To encourage fair competition among the market's traders, it was forbidden to sell foodstuffs before the Cathedral bell had tolled for Lady Mass (6.00Â am).[3] The practice of forestalling (meeting merchants on their way to the market either to buy their goods for resale, or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type they were selling scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere other than in the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to Freemen of the city.[3][note 3] The prices of bread and beer were fixed,[note 4] and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked.[3] Shortly after the transfer of the market to the city a market cross was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.[11]",
				"after": "In mid-1348, the outbreak of bubonic plague known as the Great Mortality (later referred to as the Black Death), which had swept across Europe during the past year, reached England for the first time with an outbreak in the south coast port of Melcombe.[12] The plague spread gradually over the rest of the country with devastating effect, causing a mortality estimated at between 30%â45%.[13] In late MarchÂ 1349, the outbreak reached East Anglia and, for reasons which are not understood, increased drastically in intensity.[13] In 1349â50 alone, more than half the population of East Anglia died.[14] In 1369, East Anglia, whose farming economy had collapsed in the wake of the plague, was struck by famine.",
