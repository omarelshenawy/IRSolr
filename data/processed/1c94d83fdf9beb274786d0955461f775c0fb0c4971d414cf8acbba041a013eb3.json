This quickly led to a wave of colonization.[citation needed] Not all the settlers were successful however in the attempts to reach the island. In the 10th century, GunnbjÃ¶rn Ulfsson got lost in a storm and ended up within sight of the Greenland coast. His report spurred Erik the Red, an outlawed chieftain, to establish a settlement there in 985. While they flourished initially, these settlements eventually foundered due to changing climatic conditions (see Little Ice Age).[citation needed] They are believed to have survived until around 1450.",
