				"previous": "A simple example of a field is the field of rational numbers, consisting of numbers which can be written as fractions a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â  0. The additive inverse of such a fraction is simply âa/b, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that a â  0) is b/a. To see the latter, note that",
				"after": "The abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers, such as the law of distributivity",
