				"after": "Austin is currently administered by an eleven-member city council (ten council members plus a mayor), each of them elected at large. The council is accompanied by a hired city manager under the manager-council system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. Due to a referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012, the current composition with council members elected on an at-large basis changed in 2014 to a new system of ten single member districts and a citywide election for mayor.",
