				"after": "A 2005 survey at Holkham and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39Â per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7Â million day visitors and 5.5Â million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent Â£122Â million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Holkham NNR is one of three sites within the SSSI that attract 100,000 or more visitors annually, the others being Titchwell Marsh and Cley Marshes.[16] The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as Ringed Plovers and Little Terns, and also for wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle.[28] The discovery of the nationally rare tiny earthstar fungus at Holkham led its finders to state that \"The survival of this species in Britain would undoubtedly benefit from the construction of a boardwalk across this fragile and frequently-visited habitat.\"[29]",
