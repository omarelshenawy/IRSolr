				"previous": "expressed in any Lorentz frame and here assumed timelike (or lightlike), separating points on a trajectory of a particle (think clock). The same interval can be expressed in coordinates such that at each moment, the particle is at rest. Such a frame is called an instantaneous rest frame. Due to the invariance of the interval (instantaneous rest frames taken at different times are related by Lorentz transformations) one may write",
				"after": "since in the instantaneous rest frame, the particle is at rest. Since the interval is assumed timelike (lightlike), one may take the square root of the above expression;[3]",
