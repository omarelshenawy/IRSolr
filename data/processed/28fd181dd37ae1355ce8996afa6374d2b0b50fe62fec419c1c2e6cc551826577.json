				"previous": "Scholars believe he wrote about a thousand four-line verses or rubaiyat. He was introduced to the English-speaking world through the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m, which are poetic, rather than literal, translations by Edward FitzGerald (1809â1883). Other English translations of parts of the rubÃ¡iyÃ¡t (rubÃ¡iyÃ¡t meaning \"quatrains\") exist, but FitzGerald's are the most well known.",
				"after": "Ironically, FitzGerald's translations reintroduced KhayyÃ¡m to Iranians \"who had long ignored the Neishapouri poet\". A 1934 book by one of Iran's most prominent writers, Sadeq Hedayat, Songs of KhayyÃ¡m (Taranehha-ye KhayyÃ¡m), is said to have \"shaped the way a generation of Iranians viewed\" the poet.[38]",
