				"after": "In addition to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point operations per second (FLOPS) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware.[91] In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS,[92] the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard x86 CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform certain complex functions in a single floating point operation which would otherwise require multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences.[91] Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise a large majority of Folding@home's measured computing performance.[93][94]",
