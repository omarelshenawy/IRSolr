				"previous": "The best known illustrations of Thylacinus cynocephalus were those in Gould's The Mammals of Australia (1845â63), often copied since its publication and the most frequently reproduced,[111] and given further exposure by Cascade Brewery's appropriation for its label in 1987.[112] The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image in 1934,[113] the author Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for Tasmanian Friends and Foes (1881).[111]",
				"after": "The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official Tasmanian coat of arms.[114] It is used in the official logos of Tourism Tasmania and City of Launceston.[114] It is also used on the University of Tasmania's ceremonial mace and the badge of the submarine HMASÂ Dechaineux.[114] Since 1998, it has been prominently displayed on Tasmanian vehicle number plates.",
