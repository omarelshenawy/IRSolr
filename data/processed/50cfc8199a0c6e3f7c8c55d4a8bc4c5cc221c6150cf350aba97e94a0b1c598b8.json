The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. To use a well known quaint engineer's expression it \"goes off like the side of a house\". A fast transition between pass-band and stop-band was, of course, one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.[2][29]",
