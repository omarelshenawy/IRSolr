				"previous": "Activity was reflected with a high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 177.[1] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34Â knots (39Â mph, 63Â km/h) or tropical storm strength.[2]",
				"after": "Along a diffuse front, a broad area of low pressure in association with an upper-level low pressure was noted several hundred miles northeast of Puerto Rico on JuneÂ 8. After reformation of a low-level circulation, it is estimated that Tropical Depression One developed at 18:00Â UTC on JuneÂ 11, while located about 535Â mi (860Â km) southeast of Bermuda. Initially, the system resembled a subtropical cyclone, due to its frontal characteristics. After developing on JuneÂ 11, the depression almost immediately began to drift, a motion which lasted about 24Â hours. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene at 12:00Â UTC on JuneÂ 12.[3]",
