				"previous": "Two new liveries were unveiled. The first is mainly white with a black strip running downwards on the rear fuselage from the tail, adorned with the iconic koru logo in white, to disappear downwards just before where the wings meet the body of the plane. The black and white fern mark adorns the fuselage. This livery will be used on most of the fleet. A select number will receive a distinctive all black livery with the fern in silver. Extensive consumer surveys by Air New Zealand revealed 78% believed the Fern Mark fits with the airline's brand and represents New Zealand. The repainting is expected to take about 18 months for the over 100 strong fleet.[41] The first of the aircraft to be painted in this livery, ZK-OXB, was rolled out on 24 September 2013.",
