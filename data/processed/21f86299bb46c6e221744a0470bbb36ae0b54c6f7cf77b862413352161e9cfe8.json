				"previous": "The first two sawmills were built on Upper Pine Bottom Run in 1815Â and 1817.[13] In 1817, Michael and Henry Wolf also arrived in the area from Berks County and built a sawmill near the mouth of Little Pine Creek,[13] which is 1.8 miles (2.9Â km) downstream along Pine Creek from the mouth of Upper Pine Bottom Run.[16] The Wolfs' sawmill and the land they cleared for farming helped establish the unincorporated village of Waterville, which became the most significant population center in Cummings Township, and is about 2.5 miles (4.0Â km) southeast of Upper Pine Bottom State Park.[12][13]",
				"after": "The Jersey Shore and Coudersport Turnpike was built along the former bridle path between 1825Â and 1834. The turnpike, which operated until 1860, had toll booths every 5 miles (8Â km) and charged a horse-drawn wagon $1.68Â to travel the entire road.[14] A post office was established in nearby Waterville in 1849; the early businesses included two stores and a hotel, which still stands.[13] Pennsylvania Route 44, which passes through the park, still follows the course of the former path and turnpike between Haneyville (at the western end of Upper Pine Bottom Run) and Coudersport.[14][a]",
