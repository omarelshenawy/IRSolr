				"previous": "Post-war, BOAC continued to operate the majority of long-haul services in Britain,[9] other than routes to South America; these were flown by British South American Airways, which was merged back into BOAC in 1949.[10] Continental European and domestic flights were flown by a new nationalised airline, British European Airways Corporation (BEA), which compulsorily took over the scheduled services of existing UK independent airlines.[5] On 2 May 1952, BOAC became the world's first airline to operate jet airliners; the inaugural flight with the de Havilland CometÂ 1 was from London to Johannesburg.[11][12] However, the Comet's service introduction was plagued by structural problems and accidents,[13][14] leading to its withdrawal in 1954 and replacement with the upgraded Comet 4 models in 1958.[6][15][16]",
				"after": "In 1967 the government established a committee of inquiry into Civil Aviation under Sir Ronald Edwards, the Edwards Committee reported in 1969 and one of the recommendations of the Edwards committee was the formation of a National Air Holding Board to control finances and polices of the two corporations.[17] The recommendation was enacted in 1971 with the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1971 which formed a British Airways Board to control all the activities of BOAC and BEA; including the newly formed BEA Airtours subsidiary, targeting the emerging package holiday business.[18][19]",
