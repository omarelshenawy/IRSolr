				"after": "Two R engines, R17 and R19, were built for Sir Henry Segrave's twin-engined water speed record boat Miss England II, this craft being ready for trials on Windermere by June 1930. On Friday 13 June, Segrave was fatally injured and a Rolls-Royce technical advisor, Victor Halliwell, was killed when Miss England II capsized at high speed after possibly hitting a log. Shortly before his death Segrave learnt that he had set a new water speed record of just under 100Â mph (160Â km/h).[58][59] On 18 July 1932, Kaye Don set a new world water speed record of 119.81Â mph (192.82Â km/h) on Loch Lomond in a new boat, Miss England III, which also used engines R17 and R19.[60]",
