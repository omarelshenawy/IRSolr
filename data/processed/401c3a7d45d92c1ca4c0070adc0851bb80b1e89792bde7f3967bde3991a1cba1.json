				"after": "The Third Reich first used concentration camps as places of incarceration. And though death rates were highâwith a mortality rate of 50%âthey were not designed to be killing centers. (By 1942, six large camps were built in Poland solely for mass killing.) After 1939, the camps increasingly became places where Jews and POWs were either killed or made to work as slave laborers, undernourished and tortured.[110] It is estimated that the Germans established 15,000 camps and subcamps in the occupied countries, mostly in eastern Europe.[111][112] New camps were founded in areas with large Jewish, Polish intelligentsia, communist, or Roma and Sinti populations, including inside Germany. Prisoner transportation was often carried out under horrifying conditions in rail freight cars; many died before reaching their destination.",
