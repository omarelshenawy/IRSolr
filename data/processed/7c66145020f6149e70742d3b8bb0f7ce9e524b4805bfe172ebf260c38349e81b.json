				"previous": "This hypothesis was viewed as radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay was found to be full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact.[105] Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the KâPg boundary.[106][107] Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact,[108] and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearbyâas did the discovery that the KâPg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.[14]",
				"after": "Further research identified the giant Chicxulub crater, buried under Chicxulub on the coast of YucatÃ¡n, Mexico as the source of the KâPg boundary clay. Identified in 1990[7] based on work by geophysicist Glen Penfield in 1978, the crater is oval, with an average diameter of roughly 180 kilometres (110Â mi), about the size calculated by the Alvarez team.[109] The discovery of the crater â a necessary prediction of the impact hypothesis â provided conclusive evidence for a KâPg impact, and strengthened the hypothesis that the extinction was caused by an impact.",
