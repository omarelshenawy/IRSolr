				"previous": "Following the adoption of the present UNCLOS, the coastline under international law is a state's baseline, which is generally but not always equivalent to its low-water line.[79]",
				"after": "Over most of geologic time, the sea level has been higher than it is today.[6](p74) The main factor affecting sea level over time is the result of changes in the oceanic crust, with a downward trend expected to continue in the very long term.[80] At the last glacial maximum some 20,000 years ago, the sea level was 120 meters (390Â ft) below its present-day level. For at least the last 100 years, the sea level has been rising at an average rate of about 1.8Â mm (0.071Â in) per year.[81] Most of this rise can be attributed to an increase in the temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper 500Â m (1,600Â ft) of water. Additional contributions, as much as one quarter of the total, come from water sources on land, such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs.[82] The rising trend from global warming is expected to continue until at least the end of the 21st century.[83]",
