				"previous": "The acquisition of Boeing 767 series aircraft made LOT the second airline in the former communist states of Central Europe to operate American equipment (the first was MalÃ©v Hungarian Airlines, which acquired a Boeing 737-200 as early as on 18 November 1988;[19] Interflug acquired the Western European Airbus A310 in June 1989). These new aircraft were, at one point, used to operate LOT's longest-ever connection to Singapore. By the end of 1989 LOT had achieved much, it had hosted that year's IATA congress and achieved a milestone annual load-factor of 2.3 million passengers carried over the course of the year.",
				"after": "In 1990 LOT's third Boeing 767-300 landed at Warsaw Chopin Airport and not long after Boeing 737 and ATR 72 aircraft were acquired for use on LOT's expanded route network, which began to include new international destinations such as Kiev, Lviv, Minsk and Vilnius. Soon thereafter, in 1993, LOT began to expand its Western-European operations, inaugurating, in quick succession, flights to Oslo, Frankfurt and DÃ¼sseldorf, operations at Poland's other regional airports outside Warsaw were also duly expanded around this time.",
