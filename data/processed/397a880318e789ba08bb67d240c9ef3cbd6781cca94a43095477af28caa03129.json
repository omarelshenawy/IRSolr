				"previous": "In the last few years it has made many improvements to terminals, roadways and inter-terminal transportation.[49]",
			"after": [
				"JFK has six terminals, containing 128 gates, numbered 1â8 but skipping Terminal 6 (demolished in 2011) and Terminal 3 (demolished in 2013).",
				"The terminal buildings, with the exception of the former Tower Air terminal, are arranged in a deformed U-shaped wavy pattern around a central area containing parking, a power plant, and other airport facilities. The terminals are connected by the AirTrain system and access roads. Wayfinding signage throughout the terminals was designed by Paul Mijksenaar.[50] A 2006 survey by J.D. Power and Associates in conjunction with Aviation Week found JFK ranked second in overall traveller satisfaction among large airports in the United States, behind McCarran International Airport which serves the Las Vegas metropolitan area.[51]"
