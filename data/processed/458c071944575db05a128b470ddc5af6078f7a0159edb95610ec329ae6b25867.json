The Ministry of Housing, Infrastructure, and Transport oversees the development of the transport industry in Greenland[48] and controls Mittarfeqarfiit, the airport authority in Greenland. Between them, they control mandatory services, airport taxes, pricing policies, maritime connections, and tourism development,[citation needed] effectively allowing Greenland Home Rule to control the company in spite of the other stakeholders.[14]",
