				"previous": "The pass is 54Â km (34Â mi) east of Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim and 430Â km (270Â mi) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet.[14][15] In the winter, the pass is blocked by heavy snowfall. Because there is no meteorological centre in Nathu La, systematic measurements of meteorological data (such as temperature and rainfall) are not available for the region.[16] However, it is known that in the higher reaches of the Himalayas around the region, summer temperature never exceeds 15Â Â°C (59Â Â°F).[17]",
