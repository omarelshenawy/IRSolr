				"after": "In 1802 the clergyman and antiquarian John Skinner visited Anglesey to see the island's Celtic remains, beginning his tour by rowing across the Menai Strait to land at Llanidan. His view was that the church \"seems superior to the generality of Welsh buildings of the kind\", with its double roof and two bells, but he also said that \"the interior of the building has little to attract notice\".[22] Angharad Llwyd described it in 1833 as \"a spacious structure, containing several good monuments\".[18]",
