				"previous": "Samsung SPH-M2100, the first mobile phone with built-in MP3 player was produced in South Korea in August 1999.[26][27] Samsung SPH-M100 (UpRoar) launched in 2000 was the first cell phone to have MP3 music capabilities[28] in the U.S. market. The innovation spread rapidly across the globe and by 2005, more than half of all music sold in South Korea was sold directly to mobile phones and all major handset makers in the world had released MP3 playing phones. By 2006, more MP3 playing mobile phones were sold than all stand-alone MP3 players put together. The rapid rise of the media player in phones was quoted by Apple as a primary reason for developing the iPhone. In 2007, the installed base of phones that could play media was over 1 billion.[citation needed]",
