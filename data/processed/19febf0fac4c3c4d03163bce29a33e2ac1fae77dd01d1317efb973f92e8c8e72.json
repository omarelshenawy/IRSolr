Most hypothetical constructions rely on the fact that hydrogen bombs can be made arbitrarily large assuming there are no concerns about delivering them to a target (see TellerâUlam design) or that they can be \"salted\" with materials designed to create long-lasting and hazardous fallout (e.g., a cobalt bomb).",
