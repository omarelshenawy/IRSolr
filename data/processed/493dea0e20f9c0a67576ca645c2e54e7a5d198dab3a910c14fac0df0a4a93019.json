The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotiaâhardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.[20]",
