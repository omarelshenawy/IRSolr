				"previous": "Western jackdaws practice active food sharingÂ â where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donorÂ â with a number of individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food.[76] The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it has been found to be detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.[77]",
