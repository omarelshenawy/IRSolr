When Martin Martin visited the islands in 1697,[15] the only means of making the journey was by open boat, which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the ocean and was next to impossible in autumn and winter. In all seasons, waves up to 12 metres (39Â ft) high lash the beach of Village Bay, and even on calmer days landing on the slippery rocks can be hazardous.",
