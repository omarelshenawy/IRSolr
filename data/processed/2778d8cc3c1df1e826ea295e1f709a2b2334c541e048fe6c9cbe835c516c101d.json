				"previous": "Some authors allow to be the zero vector in the definition of eigenvector.[20] This is reasonable as long as we define eigenvalues and eigenvectors carefully: If we would like the zero vector to be an eigenvector, then we must first define an eigenvalue of as a scalar in such that there is a nonzero vector in with . We then define an eigenvector to be a vector in such that there is an eigenvalue in with . This way, we ensure that it is not the case that every scalar is an eigenvalue corresponding to the zero vector.",
				"after": "If is an eigenvector of , with eigenvalue , then any scalar multiple of with nonzero is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue , since . Moreover, if and are eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue and , then is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue . Therefore, the set of all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue , together with the zero vector, is a linear subspace of , called the eigenspace of associated to .[21][22][23] If that subspace has dimension 1, it is sometimes called an eigenline.[24]",
