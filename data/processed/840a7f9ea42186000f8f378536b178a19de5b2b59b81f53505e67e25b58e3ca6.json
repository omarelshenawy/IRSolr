				"after": "Light tanks, such as the PT-76, continue to play a small role in tank warfare, although many are losing favor to cheaper, faster, lighter armored cars. The light tank still fills an important niche in many armies, especially for nations with airborne divisions, or those without the resources and funding for main battle tanks. They have important advantages over heavier tanks in Southeast Asia and other nations in the Equatorial region. Their size lets them maneuver through thick rain forests, and their weight reduces the risk of getting stuck in mud. This makes the light tank the preferred choice for infantry support in Equatorial nations. PostâCold War light tanks include the Stingray light tank and the M8 AGS, and light tanks based on infantry fighting vehicles such as the CV90120T, 2S25 Sprut-SD and ASCOD LT 105. With recent trends towards lighter and smaller combat vehicles achieving multiple roles, some nations have begun experimenting with lighter tanks as is the case with Poland's PL-01.",
