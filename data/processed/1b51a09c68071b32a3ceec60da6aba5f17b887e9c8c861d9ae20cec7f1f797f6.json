Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it.[17] However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at Â£1.75 million (today Â£3.11Â million), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling.[18] Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act made it a legal requirement that the finder and the landowner should be rewarded equally.[19]",
