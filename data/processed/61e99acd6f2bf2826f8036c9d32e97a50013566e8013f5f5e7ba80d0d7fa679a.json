				"after": "Bacteria have developed ways to survive inside phagocytes, where they continue to evade the immune system.[108] To get safely inside the phagocyte they express proteins called \"invasins\". When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes.[109] Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome, to form the phagolysosome.[100] Other pathogens, such as Leishmania, create a highly modified vacuole inside the phagocyte, which helps them persist and replicate.[110] Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome. Staphylococcus aureus, for example, produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which break down chemicalsâsuch as hydrogen peroxideâproduced by phagocytes to kill bacteria.[111] Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before the formation of the phagolysosome: Listeria monocytogenes can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called listeriolysin O and phospholipase C.[112]",
