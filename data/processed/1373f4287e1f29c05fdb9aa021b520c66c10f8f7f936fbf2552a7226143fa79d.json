				"after": "Sire Records had marketed the \"Everybody\" single as if Madonna was a black artist. This misconception was cleared by the release of the music video for the song.[14] Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, \"If I didn't have a video, I don't think all the kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That really has a lot to do with the success of my album.\"[24] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed \"Everybody\" on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails.[14] On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.'[25] Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of \"Everybody\" to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.[14]",
