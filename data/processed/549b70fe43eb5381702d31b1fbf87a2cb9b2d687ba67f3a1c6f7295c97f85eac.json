				"previous": "In 2000, Biman put out a request for proposal for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DCâ10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government.[152] A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted for the purchase of ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1Â billion.[153] Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled.[149] A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed.[154] In MarchÂ 2007Â (2007-03), Biman put out a tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years.[155] The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[156]",
				"after": "After Biman became a public limited company, renewed attempts were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009.[citation needed] The average price of these aircraft was quoted as US$165Â million.[citation needed] Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing.[citation needed] To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.[157]",
