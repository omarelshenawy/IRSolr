Guillaume de Syon, a history professor at Albright College who wrote about the history of airline meals,[14] said that the higher altitudes alter the taste of the food and the function of the taste buds; according to de Syon the food may taste \"dry and flavorless\" as a result of the pressurization and passengers, feeling thirsty due to pressurization, many drink alcohol when they ought to drink water.[15] Tests have shown that the perception of saltiness and sweetness drops 30% at high altitudes. The low humidity in airline cabins also dries out the nose which decreases olfactory sensors which are essential for tasting flavor in dishes. [16]",
