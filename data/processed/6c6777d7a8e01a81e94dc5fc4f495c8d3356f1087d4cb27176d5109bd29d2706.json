				"Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.",
				"Beginning with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty and continuing through the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there have been many treaties to limit or reduce nuclear weapons testing and stockpiles. The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has as one of its explicit conditions that all signatories must \"pursue negotiations in good faith\" towards the long-term goal of \"complete disarmament\". The nuclear weapon states have largely treated that aspect of the agreement as \"decorative\" and without force.[33]"
