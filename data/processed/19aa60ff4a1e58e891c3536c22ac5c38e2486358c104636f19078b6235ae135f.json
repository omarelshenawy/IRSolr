Kapoor attended the celebration, while local jazz trumpeter and bandleader Orbert Davis and the Chicago Jazz Philharmonic played \"Fanfare for Cloud Gate\", which Davis composed.[43] The public took an instant liking to the sculpture, affectionately referring to it as \"The Bean\".[44] Cloud Gate has become a popular piece of public art[8][45] and is now a fixture on many souvenirs such as postcards, sweatshirts, and posters.[46] The sculpture has attracted a large number of locals, tourists, and art aficionados from around the world.[47] The sculpture is now the piece by which Kapoor is most identified in the United States.[48]",
