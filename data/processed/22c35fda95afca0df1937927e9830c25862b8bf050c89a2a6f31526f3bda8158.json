				"after": "John H. Watson, (pictured holding newspaper) known as Dr. Watson, often abbreviated to Watson, is a fictional character in the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Watson is Sherlock Holmes' friend, partner, sometime flatmate, and the first person narrator in all but four of these stories. In Conan Doyle's drafts, Watson was called 'Ormond Sacker', though this was changed to Watson. In his fictional chronology, he serves in the British Army in Afghanistan; but was sent back to England after being shot. He met Holmes in A Study in Scarlet, introduced by a mutual friend named Stamford. Watson is impressed by Holmes's deductions. They solve several cases together, until in The Sign of the Four, he marries Mary Morstan, who later dies. He has been portrayed by several characters, in film, television, radio, and in video games; actors who have portrayed him include Nigel Bruce, Vitaly Solomin, Sir Ralph Richardson, and Martin Freeman. Although Watson is typically a foil for Holmes's great intellect, and is seen as a architypical Edwardian or late Victorian character, unofficial novels written to follow on chronologically from the Holmes series usually have Watson as narrator, but occasionally have him solving cases.",
