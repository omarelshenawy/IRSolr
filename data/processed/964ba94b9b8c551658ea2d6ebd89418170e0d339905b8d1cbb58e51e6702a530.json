The former coal bunkers, along with some of the space freed up by the decrease in boilers, were converted to hold 588,120 litres (155,360Â USÂ gal) of oil.[3] These modifications resulted in Bahiaââ'âs top speed increasing to 28 knots (52Â km/h).[1] All of the boats on board were replaced, and three 20Â mm (0.79Â in) Madsen guns, a 7Â mm (0.28Â in) Hotchkiss machine gun, and four 533Â mm (21.0Â in) torpedo tubes were added to give the ship a defense against aircraft and more power against surface ships, respectively.[3] Still, in 1930 The New York Times labeled Bahia and the other warships in Brazil's navy as \"obsolete\" and noted that nearly all were \"older than the ages considered effective by powers signatory to the Washington and London Naval Treaties.\"[22]",
