				"previous": "The American Kennel Club recognizes two separate varieties of Beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than 13 inches (33Â cm), and the 15-inch for those between 13 and 15 inches (33 and 38Â cm). The Canadian Kennel Club recognizes a single type, with a height not exceeding 15 inches (38Â cm). The Kennel Club (UK) and FCI affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41Â cm).",
				"after": "English and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. Beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard â which disallows animals over 15 inches (38Â cm) â are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to 16 inches (41Â cm).",
