				"previous": "The airline was established as a company in 1998 and gained its Air Operators Certificate in 2000 commencing operations in October of that year. It launched services from Amman as the first privately owned charter airline in Jordan. Jordan Aviation operates a varied route network with a worldwide AOC. UN Peacekeepers are carried extensively on the various aircraft in the Fleet and the company also is involved in \"wet-leasing\" aircraft to air carriers who need extra capacity. Holiday Charter Flights are also operated from its bases in Amman. Jordan Aviation is owned by Mohamed Al-Khashman (President & Chief Executive Officer) and Hazem Alrasekh, and has over 900 employees (as at June 2012). The company has grown considerably, as the fleet listing below shows. An Airbus A330-200 joined the fleet in March 2012 and this will be followed with additional aircraft planned to enter service in the next quarter â an Airbus A320-200 and a Boeing 737â300. Expansion into other market segments is in process.",
