				"previous": "The demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime,[167] as well as the appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics.[168] Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.[169]",
				"after": "Attempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, so as to include gravity have led to serious problems. At low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity.[170] At very high energies, however, the result are models devoid of all predictive power (\"non-renormalizability\").[171]",
