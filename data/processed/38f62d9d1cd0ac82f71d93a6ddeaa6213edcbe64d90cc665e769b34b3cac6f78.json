				"after": "In 1576, Catherine decided to enlarge her chÃ¢teau of Chenonceau, near Blois. On Henry II's death, she had demanded this property from Henry's mistress Diane de Poitiers. She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane instead of to her.[78] In return, she gave Diane the less prized Chaumont.[63] When Diane arrived at Chaumont, she found signs of the occult, such as pentangles drawn on the floor. She quickly withdrew to her chÃ¢teau of Anet and never set foot in Chaumont again.[79]",
