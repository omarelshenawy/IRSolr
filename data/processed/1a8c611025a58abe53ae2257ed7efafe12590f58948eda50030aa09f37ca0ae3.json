				"previous": "Subfossils show that the males were larger, measuring 55â65Â cm (22.6â25.5Â in) to the females' 45â55Â cm (18.7â22.6Â in) and that both sexes had disproportionately large heads and beaks. The sexual dimorphism in size between male and female skulls is the largest among parrots.[5] Differences in the bones of the rest of the body and limbs are less pronounced; nevertheless, it had greater sexual dimorphism in overall size than any living parrot. The size differences between the two birds in the 1601 sketch may be due to this feature.[16] A 1602 account by Reyer Cornelisz has traditionally been interpreted as the only contemporary mention of size differences among broad-billed parrots, listing \"large and small Indian crows\" among the animals of the island. A full transcript of the original text was only published in 2003, and showed that a comma had been incorrectly placed in the English translation; \"large and small\" instead referred to \"field-hens\", possibly the red rail and the smaller Sauzier's wood rail.[17]",
				"after": "There has been some confusion over the colouration of the broad-billed parrot.[18] The report of van Neck's 1598 voyage, published in 1601, contained the first illustration of the parrot, with a caption stating that the bird had \"two or three colours\".[3] The last account of the bird, and the only mention of specific colours, was by Johann Christian Hoffman in 1673â75:",
