				"after": "The hall, like the chapel, was largely built by Griffith Powell between 1613 and 1620, and was finally completed soon after his death in 1620.[31] The panelling, three tables and two benches date from Powell's time.[102] It measures 54 by 25 feet (16.5 by 7.6Â m) and is a Grade I listed building.[57][66] The fireplace was set in an enclosed hearth with a large projecting chimney-breast, in contrast to the traditional method of heating the hall, which was by a brazier on an open hearth.[103] A screen was installed in 1634 at a cost of Â£3 1s.[n 14][29] Pevsner noted the screen's \"elaborately decorated columns\" and the dragons along the frieze, and said that it was one of the earliest examples in Oxford of panelling using four \"L\" shapes around a centre.[74][91] Norwich said that the dragons on the screen were \"rather lovable\",[5] and Tyack said that they underlined the Welsh connections of the college:[94] the red dragon is one of the national symbols of Wales. The stone steps from the first quadrangle to the hall were added in 1637.[29] During the 17th century, changes were made to the interior of the hall. Windows painted with various coats of arms were removed and a bay window was added on the west side.[38] Pevsner commented that \"the hall windows themselves are different from all other 17th-century Gothic windows in Oxford except for the exactly contemporary hall bay-window of Exeter\".[3]",
