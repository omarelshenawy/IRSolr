				"after": "Mujeres Libres (English: Free Women) was an anarchist women's organization in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by LucÃ­a SÃ¡nchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y GascÃ³n and had approximately 30,000 members. The organization was based on the idea of a \"double struggle\" for women's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. Flying day-care centres were set up in efforts to involve more women in union activities.[28]",
