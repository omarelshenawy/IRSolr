				"previous": "On 13 September 2013 a ceremony was held at the Embraer factory in SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos to mark the delivery of the 1,000th E-jet family aircraft, an E-175, to Republic Airlines. The E-175 was delivered in an American Eagle colour scheme with a special \"1,000th E-Jet\" decal above the cabin windows.[28][32]",
				"after": "The E-170/E-175 models in the 80-seat range are the smaller in the E-Jet family. They are powered with General Electric CF34-8E engines of 14,200 pounds (62.28Â kN) thrust each. The E-170 and E-175 directly compete with the Bombardier CRJ-700 and Bombardier CRJ-900, respectively, and loosely compete with the turboprop Bombardier Q400. They also seek to replace the market segment occupied by earlier competing designs such as the BAe 146 and Fokker 70.",
