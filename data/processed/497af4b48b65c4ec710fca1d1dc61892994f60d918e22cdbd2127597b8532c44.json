				"previous": "In response to a decline in A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the Boeing 767-300ER, and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the Airbus A330-200.[55] Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER.[56] The plane was aimed at the 11,900Â km (6,400Â nmi) sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015.[56] The project, with US$450Â million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995.[56]",
				"after": "The A330-200 first flew on 13 August 1997.[57] The sixteen-month certification process involved logging 630 hours of test flights.[57] The A330-200's first customer was ILFC; these aircraft were leased by Canada 3000, who became the type's first operator.[58]",
