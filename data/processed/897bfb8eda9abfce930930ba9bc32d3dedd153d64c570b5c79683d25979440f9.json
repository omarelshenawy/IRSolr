Boeing bought Heath's shipyard in Seattle on the Duwamish River, which later became his first airplane factory.[10] Boeing was incorporated in Seattle by William Boeing, on July 15, 1916, as \"Pacific Aero Products Co\". Boeing was later incorporated in Delaware, the original Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on July 19, 1934. Boeing, who studied at Yale University, worked initially in the timber industry, where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures. This knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes. The company stayed in Seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood.[11]",
