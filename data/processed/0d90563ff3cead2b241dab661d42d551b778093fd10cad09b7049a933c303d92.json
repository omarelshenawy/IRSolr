In eastern Asia, a number of additional or alternative forms have been proposed, including saturata by Robert Ridgway in 1883,[12] kamtschatica by Benedykt Dybowski in 1883,[13] ambigua by Erwin Stresemann[14] and mandschurica by Wilhelm Meise in 1934.[12] Given the uncertainties over the validity of these forms,[13][15] this article follows the treatment of Turner and Rose.[2]",
