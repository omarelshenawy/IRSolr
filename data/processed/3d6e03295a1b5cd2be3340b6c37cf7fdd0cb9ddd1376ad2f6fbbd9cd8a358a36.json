				"after": "This secluded runestone is located in a grove near VÃ¤sby, Uppland, Sweden. It was raised by a Viking in commemoration of his receiving one danegeld in England. It is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3 and, together with U 344, it has been said to be the earliest example of an Urnes style inscription in Uppland.[5] The runic text follows a common rule to only carve a single rune for two consecutive letters, even when the letters were at the end of one word and the beginning of a second word.[6] When the text shown as Latin characters, the transliterated runes are doubled and separate words are shown. For U 194 has three examples where this occurred, Ã¾inoftiR is transliterated as Ã¾ino| |oftiR, tuknuts as tuk| |knuts, and anklanti as a| |anklanti.",
