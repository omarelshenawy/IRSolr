				"previous": "On May 2, 1706, the county justices noted that while no particular act of maleficium had been alleged against Sherwood, there was \"great cause of suspicion\".[41] Consequently, the Sheriff of Princess Anne County took Sherwood into custody, though Sherwood could give bond for her appearance and good behavior.[38] Maximilian Boush, a warden of Lynnhaven Parish Church, was the prosecutor in Sherwood's case.[1] On July 5, 1706, the justices ordered a trial by ducking to take place, with Sherwood's consent,[42] but heavy rains caused a postponement until July 10, as they feared the wet weather might harm her health.[43] Sherwood was taken inside Lynnhaven Parish Church, placed on a stool and ordered to ask for forgiveness for her witchery.[38] She replied, \"I be not a witch, I be a healer.\"[1]",
				"after": "At about 10Â a.m. on July 10, 1706, Sherwood was taken down a dirt lane now known as Witchduck Road,[13][44] to a plantation near the mouth of the Lynnhaven River.[38][45] News had spread, and the event attracted people from all over the colony,[1] who began to shout \"Duck the witch!\"[13] According to the principles of trial by water, if Sherwood floated she would be deemed guilty of witchcraft; if she did not, she would be innocent. It was not intended that Sherwood drown; the court had ordered that care be taken to preserve her life.[29]",
