				"after": "The diverse ethno-linguistic groups of Tripura have given rise to a composite culture.[120][121] The dominant ethnic groups are Bengali, Manipuri, Debbarma, Tripura, Jamatia, Reang, Noatia, Koloi, Murasing, Chakma, Halam, Garo, Kuki, Mizo, Mogh, Munda, Oraon, Santhal, and Uchoi.[110] Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguist community of the state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main non-indigenous culture. Indeed many elite tribal families which reside in towns have actively embraced Bengali culture and language.[122] The Tripuri kings were great patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature;[122] Bengali language was the language of the court.[123] Elements of Bengali culture, such as Bengali literature, Bengali music, and Bengali cuisine are widespread, particularly in the urban areas of the state.[116]:110[122][124]",
