Burrows help prairie dogs control their body temperature (Thermoregulation) as they are 5â10Â Â°C during the winter and 15â25Â Â°C in the summer. Prairie dog tunnel systems channel rainwater into the water table which prevents runoff and erosion, and can also change the composition of the soil in a region by reversing soil compaction that can result from cattle grazing.",
