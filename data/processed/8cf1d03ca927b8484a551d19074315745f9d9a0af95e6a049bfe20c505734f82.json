				"previous": "Known as the \"Oil Capital of the World\" for most of the 20th century, the city's success in the energy industry prompted construction booms in the popular Art Deco style of the time.[8] Profits from the oil industry continued through the Great Depression, helping the city's economy fare better than most in the United States during the 1930s.[23]",
				"after": "In the early 20th century, Tulsa was home to the \"Black Wall Street\", one of the most prosperous African American communities in the United States at the time.[25] Located in the Greenwood neighborhood, it was the site of the Tulsa Race Riot, one of the nation's worst acts of racial violence and civil disorder, with whites attacking blacks.[25] Sixteen hours of rioting on May 31 and June 1, 1921, was only ended when National Guardsmen were brought in by the Governor. An official report later claimed that 23 black and 16 white citizens were killed, but other estimates suggest as many as 300 people died, most of them black.[25] Over 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, and an estimated 10,000 people were left homeless as 35 city blocks, composed of 1,256 residences, were destroyed by fire. Property damage was estimated at $1.8 million.[25] Efforts to obtain reparations for survivors of the violence have been unsuccessful but the city and state re-examined the events in the early 21st century, acknowledging the terrible actions that had taken place.[26]",
