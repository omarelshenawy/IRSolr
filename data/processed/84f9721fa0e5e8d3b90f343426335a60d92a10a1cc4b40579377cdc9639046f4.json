				"after": "Acacia pycnantha generally grows as a small tree to between 3 and 8 m (10â25Â ft) in height,[2] though trees of up to 12Â m (40Â ft) high have been reported in Morocco.[3] The bark is generally dark brown to greyâsmooth in younger plants though it can be furrowed and rough in older plants.[4] Branchlets may be bare and smooth or covered with a white bloom.[2] The mature trees do not have true leaves but have phyllodesâflat and widened leaf stemsâthat hang down from the branches. Shiny and dark green, these are between 9 and 15Â cm (3.5â9Â in) long, 1â3.5Â cm (1â2â1Â 1â2Â in) wide and falcate (sickle-shaped) to oblanceolate in shape.[2] New growth has a bronze coloration.[5] Field observations at Hale Conservation Park show the bulk of new growth to take place over spring and summer from October to January.[6]",
