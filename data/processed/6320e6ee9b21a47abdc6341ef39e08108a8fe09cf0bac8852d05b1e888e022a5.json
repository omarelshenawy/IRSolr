				"previous": "Urban areas and districts of the town Poole is made up of numerous suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Poole as the town grew. Alderney â Bearwood â Branksome â Branksome Park â Broadstone â Canford Cliffs â Canford Heath â Creekmoor â Fleetsbridge â Hamworthy â Lilliput â Longfleet â Merley â Newtown â Oakdale â Parkstone â Penn Hill â Sandbanks â Sterte â Talbot Village â Wallisdown â Waterloo â Whitecliff",
				"after": "The natural environment of Poole is characterised by lowland heathland to the north and wooded chines and coastline to the south. The heathland habitat supports the six native British reptile species and provides a home for a range of dragonflies and rare birds. Development has destroyed much of the heath but scattered fragments remain to the north of Poole and have been designated Special Protection Areas. The town lies on unresistant beds of Eocene clays (mainly London Clay and Gault Clay), sands and gravels.[36] The River Frome runs through this weak rock, and its many tributaries have carved out a wide estuary. At the mouth of the estuary sand spits have been deposited, enclosing the estuary to create Poole Harbour.[37]",
