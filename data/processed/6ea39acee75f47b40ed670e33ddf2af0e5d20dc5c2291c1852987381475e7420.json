				"after": "By the 1400s the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland.[69] At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments.[63] The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.[70]",
