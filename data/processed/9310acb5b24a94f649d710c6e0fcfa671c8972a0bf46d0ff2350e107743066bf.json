He killed the Western Roman Emperor Gratian and ruled Gaul and Britain as Augustus (i.e., as a \"sub-emperor\" under Theodosius I). 383 is the last date for any evidence of a Roman presence in the north and west of Britain,[3] perhaps excepting troop assignments at the tower on Holyhead Mountain in Anglesey and at western coastal posts such as Lancaster. These outposts may have lasted into the 390s, but they were a very minor presence.[4]",
