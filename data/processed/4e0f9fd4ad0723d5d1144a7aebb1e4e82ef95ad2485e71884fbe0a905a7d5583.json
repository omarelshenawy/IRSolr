				"after": "The earliest known botanical collection of B.Â sphaerocarpa occurred in December 1801, during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound. The specimen was collected from \"A single plant observed between Princess Royal Harbour & Oyster Harbour on a heath\",[6] and is credited to English botanist Robert Brown, though it is not possible to be certain on this point, as Brown incorporated the collections of junior expedition members into his herbarium without attribution. Neither Brown nor expedition horticulturist Peter Good mentions the collection in his diary.[7][8]",
