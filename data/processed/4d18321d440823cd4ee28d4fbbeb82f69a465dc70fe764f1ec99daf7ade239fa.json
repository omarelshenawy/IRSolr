The San people of southern Africa have medicine dances named after some animals; the giraffe dance is performed to treat head ailments.[69] How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales,[12] including one from eastern Africa which explains that the giraffe grew tall from eating too many magic herbs.[70] Giraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent, including that of the Kiffians, Egyptians and MeroÃ« Nubians.[32]:45â47 The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes that has been called the \"world's largest rock art petroglyph\".[32]:45[71] The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own hieroglyph, named 'sr' in Old Egyptian and 'mmy' in later periods.[32]:49 They also kept giraffes as pets and shipped them around the Mediterranean.[32]:48â49",
