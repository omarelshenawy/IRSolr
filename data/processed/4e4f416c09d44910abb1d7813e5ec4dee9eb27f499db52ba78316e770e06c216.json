				"previous": "Commercial harvesting of painted turtles in the wild is controversial and, increasingly, restricted.[186][187] Wisconsin formerly had virtually unrestricted trapping of painted turtles but based on qualitative observations forbade all commercial harvesting in 1997.[188] Neighboring Minnesota, where trappers collected more than 300,000Â painted turtles during the 1990s,[156] commissioned a study of painted turtle harvesting.[182] Scientists found that harvested lakes averaged half the painted turtle density of off-limit lakes, and population modeling suggested that unrestricted harvests could produce a large decline in turtle populations.[162] In response, Minnesota forbade new harvesters in 2002 and limited trap numbers. Although harvesting continued,[162] subsequent takes averaged half those of the 1990s.[189] As of 2009, painted turtles faced virtually unlimited harvesting in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma;[190] since then, Missouri has prohibited their harvesting.[191]",
				"after": "Individuals who trap painted turtles typically do so to earn additional income,[162][186] selling a few thousand a year at $1â2 each.[182] Many trappers have been involved in the trade for generations, and value it as a family activity.[188] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch, saying the populations are not dropping.[188]",
