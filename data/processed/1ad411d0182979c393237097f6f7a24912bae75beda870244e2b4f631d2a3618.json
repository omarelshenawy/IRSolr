				"after": "Overnight, thousands of protesters continued to defy the curfew and, as the night progressed, troops and armoured vehicles deployed across Cairo to guard key places such as train stations, major government buildings and banks. The army had insufficient capacity to patrol neighbourhoods, so residents set up armed vigilante groups to drive off looters and robbers.[65] A heavy army presence (though no police) was reported in Suez. Chaos was rampant in Suez during the night, but as day broke the streets remained relatively quiet. As in Cairo, many residents formed vigilante groups to protect their homes and businesses in the absence of police. The military set up numerous checkpoints throughout the city.[66] An estimation of about 30 bodies including the bodies of two children were taken to El Demerdash Hospital in central Cairo.[67] By 6:00Â am local time, Tahrir Square was quiet, with only a few hundred people.[52] Later in the morning, 3â5,000 protesters were reported as gathering there, including hundreds of state judges protesting for the first time.[52][68][69]",
