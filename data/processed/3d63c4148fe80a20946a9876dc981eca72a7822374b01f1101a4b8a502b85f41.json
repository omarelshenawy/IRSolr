				"previous": "The 172E was the 1964 model. The electrical fuses were replaced with circuit breakers. Gross weight was increased to 2,300Â lb (1,043Â kg) where it would stay until the 172P. The 172E also featured a redesigned instrument panel. 1,401 172Es were built that year as production continued to increase.[14]",
				"after": "The 1965 model 172F introduced electrically operated flaps to replace the previous lever-operated system.[9] It was built in France by Reims Cessna as the F172 until 1971. These models formed the basis for the U.S. Air Force's T-41A Mescalero primary trainer, which was used during the 1960s and early 1970s as initial flight screening aircraft in USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT). Following their removal from the UPT program, some extant USAF T-41s were assigned to the U.S. Air Force Academy for the cadet pilot indoctrination program, while others were distributed to Air Force aero clubs.[17]",
