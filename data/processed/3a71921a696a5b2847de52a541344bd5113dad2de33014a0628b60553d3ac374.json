				"after": "Giraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa.[10]:337 Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes.[14] Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread.[10]:337[14] Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons.[14] The smoke from burning giraffe skins was used by the medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds.[10]:337 The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr.[75][76] In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport.[32]:129 Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them.[17]",
