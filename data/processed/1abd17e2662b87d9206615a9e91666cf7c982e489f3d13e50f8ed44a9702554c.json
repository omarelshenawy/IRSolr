				"after": "The English enlightenment political theorist William Godwin was an important influence as mentioned before.[36] The Irish anarchist writer of the Decadent movement Oscar Wilde influenced individualist anarchists such as Renzo Novatore[243] and gained the admiration of Benjamin Tucker.[244] In his important essay The Soul of Man under Socialism from 1891 Wilde defended socialism as the way to guarantee individualism and so he saw that \"With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.\"[245] For anarchist historian George Woodcock \"Wilde's aim in The Soul of Man under Socialism is to seek the society most favorable to the artistÂ ... for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinatedÂ ... Wilde represents the anarchist as aesthete.\"[246] Woodcock finds that \"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde The Soul of Man under Socialism\" and finds that it is influenced mainly by the thought of William Godwin.[246]",
