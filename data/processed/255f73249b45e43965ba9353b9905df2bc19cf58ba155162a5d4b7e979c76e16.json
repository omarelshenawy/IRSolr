				"after": "Ecology, also referred to as ecological science, is the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of living organisms and how the distribution and abundance are affected by interactions between the organisms and their environment. The environment of an organism includes both physical properties, which can be described as the sum of local abiotic factors such as solar insolation, climate and geology, as well as the other organisms that share its habitat. The term Ãkologie was coined in 1866 by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel; the word is derived from the Greek Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï (oikos, \"household\") and Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï (logos, \"study\"); therefore \"ecology\" means the \"study of the household (of nature)\".",
