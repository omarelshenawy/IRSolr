				"previous": "In January 2013, CNET named Dish Network's \"Hopper with Sling\" digital video recorder as a nominee for the CES \"Best in Show\" award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers, the Consumer Electronics Association), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, CBS division CBS Interactive disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results as CBS was in active litigation with Dish Network over its AutoHop technology (which allows users to skip commercial advertisements during recorded programs).[170] CNET announced that it would no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS Corporation was in litigation with. The \"Best in Show\" award was instead given to the Razer Edge tablet.[171][172][173] On January 14, 2013, CNET editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine said in a statement that its staff was in an \"impossible\" situation due to the conflict of interest posed by the lawsuit, and promised to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted the resignation of CNET senior writer Greg Sandoval.[172] As a result of the controversy, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013 that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (with the position being offered to other technology publications), and the \"Best in Show\" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.[173][174]",
