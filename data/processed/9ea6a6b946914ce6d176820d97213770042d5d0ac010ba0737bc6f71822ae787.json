The peninsula lies on the eastern boundary of Melville Cove in the Northwest Arm, an inlet between the Halifax Peninsula and Mainland Halifax.[1][2] It has a total area of approximately 2,000 square metres (22,000Â sqÂ ft).[3] Melville Island is 200 metres (660Â ft) west of Deadman's Island, and southeast of Regatta Point.[4] The peninsula lies on a fracture zone trending northwestâsoutheast, and is located at the border between the Halifax Slate Formation and a granite-based formation. There is evidence of glacial scouring in the area. The surrounding seabed ranges from gravel to muddy gravel, and the shore is rocky.[2]",
