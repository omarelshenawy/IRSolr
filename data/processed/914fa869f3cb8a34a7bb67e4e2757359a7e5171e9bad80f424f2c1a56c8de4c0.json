				"after": "To prepare for Tu-142 operations, on 22 June 1960 the Soviet Navy began selecting personnel for conversion training.[15] The first group began its three-month training period on 4 March 1970 at the seaside town of Nikolayev (since renamed Mykolaiv).[15] Meanwhile, the first Tu-142s were delivered to the Northern Fleet at Kipelovo AB, where they were initially tasked with tracking and monitoring nuclear-powered submarines as part of the type's operational trials. Throughout the test programme, effort focused on the verification of the ASW avionics, notably the Berkut-95 radar, as the airframe itself was not a major concern.[27] The Tu-142 reached initial operational capability in December 1972 after a successful flight-test programme.[1] Prior to that, in December 1971, the second group selected for Tu-142 operations started its own conversion training.[15] Deliveries of the aircraft at first proceeded slowly; as more Tu-142s were produced, the type was allocated to the Pacific Fleet.[14]",
