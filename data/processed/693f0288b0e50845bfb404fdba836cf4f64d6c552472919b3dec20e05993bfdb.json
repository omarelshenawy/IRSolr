				"previous": "Taquan Air is one of several local services to provide air tours of the nearby Misty Fjords National Monument. These flights are associated with the cruise line industry that brings close to a million tourists each Summer to Ketchikan with its 7,000 residents.[49] Adventure guide Inside Passage and Coastal Alaska states, \"One of the amazing things about floatplanes is just how smooth <takeoffs> are...unless you're looking out the window and see that there isn't a wake from the floats anymore, it's hard to know you're even in the air.\" The air tour typically takes two to four hours. The tour goes from seashore up into the mountains and back, during which time the floatplane lands on water in a remote area, and tourists step out on the plane's pontoon.[50]",
				"after": "The Taquan Air fleet consists of one Cessna Caravan and eight de Havilland DHC-2 Beavers[51][52] certified under FAR part 135 (Air Taxi Operators and Commercial Operators of Small Aircraft).",
