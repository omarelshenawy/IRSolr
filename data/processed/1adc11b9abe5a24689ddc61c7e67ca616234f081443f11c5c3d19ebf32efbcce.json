				"previous": "The coefficient which corresponds to a particular state in the linear combination is complex thus allowing interference effects between states. The coefficients are time dependent. How a quantum system changes in time is governed by the time evolution operator. The symbols \"|\" and \"â©\"[4] surrounding the are part of braâket notation.",
