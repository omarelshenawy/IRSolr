				"previous": "During the Permian period synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, may have dominated land environments,[71] but the PermianâTriassic extinction event 251 million years ago came very close to wiping out complex life.[72] The extinctions were apparently fairly sudden, at least among vertebrates.[73] During the slow recovery from this catastrophe a previously obscure group, archosaurs, became the most abundant and diverse terrestrial vertebrates. One archosaur group, the dinosaurs, were the dominant land vertebrates for the rest of the Mesozoic,[74] and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs.[70] During this time mammals' ancestors survived only as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores, but this apparent set-back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair.[75] After the CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event 65 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaursÂ â birds are the only surviving dinosaursÂ â mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity, and some took to the air and the sea.[76][77][78]",
				"after": "Fossil evidence indicates that flowering plants appeared and rapidly diversified in the Early Cretaceous, between 130 million years ago and 90 million years ago.[79] Their rapid rise to dominance of terrestrial ecosystems is thought to have been propelled by coevolution with pollinating insects.[80] Social insects appeared around the same time and, although they account for only small parts of the insect \"family tree\", now form over 50% of the total mass of all insects.[81]",
