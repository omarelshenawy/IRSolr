At the time, apothecaries' weights and measures were regulated \"in England, Wales, and Berwick-upon-Tweed\" by the London College of Physicians, and in Ireland by the Dublin College of Physicians. In Scotland, apothecaries' units were unofficially regulated by the Edinburgh College of Physicians. The three colleges published, at infrequent intervals, pharmacopoeiae, the London and Dublin editions having the force of law.[4][5]",
