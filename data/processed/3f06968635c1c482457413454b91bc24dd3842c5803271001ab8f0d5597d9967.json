				"after": "With the Han conquest of the Hexi Corridor in 121 BC, the city-states at the Tarim Basin were caught in between the onslaught of the war, with much shifting of allegiance.[56] There were several Han military expeditions undertaken to secure the submission of the local kings to the Han empire; the Han took control of the regions for strategic purposes while the Xiongnu needed the regions as a source of revenue.[56][57] Due to the ensuing war with the Han empire, the Xiongnu were forced to extract more crafts and agricultural foodstuffs from the Tarim Basin urban centers.[58] By 115 BC, the Han had set up commanderies at Jiuquan and Wuwei, while extending the old Qin fortifications from Lingju to the area west of Dunhuang.[20] From 115 to 60 BC, the Han and Xiongnu competed for control and influence over these states,[59] which saw the rise of power of the Han empire over eastern Central Asia with the decline of that of the Xiongnu's.[60] The Han empire brought the states of Loulan, Jushi (Turfan), Luntai (BÃ¼gÃ¼r), Dayuan (Ferghana), and Kangju (Soghdiana) into tributary submission between 108 to 101 BC.[61][62] The long-walled defense line that now stretched all the way to Dunhuang protected the people, guided caravans and troops to and from Central Asia, and served to separate the Xiongnu from their allies, the Qiang people.[63]",
