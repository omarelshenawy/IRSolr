				"previous": "Thatcher's antipathy towards European integration became more pronounced during her premiership, particularly after her third election victory in 1987. During a 1988 speech in Bruges she outlined her opposition to proposals from the European Community (EC), forerunner of the European Union, for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision making.[173] Thatcher and her party had supported British membership of the EC in the 1975 national referendum,[174] but she believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC's approach was at odds with her views on smaller government and deregulation;[175] in 1988, she remarked, \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels\".[175] Thatcher was firmly opposed to the UK's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a precursor to European monetary union, believing that it would constrain the British economy,[176] despite the urging of her Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe,[177] but she was persuaded by John Major to join in October 1990, at what proved to be too high a rate.[178]",
				"after": "In April 1986, Thatcher permitted US F-111s to use Royal Air Force bases for the bombing of Libya in retaliation for the alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothÃ¨que,[179] citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.[180][nb 3] Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of Thatcher's decision.[182] She was in the US on a state visit when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded neighbouring Kuwait in August 1990.[183] During her talks with US President George H. W. Bush, who had succeeded Reagan in 1989, she recommended intervention,[183] and put pressure on Bush to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait.[184] Bush was apprehensive about the plan, prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation that \"This was no time to go wobbly!\"[185] Thatcher's government provided military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991.",
