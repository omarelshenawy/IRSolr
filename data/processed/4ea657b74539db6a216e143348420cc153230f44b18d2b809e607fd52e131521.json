				"previous": "The beef from Highland cattle is very tender. However, the market for high-quality meat has declined. To address this decline, it is common practice to breed Highland 'suckler' cows with a more favourable breed, such as a Shorthorn or Limousin bull. This allows the Highland cattle to produce a cross-bred beef calf that has the tender beef of its mother on a carcass shape of more commercial value at slaughter. These cross-bred beef suckler cows inherit the hardiness, thrift and mothering capabilities of their Highland dams and the improved carcass configuration of their sires. Such cross-bred sucklers can be further cross-bred with a modern beef bull such as a Limousin or Charolais to produce high quality beef.[9][10]",
