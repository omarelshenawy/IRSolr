				"previous": "There were protests in Luxor.[239] On 11 February police opened fire on protesters in Dairut, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Shebin el-Kom, thousands protested in El-Arish on the Sinai Peninsula,[238] large protests took place in the southern cities of Sohag and Minya and nearly 100,000 people protested in and around local-government headquarters in IsmaÃ¯lia.[238] Over 100,000 protesters gathered on 27 January in front of the city council in Zagazig.[240] Bedouins in the Sinai Peninsula fought security forces for several weeks.[241] As a result of the decreased military border presence, Bedouin groups protected the borders and pledged their support of the revolution.[242] However, despite mounting tension among tourists no protests or civil unrest occurred in Sharm-El-Sheikh.[243]",
				"after": "Before the protests six cases of self-immolation were reported, including a man arrested while trying to set himself afire in downtown Cairo.[244] The cases were inspired by (and began one month after) the acts of self-immolation in Tunisia which triggered the Tunisian revolution. The self-immolators included Abdou Abdel-Moneim Jaafar,[245] Mohammed Farouk Hassan,[246] Mohammed Ashour Sorour[247] and Ahmed Hashim al-Sayyed, who later died from his injuries.[248]",
