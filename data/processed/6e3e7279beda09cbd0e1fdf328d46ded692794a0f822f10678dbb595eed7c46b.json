				"previous": "In 2001, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia, a collaboratively edited, multilingual, open-source, free Internet encyclopedia supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. As of December 2014, there are 4,678,709 articles in the English Wikipedia. There are 287 different editions of Wikipedia. As of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.[24] Wikipedia has more than 22 million accounts, out of which there were over 73,000 active editors globally, as of May 2014. Wikipedia's accuracy has been found to be similar to EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica[citation needed], with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics argue Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias[citation needed], and its group dynamics hinder its goals[clarification needed]. Many academics, historians, teachers, and journalists reject Wikipedia as a reliable source of information, primarily for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some falsehoods, and that as a resource about many controversial topics, is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.[25] By far the largest web-based encyclopedia, Wikipedia is not, however, the only one in existence. There are several much smaller, but usually more specialized, encyclopedias of various thematics, dedicated to a specific geographic region or time period.[26]",
