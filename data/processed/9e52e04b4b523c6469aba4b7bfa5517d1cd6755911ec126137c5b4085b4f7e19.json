				"previous": "Early in 1902 Mahler met Alfred Roller, an artist and designer associated with the Vienna Secession movement. A year later, Mahler appointed him chief stage designer to the Hofoper, where Roller's debut was a new production of Tristan und Isolde.[65][n 4] The collaboration between Mahler and Roller created more than 20Â celebrated productions of, among other operas, Beethoven's Fidelio, Gluck's IphigÃ©nie en Aulide and Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro.[63][67] In the Figaro production, Mahler offended some purists by adding and composing a short recitative scene to ActÂ III.[68]",
				"after": "In spite of numerous theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers and the house administration continued on and off for the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike.[69] In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff.[70] The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out.[71] By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave.[67] Early in 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and in June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York.[71] At the end of the summer he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 648th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts,[72] but had won few friendsâit was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals.[73] His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor.[74] After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.[75][76]",
