				"previous": "Imperial troops soon consolidated their hold on mainland Japan, and in April 1869 dispatched a fleet and an infantry force of 7,000 men to Hokkaido. The Imperial forces progressed swiftly, won the Battle of Hakodate, and surrounded the fortress at GoryÅkaku. Enomoto surrendered on June 26, 1869, turning the GoryÅkaku over to Satsuma staff officer Kuroda Kiyotaka on June 27, 1869.[6] Kuroda is said to have been deeply impressed by Enomoto's dedication in combat, and is remembered as the one who spared the latter's life from execution. On September 20 of the same year, the island was given its present name, Hokkaido (\"Northern Sea District\").[6]",
