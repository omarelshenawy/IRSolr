				"previous": "Ornamental (also known as novelty or sometimes display) typefaces are used to decorate a page. Historically floral borders known as fleurons evoking hand-drawn manuscripts were a common type, but others such as pictures of objects and animals are now common. Some may have themes, to evoke the Wild West, Christmas, horror films, etc. See above for the historical definition of display typeface.",
				"after": "Symbol, or dingbat, typefaces consist of symbols (such as decorative bullets, clock faces, railroad timetable symbols, CD-index, or TV-channel enclosed numbers) rather than normal text characters. Common, widely used symbol typeface releases include Zapf Dingbats and Wingdings, though many are created internally by a publication for its own use. Marlett is an example of a font used by Windows to draw elements of windows and icons.",
