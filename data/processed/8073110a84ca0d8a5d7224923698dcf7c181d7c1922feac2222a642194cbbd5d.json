				"previous": "In 1998, Continental Airlines acquired 49% of the airline, marking the beginning of a comprehensive marketing and operating alliance. On May 19, 1999, Continental increased its stake to 51%. Since then, Copa has adopted a livery and corporate logo similar to Continentalâs (now United). Copa participated in the OnePass frequent flyer program until Continentalâs merger with United Airlines. In connection with the initial public offering in December 2005, Continental reduced its stake to approximately 27.3% and through a follow-on offering in 2006, further reduced it to approximately 10%.[1]",
				"after": "In 2000, Copa Airlines inaugurated service to Los Angeles, CancÃºn, and Orlando, as well as to SÃ£o Paulo; in 2001, it began service to Quito, Ecuador.

Copa also announced in August of that year a codeshare agreement with Mexico's Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n, which lasted until 2007.",
