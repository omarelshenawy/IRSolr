				"previous": "One evening, BuÃ±uel and Serge Silberman were discussing uncanny repetition in everyday life when Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house, only to forget about it, so that, on the night of the dinner party, he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes.[219] This became the germ of the idea for their next film together, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, which tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together, a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in The Exterminating Angel, where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal.[158] For this film, BuÃ±uel, Silberman and CarriÃ¨re assembled a top-flight cast of European performers, \"a veritable rogues' gallery of French art-house cinema\", according to one critic.[220] For the first time, BuÃ±uel made use of a video-playback monitor, which allowed him to make much more extensive use of crane shots and elaborate tracking shots, and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for reshoots.[219] Filming required only two months and BuÃ±uel claimed that editing took only one day.[219] When the film was released, Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which it won, leading BuÃ±uel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of, â2500 idiots, including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio.â[219]",
				"after": "As was his habit, BuÃ±uel took advantage of the popular success of Discreet Charm to make one of the \"puzzling, idiosyncratic films he really wanted to make\".[210] In 1973, at the Monastery of Paular in the Spanish Somosierra, he wrote the screenplay for The Phantom of Liberty with CarriÃ¨re for production by Silberman and his Hollywood partners.[109]:p.249 The resulting film is a series of 12 distinctive episodes with separate protagonists, linked together only by following a character from one episode to another in a relay-race manner.[223] BuÃ±uel has stated that he made the film as a tribute to poet Benjamin PÃ©ret, a founding member of French Surrealism,[119]:p.170 and called it his \"most Surrealist film\".[109]:p.249",
