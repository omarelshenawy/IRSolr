Almost all mathematical operator symbols have their specific code points in Unicode outside both ASCII and General Punctuation (with notable exception of \"+\", \"=\", \"|\", as well as \",\", \":\", and three sorts of brackets). As a rule of thumb, specific mathematical symbols shall be used, not similarly looking ASCII or punctuation symbols, even if corresponding glyphs are indistinguishable. The list of mathematical symbols by subject includes markup for LaTeX and HTML, and Unicode code points.",
