In the tape, bin Laden is seen talking to Khaled al-Harbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks.[16] On December 27, 2001, a second bin Laden video was released. In the video, he said, \"It has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam....It is the hatred of crusaders. Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice, aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel, which kills our people...We say that the end of the United States is imminent, whether Bin Laden or his followers are alive or dead, for the awakening of the Muslim umma (nation) has occurred\", but he stopped short of admitting responsibility for the attacks.[17] The transcript references several times to the United States specifically targeting Muslims.",
