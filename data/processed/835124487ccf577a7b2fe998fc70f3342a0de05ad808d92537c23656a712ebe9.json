				"after": "One very early undercarriage arrangement that passively allowed for castoring during crosswind landings, unlike the \"active\" arrangement on the B-52, was pioneered on the Bleriot VIII design of 1908. It was later used in the much more famous BlÃ©riot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the Etrich Taube. In this arrangement the main landing gear's shock absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take landing shocks also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main wheel's suspension fork, allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.[citation needed]",
