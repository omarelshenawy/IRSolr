				"after": "In Africa, lions can be found in savanna grasslands with scattered Acacia trees, which serve as shade;[145] their habitat in India is a mixture of dry savanna forest and very dry deciduous scrub forest.[146] The habitat of lions originally spanned the southern parts of Eurasia, ranging from Greece to India, and most of Africa except the central rainforest-zone and the Sahara desert. Herodotus reported that lions had been common in Greece in 480 BC; they attacked the baggage camels of the Persian king Xerxes on his march through the country. Aristotle considered them rare by 300 BC. By 100 AD they were extirpated.[147] A population of Asiatic lions survived until the tenth century in the Caucasus, their last European outpost.[148]",
