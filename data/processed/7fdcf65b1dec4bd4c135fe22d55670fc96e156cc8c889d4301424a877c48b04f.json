				"after": "The music video for \"Don't Tell Me\" was directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who worked with Madonna in her videos for \"Open Your Heart\", \"Justify My Love\", \"Human Nature\" and \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\", and filmed in October 2000. The choreography was done by Alex Magno, who also collaborated on the Drowned World Tour. The tour designers DSquaredÂ² and Arianne Phillips also designed Madonna's cowgirl costume. The video features Madonna walking down an automated treadmill walkway in front of a projection screen, while cowboys dance and play on the sand in the video played on the screen behind her. Later, they join Madonna in front of the screen in a choreographed dance routine. The iconic final scene of the video depicts a cowboy riding a Skewbald horse in slow motion getting thrown to the ground, and getting up again.[28][24]",
