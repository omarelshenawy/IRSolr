				"previous": "Nozzles for vectored thrust include fixed geometry Bristol Siddeley Pegasus and variable geometry F119 (F-22).",
				"after": "Rocket motors also employ convergent-divergent nozzles, but these are usually of fixed geometry, to minimize weight. Because of the high pressure ratios associated with rocket flight, rocket motor con-di nozzles have a much greater area ratio (exit/throat) than those fitted to jet engines.",
