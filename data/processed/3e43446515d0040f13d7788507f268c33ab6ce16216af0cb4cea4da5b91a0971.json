For boarding actions Kronan was equipped with 130 muskets and 80 matchlock or flintlock pistols. For close combat there were 250 pikes, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords.[15] During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found â hakebÃ¶ssor, similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing to allow it to absorb the recoil of the charges. One hakebÃ¶ssa was still loaded with a small canister containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.[16]",
