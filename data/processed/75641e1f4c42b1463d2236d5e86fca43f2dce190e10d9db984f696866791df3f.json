				"after": "An ant colony, also called a formicary.[1] is the basic family unit around which ants organize their lifecycle.[citation needed] Ant colonies are eusocial, and are very much like those found in other social Hymenoptera, though the various groups of these developed sociality independently through convergent evolution.[citation needed] The typical colony consists of one or more egg-laying queens, a large number of sterile females (\"workers\") and, seasonally, a large number of winged sexual males and females.[citation needed] Periodically, swarms of the winged sexuals (known as alates) depart the nest in great nuptial flights. The males die shortly thereafter, along with most of the females.[citation needed] A small percentage of the females survive to initiate new nests.[2]",
