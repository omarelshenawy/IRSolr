				"previous": "Many of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. Lucy in the Field with Flowers (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons. As the first work acquired by the museum, Lucy is \"a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity\", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found Lucy or she found him.[44]",
				"after": "Kate Swoger of The Montreal Gazette called Lucy a \"gorgeous mistake\", describing her thus: \"an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other\".[30] Author Cash Peters, using less florid language, summarized it as \"the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass\".[47]",
