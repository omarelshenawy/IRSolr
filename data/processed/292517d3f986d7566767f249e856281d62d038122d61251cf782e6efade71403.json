				"after": "The Zong has inspired several works of literature. Fred D'Aguiar's novel Feeding the Ghosts (1997), tells the story of an enslaved African, who survives being thrown overboard from the Zong. In the novel, the journal of the slaveâMintahâis lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.[37] M. NourbeSe Philip's 2008 poetry book, Zong!, is based on the events surrounding the massacre and uses the account of the King's Bench hearing as its source.[37] Margaret Busby's play An African Cargo, staged by Nitro theatre company at Greenwich Theatre in 2007,[91] dealt with the massacre and the 1783 trials.[92]",
