It inhabits deciduous forests, dry scrub, montane humid forests, and gallery forests (forests along riverbanks). It strongly favors gallery forests, but such forests have now been cleared from much of Madagascar in order to create pasture for livestock.[23][19] Depending on location, temperatures within its geographic range can vary from â12Â Â°C (10Â Â°F)[22] at Andringitra Massif to 48Â Â°C (118Â Â°F) in the spiny forests of Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve.[34]",
