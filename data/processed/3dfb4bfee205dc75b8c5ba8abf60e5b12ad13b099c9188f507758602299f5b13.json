				"after": "The karyotype in T.Â talamancae is variable. Samples from two different localities in Venezuela have 34Â chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2nÂ =Â 34, FNÂ =Â 64).[77] Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67.[Note 5] The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2nÂ =Â 34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2nÂ =Â 40â42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2nÂ =Â 34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2nÂ =Â 40â42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics.[79] Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain the difference between the two groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2nÂ =Â 40â42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.[80]",
