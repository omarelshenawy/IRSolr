				"previous": "The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion of the surrounding region.[4][11] Each plateau is shaped roughly like a horseshoe because the lava followed the meanders of the Ancestral Rogue River.[9][12][13]",
				"after": "Two caves and two former gold mines are located at the base of the andesite cap on Upper Table Rock. The caves were created by natural fractures in the cap, and the gold mines were excavated by prospectors searching for gold in the 19thÂ century. Three are large enough to walk into, with an average width of 8 feet (2Â m), while one is a small pit, dropping 30 feet (9.1Â m) vertically into a pond of water.[12]",
