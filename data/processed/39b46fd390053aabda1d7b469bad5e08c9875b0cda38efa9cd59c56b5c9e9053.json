				"previous": "The bay bolete was first named as Boletus castaneus Ã badius (i.e. a subspecies of Boletus castaneus) by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818.[nb 1] Fries later renamed it as a variety of Boletus castaneus in 1828,[2] before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work Elenchus Fungorum.[3] The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its taxonomic history: Rostkovites by Petter Karsten in 1881;[4] Viscipellis and Ixocomus by Lucien QuÃ©let in 1886 and 1888, respectively;[5][6] and Suillus by Otto Kuntze in 1898.[7] In 1931, Edouard-Jean Gilbert reclassified it in the genus Xerocomus,[8] and many sources still list it thus.[9] Review of Xerocomus strongly suggested it was polyphyletic, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap distinguishes the species from others classified in Xerocomus, and hence it has been left in Boletus pending further research.[10] Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that Boletus badius is related to B.Â pallidus and B.Â glabellus; the three species form a clade known informally as the badius clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the Tylopilus, porcini (= Boletus sensu stricto) and Strobilomyces clades, as well as two other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus (the taxa designated as Xerocomus species in this clade are not Xerocomus species and require new taxonomic designations) and Xerocomellus.[11]",
				"after": "The species Boletus limatulus, originally published by Charles Christopher Frost in 1874,[12] was later redescribed, \"with a slight tinge of irritation at the time, energy and gasoline spent\", as a variety of B.Â badius by Wally Snell in 1945 (as Xerocomus badius var. limatulus).[13] The taxon name comes from the Latin limatulus, \"rather polished\" or \"refined\".[14] Varieties glaber and macrostipitatus were described from Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1976.[15]",
