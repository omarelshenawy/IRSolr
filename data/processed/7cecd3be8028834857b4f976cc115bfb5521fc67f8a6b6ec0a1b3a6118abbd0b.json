				"previous": "Reinhard Heydrich convened the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 in Berlin's Wannsee suburb. It brought together 15 Nazi leaders, including a number of state secretaries, senior officials, party leaders, SS officers, and other leaders of government departments responsible for policies linked to Jewish issues. The conference's initial purpose was to discuss plans for a comprehensive solution to the \"Jewish question in Europe.\" Heydrich intended to \"outline the mass murders in the various occupied territories .Â .Â . as part of a solution to the European Jewish question ordered by Hitler .Â .Â . to ensure that they, and especially the ministerial bureaucracy, would share both knowledge and responsibility for this policy.\"[166]",
				"after": "A copy of the minutes drawn up by Eichmann has survived, but on Heydrich's instructions, they were written in \"euphemistic language\" so the exact words used at the meeting are not known.[167] But Heydrich announced that the emigration policy was superseded by a policy of evacuating Jews to the east. This was seen to be only a temporary solution leading up to a final solution that would involve some 11 million Jews living not only in territories then controlled by Germany, but in major countries in the rest of the world including the UK and the US.[168] There was little doubt what the solution was: \"Heydrich also made it clear what was understood by the phrase 'Final Solution': the Jews were to be annihilated by a combination of forced labour and mass murder.\"[169]",
