A brief dispatch in the 1922 Baton explained, \"Sometime within the next two years the Kappa Kappa Psi Fraternity will hold a National Intercollegiate Band Contest. This enterprise will be the first of its kind ever attempted. As Music is becoming the foremost Art in America, our Fraternity aims to assist in so spreading the good work.\"[36] Nothing came of these early plans, however, and the idea of a national intercollegiate band was not revisited until the 1940s.[37]",
