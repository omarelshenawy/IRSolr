				"after": "Barnes attended Stanmore Public School and, although not a scholar, was a keen participant in sporting activities.[7] His introduction to cricket came via his older brother, Horrie; Horrie was a useful batsman who played in the local Western Suburbs Churches league and paid Sid sixpence to bowl to him after he finished work. Taking an interest in the game, Sid had trials for the school team and was eventually selected in the first XI. An early controversy saw Barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an umpire's decision.[8] Successes for both his school team and his local club team, St. Augustine, saw him acquire the nickname The Governor-Generalâthe nickname of Australian Test player, Charlie Macartney, and he was selected for New South Wales Schoolboys to play teams from Victoria and Queensland.[8]",
