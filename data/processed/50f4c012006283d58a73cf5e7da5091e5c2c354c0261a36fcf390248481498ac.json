				"after": "The new terminal, called Terminal Mitte (Central Terminal, today known as Terminal 1) and divided into three concourses (A, B and C) with 56 gates and an electric baggage handling system, was opened to the public on 14 March 1972. It was assumed that the terminal capacity would be sufficient for the next 30 years. Along with the new terminal a train station (Frankfurt Airport station) was opened, the first airport train station in the Federal Republic of Germany. A few days later the old Empfangsanlage Ost was closed.",
