The state has more mountain peaks above 4000Â meters (13,123Â feet) of elevation than any other state or province in North America. Admitted to the Union on AugustÂ 1, 1876, Colorado became the 38th U.S. state. Colorado ranks first in mean elevation, eighth in total area, and 22nd in population among the 50 U.S. states. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,355,866 on July 1, 2014, an increase of +6.50% since the 2010 United States Census. Denver is the state capital, the most populous city, and the heart of the most populous metropolitan area of the Rocky Mountain Region. Colorado Springs is the state's second most populous city. While the population of the Front Range Urban Corridor now exceeds 4.5Â million, many rugged portions of the state remain pristine wilderness.",
