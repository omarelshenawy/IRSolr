				"previous": "McCay's work has inspired cartoonists from Carl Barks[131] to Art Spiegelman.[132] Robert Crumb called McCay a \"genius\" and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman's 1974 \"Real Dream\" strip was partially inspired by Rarebit Fiend,[133] and his In the Shadow of No Towers in 2004 appropriated some of McCay's imagery, and included a page of Little Nemo in its appendix.[123] Maurice Sendak's children's book In the Night Kitchen (1970) was an homage to McCay's work,[134] as was Rick Veitch' comic book series Roarin' Rick's Rarebit Fiends (1994â96).[135] Kim Deitch and Simon Deitch's graphic novel The Boulevard of Broken Dreams revolved around a character named Winsor Newton,[d] based on an aged McCay.[136] Cartoonist Berke Breathed lamented that the conditions of newspaper cartooning had devolved to such a degree since McCay's time that, had he worked later in the century, he would not have been allotted space sufficient for his expansive full-page fantasies.[137]",
				"after": "As Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams first appeared in print in 1899, McCay's major dream strips work have invited speculation of a Freudian influence. A comic strip that appeared in Freud's book, \"A French Nurse's Dream\", strongly resembles the work of McCay in its theme, pacing Art Nouveau style, and closing panel of the dreamer awakening in bed. However, the English translation of Freud's book was not published until 1913.[138]",
