				"previous": "The square root of a positive number is usually defined as the side length of a square with the area equal to the given number. But the square shape is not necessary for it: if one of two similar planar Euclidean objects has the area a times greater than another, then the ratio of their linear sizes is âa.",
				"after": "The construction is also given by Descartes in his La GÃ©omÃ©trie, see figure 2 on page 2. However, Descartes made no claim to originality and his audience would have been quite familiar with Euclid.",
