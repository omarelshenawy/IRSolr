				"after": "Johannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau, and has a subtropical highland climate (KÃ¶ppen Cwb). The city enjoys a sunny climate, with the summer months (October to April) characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings, and the winter months (May to September) by dry, sunny days followed by cold nights.[28] Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high elevation, with an average maximum daytime temperature in January of 25.6Â Â°C (78.1Â Â°F), dropping to an average maximum of around 16Â Â°C (61Â Â°F) in June. Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with mild days and cool nights, dropping to 4.1Â Â°C (39.4Â Â°F) in June and July. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing frost. Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in the twentieth century during May 1956, August 1962, June 1964 and September 1981. In the twenty-first century, there has been light sleet in 2006, as well as snow proper on 27 June 2007 (accumulating up to 10 centimetres (4Â in) in the southern suburbs)[29] and 7 August 2012.[30]",
