The insurers refused to honour the claim and were taken to court by the Liverpool syndicate.[41] The logbook of the Zong went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, two years before the hearings started. The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing.[42] The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.[43]",
