The Grand Bazaar, in operation since 1461, is among the world's oldest and largest covered markets.[213][214] Mahmutpasha Bazaar is an open-air market extending between the Grand Bazaar and the Egyptian Bazaar, which has been Istanbul's major spice market since 1660. Galleria AtakÃ¶y ushered in the age of modern shopping malls in Turkey when it opened in 1987.[215] Since then, malls have become major shopping centers outside the historic peninsula. Akmerkez was awarded the titles of \"Europe's best\" and \"World's best\" shopping mall by the International Council of Shopping Centers in 1995 and 1996; Istanbul Cevahir has been one of the continent's largest since opening in 2005; while Kanyon won the Cityscape Architectural Review Award in the Commercial Built category in 2006.[214] Ä°stinye Park in Ä°stinye and Zorlu Center near Levent are among the newest malls which include the stores of the world's top fashion brands. Abdi Ä°pekÃ§i Street in NiÅantaÅÄ± and BaÄdat Avenue on the Anatolian side of the city have evolved into high-end shopping districts.[216][217]",
