				"previous": "Decimal time was used in China throughout most of its history alongside duodecimal time. The midnight-to-midnight day was divided both into 12 double hours (Traditional Chinese: æè¾°; Simplified Chinese: æ¶è¾°; Pinyin: shÃ­chen) and also into 10 shi / 100 ke (Hanzi: å»; Pinyin: kÃ¨) by the 1st millennium BC.[1][2] Other numbers of ke per day were used during three short periods: 120 ke from 5â3 BC, 96 ke from 507â544 CE, and 108 ke from 544â565. Several of the roughly 50 Chinese calendars also divided each ke into 100 fen, although others divided each ke into 60 fen. In 1280, the Shoushi (Season Granting) calendar further subdivided each fen into 100 miao, creating a complete decimal time system of 100 ke, 100 fen and 100 miao.[3] Chinese decimal time ceased to be used in 1645 when the Shixian (Constant Conformity) calendar, based on European astronomy and brought to China by the Jesuits, adopted 96 ke per day alongside 12 double hours, making each ke exactly one-quarter hour.[4]",
