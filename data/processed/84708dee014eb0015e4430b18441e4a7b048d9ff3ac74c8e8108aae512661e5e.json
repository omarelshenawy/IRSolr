Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's second-richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of â¬398 million. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid; matches between the two teams are referred to as \"El ClÃ¡sico\".",
