				"after": "A number of companies continue to build radials today. Vedeneyev produces the M-14P radial of 360â450Â hp (270â340Â kW) as used on Yakovlev and Sukhoi aerobatic aircraft. The M-14P is also used by builders of homebuilt aircraft, such as the Culp Special, and Culp Sopwith Pup,[11] Pitts S12 \"Monster\" and the Murphy \"Moose\". 110Â hp (82Â kW) 7-cylinder and 150Â hp (110Â kW) 9-cylinder engines are available from Australia's Rotec Aerosport. HCI Aviation offers the R180 5-cylinder (75Â hp (56Â kW)) and R220 7-cylinder (110Â hp (82Â kW)), available \"ready to fly\" and as a build-it-yourself kit. Verner Motor of the Czech Republic now builds several radial engines ranging in power from 25 to 150Â hp (19 to 112Â kW).[12] Miniature radial engines for model airplanes are available from O. S. Engines, Saito Seisakusho of Japan and Shijiazhuang of China, and Evolution (designed by Wolfgang Seidel of Germany, and made in India) and Technopower in the USA.[citation needed]",
