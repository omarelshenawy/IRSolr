				"previous": "In 1795, the Boones moved back to Kentucky, living in Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, first governor of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route. However, the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued to make their way through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. The Boones were living at the time at the mouth of the Little Sandy River in northeastern Kentucky. That same year, Kentucky named Boone County in his honor.",
