				"after": "The cane toad is very large;[20] the females are significantly longer than males,[21] reaching an average length of 10â15Â cm (3.9â5.9Â in).[20] \"Prinsen\", a toad kept as a pet in Sweden, is listed by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest recorded specimen. It reportedly weighed 2.65Â kg (5.84Â lb) and measured 38Â cm (15Â in) from snout to vent, or 54Â cm (21Â in) when fully extended.[22] Larger toads tend to be found in areas of lower population density.[23] They have a life expectancy of 10 to 15Â years in the wild,[24] and can live considerably longer in captivity, with one specimen reportedly surviving for 35Â years.[25]",
