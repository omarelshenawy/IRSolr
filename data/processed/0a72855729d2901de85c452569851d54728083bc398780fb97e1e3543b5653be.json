They are disproportionately represented in the military, service academy graduates, in higher education and academia, major professions, the clergy, business and politics.[38][39]:149â159 Eagles are more likely to exercise for 30 minutes or more every day, volunteer for religious and nonreligious organizations, have closer relationships with family and friends, be in a leadership position at their place of employment or local community, donate money to charitable groups, and to work with others to improve their neighborhoods.[40]",
