				"previous": "While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal \"Kiwi\" is commonly used both internationally[240] and by locals.[241] The MÄori loanword PÄkehÄ has been used to refer to New Zealanders of European descent, although others reject this appellation.[242][243] The word PÄkehÄ today is increasingly used to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders.[244]",
				"after": "The MÄori were the first people to reach New Zealand, followed by the early European settlers. Following colonisation, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia because of restrictive policies similar to the white Australian policies.[245] There was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian,[246] Italian, and German immigration, together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa.[247] Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased. In 2009â10, an annual target of 45,000â50,000 permanent residence approvals was set by the New Zealand Immigration Serviceâmore than one new migrant for every 100 New Zealand residents.[248] Just over 25% of New Zealand's population was born overseas, with the majority (52%) living in the Auckland region. In the late 2000s, Asia overtook the UK and Ireland as the largest source of overseas migrants; at the 2013 census, 31.6% of overseas-born New Zealand residents were born in Asia (mainly China, India, the Philippines and South Korea), while 26.5% were born in the UK and Ireland. Australia, the Pacific Islands, and South Africa are also significant sources of migrants.[249] The number of fee-paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s, with more than 20,000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002.[250]",
