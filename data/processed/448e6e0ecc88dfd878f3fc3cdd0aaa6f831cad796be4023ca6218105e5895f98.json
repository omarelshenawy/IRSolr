				"previous": "In the late 1970s, operating cost replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases.[6] As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset.[5] Boeing targeted a 20 to 30Â percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology.[6] As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for over one-third of the 767's design drawings,[6] and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests.[16] Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost.[10][12] Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics.[17] Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4Â billion.[6]",
				"after": "Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt & Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner.[18] Both jet engine models had a maximum output of 48,000 pounds-force (210Â kN) of thrust.[9] The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets.[6] The larger wings were designed using an aft-loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft.[6][19] The wings provided higher-altitude cruise performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants.[16] The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic,[20] and would be capable of operating routes up to 3,850 nautical miles (7,130Â km).[21]",
