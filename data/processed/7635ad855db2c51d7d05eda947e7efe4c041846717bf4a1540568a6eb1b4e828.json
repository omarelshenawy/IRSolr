				"previous": "In Norway, Jan Mayen, Svalbard and Bouvet Island are outside the division into counties and municipalities. They are ruled directly by national authorities without any local democracy. An exception is that Longyearbyen since 2004 has an organisation in reality acting partly like a Norwegian municipality. Svalbard has a governor appointed by the government of Norway, ruling the area. Jan Mayen has no population, only radio and weather stations with staff, whose manager has the responsibility for the activities. Bouvet Island has only occasional visitors.",
			"after": [
				"In local government in the United States, an unincorporated area generally refers to the part of a county which is outside of any municipality.",
				"Most states have granted some form of home rule, so that county commissions (or boards or councils) have the same powers in these areas as city councils or town councils have in their respective incorporated areas.[7] Some states instead put these powers in the hands of townships, which are minor civil divisions of each county, and are called \"towns\" in some states."
