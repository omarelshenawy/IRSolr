				"previous": "No date is provided for the battle alongside these casualty figures. The lower left-hand corner features Altdorfer's monogram â an 'A' within an 'A' â and the lower edge of the tablet is inscribed with \"ALBRECHT ALTORFER ZU REGENSPVRG FECIT\" (\"Albrecht Altdorfer from Regensburg made [this]\"). Tiny inscriptions on their chariot and harness identify Darius and Alexander, respectively.[64] Each army bears a banner that reports both its total strength and its future casualties.[43][60]",
				"after": "Anachronism is a major component of The Battle of Alexander at Issus. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary EuropeanâOttoman conflict.[44][59][64] In 1529 â the year of the painting's commissioning â the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city of Vienna.[64] Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.[47][59]",
