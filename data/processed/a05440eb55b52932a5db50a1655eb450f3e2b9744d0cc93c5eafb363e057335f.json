				"previous": "Approximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born.[211][212] In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates.[211] The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011 were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago,[213] while the Bangladeshi immigrant population has since become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 74,000 by 2013.[214]",
				"after": "Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 Census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[217] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[218] The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[155][156] The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (ç´ç´è¯å ), in Brooklyn (å¸é²åæè¯å ), and around Flushing, Queens (æ³æçè¯å ), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (æ¿é¨·ç¸£)[219] on Long Island (é·å³¶),[220] as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas.[221][222][223][224][225][226] In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island.[227] A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu (Chinese: æé²æ) or Joseonjok (Hangul: ì¡°ì ì¡±)) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens.[228] Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[229] Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos,[230] as well as Malaysians[8] and other Southeast Asians;[231] while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian as well as Asian Indian immigrants.",
