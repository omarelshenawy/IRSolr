				"previous": "Ralph Agas's 1578 map of Oxford shows the extent of the buildings at that time. Laurence Hall is the \"isolated group of buildings\"[24] on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street. There is then a gap along Turl Street before a building positioned south of the current entrance with glazed windows facing Turl Street and a large window or loft door at its north end; another building then runs to the old White Hall buildings.[18] The Turl Street entrance appears from Agas's map to date from after Price's death, and the north side of the building on Turl Street may have been integrated into an extension early in the 17th century, although the date of such work is unclear;[25] Price is nevertheless sometimes given the credit for the archway on the inside of the entrance on the first quadrangle.[26] Overall, whilst the structure of the buildings erected by Price remains, only a little of his work can be seen from the outside, after various alterations in the intervening centuries;[5] nevertheless, his buildings have been said to retain \"much of their original character\".[13]",
				"after": "Some land in Ship Street to the west of the college was leased from Exeter College in 1590, and further construction work took place after Powell was appointed principal in 1613.[15][27] Powell raised money from donors in Oxford, London, and Wales, collecting Â£838 12s 2d[n 2] in what has been described as \"an elaborate fundraising scheme\",[28] with efforts to attract donations from old members of the college.[28][29] Ann Lloyd, the widow of Griffith Lloyd (principal from 1572 to 1586) gave Â£100.[n 3][29] Richard Parry, the Bishop of St Asaph, gave Â£66 13s 4d out of the total from Welsh clergy of Â£78 7s 4d.[n 4][29] The old Great White Hall buildings were demolished around 1620 and replaced, and a kitchen and buttery were constructed.[29][30] Work also started on building the hall and the chapel under Powell; both were completed after his death in 1620.[31] Sir Eubule Thelwall, who became principal in 1621, raised Â£465 15s 6d[n 5] from donors, including Sir Julius Caesar, the Master of the Rolls, and Edward Littleton, the Recorder of London.[29] This was used for \"the perfecting of the Quadrangle of the building and furnishing of the library\".[29] The college then had a complete quadrangle of buildings, save for a gap between the chapel and the hall that would later be filled by the principal's lodgings, built by Thelwall at his own expense; the library (later demolished) was outside the quadrangle, to the west of the north end of the lodgings.[29][31]",
