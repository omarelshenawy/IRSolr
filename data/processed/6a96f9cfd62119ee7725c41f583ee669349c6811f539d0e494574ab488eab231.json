				"previous": "Zahner of Kansas City, Missouri, was the subcontractor for the pavilion's ribbons,[9] described as \"stainless steel panels that appear to be peeling back from the central opening\".[31] The proscenium's metal ribbons are composed of 697Â panels that range from 6Â to 300 square feet (0.56â27.87Â m2) and 1,600Â to 20,000 pounds (730â9,070Â kg) with a thickness of about 14 inches (36Â cm).[32] They are made from aluminum with a stainless steel outer layer that has a uniform shade across all panels.[32][33] The structural steel for the ribbons had an abnormally low fit tolerance of 0.125 inches (3.2Â mm), rather than the standard 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51Â mm).[29] The proscenium was inspired by Gehry's 2001 flagship store for Issey Miyake in New York City, which has sculptured titanium that represents pleating.[34] During construction, about five cranes and 18 aerial lifts were on site. The apex of the center element is approximately 150 feet (46Â m) high, which was near the limits of basic construction equipment at the time.[33]",
				"after": "Acme Structural of Springfield, Missouri, was the subcontractor for the trellis over the Great Lawn,[9] which resulted from the distributed sound system's requirement for speakers every 70 feet (21Â m). One way to achieve this would have involved placing the speakers on pipes or columns, but the resulting forest of columns seemed discordant with the architecture.[30] Gehry preferred the trellis although it cost about $3Â million more than speakers arranged on posts would have.[16] The trellis uses 22Â criss-crossing arches in a lattice pattern,[35] and is noted for its parabolic grid.[7] The arches use pipes varying in diameter from 12â20 inches (30â51Â cm) depending upon the load requirements.[35] Arches longer than 300 feet (91Â m) have four or five different radii, where radius describes the extent of pipe curvature.[35] The arch pipes connect to the structural steel of the pavilion structure without linking to the metal ribbons.[35] The trellis is 600 by 300 feet (183 by 91Â m).[36]",
