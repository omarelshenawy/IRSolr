				"previous": "In addition to the \"schoolroom\", which was larger than the Town Public Hall, the building consisted of a dining hall (cum gymnasium), the masters common room to the east and a block of six classrooms to the west.[99] The headmaster's house was completed at the same time as the main school building, and had five bedrooms wired with electric bells, and a bathroom plumbed with hot and cold water.[99] In November 1920, an organ was built at a cost of over Â£1,000, and placed in the schoolroom as a memorial to the old boys and masters who died in the First World War.[47] A new gymnasium was constructed after a 1956 survey deemed its predecessor economically irreparable. Accompanied by the construction of three hard tennis courts, it was opened by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1958, but lacked adjoining changing rooms, washing facilities and office facilities for members of the physical education staff.[103]",
				"after": "Now known as \"Lawton's\", 10Â BrookÂ Street was purchased during the early 1970s using funds provided by the Kent Education Committee, after whose chairman the building is now named.[33] A Â£2Â million classroom and technology building (the \"Cohen Building\"), together with two new science laboratories, was opened in 1991. A new music centre, financed by voluntary donations, was opened in 1995 and a schoolroom annexe followed in 1997. The most recent developments are a library/classroom building in 2002, a new sports hall in 2003 and an all-weather pitch in 2006.[42] The Atwell Building, formerly known as the \"Maths-Geography Block\", opened in 2009 after suffering delays after the original building contractor went out of business.[104] The school grounds have sufficient space for two rugby pitches and training grids in the winter months, or a 200-metre (660Â ft) running track, and a cricket ground (with nets) for summer. There are also three asphalt tennis courts, an air rifle range used by the school's Combined Cadet Force, and an open-air swimming pool.[42]",
