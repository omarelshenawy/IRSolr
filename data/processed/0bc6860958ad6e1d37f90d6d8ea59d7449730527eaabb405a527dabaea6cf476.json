				"previous": "Quasi-polynomial time algorithms are algorithms which run slower than polynomial time, yet not so slow as to be exponential time. The worst case running time of a quasi-polynomial time algorithm is for some fixed c. The best-known classical algorithm for integer factorization, the general number field sieve, which runs in time about is not quasi-polynomial since the running time cannot be expressed as for some fixed c. If the constant \"c\" in the definition of quasi-polynomial time algorithms is equal to 1, we get a polynomial time algorithm, and if it is less than 1, we get a sub-linear time algorithm.",
				"after": "The complexity class QP consists of all problems which have quasi-polynomial time algorithms. It can be defined in terms of DTIME as follows.[12]",
