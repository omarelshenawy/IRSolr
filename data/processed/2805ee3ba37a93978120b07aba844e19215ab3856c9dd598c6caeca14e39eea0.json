				"after": "The Russian zoologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (1845â1916) first recognized that specialized cells were involved in defense against microbial infections. In 1882, he studied motile (freely moving) cells in the larvae of starfishes, believing they were important to the animals' immune defenses. To test his idea, he inserted small thorns from a tangerine tree into the larvae. After a few hours he noticed that the motile cells had surrounded the thorns.[16] Mechnikov traveled to Vienna and shared his ideas with Carl Friedrich Claus who suggested the name ââphagocyteââ (from the Greek words phagein, meaning \"to eat or devour\", and kutos, meaning \"hollow vessel\"[1]) for the cells that Mechnikov had observed.[17]",
