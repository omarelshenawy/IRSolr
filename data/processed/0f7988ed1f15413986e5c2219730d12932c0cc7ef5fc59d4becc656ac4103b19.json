				"after": "The tree's gnarled bark, large green leaves, and yellow flower spikes are attractive horticultural features.[32] B.Â dentata is vulnerable to cold winters in cultivation in Melbourne and recovers over the hotter months of summer.[33] It has not been able to be grown in colder climates, such as those of Canberra.[6] Flowering occurs around 5 to 8 years from seed. Plants can be pruned hard, and do best on a sandy slightly acid soil of pH 5.5â6.5. They can be vulnerable to borers.[34] Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 32 to 40 days to germinate.[35] Banksia dentata was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1822.[36]",
