				"after": "Xenon has atomic number 54; that is, its nucleus contains 54 protons. At standard temperature and pressure, pure xenon gas has a density of 5.761Â kg/m3, about 4.5 times the surface density of the Earth's atmosphere, 1.217Â kg/m3.[44] As a liquid, xenon has a density of up to 3.100Â g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the triple point.[45] Under the same conditions, the density of solid xenon, 3.640Â g/cm3, is higher than the average density of granite, 2.75Â g/cm3.[45] Using gigapascals of pressure, xenon has been forced into a metallic phase.[46]",
