				"previous": "Frequent and often contradictory directives were issued by Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, Bernhard Rust of the Reichserziehungsministerium (Ministry of Education), and various other agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools.[306] Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries.[307] Indoctrination in National Socialist thought was made compulsory in January 1934.[307] Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated from the age of 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education for secondary education. Detailed National Socialist indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles.[308]",
				"after": "Primary and secondary education focused on racial biology, population policy, culture, geography, and especially physical fitness.[309] The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography, and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race.[310] Military education became the central component of physical education, and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications, such as ballistics and aerodynamics.[311][312] Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.[307]",
