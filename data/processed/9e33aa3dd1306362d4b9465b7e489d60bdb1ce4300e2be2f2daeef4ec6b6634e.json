				"after": "In 1702, following his father's wishes, Handel started studying law under Christian Thomasius at the University of Halle.[14] He earned an appointment for one year as the organist in the former cathedral, by then an evangelical reformed church. Handel seems to have been unsatisfied, and in 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg Oper am GÃ¤nsemarkt.[15] There he met the composers Johann Mattheson, Christoph Graupner and Reinhard Keiser. His first two operas, Almira and Nero, were produced in 1705.[16] He produced two other operas, Daphne and Florindo, in 1708. It is unclear whether Handel directed these performances.",
