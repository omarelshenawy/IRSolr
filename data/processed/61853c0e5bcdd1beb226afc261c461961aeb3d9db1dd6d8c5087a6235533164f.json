				"previous": "In 1885, a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered.[35] The \"hidden footing\" contains reliefs, 160 of which are narratives describing the real KÄmadhÄtu. The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors, illustrating the scenes to be carved.[67] The real base is hidden by an encasement base, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill.[67] There is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed, according to Vastu Shastra, the Indian ancient book about architecture and town planning.[35] Regardless of why it was commissioned, the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration.",
				"after": "Approximately 55,000 cubic metres (72,000Â cuÂ yd) of andesite stones were taken from neighbouring stone quarries to build the monument.[68] The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar. Knobs, indentations and dovetails were used to form joints between stones. Reliefs were created in situ after the building had been completed.",
