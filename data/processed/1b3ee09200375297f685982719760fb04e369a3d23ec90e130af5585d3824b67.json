				"previous": "Over the years, twelve body fossil specimens of Archaeopteryx and a feather that may belong to it have been found. All of the fossils come from the limestone deposits, quarried for centuries, near Solnhofen, Germany.[47][54]",
				"after": "The initial discovery, a single feather, was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by Hermann von Meyer. It is currently located at the Humboldt Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde in Berlin. This is generally assigned to Archaeopteryx and was the initial holotype, but whether it is a feather of this species, or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is indeed not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the \"typical\" A. lithographica).[8]",
