				"after": "A shepherd's dial â also known as a shepherds' column dial,[61][62] pillar dial, cylinder dial or chilindre â is a portable cylindrical sundial with a knife-like gnomon that juts out perpendicularly.[63] It is normally dangled from a rope or string so the cylinder is vertical. The gnomon can be twisted to be above a month or day indication on the face of the cylinder. This corrects the sundial for the equation of time. The entire sundial is then twisted on its string so that the gnomon aims toward the sun, while the cylinder remains vertical. The tip of the shadow indicates the time on the cylinder. The hour curves inscribed on the cylinder permit one to read the time. Shepherd's dials are sometimes hollow, so that the gnomon can fold within when not in use.",
