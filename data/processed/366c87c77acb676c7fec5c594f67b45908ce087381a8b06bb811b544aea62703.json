				"previous": "On July 15, 1961, to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on a 1940s-era army airbase in Boca Raton. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on 5,860Â acres (23.7Â kmÂ²) of adjacent land.[13] A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. The land was seized through eminent domain, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.[13]",
				"after": "The Boca Raton airbase was used for radar training, anti-submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop-over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America. It had a troop strength of 16,000Â men, with approximately 1,200Â civilian workers. The airfield was composed of four runways, each stretching 5,200Â feet (1.58Â km) long, set in a triangle shape, with one runway bisecting the triangle. These runways are still visible on the Boca Campus today and are mainly used for parking. Over the course of the war, the airfield would grow to encompass more than 800Â buildings serving approximately 100,000Â airmen, including those who were aboard the Enola Gay when it dropped a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima.[14][15] As the war drew to a close Boca Raton Army Airfield saw a steady decline in use. By the end of 1945, about only 100Â planes were stationed at the airbase.[16][17]",
