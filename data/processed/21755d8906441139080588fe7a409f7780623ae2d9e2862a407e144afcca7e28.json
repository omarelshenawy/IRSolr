				"previous": "The two widest separated points in Russia are about 8,000Â km (4,971Â mi) apart along a geodesic line. These points are: the boundary with Poland on a 60Â km (37Â mi) long Vistula Spit separating the GdaÅsk Bay from the Vistula Lagoon; and the farthest southeast of the Kuril Islands. The points which are furthest separated in longitude are 6,600Â km (4,101Â mi) apart along a geodesic line. These points are: in the west, the same spit; in the east, the Big Diomede Island. The Russian Federation spans 9 time zones.",
				"after": "Most of Russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly steppe to the south and heavily forested to the north, with tundra along the northern coast. Russia possesses 10% of the world's arable land.[149] Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the Caucasus (containing Mount Elbrus, which at 5,642Â m (18,510Â ft) is the highest point in both Russia and Europe) and the Altai (containing Mount Belukha, which at the 4,506Â m (14,783Â ft) is the highest point of Siberia outside of the Russian Far East); and in the eastern parts, such as the Verkhoyansk Range or the volcanoes of Kamchatka Peninsula (containing Klyuchevskaya Sopka, which at the 4,750Â m (15,584Â ft) is the highest active volcano in Eurasia as well as the highest point of Asian Russia). The Ural Mountains, rich in mineral resources, form a north-south range that divides Europe and Asia.",
