				"South Vietnam's origins can be traced to the French colony of Cochinchina, which consisted of the southern third of Vietnam and was a subdivision of French Indochina. After World War II, the Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh, proclaimed the establishment of a Communist nation in Hanoi. In 1949, non-communist Vietnamese politicians formed a rival government in Saigon led by former emperor Báº£o Äáº¡i. Báº£o Äáº¡i was deposed by Prime Minister NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Diá»m in 1955, who proclaimed himself president after a referendum. After Diá»m was deposed in a military coup in 1963, there was a series of short-lived military governments. General Nguyá»n VÄn Thiá»u led the country from 1967 until 1975. The Vietnam War began in 1959 with an uprising by Viet Cong forces supplied by North Vietnam. Fighting climaxed during the Tet Offensive of 1968, when there were over 1.5 million South Vietnamese soldiers and 500,000 U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. Despite a peace treaty concluded in January 1973, fighting continued until the North Vietnamese army overran Saigon on 30 April 1975."
