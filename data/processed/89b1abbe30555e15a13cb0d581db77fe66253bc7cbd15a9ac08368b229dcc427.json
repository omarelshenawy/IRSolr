Some of the more popular theories include Freemasonry being an offshoot of the ancient mystery schools, or that it is an institutional outgrowth of the medieval guilds of stonemasons, or that it is a direct descendant of the \"Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem\" (the Knights Templar).",
