				"previous": "In January 2015, Elon Musk, the CEO of Space Exploration Industries (SpaceX), announced he would likely be hiring hundreds of engineers in the Seattle area for his ambitious space exploration related venturesâincluding traveling to, and possibly colonizing Mars using the company's re-usable rocket systems.[130] This news comes at a time when Boeing has recently announced it will be re-locating thousands of aviation related engineering positions to other states.[131]",
				"after": "From 1869 until 1982, Seattle was known as the \"Queen City\".[132] Seattle's current official nickname is the \"Emerald City\", the result of a contest held in 1981;[133][134] the reference is to the lush evergreen forests of the area. Seattle is also referred to informally as the \"Gateway to Alaska\" for being the nearest major city in the contiguous US to Alaska, \"Rain City\" for its frequent cloudy and rainy weather, and \"Jet City\"[134] from the local influence of Boeing. The city has two official slogans or mottos: \"The City of Flowers\", meant to encourage the planting of flowers to beautify the city, and \"The City of Goodwill\", adopted prior to the 1990 Goodwill Games.[135] Seattle residents are known as Seattleites.",
