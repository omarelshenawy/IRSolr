Breeding occurs around September, and possibly also in December and January.[12] American ornithologist James Bond found a nest containing three white eggs 60Â cm (2Â ft) above water level in sawgrass, but little else is known of the breeding biology.[9][17] Rails are usually monogamous, and all have precocial chicks which are fed and guarded by the adults.[18]",
