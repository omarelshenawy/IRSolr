				"previous": "The Crowns were open-minded about the choice of artist; wanting a modern work, they solicited proposals from a list of prospective artists and architects.[17] Jaume Plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied anthropomorphism in fountain imagery.[18] Some of his early ideas for the project referenced Buckingham Fountain, but these were soon abandoned.[8] His presentation to the Crown family started with a slide show of fountains from the Middle Ages through the 20thÂ century. Plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains, their history, use and art.[18] His presentation included computer animation of facial expressions.[19] The other finalists were Maya Lin, who presented a low-height horizontal form, and Robert Venturi, who presented a fountain that would have been 150 feet (46Â m) tall.[20] In January 2000, Plensa won the commission to design the fountain over Lin and Venturi.[6][20] The installation is a video sculpture, commissioned to operate thirty years.[21]",
				"after": "Prior to Crown Fountain, Plensa's dominant theme had been dualism,[22] which he had expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside, and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces. In the 1990s, he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light (The Star of David (1998) at Stockholm's Raoul Wallenberg Square, Bridge of Light (1998) in Jerusalem), and LED technology, video, and computer design (GlÃ¤serne Seele & Mr. Net in Brandenburg (1999â2000)).[23] In his public art, Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art, which led to his conception of the Crown Fountain.[18] His objective was to create a socially relevant, interactive fountain for the 21stÂ century.[24] Since water is the focus of a fountain, and since Chicago, and especially Millennium Park, is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront, Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations.[8] Because of the colder winters common to the climate of Chicago, Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime, so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology.[8]",
