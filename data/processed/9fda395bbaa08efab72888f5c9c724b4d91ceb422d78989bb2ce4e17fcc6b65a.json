				"after": "First introduced in the 9th century, Faroes sheep have long been an integral part of the island traditions. The name Faeroe itself is thought to mean \"sheep islands\", and the animal is depicted on the Faroe Islands' historic coat of arms. Lamb and mutton dishes made from Faroes sheep, such as skerpikjÃ¸t, are a large part of traditional island cuisine. The breed is primarily kept for meat production, but wool is used for traditional knitwear like the Faroese shawl.",
