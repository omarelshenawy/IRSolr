				"previous": "In 2004, the second daily delivery was scrapped in an effort to reduce costs and improve efficiency, meaning a later single delivery would be made.[39] That year, the travelling post office \"mail trains\" were also axed.[40] They were resumed on some lines the following year.[41]",
				"after": "On 1 January 2006, the Royal Mail lost its 350-year monopoly and the British postal market became fully open to competition.[42] Competitors were allowed to collect and sort mail, and pass it to Royal Mail for delivery, a service known as Downstream access. Royal Mail introduced Pricing in Proportion (PiP) for first and second class inland mail, whereby prices are affected by the size as well as weight of items. It also introduced an online postage service, allowing customers to pay for postage online.[43]",
