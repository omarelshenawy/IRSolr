A file that is already hosted on Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Commons can be inserted with the basic code \"[[File:FILENAME|thumb|DESCRIPTION]]\". (\"Image:\" can be substituted for \"File:\" with no change in effect; the choice between the two is purely a matter of editorial preference.) Using \"thumb\" generates a thumbnail of an image (the most common placement option), which is typically sized differently from the original image. Several options can affect a thumbnail's placement and size, and there are other methods for placing images not in a thumbnail format, such as in a frame, table or \"infobox\", which this summary page does not delve into.",
