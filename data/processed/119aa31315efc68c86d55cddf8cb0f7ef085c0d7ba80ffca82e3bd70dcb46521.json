				"previous": "Channel Airways received its first ex-Continental Viscount 812 at Southend in April 1966. The aircraft participated in that year's Biggin Hill Air Fair.[46] The fact that the ex-Continental Viscounts already wore a livery that was similar in appearance to the recently adopted Golden-themed livery enabled Channel Airways to save costs by only changing the name on these planes and making a few other, minor adjustments.[47]",
				"after": "In September 1966, Channel Airways announced its first jet aircraft order comprising four BAC One-Eleven 400 series plus two options. That order was worth Â£5.5 million. These aircraft were the first jets to join the fleet, the first of which arrived at the company's Southend base on 15 June 1967.[nb 8] Nineteen sixty-six was also the year Channel arranged a 21-year lease on the grass field at Ipswich.[3][8][9][37][46][48][49]",
