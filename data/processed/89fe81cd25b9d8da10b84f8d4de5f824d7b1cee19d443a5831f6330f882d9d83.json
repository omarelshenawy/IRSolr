				"previous": "A 2008 study estimated that changes in climate shrank suitable mammoth habitat from 7,700,000Â km2 (3,000,000Â sqÂ mi) 42,000 years ago to 800,000Â km2 (310,000Â sqÂ mi) 6,000 years ago.[91][92] Woolly mammoths survived an even greater loss of habitat at the end of the Saale glaciation 125,000 years ago, and it is likely that humans hunted the remaining populations to extinction at the end of the last glacial period.[93][94] Studies of an 11,300â11,000 year old trackway in southwestern Canada showed that M. primigenius was in decline while coexisting with humans, since far fewer tracks of juveniles were identified than would be expected in a normal herd.[47]",
				"after": "DNA sequencing of remains of two mammoths, one from Siberia 44,800 years BP and one from Wrangel Island 4,300 years BP, indicates two major population crashes: one around 280,000 years ago from which the population recovered, and a second about 12,000 years ago, near the Ice Age's end, from which it did not.[95] The Wrangel Island mammoths were isolated for 5000 years, and due to the small population present when the island was isolated by rising post-ice-age sea level, about 300 to 1000 individuals,[96] experienced a 20%[95] to 30%[90] loss of heterozygosity, and a 65% loss in mitochondrial DNA diversity.[90] However, the population seems to have subsequently been stable, without suffering further significant loss of genetic diversity.[90][97] Genetic evidence thus implies the extinction of this final population was sudden, rather than the culmination of a gradual decline;[90] the disappearance coincides roughly in time with the first evidence for humans on the island.[98] The woolly mammoths of eastern Beringia (modern Alaska and Yukon) had similarly died out about 13,300 years ago, soon (roughly 1000 years) after the first appearance of humans in the area, which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene proboscids (mammoths, gomphotheres and mastodons), as well as most of the rest of the megafauna, of the Americas.[99] In contrast, the St. Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out prior to human arrival due to habitat shrinkage resulting from the post-ice-age sea-level rise.[99]",
