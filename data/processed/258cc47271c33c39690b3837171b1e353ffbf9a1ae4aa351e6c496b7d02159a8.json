A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia.[71] Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement.[72] The first modern Olympics were held at Athens in 1896.",
