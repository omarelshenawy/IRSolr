				"previous": "Some predators take advantage of the concentration of birds during migration. Greater noctule bats feed on nocturnal migrating passerines.[15] Some birds of prey specialize on migrating waders.[83]",
			"after": [
				"Early studies on the timing of migration began in 1749 in Finland, with Johannes Leche of Turku collecting the dates of arrivals of spring migrants.[84]",
				"Bird migration routes have been studied by a variety of techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899.[85] Other techniques include radar[86] and satellite tracking.[87]"
