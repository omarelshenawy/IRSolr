				"after": "The painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts and his second wife Mary Fraser Tytler had long been advocates of the idea of art as a force for social change. Watts had painted a series of portraits of those figures he considered to be a positive social influence, the \"Hall of Fame\", which was donated to the National Portrait Gallery.[39][n 7] As the son of a piano maker, who reportedly despised the wealthy and powerful and twice refused a baronetcy,[40] Watts had long considered a national monument to the bravery of ordinary people.[39] In August 1866, he suggested to his patron Charles Rickards that he \"erect a great statue to Unknown Worth\", and proposed erecting a colossal bronze figure. Unable to secure funds, the memorial remained unrealised.[41][n 8]",
