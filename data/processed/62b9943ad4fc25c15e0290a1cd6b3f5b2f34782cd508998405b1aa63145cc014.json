				"previous": "In his comics and animation McCay used stock ethnic stereotypes common in his era.[151] A conscious attempt to offend is not apparent.[152] He depicted blacks as savages, or wishing they could be white.[153] Most prominent were a pair of characters in Little Nemo: the ill-tempered Irishman Flip and the rarely speaking grass-skirted African Little Imp. In the animated Little Nemo, the Anglo-Saxon Nemo is shown drawn in a dignified Art Nouveau style, and controls by magic the more grotesquely caricatured Flip and Imp.[154] Women were few in McCay's work, and were depicted as superficial, jealous, and argumentative; the Princess in Little Nemo never partook in the camaraderie the males shared.[155]",
