				"previous": "As of 2006, there were an estimated 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in Asia. About Â 3â4 were fishers and the remainder fish farmers.[188] In 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) were caught in the wild.[189] This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy,[189] whose population can vary dramatically with the El NiÃ±o cycle.[190][191] The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild. The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems[192] over the most productive regions of the sea, accounting for around 87% of the annual harvest.[193] The results are sometimes dramaticâthe lull in fishing over the course of the First World War saw the North Sea's 1919 catch double 1913's[182]âand sometimes much less so: two decades on, the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10% of their peak. At present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. A number of these, as well as large predatory fish,[194] remain well below historical levels.[195]",
				"after": "Over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing.[193] Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.[196]",
