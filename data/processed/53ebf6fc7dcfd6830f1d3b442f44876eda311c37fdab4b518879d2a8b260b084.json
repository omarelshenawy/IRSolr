				"previous": "There have been two London 2012 logos: one created by Kino Design for the bidding process and a second as the brand for the Games themselves. The former was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green and red stripes winding through the text \"LONDON 2012\", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The latter, designed by Wolff Olins, was published on 4 June 2007. It is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero.[168]",
				"after": "Public reaction to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely negative; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating.[169] Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers,[170] and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo.[170][171] A segment of animated footage released at the same time as the logo was reported to trigger seizures in a small number of people with photosensitive epilepsy, and a short segment was removed from the London 2012 website in response.[172] It was suggested that the logo resembles the cartoon character Lisa Simpson performing fellatio on Bart Simpson.[173][174][175][176][177][178][179] In February 2011, Iran threatened to boycott the Olympics, complaining that the logo appeared to spell out the word \"Zion\". However, this boycott did not occur.[180]",
