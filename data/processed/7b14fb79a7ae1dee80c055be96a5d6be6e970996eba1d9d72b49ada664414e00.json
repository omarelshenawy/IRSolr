				"In 2000 Bell Atlantic merged with GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. The combined company elected to change its name to \"Verizon\", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for \"truth\") and horizon.[11] The first New York City company headquarters was at 1095 Avenue of the Americas (1997-2000) until the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger, when the headquarters moved to the Verizon Building at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, before returning to the 1095 space in 2013.[12]"

				"after": "Verizon Communications formed in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$64.7 billion merger of telephone companies Bell Atlantic and GTE, nearly two years after the businesses proposed the deal in July 1998.[13] The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers, including investing in new markets and broadband technologies.[13] The new venture was headed by co-CEOs Charles Lee, formerly the CEO of GTE, and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg.[13]",
