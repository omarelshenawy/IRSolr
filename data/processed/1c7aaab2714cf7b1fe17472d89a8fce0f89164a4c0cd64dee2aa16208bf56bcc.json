				"after": "In her fifth paper on cyclols (1937),[41] Wrinch identified the conditions under which two planar cyclol fabrics could be joined to make an angle between their planes while respecting the chemical bond angles. She identified a mathematical simplification, in which the non-planar six-membered rings of atoms can be represented by planar \"median hexagon\"s made from the midpoints of the chemical bonds. This \"median hexagon\" representation made it easy to see that the cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if the dihedral angle between the planes equals the tetrahedral bond angle Î´ = arccos(-1/3) â 109.47Â°.",
