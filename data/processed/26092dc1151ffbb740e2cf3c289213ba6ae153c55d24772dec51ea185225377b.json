				"previous": "The boy Jones was an intruder who gained entry to the palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841 as recorded by Charles Dickens some 40 years later.[80] In 1982, Michael Fagan was able to break into the palace twice, and conversed with the Queen on one of these occasions.[81] Reportedly, Her Majesty maintained her composure while the palace police were en route and Fagan made no threatening motions towards the Queen.",
				"after": "At the rear of the palace is the large and park-like garden, which together with its lake is the largest private garden in London.[82] Here the Queen hosts her annual garden parties each summer, and also holds large functions to celebrate royal milestones, such as jubilees. It covers 40 acres (16Â ha), and includes a helicopter landing area, a lake, and a tennis court.[51]",
