				"previous": "California Chrome was foaled on February 18, 2011,[1] at Harris Farms near Coalinga, California, the horse breeding division of the Harris Ranch.[8] Steve Coburn said he had a dream not long before California Chrome's birth that the foal would be a colt with four white feet and a blaze.[30] California Chrome was relatively large for a newborn horse, weighing 137 pounds (62Â kg), and active, described by Martin as \"running circles around Momma\" within two hours of birth.[31] As a foal, he was given the nickname \"Junior\" by the Martins[4] because of his resemblance to his sire, Lucky Pulpit.[32][33]",
				"after": "The Martins and Coburns chose California Chrome's official name in 2013 at Brewsters Bar & Grill in Galt, California, a town halfway between their two homes. Each of the four wrote a potential name on pieces of paper and asked a waitress to draw them out of Coburn's cowboy hat. They submitted the names to The Jockey Club ranked in the order drawn. California Chrome, Coburn's choice, was first drawn, and the registry accepted the name.[34] The word \"chrome\" in his name comes from slang for a horse with flashy white markings.[35]",
