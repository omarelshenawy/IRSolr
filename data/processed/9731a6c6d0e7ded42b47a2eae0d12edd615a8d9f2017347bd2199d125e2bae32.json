				"previous": "The reign of King Ãthelred the Unready witnessed the resumption of Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained. Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s, but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009-12, when a large part of the country was devastated by the army of Thorkell the Tall. It remained for Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013â14, and (after Ãthelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015â16. The tale of these years incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle must be read in its own right,[93] and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during Ãthelred's reign.[94] It is this evidence which the basis for Simon Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who throughout his reign tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat. The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state; and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler probably knew. It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop Ãthelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered.[95]",
				"after": "The increasingly difficult times brought on by the Viking attacks are reflected in both Ãlfric's and Wulfstan's works, but most notably in Wulfstan's fierce rhetoric in the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, dated to 1014.[96] Malcolm Godden suggests that ordinary people saw the return of the Vikings, as the imminent \"expectation of the apocalypse\", and this was given voice in Ãlfric and Wulfstan writings,[97] which is similar to that of Gildas and Bede. Raids were signs of God punishing his people, Ãlfric refers to people adopting the customs of the Danish and exhorts people not to abandon the native customs on behalf of the Danish ones, and then requests a 'brother Edward', to try to put an end to a 'shameful habit' of drinking and eating in the outhouse, which some of the countrywomen practiced at beer parties.[98]",
