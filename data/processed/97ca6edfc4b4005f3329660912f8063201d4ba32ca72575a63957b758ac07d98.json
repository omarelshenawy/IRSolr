Of this, the population in the eastern portion of the North Pacific was estimated to be 25,000 to 27,000.[81] By 1975, the estimate had declined to between 8,000 and 16,000.[62][82] Surveys conducted in 1991, 1993, 1996 and 2001 produced estimates of between 1,600 and 3,200 off California and 280 to 380 off Oregon and Washington.[83] The minimum estimate for the California-Oregon-Washington population, as defined in the U.S. Pacific Marine Mammal Stock Assessments: 2005, is about 2,500.[84] Surveys in coastal waters of British Columbia in summers 2004 and 2005 produced abundance estimates of approximately 500 animals.[85] Surveys near the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea indicated a substantial increase in the local abundance of Fin Whales between 1975â1978 and 1987â1989.[86] In 1984, the entire population was estimated to be at less than 38% of its historic carrying capacity.[87] Fin whales might have started returning to the coastal waters off British Columbia (a sighting occurred in Johnstone Strait in 2011[88]) and Kodiak Island. Size of the local population migrating to Hawaiian Archipelago is unknown. Historically, there were several other wintering grounds scattered among North Pacific in the past such as off Northern Mariana Islands, Bonin Islands, and Ryukyu Islands (for other possible habitats, see Blue whale as their habitat preferences may correspond).",
