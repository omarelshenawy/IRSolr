Pre-European settlement numbers are not known with any precision, although the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory has been estimated at \"well over 10,000\".[1] The area now known as Muckaty Station (often referred to as just \"Muckaty\", though the origin of this name and near variants such as \"Mucketty\" is unknown) was â and is â the responsibility of seven clans of traditional Indigenous owners: Milwayi, Ngapa, Ngarrka, Wirntiku, Kurrakurraja, Walanypirri and Yapayapa.[2] The country is known by the Indigenous name Warlmanpa, which is also the name of a local language.[3]",
