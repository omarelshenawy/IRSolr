The major river to flow into the sea is the Mackenzie, Canada's longest, which empties into the Canadian part of the sea, west of Tuktoyaktuk. The coastal shelf area is rather narrow, especially near and east of Point Barrow in the Alaskan part of the sea, and contains numerous submarine valleys. It becomes wider near the delta of the Mackenzie River but nowhere exceeds 145Â km (90Â mi). Near the coast, the depths are shallower than 60Â m (200Â ft) but they rapidly increase northwards up to a few kilometers, transforming into a massive platform which is geologically similar to that of the oceans. There are many small islands in the sea and in the delta of the Mackenzie River. A few larger ones lie west of the Mackenzie River, such as Herschel Island (4Â km (2.5Â mi) off the shore, area 18Â km2 (6.9Â sqÂ mi)) and Barter Island (0.3Â km (0.19Â mi) from the coast, area 13Â km2 (5.0Â sqÂ mi)). The coasts are low, with the maximum elevations between 250 and 750Â m (820 and 2,460Â ft).[2] The soil is frozen all year around at the depth below about 1Â m (3Â ft 3Â in) or less, forming permafrost, and only top few tens centimeters thaws in summer. Consequently, buildings have to be elevated above ground on wooden piles that are immersed into the permafrost.[19]",
