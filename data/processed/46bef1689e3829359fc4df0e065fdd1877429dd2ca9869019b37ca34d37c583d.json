				"after": "The Hope Diamond, also known as Le Bijou du Roi (\"the King's Jewel\"),[3] Le bleu de France (\"the Blue of France\"), and the Tavernier Blue, is a large, 45.52-carat (9.104Â g),[w][1][4][5] deep-blue diamond, and now housed in the National Gem and Mineral collection at the National Natural History Museum in Washington, D.C. It is blue to the naked eye because of trace amounts of boron within its crystal structure, and exhibits red phosphorescence after exposure to ultraviolet light.[6][7] It is classified as a Type IIb diamond, and is notorious for supposedly being cursed. It has a long recorded history, with few gaps, in which it changed hands numerous times on its way from India to France to Britain and eventually to the United States, where it has been regularly on public display since. It has been described as the \"most famous diamond in the world\".[8]",
