				"previous": "After the heights around Tskhinvali were secured, Georgian troops with tanks and artillery support entered the town.[67] Georgian shelling left parts of Tskhinvali in ruins.[69] According to Russian military commander, over 10 Russian peacekeepers were killed on 8 August.[70] That day Russia officially sent troops across the Georgian border into South Ossetia,[71] claiming to be defending both peacekeepers and South Ossetian civilians.[72] Russia accused Georgia of committing \"genocide\".[73] Russian authorities claimed that the civilian casualties in Tskhinvali amounted up to 2,000.[74] These high casualty figures were later revised down to 162 casualties.[75]",
				"after": "In five days of fighting, the Russian forces captured Tskhinvali, pushed back Georgian troops, and largely destroyed Georgiaâs military infrastructure using airstrikes deep inside Georgia proper.[76] Russian and Abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge, held by Georgia. After the retreat of the Georgian forces, the Russians temporarily occupied the cities of Poti, Gori, Senaki, and Zugdidi.[77]",
