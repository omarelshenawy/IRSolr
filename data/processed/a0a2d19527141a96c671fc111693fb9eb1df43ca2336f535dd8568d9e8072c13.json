				"previous": "Atlanta City Council voted on October 20, 2003, to change the name from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport to the current HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport, to honor former mayor Maynard Jackson, who died June 23, 2003. The council initially planned on renaming the airport solely for Mayor Jackson, but public outcry,[28] especially by Mayor Hartsfield's descendants, prompted the compromise.[29]",
				"after": "In April 2007 an \"end-around taxiway\" opened, Taxiway Victor. It is expected to save an estimated $26 million to $30 million in fuel each year by allowing airplanes landing on the northernmost runway to taxi to the gate area without preventing other aircraft from taking off. The taxiway drops about 30 feet (9.1Â m) from runway elevation to allow takeoffs to continue.[30]",
