				"previous": "The script was written in six days at DalÃ­'s home in CadaquÃ©s. In a letter to a friend written in February 1929, BuÃ±uel described the writing process: \"We had to look for the plot line. DalÃ­ said to me, 'I dreamed last night of ants swarming around in my hands', and I said, 'Good Lord, and I dreamed that I had sliced somebody or other's eye. There's the film, let's go and make it.'\"[46] In deliberate contrast to the approach taken by Jean Epstein and his peers, which was to never leave anything in their work to chance, with every aesthetic decision having a rational explanation and fitting clearly into the whole,[47] BuÃ±uel and DalÃ­ made a cardinal point of eliminating all logical associations.[48] In BuÃ±uel's words: \"Our only rule was very simple: no idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted. We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us, without trying to explain why\".[22]:p.104",
				"after": "It was BuÃ±uel's intention to shock and insult the intellectual bourgeoisie of his youth, later saying: \"Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what in those days was called âavant-garde,â which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audienceâs reason.â[50] Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a huge success amongst the French bourgeoisie,[51] leading BuÃ±uel to exclaim in exasperation, \"What can I do about the people who adore all that is new, even when it goes against their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?\"[52]",
