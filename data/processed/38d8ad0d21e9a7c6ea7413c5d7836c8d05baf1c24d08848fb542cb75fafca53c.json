For example, the German Wikipedia maintains \"stable versions\" of articles,[24] which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012.[25] Under this system, new users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are \"subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication\".[26]",
