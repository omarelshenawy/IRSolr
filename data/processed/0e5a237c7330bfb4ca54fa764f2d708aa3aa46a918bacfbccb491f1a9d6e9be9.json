				"previous": "Beginning in 1964, Romania took a more independent course.[85] While it did not repudiate either Comecon or the Warsaw Pact, it ceased to play a significant role in either.[85] Nicolae CeauÈescu's assumption of leadership one year later pushed Romania even further in the direction of separateness.[85] Albania, which had become increasingly isolated under Stalinist leader Enver Hoxha following de-Stalinization, withdrew from the Warsaw Pact in 1968[86] following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.[87]",
				"after": "In 1917, Russia restricted emigration by instituting passport controls and forbidding the exit of belligerent nationals.[88] In 1922, after the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, both the Ukrainian SSR and the Russian SFSR issued general rules for travel that foreclosed virtually all departures, making legal emigration impossible.[89] Border controls thereafter strengthened such that, by 1928, even illegal departure was effectively impossible.[89] This later included internal passport controls, which when combined with individual city Propiska (\"place of residence\") permits, and internal freedom of movement restrictions often called the 101st kilometre, greatly restricted mobility within even small areas of the Soviet Union.[90]",
