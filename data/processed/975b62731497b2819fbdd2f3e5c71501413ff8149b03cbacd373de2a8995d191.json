				"previous": "The excavations have revealed information about the original priory buildings and grounds, and how they were subsequently modified.[62] A series of ditches was found that would have provided a supply of fresh water and also a means for drainage of a relatively wet site.[63] Evidence of the earliest temporary timber buildings in which the canons were originally housed was found in the form of 12th-century post pits. Norton Priory is one of few monastic sites to have produced evidence of temporary quarters.[64] The remains of at least seven temporary buildings have been discovered. It is considered that the largest of these, because it had more substantial foundations than the others, was probably the timber-framed church; another was most likely the gatehouse, and the other buildings provided accommodation for the canons and the senior secular craftsmen.[65]",
				"after": "The earliest masonry building was the church, which was constructed on shallow foundations of sandstone rubble and pebbles on boulder clay. The walls were built in local red sandstone with ashlar faces and a rubble and mortar core.[66] The ground plan of the original church was cruciform, and consisted of a nave without aisles, a choir at the crossing with a tower above it, a square-ended chancel, and north and south transepts, each with an eastern chapel. The total length of the church was 148 feet (45.1Â m) and the total length across the transepts was 74 feet (22.6Â m), giving a ratio of 2:1. The walls of the church were 5 feet (1.5Â m) wide at the base, and the crossing tower was supported on four piers.[67][68]",
