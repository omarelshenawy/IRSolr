				"previous": "Traditional religions were often animist. Some also tended to have elements of Veneration of the dead, though generalisation is suspect given the extreme heterogeneity of Melanesian societies. Prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in masalai, or evil spirits, which are blamed for \"poisoning\" people, causing calamity and death, and the practice of puripuri (sorcery).[61][62]",
