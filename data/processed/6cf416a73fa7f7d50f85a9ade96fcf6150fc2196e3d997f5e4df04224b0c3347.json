				"previous": "To prove this is true in general, suppose P is a polynomial of degree N having the property described, that is, it gives rise to an error function that has NÂ +Â 2 extrema, of alternating signs and equal magnitudes. The red graph to the right shows what this error function might look like for NÂ =Â 4. Suppose Q(x) (whose error function is shown in blue to the right) is another N-degree polynomial that is a better approximation to f than P. In particular, Q is closer to f than P for each value xi where an extreme of Pâf occurs, so",
				"after": "When a maximum of Pâf occurs at xi, then",
