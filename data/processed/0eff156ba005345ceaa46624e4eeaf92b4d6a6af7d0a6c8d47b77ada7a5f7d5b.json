				"after": "The animation combines editorial cartooning techniques with live-action-like sequences,[23] and is considered McCay's most realistic effort; the intertitles emphasized that the film was a \"historical record\" of the event. McCay animated the action in what animation historian Donald Crafton describes as a \"realistic graphic style\".[36] The film has a dark mood and strong propagandist feel. It depicts the terrifying fates of the passengers, such as the drowning of children[33] and human chains of passengers jumping to their deaths.[37] The artwork is highly detailed, the animation fluid and naturalistic.[33] McCay used alternating shots to simulate the feel of a newsreel,[5] which reinforced the film's realistic feel.[36]",
