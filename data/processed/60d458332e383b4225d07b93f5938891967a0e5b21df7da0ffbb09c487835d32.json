				"previous": "Suppose the geometric algebra with the familiar positive definite inner product on Rn is formed. Given a plane (2-dimensional subspace) of Rn, one can find an orthonormal basis {b1,b2} spanning the plane, and thus find a unit pseudoscalar I = b1b2 representing this plane. The geometric product of any two vectors in the span of b1 and b2 lies in , that is, it is the sum of a 0-vector and a 2-vector.",
				"after": "It is sometimes possible to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in the real algebra that square to â1, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.",
