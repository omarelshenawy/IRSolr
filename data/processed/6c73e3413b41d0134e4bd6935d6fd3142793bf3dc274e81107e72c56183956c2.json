PedroÂ II was seen nationwide as a legitimate source of authority, whose position placed him above partisanship and petty disputes. He was, however, still no more than a boy, and a shy, insecure and immature one.[38] His nature resulted from his broken childhood, when he experienced abandonment, intrigue and betrayal.[39] Behind the scenes, a group of high ranking palace servants and notable politicians led by Aureliano Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba) became known as the \"Courtier Faction\" as they established influence over the young Emperor. Some were very close to him, such as Mariana de Verna and Steward Paulo Barbosa da Silva.[40] PedroÂ II was deftly used by the Courtiers against their actual or suspected foes.[41]",
