				"after": "The Renaissance marks the period of European history at the close of the Middle Ages and the rise of the Modern world. It represents a cultural rebirth from the 14th through the middle of the 17th centuries. Early Renaissance, mostly in Italy, bridges the art period during the fifteenth century, between the Middle Ages and the High Renaissance in Italy. It is generally known that Renaissance matured in Northern Europe later, in the 16th century.[49] One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267â1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377â1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404â1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.[50]",
