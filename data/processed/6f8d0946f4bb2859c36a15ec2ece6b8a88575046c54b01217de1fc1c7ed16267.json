				"previous": "Many places of learning and cultureâuniversities, schools, libraries, museums, theaters and cinemasâwere either closed or designated as \"Nur fÃ¼r Deutsche\" (For Germans Only). Twenty-five museums and a host of other institutions were destroyed during the war.[24] According to one estimate, by war's end 43% of the infrastructure of Poland's educational and research institutions and 14% of its museums had been destroyed.[27] According to another, only 105 of pre-war Poland's 175Â museums survived the war, and just 33 of these institutions were able to reopen.[28] Of pre-war Poland's 603Â scientific institutions, about half were totally destroyed, and only a few survived the war relatively intact.[29]",
				"after": "Many university professors, as well as teachers, lawyers, artists, writers, priests and other members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed, or transported to concentration camps, during operations such as AB-Aktion. This particular campaign resulted in the infamous Sonderaktion Krakau[31] and the massacre of LwÃ³w professors.[22][32] During World War II Poland lost 39% to 45% of its physicians and dentists, 26% to 57% of its lawyers, 15% to 30% of its teachers, 30% to 40% of its scientists and university professors, and 18% to 28% of its clergy.[2][33] The Jewish intelligentsia was exterminated altogether. The reasoning behind this policy was clearly articulated by a Nazi gauleiter: \"In my district, [any Pole who] shows signs of intelligence will be shot.\"[22]",
