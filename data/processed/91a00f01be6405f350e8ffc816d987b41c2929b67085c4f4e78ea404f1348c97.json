				"previous": "The next decade was considered a great one for Colombian aviation, and Panama's flag carrier, Copa Airlines, was interested in entering the Colombian market. After negotiating for several companies, including entering the auction for bankrupt Avianca, Copa acquired 90% percent of AeroRepÃºblica.",
				"after": "With this acquisition, AeroRepÃºblica began a corporate, and image, makeover, and changes to the fleet. The first step came when the former president of the airline's board, Alfonso Avila Velandia, resigned and was succeeded by Roberto Junguito. AeroRepÃºblica adopted a livery and a corporate logo similar to Copa's, and Continental's (now United), and started the gradual retirement of its MD-80 fleet, ordering 15 modern Embraer E-190 aircraft, and acquiring 10 of the 18 older Boeing 737-700s from Copa's fleet.",
