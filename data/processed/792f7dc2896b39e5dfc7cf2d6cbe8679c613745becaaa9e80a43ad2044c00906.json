				"after": "The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's suffrage activist from New York City, to investigate the lynching.[65] She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event.[66] She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them.[67] Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed the challenge of the investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north.[68] Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders.[68] Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.[69]",
