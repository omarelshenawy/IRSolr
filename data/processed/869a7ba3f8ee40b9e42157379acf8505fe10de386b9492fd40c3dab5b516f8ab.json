				"after": "The adult magpie is a fairly solid, sturdy bird ranging from 37 to 43Â cm (14.5â17Â in) in length with a 65â85Â cm (26â33Â in) wingspan, and weighing 220â350Â g (8â12Â oz).[22] Its robust wedge-shaped bill is bluish-white bordered with black, with a small hook at the tip. The black legs are long and strong.[28] The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, in contrast to the yellow eyes of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows.[29] The main difference between the subspecies lies in the \"saddle\" markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape.[22] White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies dorsalis is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.[29]",
