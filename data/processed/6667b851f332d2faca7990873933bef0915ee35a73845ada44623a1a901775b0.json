Advertising revenues from AdWords generate almost all of the company's profits. The company was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while both attended Stanford University. Together, Brin and Page own about 16 percent of the company's stake. Google was first incorporated as a privately held company on SeptemberÂ 4, 1998, and its initial public offering followed on AugustÂ 19, 2004. The company's mission statement from the outset was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\" and the company's unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\". In 2006, the company moved to its current headquarters in Mountain View, California.",
