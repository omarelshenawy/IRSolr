				"previous": "In World War II the three worst disasters were the loss of the Cunarder Lancastria in 1940 off Saint-Nazaire to German bombing while attempting to evacuate troops of the British Expeditionary Force from France, with the loss of more than 3,000 lives; the sinking of Wilhelm Gustloff with more than 9,000 lives lost; and the sinking of Cap Arcona with more than 7,000 lives lost, both in the Baltic Sea, in 1945.",
				"after": "Ocean liners were also used in World War II as troopships. Normandie caught fire, capsized and sank in New York in 1942 while being converted for troop duty. Many of the superliners of the 'twenties and 'thirties were victims of U-boats, mines or enemy aircraft. Empress of Britain was attacked by German planes, then torpedoed by a U-boat when tugs tried to tow her to safety.[28] She was the largest British ocean liner to sink during World War II. In 1941, Germany's speed queen, Bremen, fell victim to an arsonist, believed to be a disgruntled crew member, and became a total loss. Italy's giants, Rex and Conte di Savoia, were respectively destroyed by the Royal Air Force and the retreating German forces. The United States lost the American President Lines vessel President Coolidge when she steamed into an Allied mine in the South Pacific. No shipping line was left untouched by World War II.",
