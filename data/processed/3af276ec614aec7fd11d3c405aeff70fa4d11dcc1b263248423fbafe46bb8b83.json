				"A short-lived designation used from 1935â1936 to refer to three long-range bomber projects commissioned by the Army Air Corps. Most of the bombers were night bombers.",
				"Until 1926, the Army Air Service had three sequences for bombers. Light bombers were indicated by the LB- prefix, medium bombers by the B- prefix, and heavy bombers by the HB- prefix. In 1926, the three-category system was scrapped and all bombers subsequently built were placed in the B- sequence."
