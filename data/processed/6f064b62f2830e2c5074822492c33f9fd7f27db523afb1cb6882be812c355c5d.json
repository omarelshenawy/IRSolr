				"previous": "In the early 10th century, AbÅ« Zayd al-BalkhÄ«, a Persian originally from Balkh, founded the \"BalkhÄ« school\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.[45] SuhrÄb, a late 10th-century Persian geographer, accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map, with equirectangular projection or cylindrical equidistant projection.[45] In the early 11th century, Avicenna hypothesized on the geological causes of mountains in The Book of Healing (1027).",
				"after": "In mathematical geography, Persian AbÅ« RayhÄn al-BÄ«rÅ«nÄ«, around 1025, was the first to describe a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere.[46] He was also regarded as the most skilled when it came to mapping cities and measuring the distances between them, which he did for many cities in the Middle East and western Indian subcontinent. He combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations to record degrees of latitude and longitude and to measure the heights of mountains and depths of valleys, recorded in The Chronology of the Ancient Nations. He discussed human geography and the planetary habitability of the Earth, suggesting that roughly a quarter of the Earth's surface is habitable by humans. He solved a complex geodesic equation in order to accurately compute the Earth's circumference.[47] His estimate of 6,339.9Â km for the Earth radius was only 16.8Â km less than the modern value of 6,356.7Â km.",
