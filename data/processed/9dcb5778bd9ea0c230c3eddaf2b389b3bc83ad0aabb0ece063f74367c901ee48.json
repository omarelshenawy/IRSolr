				"after": "The Scottish education system has always remained distinct from the rest of United Kingdom, with a characteristic emphasis on a broad education.[225] In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \"perfyct Latyne\", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite.[226] In the Reformation the 1560 First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible.[227] In 1616 an act in Privy council commanded every parish to establish a school.[228] By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.[229] Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the Education Act (1872).[230]",
