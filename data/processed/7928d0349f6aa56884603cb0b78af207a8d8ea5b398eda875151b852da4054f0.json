				"previous": "The effect of this mapping is to displace every point horizontally by an amount proportionally to its coordinate. Any point above the -axis is displaced to the right (increasing ) if , and to the left if . Points below the -axis move in the opposite direction, while points on the axis stay fixed.",
				"after": "If the coordinates of a point are written as a column vector (a 2Ã1 matrix), the shear mapping can be written as multiplication by a 2Ã2 matrix:",
