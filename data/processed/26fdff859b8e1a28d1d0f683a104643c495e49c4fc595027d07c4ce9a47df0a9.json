				"after": "Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States (2009), is consumed in the form of zinc compounds;[98] a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints, and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber. It is also used as a heat disperser for the rubber and acts to protect its polymers from ultraviolet radiation (the same UV protection is conferred to plastics containing zinc oxide).[16] The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products.[120] The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.[121]",
