The phrase inspired him to write the song.[141] A sculpture of an impossibly large redback, one of Australia's big things, was built in 1996 at Eight Mile Plains, Queensland.[142] The Angels 1991 album Red Back Fever takes its name from the spider.[143][144] Matilda Bay Brewing Company produces a wheat beer called Redback,[145] with the distinctive red stripe as the logo.[146] The redback appears in the name and emblem of the South Australia cricket team.[147][148] The Airborne Redback, an Australian ultralight trike, was also named after the spider.[149] Redback Boots is an Australian workboot manufacturing company,[150] which uses the spider in its name and logo.[151] In 2006 a redback spider stamp was designed as part of a \"Dangerous Australians\" stamp series, but was withheld from general circulation by Australia Post due to concerns that the realistic depiction would scare people opening their letter boxes.[152]",
