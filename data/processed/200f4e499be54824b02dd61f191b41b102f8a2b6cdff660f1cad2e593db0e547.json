				"after": "The spectral signature of hematite was seen on the planet Mars by the infrared spectrometer on the NASA Mars Global Surveyor (\"MGS\") and 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft in orbit around Mars.[12] The mineral was seen in abundance at two sites[13] on the planet, the Terra Meridiani site, near the Martian equator at 0Â° longitude, and the Aram Chaos site near the Valles Marineris.[14] Several other sites also showed hematite, e.g., Aureum Chaos.[15] Because terrestrial hematite is typically a mineral formed in aqueous environments or by aqueous alteration, this detection was scientifically interesting enough that the second of the two Mars Exploration Rovers was sent to a site in the Terra Meridiani region designated Meridiani Planum. In-situ investigations by the Opportunity rover showed a significant amount of hematite, much of it in the form of small spherules that were informally named \"blueberries\" by the science team. Analysis indicates that these spherules are apparently concretions formed from a water solution. \"Knowing just how the hematite on Mars was formed will help us characterize the past environment and determine whether that environment was favorable for life\".[16]",
