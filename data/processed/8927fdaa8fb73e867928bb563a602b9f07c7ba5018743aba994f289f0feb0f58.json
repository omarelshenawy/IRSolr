				"previous": "HabrÃ© consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule.[21][22] The president favoured his own Daza ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa. His general, Idriss DÃ©by, overthrew him in 1990.[23] Attempts to prosecute HabrÃ© led to his placement under house arrest in Senegal in 2005; in 2013, HabrÃ© was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule.[24]",
				"after": "DÃ©by attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, DÃ©by easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later.[25] Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. DÃ©by unilaterally modified the constitution to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.[26]",
