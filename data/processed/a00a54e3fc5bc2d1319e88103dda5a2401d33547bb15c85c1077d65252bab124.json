After each modification, the Association provides an updated simplified presentation of the alphabet in the form of a chart. (See History of the IPA.) The most recent official chart, from 2005, is presented above. Not all aspects of the alphabet can be accommodated in a chart. The indefinitely large number of tone letters, for example, make a full accounting impractical, and only a few examples are shown.",
