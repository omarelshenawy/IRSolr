				"previous": "The Harris Theater is located beneath and directly north of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Millennium Park's outdoor performance venue. The theater and pavilion were built adjacent to each other at about the same time, with the benefit that they share a loading dock, rehearsal rooms and other backstage facilities.[34][38] The entire auditorium is in a cube 100 feet (30.5Â m) on a side, so all the seats are relatively close to the stage.[30] The seating capacity is 1525,[28] with approximately 600Â main floor seats, 500Â raised orchestra level seats and 400Â balcony seats. The modern orchestra pit, which can be closed,[39] accommodates 45Â musicians.[30] The seats are maplewood; carpeting and walls have a muted color schemeâblacks, charcoals and grays.[39] Kamin felt the modest palette is appropriate for a modest structure that attempts to complement the exuberant neighboring pavilion.[34]",
				"after": "The proscenium is 30 feet (9.1Â m) high and is flanked by 75-foot (22.9Â m) steel reflector towers to help focus sound.[30][39] The stage is both 45 feet (13.7Â m) wide and deep, with 75 feet (22.9Â m) of flyspace above.[28][30] The offstage right distance is 26 feet (7.9Â m), while offstage left is 27Â feet 10Â inches (8.5Â m).[28] The theater's sightlines and acoustics provide \"an unusually modern and stainless-steel bolstered environment\" for experiencing performances according to the Centerstage City Guide.[35]",
