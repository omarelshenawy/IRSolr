The Viet Minh entered a trap. Caught for the first time in the open and actually forced to fight the French head-on, without the ability to quickly hide and retreat, they were mown down by concentrated French artillery and machine gun fire. By January 16, the Battle of VÄ©nh YÃªn ended as GiÃ¡p was forced to withdraw, with over 6,000 of his troops killed, 8,000 wounded and 500 captured.[citation needed]",
