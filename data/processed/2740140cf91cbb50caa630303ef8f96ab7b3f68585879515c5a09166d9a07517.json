				"previous": "As a magnet school founded to promote school integration, racial and economic diversity have been important factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1Â percent black, 41.7Â percent low income, and 7.7Â percent disabled in 2009â10.[107] In 2007, in response to a US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions.[108][109] School officials insist this will have little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.[109]",
				"after": "The curriculum is designed to prepare students for professional careers in the arts. Each student concentrates in at least one major area: creative writing, dance, drama, music, stagecraft, and visual art. Younger students often concentrate in two or more. High school students are required to specialize and major only in the areas in which they have potential to do professional work.[110] Advanced students study up to two hours each day in their major. Forty percent of the students stay at least two hours after school for rehearsals, private lessons, and productions.[53]",
