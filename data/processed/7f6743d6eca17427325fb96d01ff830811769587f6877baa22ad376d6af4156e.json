				"previous": "As it is expected to be operating 170 aircraft in 2020, Vietnam Airlines is aiming to become the second-largest full-service carrier in Southeast Asia.[91] The airline is interested in launching services to the United States, where more than 1.2Â million Vietnamese reside.[92] Such plans have been confirmed in December 2003, but have since been postponed because Vietnam is not yet part of Federal Aviation Administration's International Aviation Safety Assessment Program.[93] Vietnam Airlines also considered \"opening new routes such as Ho Chi Minh City/Hanoi, VietnamâLondon; Ho Chi Minh City/HanoiâShanghai/Beijing, China; Ho Chi Minh CityâMumbai; Ho Chi Minh CityâBrisbane; and Ho Chi Minh CityâDoha\", according to CEO Pham Ngoc Minh in 2008.[94]",
				"after": "While the airline had launched flights to London-Gatwick,[95] Beijing[96] and Shanghai,[97] there are currently no flights to Mumbai, Doha, and Brisbane. The airline also plans to re-open flights to Berlin, and commence flights to Adelaide, Perth, Amsterdam, Milan, Prague, Mandalay, Dalian, Nanjing, Hangzhou and African cities; by 2020, Vietnam Airlines is expected to serve 53 international destinations, up from 27 in 2011.[98] By 2020, Vietnam Airlines plans to increase its annual revenue to US$7Â billionÂ â up from $1.86Â billion in 2010Â â by carrying 620,000 tonnes of cargo and 35 million passengers, using a fleet of 163 aircraft (later revised to 41 million passengers using 170 aircraft).[99] It aims to capture a 45% market share of Vietnam's aviation market. During its first 15 years of operation, from 1996 to 2010, Vietnam Airlines carried a total of 82Â million passengers on 678,550 flights.[100] In addition, Vietnam Airlines plans to transfer most of its international operations from its current hub, Tan Son Nhat International Airport, to the proposed Long Thanh International Airport. With a cost of approximately US$6Â billion,[101][102] the airport will, according to Vietnamese authorities, help Vietnam Airlines boost its operations internationally as it seeks to bypass Thailand as the dominant gateway to the Greater-Mekong region.[103] London operations were transferred from Gatwick to Heathrow in early 2015Â (2015). The airline plans to operate Boeing 787 aircraft to this destination since JulyÂ 2015Â (2015-07).[104]",
