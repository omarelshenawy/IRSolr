				"previous": "Existing external hardpoints would be modified to allow multiple conventional weapons to be carried, increasing overall loadout. For air-to-air defense, an Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar would be added and some existing hardpoints modified to carry air-to-air missiles. If needed the B-1R could escape from unfavorable air-to-air encounters with its MachÂ 2+ speed. Few aircraft are currently capable of sustained speeds over MachÂ 2.[144]",
