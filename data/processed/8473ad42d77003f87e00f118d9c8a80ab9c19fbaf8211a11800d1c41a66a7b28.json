				"previous": "3 RAR served two tours in South Vietnam, the first during 1967 and 1968 saw the battalion stationed in Phuoc Tuy Province.[13] The battalion took part in several operations and was involved in mine clearing, counter mortar and rocket tasks and reconnaissance in force operations. As the ready reaction force at the 1ATF base 'A' Company 3 RAR was responsible for clearing and securing the nearby provincial capital of Ba Ria (Phuoc Le) during the Tet Offensive of February 1968. The battalion was then committed to Operation Coburg in February and March.[14] During 26â28 May 1968, 3 RAR, while stationed at FSB Balmoral in a battalion defensive position, withstood two determined assaults by regimental sized units of the North Vietnamese Army during the Battle of CoralâBalmoral.[15] During its first tour of Vietnam the battalion lost 24 killed and 93 wounded.[16] In 1971 the battalion returned to Phuoc Tuy Province. During the second tour the battalion took part in several actions before returning to Australia by the end of 1971 after an eight month tour.[17] During these operations 3 RAR lost four killed and 27 wounded.[16]",
				"after": "A move to Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney, contemplated since returning from operations in South Vietnam, was conducted at the end of 1981. In December 1983, the battalion assumed responsibility for the Australian Army's conventional Airborne forces capability (previously, D Company 6 RAR had maintained an airborne company).[18][19] In 1985, the battalion was granted permission to wear the dull Cherry beret, common to all parachute units worldwide, and to wear parachute wings identical to those worn by the 1st Australian Parachute Battalion during the Second World War. From 1989, 3 RAR formed the main combat elements of the Parachute Battalion Group,[10] which also included an engineer troop, signals detachment, artillery battery, and medical support, including a parachute surgical team.[20] Attached in direct support, A Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery was equipped with 105-mm L118 Hamel guns.[21]",
