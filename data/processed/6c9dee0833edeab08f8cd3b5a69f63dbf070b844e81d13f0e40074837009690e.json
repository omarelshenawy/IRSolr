				"after": "A 2005 study indicated that Massospondylus' sister taxon, Plateosaurus, exhibited growth patterns affected by environmental factors. The study indicated that, when food was plentiful or when the climate was favorable, Plateosaurus exhibited accelerated growth. This pattern of growth is called \"developmental plasticity\". It is unseen in other dinosaurs, including Massospondylus, despite the close relationship between the two. The study indicated that Massospondylus grew along a specific growth trajectory, with little variation in the growth rate and ultimate size of an individual.[52] Another study of age determination indicated that Massospondylus grew at a maximum rate of 34.6Â kg (76.3Â lb) per year and was still growing at around 15 years of age.[56]",
