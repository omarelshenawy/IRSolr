				"after": "During the period of the Bidahochi deposition, a large lake basin covered much of northeastern Arizona. The older (lower) layers of the formation consist of fluvial and lacustrine (lake-related) deposits of silt, sand, and clay. The younger (upper) Bidahochi contains ash and lava from volcanoes that erupted nearby and as far away as southwestern Nevada.[11] Although much of the Bidahochi has since eroded, a small part of it outcrops in the northern part of the parkâon Pilot Rock in the parkâs wilderness section and along the rim of the Painted Desert between Pintado and Tawa points.[12] Exposed by erosion of the Bidahochi are volcanic landforms called maars (flat-bottomed, roughly circular volcanic craters of explosive origin). A maar vent can be seen from the Pintado Point lookout.[11]",
