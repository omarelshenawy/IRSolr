				"after": "The green and golden bell frog breeds in the warmer months from October to March, although some cases have been recorded earlier at the end of winter. Reproduction appears to be influenced by geography. More southerly and highland populations appear to have a shorter window for breeding than their more northerly and lowland counterparts. The latter appear commence breeding earlier and end later than the former group.[18] During the breeding season, males call, usually while floating in the water, but sometimes on vegetation at the side of a pond, mainly at night. They do so with a deep growl that has been described as a four-part \"walk-walk sound\"âlikened to the sound of a motorbike changing gears.[16][18] Males have been found to respond to recordings of the call, and this is why entire groups of males will then call in unison.[18] Males are also more likely to call under certain temperature ranges, 16â23Â Â°C for water temperature, and 14â25Â Â°C in the air. Calling is also more likely immediately after rain has occurred.[33]",
