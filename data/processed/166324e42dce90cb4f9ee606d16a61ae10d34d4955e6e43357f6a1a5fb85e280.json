				"after": "A wingtip fence refers to the winglets used in some Airbus airplane models which include surfaces extending both above and below the wingtip as described in Whitcomb's early research.[10] Both surfaces are shorter than or equivalent to a winglet possessing similar aerodynamic benefits. Wingtip fences were the preferred wingtip device of Airbus for many years, employed on all their airliners except for the Airbus A320 Enhanced (using winglets), A330 and A340 families. The A350 and Airbus A320neo family will also make use of winglets rather than wingtip fences.[citation needed] The An-158 also uses wingtip fences.[citation needed]",
