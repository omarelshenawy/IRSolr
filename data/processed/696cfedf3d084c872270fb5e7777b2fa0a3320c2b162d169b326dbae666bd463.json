				"after": "With captain Johnson and vice captain Miller, the main spinner and one of the two leading fast bowlers retiring upon their return from the subcontinent,[53] Australia moved into uncharted territory and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England.[10] The 1956â57 Australian season was purely domestic and a chance for the players to stake their claims to be part of Australia's future.[10] Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort helped set up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.[13]",
