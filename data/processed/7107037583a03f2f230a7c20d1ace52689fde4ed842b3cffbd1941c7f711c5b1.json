				"after": "The Old World sparrow genus Passer is a group of small passerine birds that is believed to have originated in Africa, and which contains 15â25 species depending on the authority.[10] Its members are typically found in open, lightly wooded, habitats, although several species, notably the house sparrow (P. domesticus) have adapted to human habitations. Most species in the genus are typically 10â20Â cm (4â8Â in) long, predominantly brown or greyish birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks. They are primarily ground-feeding seed-eaters, although they also consume invertebrates, especially when breeding.[11] Genetic studies show that the Eurasian tree sparrow diverged from the other Eurasian members of its genus relatively early, before the speciation of the house, plain-backed and Spanish sparrows.[12][13] The Eurasian species is not closely related to the American tree sparrow (Spizella arborea), which is an American sparrow.[14]",
