				"after": "With his ranks swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco made another attempt to capture Madrid in January and February 1937, but was again unsuccessful. The Battle of MÃ¡laga started in mid-January, and this Nationalist offensive in Spain's southeast would turn into a disaster for the Republicans, who were poorly organised and armed. The city was taken by Franco on 8 February.[172] The consolidation of various militias into the Republican Army had started in December 1936.[173] The main Nationalist advance to cross the Jarama river and cut the supply of Madrid by the Valencia road, termed the Battle of Jarama, led to heavy casualties (6,000â20,000) on both sides. The operation's main objective was not met, though Nationalists gained a modest amount of territory.[174]",
