				"previous": "The force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:[dubious â discuss][citation needed] (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force[dubious â discuss][citation needed], which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference. At the equator, the force of gravity is the weakest due to the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation. The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780Â m/s2 at the Equator to about 9.832Â m/s2 at the poles.",
				"after": "Under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, Newton's law of universal gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is the mass of the body and g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81Â m/s2 on Earth. This resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this g. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first 1â20 of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12Â mm); by 2â20 it has dropped at total of 4 units; by 3â20, 9 units and so on.",
