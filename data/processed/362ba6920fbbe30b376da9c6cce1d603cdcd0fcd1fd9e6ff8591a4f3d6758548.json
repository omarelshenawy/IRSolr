				"after": "Thermal barrier ceramic coatings are becoming more common in automotive applications. They are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, exhaust headers, downpipes and tailpipes. This process is also known as \"exhaust heat management\". When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore reducing the intake air temperature.",
