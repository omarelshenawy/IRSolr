				"previous": "Apart from having a significantly shorter fuselage and one fewer cabin door per side, the 747SP differs from other 747 variants in having simplified flaps and a taller vertical tail[6] to counteract the decrease in yaw moment-arm from the shortened fuselage. The 747SP uses single-piece flaps on the trailing edges, rather than the smaller triple-slotted flaps of standard 747s. The SP was also the firstâ and until the introduction of the Boeing 777-200LR (and eventually the 787-8) the onlyâBoeing wide-body with a wingspan greater than the length of the fuselage. The SP could accommodate 230 passengers in a 3-class cabin or 331 in a (303 economy, 28 business) 2-class cabin, and a maximum of 440 passengers in one class.",
				"after": "Forty-five 747SP aircraft were built between 1974 and 1989. As of February 2013, 18 are still flying, 18 have been scrapped, and 9 are in storage, awaiting salvage or on display in museums.[10]",
