				"previous": "The new uniforms were adopted while Raymond James Stadium was still under construction, and the new colors would be prominent at the new facility. This new color scheme closely resembled that of the Tampa Bay Bandits, the USFL team that played in the region from 1983 to 1985 and had a color scheme of red, silver, black and white.",
				"after": "The new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white pants. The red-on-white combination has been used sparingly, but was brought back for a SNF home game against the Seattle Seahawks in 2008, and it was worn again against the following teams and years; a home game against the New Orleans Saints in 2009, both road and home games against the Carolina Panthers in 2010, and a home game against the Houston Texans in 2011. The Buccaneers reverted to pewter pants with both jerseys under former head coach Greg Schiano.",
