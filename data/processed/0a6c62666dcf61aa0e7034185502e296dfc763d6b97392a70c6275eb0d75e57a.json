				"previous": "In March 2005, John Reid called BBC TV Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman a \"West London wanker,\" after Paxman introduced him in an interview as \"an all-purpose attack dog\" who \"came out snarling and spent less time promoting Labour policy than trying to put the opposition into intensive care\". Paxman later accused Reid of having a chip on his shoulder and Reid accused Paxman of class prejudice.[49]",
			"after": [
				"Following the incumbent Labour Party's 2005 general election victory, John Reid was appointed Secretary of State for Defence. He replaced Geoff Hoon.[50]",
				"At Defence Reid argued that \"democracy, restraint and respect for the rule of law are at the core of our national beliefsâ¦ even if they create a short-term tactical disadvantage, they represent a long-term strategic advantage â by basing our actions on principle, law, morality and right\".[51] At the same time he raised questions about \"the adequacy of the international legal framework in the light of modern developments in conflict\". He suggested that \"the body of relevant international rules and conventions should, where beneficial, be strengthened\", especially \"to cope with conflict against non-state actors such as the international terroristâ¦ this means extending, not reducing, such conventions\".[51]"
