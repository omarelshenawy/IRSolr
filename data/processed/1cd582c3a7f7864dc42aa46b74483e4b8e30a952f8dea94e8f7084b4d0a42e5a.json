				"At 462,840Â km2 (178,704Â sqÂ mi), Papua New Guinea is the world's fifty-fourth largest country. Including all its islands, it lies between latitudes 0Â° and 12Â°S, and longitudes 140Â° and 160Â°E.",
				"The country's geography is diverse and, in places, extremely rugged. A spine of mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, runs the length of the island of New Guinea, forming a populous highlands region mostly covered with tropical rainforest, and the long Papuan Peninsula, known as the 'Bird's Tail'. Dense rainforests can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large wetland areas surrounding the Sepik and Fly rivers. This terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure. Some areas are accessible only on foot or by aeroplane.[citation needed] The highest peak is Mount Wilhelm at 4,509 metres (14,793Â ft). Papua New Guinea is surrounded by coral reefs which are under close watch, in the interests of preservation."
