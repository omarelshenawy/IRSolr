				"previous": "Capital or small capital Roman numerals are widely used in Romance languages to denote centuries, e.g. the French xviiie siÃ¨cle[26] and the Spanish siglo XVIII mean \"18th century\". Slavic languages in and adjacent to Russia similarly favour Roman numerals (XVIII Ð²ÐµÐº). On the other hand, in Slavic languages in Central Europe, like most Germanic languages, one writes \"18.\" (with a period) before the local word for \"century\".",
				"after": "In many European countries, mixed Roman and Hindu-Arabic numerals are used to record dates (especially in formal letters and official documents, but also on tombstones). The month is written in Roman numerals, while the day is in Hindu-Arabic numerals: 14.VI.1789 is 14 June 1789.",
