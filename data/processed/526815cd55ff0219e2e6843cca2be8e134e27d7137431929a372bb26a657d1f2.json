				"previous": "For example, the stressâenergy tensor is a second-order tensor field containing energyâmomentum densities, energyâmomentum fluxes, and shear stresses, of a mass-energy distribution. The differential form of energy-momentum conservation in general relativity states that the covariant divergence of the stress-energy tensor is zero:",
				"after": "This is an important constraint on the form the Einstein field equations take in general relativity.[4]",
