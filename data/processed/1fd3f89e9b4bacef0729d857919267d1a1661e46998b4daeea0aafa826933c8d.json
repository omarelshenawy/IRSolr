				"after": "Antimony is a silver-white solid with a blue tint and a brilliant lustre.[334] It has a density of 6.697 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more so than arsenic; less so than iron; about the same as copper).[333] It is stable in air and moisture at room temperature. It is attacked by concentrated nitric acid, yielding the hydrated pentoxide Sb2O5. Aqua regia gives the pentachloride SbCl5 and hot concentrated sulfuric acid results in the sulfate Sb2(SO4)3.[361] It is not affected by molten alkali.[362] Antimony is capable of displacing hydrogen from water, when heated: 2 Sb + 3 H2O â Sb2O3 + 3 H2.[363] It melts at 631Â Â°C. Antimony is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.1 Ã 104Â Sâ¢cmâ1[364] and a band overlap of 0.16Â eV.[338][n 37] Liquid antimony is a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity of around 5.3 Ã 104Â Sâ¢cmâ1.[366]",
