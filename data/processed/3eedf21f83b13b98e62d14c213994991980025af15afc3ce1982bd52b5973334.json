				"previous": "Following the Little Ice Age's end around 1850, glaciers around the Earth have retreated substantially. A slight cooling led to the advance of many alpine glaciers between 1950â1985, but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss has become larger and increasingly ubiquitous.[14][15][16]",
				"after": "Glaciers move, or flow, downhill due to gravity and the internal deformation of ice.[17] Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50Â m (160Â ft). The pressure on ice deeper than 50Â m causes plastic flow. At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers. When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.[18]",
