				"previous": "Since 2005 DLR is studying a suborbital spaceplane concept making fast intercontinental passenger transport possible. The so-called SpaceLiner is a reusable vehicle lifting-off vertically and landing like a glider.",
				"after": "DLR operates Europeâs largest fleet of research aircraft. The aircraft are used both as research objects and as research tools. DLRâs research aircraft provide platforms for all kinds of research missions. Scientists and engineers can use them for practical, application-oriented purposes: Earth observation, atmospheric research or testing new aircraft components. DLR is for instance investigating wing flutter and possible ways of eliminating it, which would also help to reduce aircraft noise. So-called \"flying simulators\" can be used to simulate the flight performance of aircraft that have not been built yet. This method was for instance used to test the Airbus A380 in the early stages of its development. The VFW 614 ATTAS was used to test several systems.[8]",
