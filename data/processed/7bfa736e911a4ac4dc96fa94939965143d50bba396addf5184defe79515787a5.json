				"Spain's capitalist mixed economy is the 14th largest worldwide and the 5th largest in the European Union, as well as the Eurozone's 4th largest.",
				"The centre-right government of former prime minister JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999. Unemployment stood at 7.6% in October 2006, a rate that compared favourably to many other European countries, and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20%. Perennial weak points of Spain's economy include high inflation,[90] a large underground economy,[91] and an education system which OECD reports place among the poorest for developed countries, together with the United States and UK.[92]"
