				"previous": "As with most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Gov. Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that due to air conditioning units not being used as often in the morning on standard time, energy use would increase in the evening. He went on to say that energy use would rise \"because there would be more lights on in the early morning.\" He was also concerned about children going to school in the dark, which was quite accurate.[56]",
