				"previous": "The male bog turtle is territorial and will attack other males if they venture within 15 centimeters (5.9Â in) of his position. An aggressive male will crawl toward an intruder with his neck extended. As he approaches his foe, he tilts his carapace by withdrawing his head and raising his hind limbs. If the other male does not retreat, a fight of pushing and biting can follow. The bouts typically last just a few minutes,[34] with the largest and oldest male usually winning.[17] The female is also aggressive when threatened. She will defend the area around her nest, usually up to a radius of 1.2 meters (3.9Â ft), from encroaching females, but when a juvenile approaches, she ignores it, and when a male appears she surrenders her area (except during mating season).[34]",
