				"previous": "Its high elevation of 929Â m (3,047.9Â ft) and close proximity to the Rocky Mountains provides Lethbridge with cooler summers than other locations in the Canadian Prairies.[24] These factors protect the city from strong northwest and southwest winds and contribute to frequent chinook winds during the winter. Lethbridge winters have the highest temperatures in the prairies, reducing the severity and duration of winter cold periods and resulting in fewer days with snow cover.[25] The average daytime temperature peaks by the end of July/beginning of August, when it reaches 26.4Â Â°C (79.5Â Â°F).[26] The city's temperature reaches a maximum high of 35Â Â°C (95Â Â°F) or greater on average once or twice a year.[23]",
