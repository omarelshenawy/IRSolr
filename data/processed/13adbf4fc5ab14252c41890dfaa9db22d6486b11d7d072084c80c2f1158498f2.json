				"after": "Ursula Franklin explains in a prelude to her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms \"the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole,\" has been at the root of most of her activities.[28] Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, \"I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist in the here and now and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'\"[28] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. \"Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels,\" she writes. \"I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement.\"[29] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls \"the real world\" by \"the maps of pacifism and feminism\".[29]",
