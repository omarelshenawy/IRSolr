This is one of the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. In modern predator guilds, similar-sized predators are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition.[26] Several studies have attempted to explain niche differentiation in Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus.",
