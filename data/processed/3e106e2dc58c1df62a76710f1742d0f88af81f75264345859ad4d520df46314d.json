				"after": "Prior to introducing the current \"plum blossom\" livery in 1995, China Airlines used to have a livery featuring the flag of the Republic of China on the tail. The carrier changed its livery due to political pressure from the Chinese government. The mainland government prohibited any aircraft flying with the Republic of China Flag displayed to land in the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. It also pressured other countries to carry out similar bans. This forced China Airlines to change its corporate identity in order to avoid having operations affected.",
