				"after": "Cutthroat trout are prized as a gamefish, particularly by fly anglers. They are regulated as a gamefish in every state and province they occur in. From the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in Yellowstone National Park,[61][67][68][69] the unique Lahontan cutthroat trout fishery in Pyramid Lake in Nevada, and the small stream fisheries of the westslope cutthroat trout to saltwater angling for sea-run cutthroat trout on the Pacific coast,[70] cutthroat trout are a popular quarry for trout anglers throughout their ranges. The all-tackle world record is 41Â lb (19Â kg) caught in Pyramid Lake in December 1925.[30] Their propensity to feed on aquatic and terrestrial insects make them an ideal quarry for the fly angler.[71]",
