				"previous": "At the lower end of Grand Canyon, the Colorado widens into Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the continental United States, formed by Hoover Dam on the border of Arizona and Nevada. Situated southeast of metropolitan Las Vegas, the dam is an integral component for management of the Colorado River, controlling floods and storing water for farms and cities in the lower Colorado River basin.[27] Below the dam the river passes under the Mike O'CallaghanâPat Tillman Memorial Bridge â which at nearly 900 feet (270Â m) above the water is the highest concrete arch bridge in the Western Hemisphere[28] â and then turns due south towards Mexico, defining the ArizonaâNevada and ArizonaâCalifornia borders.",
				"after": "After leaving the confines of the Black Canyon, the river emerges from the Colorado Plateau into the Lower Colorado River Valley (LCRV), a desert region dependent on irrigation agriculture and tourism and also home to several major Indian reservations.[29] The river widens here to a broad, moderately deep waterway averaging 500 to 1,000 feet (150 to 300Â m) wide and reaching up to 1â4 mile (400Â m) across, with depths ranging from 8 to 60 feet (2 to 20Â m).[30][31] Before channelization of the Colorado in the 20thÂ century, the lower river was subject to frequent course changes caused by seasonal flow variations. Joseph C. Ives, who surveyed the lower river in 1861, wrote that \"the shifting of the channel, the banks, the islands, the bars is so continual and rapid that a detailed description, derived from the experiences of one trip, would be found incorrect, not only during the subsequent year, but perhaps in the course of a week, or even a day.\"[32]",
