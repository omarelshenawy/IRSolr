				"previous": "Without such a formal cooperation, the Swedish Conversations-lexicon (4 volumes, 1821â1826) was a translation of Brockhaus 2nd edition. The first encyclopedia written originally in Swedish was Svenskt konversationslexikon (4 volumes, 1845â1851) by Per Gustaf Berg. A more ambitious project was Nordisk familjebok, established in 1875 and intended to comprise 6 volumes. But in 1885, when it had published 8 volumes and gotten only halfways (AâK), the publisher turned to the government for extra funding; encyclopedias had become national monuments. It was finished in 1894 with 18 volumes,[13] with two supplement volumes (1896â1899).",
				"after": "The first major Danish encyclopedia was Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon (19 volumes, 1893â1911).",
