				"after": "The Zodiac settle is a piece of painted furniture designed by the English architect and designer William Burges and made between 1869 and 1871. A wooden settle designed with Zodiac themes, it was made for Burges' rooms at Buckingham Street, and later moved to the drawing room of The Tower House, the home that he designed for himself in Holland Park. Burges desired to fill his home with furniture \"covered with paintings, both ornaments and subjects; it not only did its duty as furniture, but spoke and told a story.\"[1] At one stage the poet John Betjeman gave the settle to the novelist Evelyn Waugh, and it is now in the collection of the The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in Bedford.[2]",
