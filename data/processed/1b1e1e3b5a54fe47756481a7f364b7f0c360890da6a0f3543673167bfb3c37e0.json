A referendum held amongst the Oxford student body in 2006 showed 81% against making it voluntary in examinations â 4,382 voted in the poll, almost 1,000 more than voted in the previous term's students' union elections.[99] This was widely interpreted by students as not so much being a vote on making subfusc voluntary, but rather a vote on whether or not to effectively abolish it by default, as it was assumed that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[100] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[101]",
