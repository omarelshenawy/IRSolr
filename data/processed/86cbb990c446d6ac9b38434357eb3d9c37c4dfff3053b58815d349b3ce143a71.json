				"after": "Females start to breed when they reach sexual maturity, typically in their second year. At this point, they become fertile once a year, producing multiple ova while in heat.[93] As prey is most abundant in spring and early summer, the devil's reproductive cycle starts in March or April so that the end of the weaning period coincides with the maximisation of food supplies in the wild for the newly roaming young devils.[94] Occurring in March, mating takes places in sheltered locations during both day and night. Males fight over females in the breeding season, and female devils will mate with the dominant male.[44][95] Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and copulation can take five days; one instance of a couple being in the mating den for eight days has been recorded.[95] Devils are not monogamous, and females will mate with several males if not guarded after mating; males also reproduce with several females during a season.[44][95] Females have been shown to be selective in an attempt to ensure the best genetic offspring,[95] for example, fighting off the advances of smaller males.[35] Males often keep their mates in custody in the den, or take them along if they need to drink, lest they engage in infidelity.[95] Males can produce up to 16 offspring over their lifetime, while females average four mating seasons and 12 offspring.[95] Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and make the species insulated against high mortality.[96] The pregnancy rate is high; 80% of two-year-old females were observed with newborns in their pouches during the mating season.[95] More recent studies of breeding place the mating season between February and June, as opposed to between February and March.[34]",
