				"previous": "The distinction between coast-assault battleship and cruising battleship became blurred with the AdmiralÂ class, ordered in 1880. These ships reflected developments in ironclad design, being protected by iron-and-steel compound armour rather than wrought iron. Equipped with breech-loading guns of between 12-inch and 16âÂ¼-inch (305Â mm and 413Â mm) calibre, the Admirals continued the trend of ironclad warships towards gigantic weapons. The guns were mounted in open barbettes to save weight. Some historians see these ships as a vital step towards pre-dreadnoughts; others view them as a confused and unsuccessful design.[6]",
				"after": "The subsequent Royal SovereignÂ class of 1889 retained barbettes but were uniformly armed with 13.5-inch (343Â mm) guns; they were also significantly larger (at 14,000 tons displacement) and faster (due to triple-expansion steam engines) than the Admirals. Just as importantly, the Royal Sovereigns had a higher freeboard, making them unequivocally capable of the high-seas battleship role.[7][8]",
