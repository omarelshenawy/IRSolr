TAMECT medics radioed an alert to University Police and Texas A&M University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding EMS, Fire, and Police agencies. [33] In addition to the mutual aid received from the College Station and Bryan, Texas EMS, Fire, and Police Departments, members of Texas Task Force 1, the state's elite emergency response team, arrived to assist the rescue efforts.[34]",
