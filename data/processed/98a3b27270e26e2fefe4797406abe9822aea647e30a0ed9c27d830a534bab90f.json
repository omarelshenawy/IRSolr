				"after": "The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on AugustÂ 22 north of Bikini Atoll and southwest of Wake Island.[2][3] It moved to the west-northwest, a movement it would maintain for much of its duration. Early on AugustÂ 23, it intensified into Tropical Storm Rusa,[2] about 1,800Â km (1,100Â mi) east of Guam.[4] At 1800Â UTC on AugustÂ 25, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] upgraded Rusa to a typhoon while the system was northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands. The next day, the agency estimated that the typhoon attained peak winds of 150Â km/h (90Â mph 10Â minute sustained).[2] Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 4] estimated peak winds of 215Â km/h (135Â mph 1Â minute sustained).[3]",
