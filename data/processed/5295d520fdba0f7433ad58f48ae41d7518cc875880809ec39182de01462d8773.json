Larger aircraft including widebodies will usually require at least 8,000Â ft (2,438Â m) at sea level and somewhat more at higher altitude airports. International widebody flights, which carry substantial amounts of fuel and are therefore heavier, may also have landing requirements of 10,000Â ft (3,048Â m) or more and takeoff requirements of 13,000Â ft (3,962Â m).",
