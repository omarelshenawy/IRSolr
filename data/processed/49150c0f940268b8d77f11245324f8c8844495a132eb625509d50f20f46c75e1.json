				"after": "Swimming behavior in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim at a constant rate in a straight line, while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50. They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals.[19] Mantas sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other.[11] These leaps come in three forms: forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry or somersaults.[11] The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, birthing, communication, or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras (suckerfish).[21]:15",
