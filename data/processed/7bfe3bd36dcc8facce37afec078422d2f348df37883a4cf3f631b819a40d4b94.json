				"after": "Adi Shankaracharya (788â820) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to establish the first of his four mathas (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238â1317) was the chief proponent of TattvavÄda (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophyÂ â one of the three most influential VedÄnta philosophies. Madhva was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, MadhvÄcÄrya is believed to be the third incarnation of VÄyu (MukhyaprÄá¹a), after HanumÄn and BhÄ«ma. The Haridasa (Kannada: à²¹à²°à²¿à²¦à²¾à²¸) devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.[1]",
