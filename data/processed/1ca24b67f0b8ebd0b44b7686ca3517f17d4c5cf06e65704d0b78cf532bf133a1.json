				"previous": "By 1717, the local population seems to have been very homogeneous in terms of belief: \"Persons, servants included, above the age of sixteen, the men chiefly sea-faring are supposed to be rather above three hundred. Papist none. Protestant dissenter none\".[22] Nevertheless, in 1854 there were Non-conformist chapels of three denominations, of which only the Methodist remains.[23]",
				"after": "The church was originally constructed of flint with stone dressings,[24] but was substantially refaced with knapped flint in the 1880s; the tower was restored at the same time. A wall was built behind the altar in 1886 to create a separate sacristy for storing vestments and other items. The west tower was restored again in 1989, and the current doors to the sacristy were added in the same year.[2]",
