				"after": "Like most dinosaurs, the skeleton of Parasaurolophus is incompletely known. The length of the type specimen of P. walkeri is estimated at 9.5Â m (31Â ft), and its weight is estimated at 2.5 tonnes (2.8 short tons).[3] Its skull is about 1.6Â m (5Â ft 3Â in) long, including the crest, whereas the type skull of P. tubicen is over 2Â m (6Â ft 7Â in) long, indicating a larger animal.[4] Its single known forelimb was relatively short for a hadrosaurid, with a short but wide shoulder blade. The thighbone measures 103Â cm (41Â in) long in P. walkeri and is robust for its length when compared to other hadrosaurids.[4] The upper arm and pelvic bones were also heavily built.[5]",
