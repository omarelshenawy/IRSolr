				"previous": "The Jetliner was later used as the aerial photo platform for the CF-100 project. On 10 December 1956, the Jetliner was ordered surplused, and although it was donated to the National Research Council, they had no room for it in storage and took only the nose section for cockpit layout design. The rest of the Jetliner was cut up on 13 December 1956. The only surviving parts are the nose and cockpit section in the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa.",
