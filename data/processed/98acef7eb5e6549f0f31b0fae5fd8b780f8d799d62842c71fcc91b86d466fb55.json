				"after": "Haflingers were bred to be versatile enough for many under-saddle disciplines, but still solid enough for draft and driving work.[20] The Haflinger was originally developed to work in the mountainous regions of its native land, where it was used as a packhorse and for forestry and agricultural work. In the late 20th century Haflingers were used by the Indian Army in an attempt to breed pack animals for mountainous terrain, but the program was unsuccessful because of the Haflinger's inability to withstand the desert heat.[48] The Austrian Army still uses Haflingers as packhorses in rough terrain. They are used most often in high Alpine terrain, with slopes up to 40 percent and steps of up to 40 centimetres (16Â in).[49] There are around 70 horses in use, held by the 6th Infantry Brigade and based in Hochfilzen.[50] The Haflinger is also used by the German army for rough terrain work and demonstration purposes.[51]",
