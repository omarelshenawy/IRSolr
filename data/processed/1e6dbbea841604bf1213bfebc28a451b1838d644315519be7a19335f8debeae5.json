				"after": "As a member of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places.[20] Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus,[21] which consists of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity.[22] The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs.[23] Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.[23]",
