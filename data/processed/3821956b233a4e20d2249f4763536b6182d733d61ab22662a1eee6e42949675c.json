				"after": "Federer and Nadal are the only pair of men to have finished six consecutive calendar years as the top two ranked players on the ATP Tour, from 2005â2010. Federer was ranked No. 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004. Nadal, who is four years and ten months younger, ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008. Federer regained the No. 1 ranking in June 2009, due in part to Nadal's injury hiatus, which also caused Nadal to briefly fall to No. 3. Nadal returned to No. 2 in September but dropped two spots in February 2010, and regained the World No. 2 after winning the Mutua MadrileÃ±a Madrid Open in May 2010 (against Federer in the final). After winning the 2010 French Open, Nadal regained the No. 1 position again.",
