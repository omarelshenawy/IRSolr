				"Santiago (Portuguese for âSaint Jamesâ), or Santiagu in Cape Verdean Creole, is the largest island of Cape Verde, its most important agricultural centre and home to half the nationâs population.",
				"Santiago is located between the islands of Maio (40 km west) and Fogo (50 km east) and is one of the Sotavento. It was the first of the islands to be settled, the town of Cidade Velha being founded as Riberia Grande in 1462. It is also home to the nation's capital city of Praia and to one of the islandsâ two international airports, Praia International Airport, 3 km from the capital (IATA airport code: RAI, Praia)."
