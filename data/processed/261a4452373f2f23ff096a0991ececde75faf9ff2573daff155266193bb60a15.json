				"after": "Humpback whales are generally curious about objects in their environments. Some individuals, referred to as \"friendlies\", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes. Because humpbacks are often easily approachable, curious, easily identifiable as individuals, and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of whale-watching tourism in many locations around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of \"ecotourism\" to use the species without killing them. This whale-watching business brings in a revenue of $20 million per year for the state's economy.[86]",
