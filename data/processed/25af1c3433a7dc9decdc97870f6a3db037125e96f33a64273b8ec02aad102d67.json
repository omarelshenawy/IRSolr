				"after": "Austronesian seafarers are believed to have been the first humans to settle on the island, arriving between 100 and 500Â CE.[2] In their outrigger canoes they carried food staples from home including rice, plantains, taro, and water yam.[3] Sugarcane, ginger, sweet potatoes, pigs and chickens were also probably brought to Madagascar by these first settlers, along with coconut and banana.[3] The first concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast.[4] Upon arrival, early settlers practiced tavy (swidden, \"slash-and-burn\" agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of crops. They also gathered honey, fruits, bird and crocodile eggs, mushrooms, edible seeds and roots, and brewed alcoholic beverages from honey and sugar cane juice.[5]",
