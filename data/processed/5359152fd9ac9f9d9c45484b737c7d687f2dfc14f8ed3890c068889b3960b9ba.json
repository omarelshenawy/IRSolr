				"previous": "The first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321, also known as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325.[40][49] Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured.[40][50] The aircraft would be a minimum-changed derivative, apart from a number of minor modifications to the wing, and the fuselage stretch itself. The wing would incorporate double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications,[51] increasing the wing area from 124Â m2 (1,330Â sqÂ ft) to 128Â m2 (1,380Â sqÂ ft).[52] The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs (two ahead and two behind the wings), giving the A321 an overall length of 6.94 metres (22Â ft 9Â in) longer than the A320.[51][53][54] The length increase required the overwing exits of the A320 to be enlarged and repositioned in front of and behind the wings.[55] The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate the increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9,600Â kg (21,200Â lb), taking it to 83,000Â kg (183,000Â lb).[51]",
				"after": "Final assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).[56] This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150Â million (â¬135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant,[57] and the Germans, arguing it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480Â million (â¬475 million) to finance development costs.[43] An additional $180Â million (â¬175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.[58]",
