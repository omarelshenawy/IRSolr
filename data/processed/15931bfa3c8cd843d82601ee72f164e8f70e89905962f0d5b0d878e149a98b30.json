				"previous": "Maersk saw its ridership increase with 22 percent in 1997, ending at 550,000 passengers. At the end of the year it retained three One-Elevens and three 737-500s. In November the airline ordered three 50-seat Bombardier CRJ200s with an option for a further twelve of any combination of the CRJ200 and the larger 70-seat CRJ700. The airline preferred Bombardier over Embraer due to the availability of the 70-seat variant which would allow it to replace the aging One-Elevens. The fourth 737 was delivered in February 1998.[12] The first CRJs were delivered in 1998 and by August 1999 there were six such aircraft in the fleet.[13] The One-Eleves were retired in 1998 and the Jetstream 41 was pulled from service the following year.[14]",
				"after": "The airline launched services to Geneva and Vienna in February 1999.[15] In November routes were added to Stockholm and Rome.[16] By 1999 the airline had grown to a staff of 347.[17] A year later Berlin, Brussels, Frankfurt and ZÃ¼rich had been added as destinations and the fleet grown to six 737-500s and six CRJ200s.[18]",
