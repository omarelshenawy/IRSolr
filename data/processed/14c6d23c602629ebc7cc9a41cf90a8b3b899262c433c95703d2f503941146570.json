				"previous": "The F-111 used a three-point landing gear arrangement, with a two-wheel nose gear and two single-wheel main landing gear units. The landing gear door for the main gear, which was positioned in the center of the fuselage, also served as a speed brake in flight.[37][39] Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines. The F-111's variable-geometry wings, escape capsule, terrain following radar, and afterburning turbofans were new technologies for production aircraft.[40]",
				"after": "The F-111 featured an internal weapons bay that could carry bombs, a removable 20Â mm M61 cannon, or auxiliary fuel tanks.[41][42] For bombs, the bay could hold two 750Â lb (340Â kg) M117 conventional bombs, one nuclear bomb or practice bombs. The F-111B was to carry two AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missiles in the bay. The cannon had a large 2,084-round ammunition tank, and its muzzle was covered by a fairing; however, it was rarely fitted on F-111s.[43]",
