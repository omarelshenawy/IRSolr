				"previous": "On September 7, 2009, Brazilian Independence Day, it was announced Brazil would negotiate 36 Dassault Rafale.[16] But the Defence Minister did not confirm the final decision.",
				"after": "On January 5, 2010, after lobbying by Air Force Officers and Commanders, it was reported that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Saab Gripen NG ahead of the other contenders. The decisive factor was apparently the overall cost of the new fighters, both in terms of unit cost, and operating and maintenance costs, and the personal preference of the test pilots. Rafale was reported to not even be the second choice.[17] It was announced in February 2011 that the decision would be further delayed due to budget cuts.[18] And that July the decision was put off for yet another six-month extension.[19]",
