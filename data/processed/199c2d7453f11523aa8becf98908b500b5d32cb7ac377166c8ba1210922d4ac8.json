				"previous": "In the 1996 general election he was the only candidate by law to run for election.[31] Sudan became a single-party state under the National Congress Party (NCP).[32] During the 1990s, Hassan al-Turabi, then Speaker of the National Assembly, reached out to Islamic fundamentalist groups, even personally inviting Osama bin Laden to the country.[33] The United States subsequently listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism.[34] The U.S bombed Sudan in 1998. Later, al-Turabi's influence waned, in favor of more pragmatic leaders who focused on trying to recover from Sudan's disastrous international isolation.[35] Sudan worked to appease its international critics by expelling members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and encouraging bin Laden to leave.[36]",
				"after": "Before the 2000 presidential election, al-Turabi introduced a bill to reduce the President's powers, prompting al-Bashir to dissolve parliament and declare a state of emergency. When al-Turabi urged a boycott of the President's re-election campaign and signed an agreement with Sudan People's Liberation Army, al-Bashir suspected they were plotting to overthrow him and the government,[37] which resulted in the jailing of Hassan al-Turabi that same year.[38]",
