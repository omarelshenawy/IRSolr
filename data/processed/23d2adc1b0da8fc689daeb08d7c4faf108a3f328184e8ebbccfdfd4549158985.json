				"previous": "Apple improved Macintosh computers by introducing models equipped with newly available processors from the 68k lineup. The Macintosh Classic II[69] and Macintosh LC II, which used a 16Â MHz 68030 CPU,[70] were joined in 1991 by the Macintosh Quadra 700[71] and 900,[72] the first Macs to employ the faster Motorola 68040 processor.",
				"after": "It wasn't long until Apple released their first portable computers, beginning with the Macintosh Portable released in 1989. Although due to considerable design issues, it was soon replaced in 1991 with the first of the PowerBook line: the PowerBook 100, a miniaturized Portable; the 16Â MHz 68030 PowerBook 140; and the 25Â MHz 68030 PowerBook 170.[73] They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built-in pointing device (a trackball) in front of the keyboard.[74] The 1993 PowerBook 165c was Apple's first portable computer to feature a color screen, displaying 256 colors with 640 x 400-pixel resolution.[75] The second generation of PowerBooks, the 68040-equipped 500 series, introduced trackpads, integrated stereo speakers, and built-in Ethernet to the laptop form factor in 1994.[76]",
