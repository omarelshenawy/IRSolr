				"after": "The truce of Hudaybiyyah had been enforced for two years.[169][170] The tribe of Banu Khuza'a had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans.[169][170] A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them.[169][170] The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting.[167][169] After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.[171]",
