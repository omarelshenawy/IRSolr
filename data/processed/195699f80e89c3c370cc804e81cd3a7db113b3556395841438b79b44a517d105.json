				"previous": "The two different strategies of the American and British bomber commands were organized at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. The resulting \"Combined Bomber Offensive\" would weaken the Wehrmacht, destroy German morale and establish air superiority through Operation Pointblank's destruction of German fighter strength in preparation of a ground offensive.[7] The USAAF bombers would attack by day, with British operations â chiefly against industrial cities â by night.",
