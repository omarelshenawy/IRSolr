Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929.[94] The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930sâthe Maypole dance by the fifth group dates back to the beginning of the Cottage School.[95]",
