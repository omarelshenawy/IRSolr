				"previous": "Eventually,[9][10] it became possible to characterize the passage of time with instrumentation, using operational definitions. Simultaneously, our conception of time has evolved, as shown below.[11]",
				"after": "The UTC timestamp in use worldwide is an atomic time standard. The relative accuracy of such a time standard is currently on the order of 10â15[13] (corresponding to 1 second in approximately 30 million years). The smallest time step considered observable is called the Planck time, which is approximately 5.391Ã10â44 seconds - many orders of magnitude below the resolution of current time standards.",
