				"after": "\"Destructive cult\" has generally referred to groups whose members have, through deliberate action, physically injured or killed other members of their own group or other people. The Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance limit use of the term to specifically refer to religious groups that \"have caused or are liable to cause loss of life among their membership or the general public.\"[103] Psychologist Michael Langone, executive director of the anti-cult group International Cultic Studies Association, defines a destructive cult as \"a highly manipulative group which exploits and sometimes physically and/or psychologically damages members and recruits.\"[104]",
