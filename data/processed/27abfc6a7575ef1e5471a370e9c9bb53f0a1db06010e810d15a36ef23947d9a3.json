				"previous": "By 1838, he was capable only of working in a small format. He and his family were living in poverty and grew increasingly dependent for support on the charity of friends.[44]",
				"after": "Friedrich died in Dresden on 7 May 1840, and was buried in Dresden's Trinity Cemetery (the entrance to which he had painted some 15 years earlier). By then, his reputation and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community.[32] His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood.[2] By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.",
