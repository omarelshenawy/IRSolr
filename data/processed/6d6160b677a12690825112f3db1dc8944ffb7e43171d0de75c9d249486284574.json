				"Syrian Arab Airlines (Arabic: ÙØ¤Ø³Ø³Ø© Ø§ÙØ·ÙØ±Ø§Ù Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ±ÙØ©â), operating as SyrianAir (Arabic: Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ±ÙØ©â), is the flag carrier airline of Syria.[1] It operates scheduled international services to several destinations in Asia, Europe and North Africa, though the number of flights operated has seriously declined since 2011 due to the ongoing turmoil in Syria that began with the Arab Spring. SyrianAir previously served over 50 destinations worldwide. Its main bases are Damascus International Airport and Aleppo International Airport, though no scheduled services are currently operating from either airport. SyrianAir has a fleet of eight passenger aircraft, consisting of six Airbus and two ATR. SyrianAir is a member of the Arab Air Carriers Organization and Arabesk Airline Alliance. SyrianAir has orders for new Tupolev, Ilyushin and Antonov aircraft, although deliveries have been delayed by the ongoing civil war in Syria."

				"after": "Syrian Airlines was established in autumn 1946, with two propeller aircraft and started to fly between Damascus, Aleppo and Deir ez-Zour and Al-Qamishli. Operations began in 1947. Financial difficulties caused the suspension of services in 1948, but after receiving government support operations were resumed in 1951. The airline expanded during the next years to include Beirut, Baghdad, and Jerusalem, then Cairo and Kuwait then Doha, in addition to flights during the hajj. The airline started its operations in June 1947 using two Beech D-18s and three Douglas DC-3 (C-47 Dakotas). The Dakotas had been acquired from Pan American World Airways (PAA), which provided technical assistance to Syrian Airways during the very first years of operation. The airline's domestic network linked Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia, Kamishly and Palmyra. Syrian Airways also operated a regional network, with flights to Beirut, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Amman; followed by Cairo, Kuwait, Doha and Jeddah. In May 1948, the war in Palestine and financial difficulties led to the withdrawal of PAA and to the suspension of service until the summer of 1952. On December 21, 1953, one of the airline's Douglas planes crashed near Damascus killing all nine aboard. The airline's operating permit was cancelled following the crash. The airline was allowed to fly again in 1954. The D-18s had been returned to the Syrian Air Force in 1949, while four additional Dakotas were acquired between 1952 and 1956.",
