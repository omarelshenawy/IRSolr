				"after": "In 1948, race car designer and Kurtis-Kraft founder Frank Kurtis attempted to market a new sports car, the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport. Only 36Â units had been sold by 1950.[13] In 1951, for just $200,000[14] ($Â 1.8Â million in 2015) Kurtis sold the cars' manufacturing license to Muntz, who quickly rebadged them as the \"Muntz Jet\".[15] Initial production of the Jet took place in Glendale, where Muntz extended the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport's body by 13 inches (33Â cm), making it a four-seater, and exchanged the Ford V8 engine for a larger Cadillac V8.[14] Later, after making just 28Â Jets in California, Muntz moved production to a new factory in Evanston, Illinois, extended the body further by 3 inches (8Â cm), and replaced the CadillacÂ V8 with a less expensive Lincoln sidevalveÂ V8.",
