A small terminal was constructed with a capacity for 30,000 passengers a year, in addition to several hangars and the building of the AviÃ³n Club. The first regular flight was established by Lineas AÃ©reas Postales EspaÃ±olas (LAPE) with its line to Barcelona. Later, in the 1930s international flights started to serve some European and African destinations.",
