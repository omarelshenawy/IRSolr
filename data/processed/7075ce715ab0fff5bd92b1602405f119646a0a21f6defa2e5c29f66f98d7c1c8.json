It called upon the belligerents to immediately cease all military activity. The cease-fire was to come into effect 12 hours later at 6:52Â pm Israeli time.[183] Because this was after dark, it was impossible for satellite surveillance to determine where the front lines were when the fighting was supposed to stop.[184] U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger intimated to Prime Minister Meir that he would not object to offensive action during the night before the ceasefire was to come into effect.[185]",
