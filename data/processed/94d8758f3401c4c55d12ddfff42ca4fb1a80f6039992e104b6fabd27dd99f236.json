At that time, Scene7 had 80Â employees, most of whom were transferred from Scene7's former headquarters in Novato, California[4] to Adobe's offices in San Francisco, California.[28] Mack joined Adobe as its vice president of Creative Solutions Services. Scene7 was added to Adobe's product line as a hosted service to help boost Adobe's overall services strategy,[1] especially its software as a service efforts,[4] and because Scene7 was a great fit due to its heavy usage of Adobe products.[1]",
