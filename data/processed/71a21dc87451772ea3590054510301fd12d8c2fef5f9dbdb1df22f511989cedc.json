				"after": "Introduced in 2009, the \"Inspiration of Japan\" cabin features included fully-lie-flat-bed business class seats, nearly enclosed first class suite seats, fixed shell back seats in both of its economy classes, a new AVOD in-flight entertainment system (based on Panasonic Avionics Corporation's eX2 IFE system with iPod connectivity, in-seat shopping and meal ordering as well as cabin touchscreen consoles) as well as improvements to its in-flight service[examples needed]. ANA will also introduce a new lounge (which opened on February 20, 2010, supposed to be in coincidence with the introduction of new aircraft interiors but delayed [see below]) and check-in concept (later in autumn 2010) at Narita for first class and ANA Mileage Club's Diamond Service elite members.",
