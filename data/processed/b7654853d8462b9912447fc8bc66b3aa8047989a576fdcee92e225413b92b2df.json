				"previous": "In 2012, he was re-elected as Mayor, again defeating Livingstone.[283]",
				"after": "London was successful in its bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics while Ken Livingstone was still Mayor in 2005. Johnson's role in the proceedings was to be the co-chair of an Olympic board which oversaw the Games.[284] Two of the actions subsequent to taking on this role were to improve the transport around London by making more tickets available and laying on more buses around the capital during the busy period as thousands of spectators were temporary visitors in London,[285][286] and also to allow shops and supermarkets to have longer hours on Sundays.[287]",
