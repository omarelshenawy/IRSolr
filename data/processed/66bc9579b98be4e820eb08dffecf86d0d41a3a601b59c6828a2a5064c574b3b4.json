				"after": "According to Colfer, Gleeââ'âs creators initially \"were leaning on [Kurt] being overly flamboyant\". However, the actor stated that he did not want to take that approach \"because it's so overdone\". Instead, he decided to portray the character as \"more internal and superior.\"[8] Colfer has explained that Kurt \"puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona,\" but that \"underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point.\" Colfer also commented, \"In later episodes, [Kurt] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes.\"[3] In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is \"very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion\", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer Marc Jacobs before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode.[55] The second season episode \"Grilled Cheesus\" centered around Kurt's atheism, with Murphy explaining that Kurt is \"saying to the world, 'Prove [me] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.'\"[56]",
