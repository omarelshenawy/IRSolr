				"previous": "William De Morgan was unwilling to compromise on quality or embrace the trend towards mass production, and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than similar works by other designers. Consequently, his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially.[52] In 1906 his first novel, Joseph Vance, was published and became a great success, prompting DeÂ Morgan to close the ceramics business in 1907 to concentrate on writing.[52] Mary Watts attempted to replicate DeÂ Morgan's tile designs at Watts's pottery in Compton but was unable to do so, and investigated other tile manufacturers.[52]",
				"after": "It transpired that the only manufacturer able to supply suitable tiles was Royal Doulton, although they were unable or unwilling to replicate DeÂ Morgan's designs, and they were duly commissioned to manufacture the 24 tiles, delivered in May 1908.[52] Mary Watts was unhappy with the design of the tiles, which were significantly different in colour and appearance from DeÂ Morgan's original tiles, and they were installed without ceremony on 21 August 1908, immediately below DeÂ Morgan's original row of tiles.[53]",
