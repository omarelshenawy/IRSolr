				"The South Island is separated from the North Island by Cook Strait, which is 24 kilometres (15 miles) wide at its narrowest point, and requires a 70 kilometres (43 miles) ferry trip to cross."

				"after": "The South Island, with an area of 150,437Â km2 (58,084Â sqÂ mi), is the largest land mass of New Zealand; it contains about one quarter of the New Zealand population and is the world's 12th-largest island. It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps, the highest peak of which is Aoraki/Mount Cook at 3754Â metres (12,316Â ft), with the high Kaikoura Ranges to the northeast. There are eighteen peaks of more than 3000Â metres (9800Â ft) in the South Island. The east side of the island is home to the Canterbury Plains while the West Coast is famous for its rough coastlines such as Fiordland, very high proportion of native bush, and Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers. The dramatic landscape of the South Island has made it a popular location for the production of several films, including the The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.",
