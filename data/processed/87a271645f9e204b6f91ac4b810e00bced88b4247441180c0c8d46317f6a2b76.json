				"previous": "Gamma delta T cells (Î³Î´ T cells) possess an alternative T cell receptor (TCR) as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ (Î±Î²) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from Î³Î´ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, Î³Î´ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity.[58] On one hand, Î³Î´ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human VÎ³9/VÎ´2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted VÎ´1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.[51]",
