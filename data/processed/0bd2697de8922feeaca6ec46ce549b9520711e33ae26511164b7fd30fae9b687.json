Other prominent peaks include Mount Kazbek at 5,047Â m (16,558Â ft), Shota Rustaveli 4,860Â m (15,945Â ft), Tetnuldi 4,858Â m (15,938Â ft), Mt. Ushba 4,700Â m (15,420Â ft), and Ailama 4,547Â m (14,918Â ft).[134] Out of the abovementioned peaks, only Kazbek is of volcanic origin. The region between Kazbek and Shkhara (a distance of about 200Â km (124Â mi) along the Main Caucasus Range) is dominated by numerous glaciers. Out of the 2,100 glaciers that exist in the Caucasus today, approximately 30% are located within Georgia.",
