				"previous": "Gumbo is a heavily seasoned stew-like dish that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a gravy-like texture.[5] Any combination of either meat or seafood can be used, but not both,[6] with the exception of the traditional New Orleans version that features both seafood and sausage.[7] Meat-based gumbo may consist of chicken, duck, squirrel, rabbit or alligator.[8] Seafood-based gumbo generally has shrimp, crab (whole or meat), and sometimes oysters.[6] With the exception of sausage and ham, beef and pork are almost never used. Most varieties of gumbo are seasoned with onions, parsley, bell pepper, and celery.[6] Today, most people are familiar with seafood gumbo and chicken and sausage gumbo.[9]",
				"after": "A roux is traditionally used as a thickener. Ground sassafras leaf, known as filÃ©, is generally not added until after the vegetables and meats and/or seafood are finished cooking and removed from the heat source. The use of filÃ© is optional. The use of okra and tomato is an influence of the Creole (although the tomato was introduced by French chefs in the 19th Century).",
