				"after": "On 10 January 2011, Virgin Blue entered a 10-year strategic alliance with Perth-based Skywest Airlines, to operate up to 18 new Virgin-branded turboprop aircraft from mid-2011.[57] On 23 February, it was announced that the aircraft would be ATR-72s, to enter service beginning in May 2011; they would allow Virgin Australia to both replace its fleet of Embraer 170s and introduce new regional routes. The turboprops will be operated by Skywest Airlines under a wet lease agreement.[58] The May in-service date was not met, and in late July the first announcement was made concerning routes to be served. It was reported that the ATR-72s would be initially employed on services between Brisbane and Gladstone, Queensland; from Brisbane and Sydney to Port Macquarie in New South Wales; and on additional services between Sydney and Canberra.[59]",
