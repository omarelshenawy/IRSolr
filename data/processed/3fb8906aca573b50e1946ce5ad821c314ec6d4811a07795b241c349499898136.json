				"previous": "New models are beginning to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction.[26] Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities;[27] however, in many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction.[26] Surface roughness and contact area, however, do affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.[28]",
