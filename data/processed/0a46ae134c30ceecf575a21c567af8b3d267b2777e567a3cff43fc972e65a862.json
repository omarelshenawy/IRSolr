				"Humpback whales have also been found to make a range of other social sounds to communicate, such as \"grunts\", \"groans\", \"thwops\", \"snorts\" and \"barks\".[39]",
				"Scientists are unsure of the purpose of whale songs. Only males sing, suggesting one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males.[36] Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function.[37] During the feeding season, humpbacks make altogether different vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.[38]"
