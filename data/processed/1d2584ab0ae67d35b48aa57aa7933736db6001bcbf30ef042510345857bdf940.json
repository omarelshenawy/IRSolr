				"after": "Windsor Castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066.[70] William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's marchÂ â about 20 miles (32Â km)Â â from the city and from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis.[70] Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings.[71] The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep on the top of a man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier, or bluff, rising 100Â ft (30Â m) above the river.[72] A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward.[73] By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle.[73][nb 5] In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle.[75]",
