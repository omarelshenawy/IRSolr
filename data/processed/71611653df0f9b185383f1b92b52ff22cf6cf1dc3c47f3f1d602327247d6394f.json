Other southwestern states such as Colorado, Utah, and Nevada have large Hispanic populations as well, with many names places also attest to the history of former Mexican territories. Mexican-Americans have also had a growing population in Northwestern states of Oregon and Washington, as well as the southern state of Oklahoma.",
				"after": "Alaskaâthe northernmost state in the Unionâis a vast land of few people, many of them native, and of great stretches of wilderness, protected in national parks and wildlife refuges.
