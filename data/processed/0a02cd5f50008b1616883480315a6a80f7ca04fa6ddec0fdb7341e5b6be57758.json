				"previous": "Madagascar's highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs: Maromokotro 2,876Â m (9,436Â ft) in the Tsaratanana Massif is the island's highest point, followed by Boby Peak 2,658Â m (8,720Â ft) in the Andringitra Massif, and Tsiafajavona 2,643Â m (8,671Â ft) in the Ankaratra Massif. To the east, the Canal des Pangalanes is a chain of man-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some 600Â km (370Â mi). The western and southern sides, which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.[16]",
				"after": "The combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (NovemberâApril) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (MayâOctober). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rain forest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.[15] Tropical cyclones annually cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.[17] In 2004 Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless[18] and caused more than US$250Â million in damage.[19]",
