				"previous": "While the Home Army was largely untainted by collaboration with the Nazis during the Holocaust,[41] some historians have asserted that, due to antisemitism, the Home Army was reluctant to accept Jews into its ranks.[42][43][44] However, records confirm that numerous Jewish resistance fighters were Home Army members.[44][45] Notable Jewish members included Julian Aleksandrowicz,[46] StanisÅaw \"Shlomo\" Aronson,[47] Alicja GoÅod-GoÅÄbiowska,[48] Leon Kopelman,[49] Marceli Handelsman,[50] Jerzy Makowiecki[50] and Ludwik Widerszal[50] (some, like the last three, were Home Army headquarters staff[50]), while others, such as Ignacy Schwarzbart and Szmul Zygielbojm, held top leadership positions in the National Council of the Polish Government in Exile, to which the Home Army answered.[51] (However, there were no Jewish representatives in the Government Delegation for Poland.)[52]",
				"after": "In February 1942, the Home Army Operational Command's Office of Information and Propaganda set up a Section for Jewish Affairs, directed by Henryk WoliÅski.[53] This section collected data about the situation of the Jewish population, drafted reports, and sent information to London. It also centralized contacts between Polish and Jewish military organizations. The Home Army also supported the Relief Council for Jews in Poland (codenamed Å»egota) as well as the formation of organizations of Jewish resistance under Nazi rule in Poland.[54][55][56] One Home Army member, Witold Pilecki, was the only person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. The information that he gathered proved crucial in convincing the Western Allies about the fate of the Jewish population.[10] In 1942 the Home Army sent Jan Karski on a secret mission to personally carry the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the mostly disbelieving Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Before leaving, Karski visited the Warsaw Ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp.[52][57]",
