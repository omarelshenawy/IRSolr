He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, with a political strategy devised by Karl Rove.[93] Bush and the Republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[94] support for the USA PATRIOT Act,[95] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,[94][96] reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts,[94] creation of an ownership society,[94] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[97] Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants,[94] which was criticized by conservatives.[98]",
