				"previous": "In December 1900, with $52,000 of individual investor's money and $48,000 of his own, Harvey formed the Monte Ne Investment Company, which held the deeds to all of the land.[14] The first hotel completed was the Hotel Monte Ne in April 1901, which opened in May. It was three stories high and had two wings 300 feet (91Â m) long. Each room had a doorway to the outside and the hotel was surrounded with wide porches.[13]",
				"after": "In April 1904, Harvey organized the Monte Ne Club House Hotel and Cottage Company with capital stock of $250,000.[15] A.O. Clarke from St. Louis, Missouri served as architect and superintendent of the company. Harvey wanted to build five large hotels: a three-story main building called the Club House Hotel and four 300 to 450 foot (91 to 137Â m) long \"cottage rows,\" each to be named for a state bordering on Arkansas. Stock holders in the company received stock certificates that listed privileges such as transportation on the Monte Ne Railroad with 150Â lb (68Â kg) of baggage and a 25% discount for the stockholder and his family at the Hotel Monte Ne. Missouri Row, begun in August, 1904, was the first hotel constructed.[16] This Clarke-designed building was 46 feet (14Â m) wide and 305 feet (93Â m) long and built of 8,000 logs with a concrete floor and red tile roof. Fourteen thousand cubic feet (396Â mÂ³) of concrete were used. The tiles were shipped from Chicago. The center and two ends of the hotel rose to two stories, the remainder being a single story. Hotel Monte Ne, Missouri Row both featured porches 575 feet (175Â m) long. The hotel had forty 16Â ftÂ² (1.5Â mÂ²) rooms, each with a fireplace. Harvey employed area carpenters and stonemasons to build Missouri Row. In April 1905, to save time and money, the work schedule was changed from 9 to 10 hours per day and some wages were cut.[17] Many workers went on strike and, when their demands were not met, they quit. The men formed a union, and although Harvey thought of himself as a friend to the working man, he viewed unions as another kind of monopoly or trust.[18] The strike delayed construction, but by the end of May 1905, a full workforce was in place. In July, carpet, washstands and furniture, including iron-and-brass bedsteads, were installed in the rooms. Cannonballs and shells from the Pea Ridge battlefield were sunk into the concrete porch on either side of the main entrance. The hotel opened in September 1905 with room rates of $1 a day and $6 a week.[19]",
