				"after": "Each term in the sexagenary cycle consists of two Chinese characters, the first representing a term from a cycle of ten known as the Heavenly Stems (å¤©å¹²; tiÄngÄn) and the second from a cycle of twelve known as the Earthly Branches (å°æ¯; dÃ¬zhÄ«). The first term (ç²å­ jiÇ-zÇ) combines the first heavenly stem (ç²; jiÇ) with the first earthly branch (å­; zÇ). The second (ä¹ä¸; yÇ-chÇu) combines the second stem with the second branch. This continues, generating a total of 60 different terms (the least common multiple of ten and twelve), after which the cycle repeats itself. This combination of two sub-cycles to generate a larger cycle and its use to record time have parallels in other calendrical systems, notably the Akan calendar.[3]",
