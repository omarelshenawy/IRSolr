				"after": "PedroÂ II was faced by three crises between 1848 and 1852.[56] The first test came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with Great Britain.[57] Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government's passage of the Aberdeen Act of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade.[58] While Brazil grappled with this problem, the Praieira revolt erupted on 6 November 1848. This was a conflict between local political factions within Pernambuco province; it was suppressed by March 1849. The EusÃ©bio de QueirÃ³s Law was promulgated on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves. By 1852 this first crisis was over, and Britain accepted that the trade had been suppressed.[59]",
