				"previous": "On 24 September 2009, the USAF began the first steps in the new round of bids, with a clearer set of criteria.[68] On 8 March 2010, Northrop Grumman withdrew from the bidding process, asserting that the new criteria were skewed in favour of Boeing's offering.[69][70][71] On 20 April 2010, EADS announced it was re-entering the competition on a stand-alone basis and intended to enter a bid with the KC-45, still intending for Mobile to be the final assembly site.[72] On 24 February 2011, the USAF announced that the $35 billion contract had been awarded to Boeing. William J. Lynn III, the deputy defence secretary, said Boeing was \"the clear winner\" under a formula that considered the bid prices, how well each of the planes met war-fighting needs and what it would cost to operate them over 40 years.[73]",
