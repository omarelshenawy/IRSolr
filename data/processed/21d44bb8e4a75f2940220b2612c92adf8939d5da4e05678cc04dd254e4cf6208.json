				"after": "Biscayne Bay marks the southernmost extent of the Atlantic barrier islands, represented by Key Biscayne, and the northernmost extent of the Florida Keys at Elliott Key. The keys are distinguished from the barrier islands by the coral limestone that extends to the islands' surface under a thin veneer of topsoil, while the barrier islands are dominated by wave-deposited sands that cover most of the limestones.[6] Biscayne Bay lies between low ridges of oolitic Miami Limestone on the west, forming Cutler Ridge, and the coral-based Key Largo Limestone that underlies Elliott Key and the keys to the south. The Miami Limestone was deposited in turbulent lagoon waters. The Key Largo Limestone is a fossilized coral reef and was formed during the Sangamonian interglacial period of about 75,000 to 125,000Â years ago. The Miami Formation achieved its present form somewhat later, during a glacial period in which the lagoon deposits were consolidated and cemented by fresh water.[7] The Key Largo Limestone is a coarse stone formed from stony corals, between 69 and 200Â ft (21 and 61Â m) in thickness.[8] As a consequence of their origins as reefs, the beaches of Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key are rocky. Significant sandy beaches are found only at Sands Key.[9]",
