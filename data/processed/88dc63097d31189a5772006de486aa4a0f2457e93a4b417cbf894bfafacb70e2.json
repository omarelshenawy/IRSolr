				"after": "Selected to return to action in the Pacific Theater[42] in late 1944, she transited the Panama Canal on 27 November, and arrived in Long Beach, California on 9 December, breaking down at least once along the way and losing an observation plane in bad weather.[41] She conducted refresher training off Southern California in December 1944 and January 1945. New York departed 12 January and rendezvoused with Idaho, Tennessee, Nevada, Texas, and Arkansas, forming a support force for the invasion of Iwo Jima. New York lost a blade off her port screw just before the invasion began[40] and briefly put in for temporary repairs at Eniwetok from 5 to 7 February. She returned to the group, which was near Saipan, on 11 February. Together, they arrived at Iwo Jima on 16 February and began the pre-invasion bombardment.[41] During the three days of shore bombardment that followed, New York expended 6,417 rounds, including 1,037 14-inch (360Â mm) rounds. One of her salvoes struck the primary ammunition dump on the island, causing \"the most spectacular secondary explosion in the campaign.\"[40] She retired from the area on 19 February and arrived at Ulithi on 21 February.[41]",
