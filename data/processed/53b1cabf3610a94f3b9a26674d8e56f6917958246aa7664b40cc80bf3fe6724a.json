				"previous": "Istanbul does not have a primary urban park, unlike other large cities, but it does have a number of green areas. GÃ¼lhane Park and YÄ±ldÄ±z Park were originally included within the grounds of two of Istanbul's palacesâTopkapÄ± Palace and YÄ±ldÄ±z Palaceâbut they were repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the Turkish Republic.[115] Another park, Fethi PaÅa Korusu, is situated on a hillside adjacent to the Bosphorus Bridge in Anatolia, opposite YÄ±ldÄ±z Palace. Along the European side, and closer to the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, is Emirgan Park; originally a private estate belonging to Ottoman leaders, the 47-hectare (120-acre) park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual tulip festival held since 2005.[116] Popular during the summer among Istanbulites is Belgrad Forest, spreading across 5,500 hectares (14,000 acres) at the northern edge of the city. The forest originally supplied water to the city and remnants of reservoirs used during Byzantine and Ottoman times still survive.[117][118]",
