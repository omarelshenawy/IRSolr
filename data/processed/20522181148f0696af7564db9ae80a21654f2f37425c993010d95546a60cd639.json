				"previous": "At the conclusion of World War II, the valley's economy began to further grow and expand. After the war, the city's population began to surge, as many men who had undergone their military training at the various bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. In 1948, Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. They were followed in time by other high-tech companies, such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas.[12]",
				"after": "The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, further expanded with the development of Sun City. Much like Levittown, New York became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America,[117] Sun City, just northwest of Phoenix, became the template for retirement communities when Del E. Webb opened the community in 1960. Over 100,000 people visited the community during the opening weekend.[118]",
