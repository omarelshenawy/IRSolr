				"after": "Canada purchased five Boeing 707s in 1970-71 to replace the RCAF's CC-106 Yukons in the long range transport role and the CC-109 Cosmopolitan as an executive or short-range transport.[3] The first four aircraft had been built for Western Airlines, but that order was subsequently cancelled; the fifth was bought separately a year later. To fulfil Canada's requirements for aerial refueling, two aircraft were fitted with Beechcraft made probe and drogue refueling pods in 1972.[4] The two sets of refuelling equipment was moved from aircraft to aircraft to keep fleet utilization even between the airframes.",
