				"previous": "A number of aircraft companies attempted to design a \"DC-3 replacement\" over the next three decades (including the very successful Fokker F27 Friendship), but no single type could match the versatility, rugged reliability and economy of the DC-3. It remained a significant part of air transport systems well into the 1970s.",
				"after": "There are still small operators with DC-3s in revenue service and as cargo aircraft. The common saying among aviation buffs and pilots is that \"the only replacement for a DC-3 is another DC-3\". The aircraft's legendary ruggedness is enshrined in the lighthearted description of the DC-3 as \"a collection of parts flying in loose formation.\"[19] Its ability to take off and land on grass or dirt runways makes it popular in developing countries, where runways are not always paved.",
