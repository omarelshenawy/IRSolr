				"after": "Holkham was built by first Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke,[3] who was born in 1697.[5] A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlingtonâthe aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in Englandâand William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived.[6] Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting,[6] and being a leading supporter of cockfighting.[7] He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years.[6] Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759âfive years before the completion of Holkhamâhaving never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700â1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the House.[8]",
