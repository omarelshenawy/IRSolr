Species of Velociraptor have also been reported from the slightly younger Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia,[19] though these are indeterminate and may belong to a related genus instead.[20] These geologic formations are estimated to date back to the Campanian stage (between 83 and 70Â million years ago[21]) of the Late Cretaceous Epoch.[22]",
