				"after": "Although not called as such, machines performing the role recognizable as artillery have been employed in warfare since antiquity. The first references in the western historical tradition begin at Syracuse in 399 BC, and these devices were widely employed by the Roman legions in Republican times well before the Christian era. Until the introduction of gunpowder into western warfare, artillery depended upon mechanical energy to operate, and this severely limited the kinetic energy of the projectiles, while also requiring the construction of very large apparatus to store sufficient energy. For comparison, a Roman 1st-century BC catapult using stones of 6.55Â kg fired with a kinetic energy of 16,000 joules, while a mid-19th-century 12-pounder gun firing projectiles of 4.1Â kg fired the projectile with a kinetic energy of 240,000 joules.",
