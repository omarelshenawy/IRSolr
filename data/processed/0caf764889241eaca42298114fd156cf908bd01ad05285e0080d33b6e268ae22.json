As there are 360 degrees in a circle, the meridian on the opposite side of the earth from Greenwich, forming the other half of a circle with the one through Greenwich, is 180Â° longitude, and the others lie between 0Â° and 180Â° of West longitude in the Western Hemisphere (West of Greenwich) and between 0Â° and 180Â° of East longitude in the Eastern Hemisphere (East of Greenwich). Most maps show the lines of longitude.",
