Priests performed the temple's essential ritual functions, but in Egyptian religious ideology they were far less important than the king. As temple decoration illustrates, all ceremonies were, in theory, acts by the king, and priests merely stood in his place. The priests were therefore subject to the king's authority, and he had the right to appoint anyone he wished to the priesthood. In fact, in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of the year to serve the temple in shifts.[130] Once the priesthood became more professional, the king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for the highest-ranking positions, usually to reward a favorite official with a job or to intervene for political reasons in the affairs of an important cult. Lesser appointments he delegated to his vizier or to the priests themselves. In such cases, the holder of an office named his own son as his successor, or the temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post.[131] Priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by the wealthiest and most influential members of Egyptian society,[132] until Roman economic reforms reduced the templesâ economic power.[133]",
