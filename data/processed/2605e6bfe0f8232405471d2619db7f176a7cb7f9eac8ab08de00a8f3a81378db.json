The bridge begins at the southwest end of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's Great Lawn and extends across Monroe Street, where it connects to the third floor of the Art Institute's West Pavilion.[185][186] The bridge design by Renzo Piano, the architect of the Modern Wing, was inspired by the hull of a boat.[187]",
