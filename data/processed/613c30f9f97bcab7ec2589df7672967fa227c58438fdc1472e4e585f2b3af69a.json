				"A fully updated version of the military RB.168 was also built to power the AMX International AMX attack aircraft, filling a role similar to the original Buccaneer.",
				"During its lifetime the Spey has garnered an impressive safety record. Its relatively low maintenance costs provide one of the major reasons it continued in service even when newer designs were available. With the need for a 10,000 to 15,000Â lbf (44 to 67Â kN) thrust class engine starting up again with the removal of the Spey from service, Rolls then used the Spey turbomachinery with a much larger fan to produce the Rolls-Royce Tay, a rather modern design even though its ancestors can be traced to the 1950s."
