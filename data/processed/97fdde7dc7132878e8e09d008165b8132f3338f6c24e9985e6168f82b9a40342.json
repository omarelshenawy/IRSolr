				"previous": "The 600-foot (180Â m) beach on Lake Jean is open from mid-May through mid-September. A concession stand and modern restrooms are at the beach. Lifeguards have not been provided since 2008; visitors swim at their own risk. Picnic areas are at Lake Jean and the PA 118 access area at the Falls Loop Trail trailhead. Charcoal grills are provided for use at the picnic areas.[3][109][110]",
				"after": "Environmental education specialists lead guided tours of parts of the park from March through November. The walks give school groups, scouting organizations, and other visitors a close and informed look at natural wetlands, old-growth forests, waterfalls, flora and fauna, and geologic formations.[3] Other programs are held in the park office, on topics such as safety around wild animals.[111] In summer and fall, park educators lead \"Ghost Town Walks\" to the ruins of the lumber village of Ricketts and to adjoining State Game Lands.[36]",
