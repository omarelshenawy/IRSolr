				"after": "The 2001â02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season had the earliest named storm since 1992. Eleven tropical storms, two more than average, formed in the basin, which lies west of longitude 90Â°E and south of the equator. Many storms formed in the north-east portion of the basin, and several more originated around Australia. Tropical systems were present during 73Â days, 15 more than average. Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in RÃ©union. The first storm was Andre, which emerged from the Australian basin as Tropical Cyclone Alex in late October, before the conventional storm season began. The strongest storm, Cyclone Hary (pictured), was the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000; it hit Madagascar, where it caused lighter damage than expected but three deaths. In January, Cyclone Dina left heavy damage in the Mascarene Islands, particularly on RÃ©union, where it dropped 2,102Â mm (82.8Â in) of rainfall. The final storm was Cyclone Kesiny, which killed 33Â people when it struck Madagascar amid a political crisis in May, after the conventional storm season had ended. (FullÂ article...)",
