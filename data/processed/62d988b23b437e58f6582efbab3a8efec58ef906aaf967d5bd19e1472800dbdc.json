Like much of the Pacific Northwest, according to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification it has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb).[66] Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha, place it firmly in the Oceanic zone (Do), like much of Western Europe.[67] The city and environs are part of USDA hardiness zone 8b, with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a.[68]",
