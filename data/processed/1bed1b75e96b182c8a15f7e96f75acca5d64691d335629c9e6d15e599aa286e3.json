				"after": "Harley Quinn first appeared in the Batman: The Animated Series episode \"Joker's Favor\",[50] as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a walk-on role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre (although he ended up doing so anyway). Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker. Arleen Sorkin, a former star of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a jester costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.[51] Having been friends with Sorkin since college, he incorporated aspects of her personality into the character.[52]",
