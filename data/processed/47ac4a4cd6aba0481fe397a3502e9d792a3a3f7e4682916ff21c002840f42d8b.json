				"previous": "The spherical approximation of Earth with radius a can be modelled by a smaller sphere of radius R, called the globe in this section. The globe determines the scale of the map. The various cylindrical projections specify how the geographic detail is transferred from the globe to a cylinder tangential to it at the equator. The cylinder is then unrolled to give the planar map.[4][5] The fraction R/a is called the representative fraction (RF) or the principal scale of the projection. For example, a Mercator map printed in a book might have an equatorial width of 13.4Â cm corresponding to a globe radius of 2.13Â cm and an RF of approximately 1/300M (M is used as an abbreviation for 1,000,000 in writing an RF) whereas Mercator's original 1569 map has a width of 198Â cm corresponding to a globe radius of 31.5Â cm and an RF of about 1/20M.",
				"after": "A cylindrical map projection is specified by formulÃ¦ linking the geographic coordinates of latitudeÂ Ï and longitudeÂ Î» to Cartesian coordinates on the map with origin on the equator and x-axis along the equator. By construction, all points on the same meridian lie on the same generator[6] of the cylinder at a constant value of x, but the distance y along the generator (measured from the equator) is an arbitrary[7] function of latitude, y(Ï). In general this function does not describe the geometrical projection (as of light rays onto a screen) from the centre of the globe to the cylinder, which is only one of an unlimited number of ways to conceptually project a cylindrical map.",
