				"previous": "The final phase of the Foothill Freeway project involved the completion of the interchange with I-215 (Exit 74).[15] When the Foothill Freeway mainline was completed in 2007, Exit 74 had only four of its six ramps built, the missing moves being from 210 EB to 215 SB and from 215 NB to 210 WB. The flyover plans for these moves had to be recast to address potential soil liquefaction in the event of rupture of existing or undiscovered faults in the area during an earthquake; this project was separated from the main 210 project to avoid delaying the latter.[16] Completion of Exit 74 was also tied to the widening and improving of I-215 in the area. The flyover from northbound I-215 to westbound CA 210 opened on December 22, 2011,[17] while the eastbound CA 210 to southbound I-215 opened on July 23, 2012, thus completing the interchange.[18] With its completion, Caltrans is expected to petition AASHTO to designate the entire route as part of Interstate 210; once approved, the SR 210 green State Route signs will be replaced with Interstate 210 ones.[citation needed]",
