				"after": "Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil-on-canvas painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It depicts Louis-FranÃ§ois Bertin (1766â1841), the writer, art collector and exiled director of the pro-royalist Journal des dÃ©bats. Ingres completed the portrait during his period of first success: having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Ingres presents Bertin as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. Bertin was a politically active member of the French upper-middle class who was physically imposing and self-assured but warm and engaging to those who earned his trust. Ingres faithfully captured his sitter's character, but in doing so risked accusations of caricature: the portrait inspired witticisms such as Ãdouard Manet's \"Buddha of the bourgeoisie\" and ThÃ©ophile Gautier's \"bourgeois Caesar\".[1]",
