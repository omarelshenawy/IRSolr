				"previous": "There is an Apple TV export option in QuickTime which allows content in some formats that the device does not support to be easily re-encoded.[55] Applications that use QuickTime to export media can use this; e.g. iMovie's Share menu,[56] iTunes' advanced menu,[57] and some third-party content conversion tools.[58]",
				"after": "Apple TV streams video through an HDMI cable (Type A) connected to the TV's HDMI port. Audio is supported through the optical or HDMI ports. The device also has a Micro-USB port, which is reserved for service and diagnostics. The device connects through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection to the computer for digital content from the internet and local networks. Apple TV does not come with audio, video or other cables, which must be acquired additionally as required.[59] On the previous Apple TV, media files could be transferred directly onto the device by syncing with another computer. Once content was stored on the device's hard drive, an internet connection was no longer needed to view content.[40] This is not the case with the current model, which does not have a hard drive.",
