This was done after the 'success' of the experimental introductions into Puerto Rico.[90][91] It subsequently became the most ubiquitous amphibian in the islands. It still retains the common name of kamprag in the Visayan languages, a corruption of 'American frog', referring to its origins.[89] It is also commonly known as 'bullfrog' in Philippine English.[92]",
