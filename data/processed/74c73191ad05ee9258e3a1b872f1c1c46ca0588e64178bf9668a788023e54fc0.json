				"after": "The Fraternity Hymn was written by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. when he was a prospective member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977.[68] Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, \"We know that you play [piano] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there and come up with a hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn.\"[68] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few wordsâfor example, \"Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below\" became \"K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below.\"[68] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn.[69] Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors.[67] The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.[67]",
