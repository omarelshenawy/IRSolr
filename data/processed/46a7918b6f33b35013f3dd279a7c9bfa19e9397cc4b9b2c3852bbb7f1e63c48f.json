				"previous": "In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons[170] and can \"modulate brain excitability\".[6] It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning.[171] However, it has been called \"the brain's dark horse\"[170] because it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system.[170]",
				"after": "Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions.[163] The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions.[172] Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO 2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.[173]",
