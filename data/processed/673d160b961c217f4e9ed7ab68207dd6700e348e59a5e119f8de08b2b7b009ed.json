They remain at low numbers after severe declines. On Baffin Island, the largest Arctic island, the population of Peary caribou peaked in the early 1990s to approximately 60,000 to 180,000.[75] By 2012, in northern Baffin Island caribou numbers were considered to be at a \"low in the cycle after a high in the 1990s\" and in south Baffin Island, the population was estimated as between 1,065 and 2,067.[76]",
