				"after": "On July 16, 2009, as workers were assembling Madonna's stage at the Stade VÃ©lodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert.[56] Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French worker, was killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight at a hospital in Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became unbalanced as it was being lifted by four cranes, toppling one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started shaking and then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers to get out in time.[57]",
