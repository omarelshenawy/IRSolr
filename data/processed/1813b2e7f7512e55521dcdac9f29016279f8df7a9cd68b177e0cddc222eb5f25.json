				"after": "Prior to the Han dynasty, markets close to China's northern border engaged in trade with the nomadic tribes of the eastern Eurasian Steppe.[112] The heqin agreement between the Han and nomadic Xiongnu stipulated the transfer of tributary goods from China. The exact amount of annual tribute sent to the Xiongnu in the 2nd century BC is unknown. In 89 BC, when Hulugu Chanyu (çé¹¿å§) (r. 95â85 BC) requested a renewal of the heqin agreement, he demanded an annual tribute of 400,000 litres (11,000Â USÂ bu) or 10,000 dan of wine, 100,000 litres (2,800Â USÂ bu) or 5,000 hu of grain, and 10,000 bales of silk.[113][114] These amounts of wine, grain, and silk were considered to be a significant increase from earlier amounts of tribute, which must have been much less.[113] Besides these arrangements, the most common commercial exchanges between the Xiongnu and Han merchants consisted of the trading of Xiongnu horses and furs for Han agricultural foodstuffs and luxury items, most notably silk.[112] By means of the black market, the Xiongnu were also able to smuggle Han iron weapons across the border.[112]",
