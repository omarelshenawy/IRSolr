				"after": "John Henry \"Bonzo\" Bonham was an English drummer and songwriter, best known as the drummer of Led Zeppelin. Bonham was esteemed for his speed, power, fast right foot, distinctive sound, and \"feel\" for the groove. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest drummers in the history of rock music by other musicians and commentators in the industry. Bonham was born on 31 May 1948, in Redditch, Worcestershire, England, to Joan and Jack Bonham. He first learned how to play drums at the age of five, making a drum kit out of containers and coffee tins, imitating his idols Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. John Bonham died at the age of 32 on September 25, 1980, resulting in the end of Led Zeppelin for nearly two decades. John's sister Deborah Bonham (rock and blues vocalist) and John's son Jason Bonham (drummer) have found success unassociated with their famous relative in the music industry as well. Jason Bonham has also performed in his father's role as Led Zeppelin's drummer, most notably on December 10, 2007 during the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert. The \"tribute concert\" was Zeppelin's first full-length concert since the death of John Bonham.",
