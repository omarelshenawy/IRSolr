				"previous": "This leads to the question of how to determine the coordinates of a vector x relative to a general basis v and w in E. Assume that we know the coordinates of the vectors, x, v and w in the natural basis i=(1,0) and j =(0,1). Our goal is two find the real numbers Î±, Î², so that x=Î±v+Î²w, that is",
				"after": "To solve this equation for Î±, Î², we compute the linear coordinate functionals Ï and Ï for the basis v, w, which are given by,[21]",
