				"previous": "The second fatal accident took place on 5 September 1961 when another DC-3 crashed shortly after takeoff from Sendafar; a flight attendant and four passengers lost their lives in the accident. The event urged the Civil Aviation Department to investigate the accidents. It was foud that the lack of infrastructure at many airfields, marginal even for DC-3 operations, was a major contribution. Landing sites at Gore, Mizan Teferi and Tippi were included in the list of airfields that would require closure. On 13 January 1962, the crew and four passengers lost their lives in another accident involving a DC-3 âregistration ET-T-1, EALâââ'ââs first aircraft of the typeâ, this time the crash taking place at Tippi while the aircraft was taking off. The event prompted the government to decide the closure of the airfields at both Mizan Teferi and Tippi. In MarchÂ 1962Â (1962-03), two more DC-3s were acquired, and registered ET-ABE and ET-ABF. During the year, the â³ET-T-â³ registration would change to simply â³ET-â³. Jack B. Asire became general manager in AprilÂ 1962Â (1962-04).[42]",
				"after": "It was also decided to build a new airport to replace the Lideta Airfield, unable to accommodate the Boeing 720 jetliner the company intended to acquire.[19][44] This was the birth of Bole International Airport, where the company set its headquarters.[19] In DecemberÂ 1962Â (1962-12), the arrival of two Boeing 720s ordered directly from Boeing marked the carrierâââ'ââs entrance into the jet age. These two aircraft were registered ET-AAG and ET-AAH and were named â³Blue Nileâ³ and â³White Nileâ³, respectively. The first jet service took place on 15Â JanuaryÂ 1963Â (1963-01-15) when one of these aircraft was deployed on the route to Nairobi. The following day, a new service to Madrid was flown using the new jet equipment, with Frankfurt joining the jet network soon afterwards. On 1 April, the Boeing 720 replaced the DC-6B on the Addis AbabaâAthens route; during that month, the West African corridor also benefited from jet operations. The airline entered into a pool agreement with Aden Airways and Sudan Airways on the KhartoumâAsmaraâAden service. A new flight to Conakry was launched on 8Â MayÂ 1963Â (1963-05-08). Kano, which had been served since 18Â MarchÂ 1962Â (1962-03-18), was removed from the list of destinations that day. On 30 November 1963, the airline lost another DC-3 (ET-AAT) in a test flight at Addis Ababa; the crew of three suffered minor injuries. Rome became served for the first time on 5Â JuneÂ 1964Â (1964-06-05) on a weekly basis; the flight was routed via either Khartoum or Athens as part of a pool agreement with Alitalia.[42]",
