				"previous": "Here we follow the discussion in Ref.[3] To first approximation, the formation of vortex cores is thermodynamically an adiabatic process, i.e., one with no exchange of heat. In such a process, the drop in pressure is accompanied by a drop in temperature, according to the equation",
				"after": "Here and are the absolute temperature and pressure at the beginning of the process (here equal to the ambient air temperature and pressure), and are the absolute temperature and pressure in the vortex core (which is the end result of the process), and the constant is about 7/5Â =Â 1.4 for air (see here).",
