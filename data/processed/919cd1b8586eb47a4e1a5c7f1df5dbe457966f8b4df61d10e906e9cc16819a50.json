				"previous": "The Andean condor is the only accepted living species of its genus, Vultur.[13] Unlike the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of congeners, the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, may have been a smaller palaeosubspecies, V. gryphus patruus.[14]",
				"after": "Although it is on average about seven to eightÂ cm shorter from beak to tail than the California condor, the Andean condor is larger in wingspan, which ranges from 270 to 320Â cm (8Â ft 10Â in to 10Â ft 6Â in).[3] It is also typically heavier, reaching a weight of 11 to 15Â kg (24 to 33Â lb) for males and 8 to 11Â kg (18 to 24Â lb) for females.[15] Overall length can range from 100 to 130Â cm (3Â ft 3Â in to 4Â ft 3Â in).[15] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 75.7â85.2Â cm (29.8â33.5Â in), the tail is 33â38Â cm (13â15Â in) and the tarsus is 11.5â12.5Â cm (4.5â4.9Â in).[3] Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity.[3] The mean weight is 11.3Â kg (25Â lb), with the males averaging about a kilogram more at 12.5Â kg (28Â lb), the females a kilogram less at 10.1Â kg (22Â lb). According to a recently published manual of avian body masses, the species possesses the heaviest average weight for any living flying bird or animal, ahead of competitors such as trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) and Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus).[16][17] However, another resources claims a mean species body mass of 10.3Â kg (23Â lb) for the Andean condor.[18] The Andean condor is the largest living land bird capable of flight if measured in terms of average weight and wingspan, although male bustards of the largest species (far more sexually dimorphic in size) can weigh more at maximum.[15][19][20] The mean wingspan is around 283Â cm (9Â ft 3Â in) and the wings have the largest surface area (measured in square centimeters) of any extant bird.[20] Among living bird species, only the great albatrosses and the two largest species of pelican exceed the Andean condor in average and maximal wingspan.[20][21]",
