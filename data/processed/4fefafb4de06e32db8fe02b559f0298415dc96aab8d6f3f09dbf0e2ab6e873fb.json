				"after": "Due to the volume and seasonality of precipitation in its valley, the Willamette River has often flooded. In 1861, rainstorms and warm temperatures combined with a well-above-average snowpack in the Cascades created the largest Willamette River flood in recorded history. An observer of the flood wrote, \"The whole Willamette valley [sic] was a sheet of water\".[96] From Eugene to Portland, thousands of acres of rich riverside farmland were washed away and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed. The \"Great Flood\", as it is sometimes called, was massively destructive to human development because most of that development was located in the river's floodplain. Floodplain locations offer easy access to river transportation and the best soils for farming. The 1861 flood peaked at 635,000 cubic feet per second (18,000Â m3/s)âmore than the Mississippi River usually discharges in the 21stÂ centuryâand inundated some 353,000 acres (1,430Â km2) of land.[6][96][97]",
