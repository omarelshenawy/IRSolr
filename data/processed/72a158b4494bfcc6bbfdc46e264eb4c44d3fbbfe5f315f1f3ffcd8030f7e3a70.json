				"previous": "The flag carrier was privatised and floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987 by the Conservative government,[6][62] the initial share offering was nine times oversubscribed.[75] The privatisation of British Airways was regarded as very successful by industry observers, perhaps the most successful of a series of companies divested by the state in this era.[76] Four months later, in July 1987, BA announced the controversial takeover of Britain's \"second\" airline, British Caledonian.[77][78] The acquisition led to concerns regarding competition;[79] within the industry it was widely acknowledged as a mutually agreed rescue deal to avoid the latter's collapse.[80] The Caledonian name was kept alive, the charter subsidiary British Airtours being rebranded as Caledonian Airways. In 1992, BA absorbed Gatwick-based British carrier Dan-Air.[81]",
				"after": "Soon after British Airways' privatisation, Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways began to emerge as a competitor on some of BA's most lucrative routes.[82] Following Virgin's highly publicised mercy mission to Iraq to fly home hostages of Saddam Hussein in 1991,[83] King is reported to have told Marshall and his PA Director David Burnside to \"do something about Branson\".[84] This began the campaign of \"dirty tricks\" that ended in Branson suing King and British Airways for libel in 1992.[85][86] King countersued Branson and the case went to trial in 1993.[87] British Airways, faced with likely defeat, settled the case, giving Â£500,000 to Branson and a further Â£110,000 to his airline; furthermore, BA was to pay the legal fees of up to Â£3 million.[2][88] Branson divided the compensation among his staff, the so-called \"BA bonus.\"[89] British Airways and Virgin Atlantic continued to be noticeably bitter and active rivals for many years afterwards.[90][91][92]",
