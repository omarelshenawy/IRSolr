				"previous": "During the Soviet era, almost all Aeroflot's airliners were built by Soviet manufacturers. During the 1940s and the early 1950s, the main aircraft was a licensed version of the Douglas DC-3. Soviet-made, modified versions of this airliner were named the PS-84 and the Lisunov Li-2. The first to be produced in the Soviet Union was completed in 1939. The Li-2 would be replaced by the Ilyushin Il-12, which entered service in 1947, and the Ilyushin Il-14, which entered service in 1954. Aeroflot also operated large numbers of the Antonov An-2 STOL biplane (first flying in 1947), in passenger and cargo roles. The An-2 remained in service until the 1980s.",
				"after": "Aeroflot began operating the Tupolev Tu-104, reportedly named Silver Arrow,[63] in 1956,[citation needed] with at least three of these machines in service between Moscow and the Russian Far East by June that year.[64] The Tu-104 was the USSR's first jet airliner.[65]:615 The first two routes on which it was deployed were the MoscowâIrkutsk and the MoscowâYakutsk runs;[63][additional citation needed] in SeptemberÂ 1956Â (1956-09), the MoscowâTiflis route became the third scheduled service flown with the aircraft.[66] Likewise, MoscowâPrague was the first international route served with the Silver Arrow.[63]",
