				"previous": "Less than two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Miller was called to active service.[66] He trained at No. 4 Initial Training School, Victor Harbour in South Australia,[67][68] and gained his wings in late 1942.[60][69] He played only one match during the 1942 football season, while posted in South Australia.[60][69] In December, he was promoted to the rank of flight sergeant and,[69] a month later, he sailed to Europe.[70] The journey included a stopover at a training camp in Boston in the United States, where Miller met his future wife Peg Wagner.[60][71][72] In March, he was deployed to Bournemouth, in England, where he continued his training.[71][73][74]",
				"after": "Miller was invited to join a RAAF team in London.[75] The team was officially formed in preparation for the 1943 season and Miller's selection let to the first of many brushes with death: in April, while away with the team, some of his comrades were killed in a German air strike.[71][75][76][77][78][79] Miller played his first match at Lord's against Warner's XI, a team that featured past, current and future England players, including Bob Wyatt, Gubby Allen, Trevor Bailey and Alec Bedser.[80][81][82] Miller top-scored in the first innings with 45 and added 21 not out, with two sixes, in the second innings.[83] The RAAF played eight matches that season and Miller's top score was 141 against Public School Wanderers.[83] He went on to play for Dominions against Warner's XI in August, scoring 32 and two.[84] The match marked the first meeting between Miller and his good friend, England batsman Denis Compton and his bowling began to attract media attention.[85] In the final match of the season at Lord's between the RAAF and the Royal Air Force, Miller took 3/23 and scored 91.[86] The success of RAAF and Dominions that season, especially the attractive batting by Miller and Keith Carmody,[87] prompted Warner to begin planning for a \"Test\" series between the respective armed services of England and Australia.[88][89]",
