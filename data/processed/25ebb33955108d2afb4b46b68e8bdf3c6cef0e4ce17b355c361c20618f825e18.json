				"previous": "Zinc makes up about 75Â ppmÂ (0.0075%) of Earth's crust, making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains 5â770Â ppm of zinc with an average of 64Â ppm. Seawater has only 30Â ppb zinc and the atmosphere contains 0.1â4Â Âµg/m3.[16]",
				"after": "The element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores.[17] Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere.[18] Sphalerite, which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60â62% zinc.[17]",
