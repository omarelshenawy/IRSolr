				"previous": "The 757 was intended to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727.[15] The focus on fuel efficiency reflected airline concerns over operating costs, which had grown amid rising oil prices during the Yom Kippur War of 1973.[9][16] Design targets included a 20Â percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines, plus an additional 10Â percent from aerodynamic improvements, versus preceding aircraft.[16] Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency.[9] The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) was set at 220,000 pounds (99,800Â kg),[17] which was 10,000 pounds (4,540Â kg) more than the 727.[18] The 757's higher power-to-weight ratio allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in hot and high climates, offering better takeoff performance than that offered by competing aircraft. Competitors needed longer takeoff runs at airports at higher elevations, with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air. Boeing also offered options for higher payload capability.[17][19]",
				"after": "The twin-engine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three- and four-engine designs.[20] Launch customers Eastern Air Lines and British Airways selected the RB211-535C turbofan built by Rolls-Royce, which was capable of 37,400 pounds-force (166Â kN) of thrust.[21] This marked the first time that a Boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the U.S.[9] Domestic manufacturer Pratt & Whitney subsequently offered the 38,200 pounds-force (170Â kN) thrust PW2037,[21] which Delta Air Lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in November 1980.[9][22] General Electric also offered its CF6-32 engine early in the program, but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand.[23]",
