				"after": "The English common name of L.Â canarium is \"dog conch\"; in the Malay Peninsula, the species is known by the Malay common names siput gonggong and gong-gong; siput means \"snail\", and gonggong is an onomatopoetic word for a dog's bark or howl.[6][39][17] The flesh of the dog conch is edible. It is a staple food for locals living along the seashore, and is fished in many parts of southeast Asia.[23] In India it has been reported that the meat of this species works well in a variety of common Indian seafood dishes: dog conch soups, cutlets, noodles, curry and chili.[40] Despite their ornamental value,[1][41] L.Â canarium shells are traditionally used by local fishermen as sinkers for fishing nets.[1] Studies from 2008 to 2009 indicate that L.Â canarium has been overexploited and overfished in many areas; malacologists and ecologists have recommended reducing exploitation rates to maintain its availability as a natural resource.[23][18] Finding large dog-conch individuals has become an increasingly difficult task in several regions where this species occurs.[42] Initiatives in the Southern Thailand province of Phuket intend to increase depleted natural stocks of L.Â canarium by reintroducing cultured animals in local seagrass beds. Fishermen are encouraged not to collect younger, smaller individuals that have not yet reproduced.[42]",
