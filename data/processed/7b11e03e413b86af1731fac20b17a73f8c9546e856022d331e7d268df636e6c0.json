				"previous": "The song remained popular in the Chicago area for several years.[15] Later in 1887, with McCaull at the Chicago Opera House, she sang \"Bid Me Good-By and Go\" in the musical comedy Natural Gas by Henry Grattan Donnelly.[18] YohÃ©'s unique vocal quality attracted the attention of the manager of the Chicago Opera House, and she was engaged to play princess Zal-Am-Boo in Alfred Thompson's extravaganza Arabian Nights, which premiered on June 2, 1887.[19][20] The following year, she appeared in The Crystal Slipper: or Prince Pretliwittz and Little Cinderella, also at the Chicago Opera House.[9][21] In 1888, on the weekend that preceded the Fourth of July, YohÃ© travelled to Cleveland, Ohio in the company of Edward Shaw, the son of W. W. Shaw, a major stockholder in the Chicago Opera House. She missed at least two performances before returning. Shawâs young wife filed for divorce a week later.[9][22] She subsequently toured in America and abroad with George Lederer's Players in the farce comedy U & I and as Celia Cliquot in Hoss and Hoss, both in 1891.[23]",
				"after": "In 1893, YohÃ© made her London debut as Martina in The Magic Opal by Isaac AlbÃ©niz, and the following year she played the title character in the musical The Lady Slavey, composed by Gustave Adolph Kerker, with a book by Sir George Dance, in which she sang âWhatâs a Poor Girl to Doâ.[24] She starred as the title character in the 1894 hit burlesque Little Christopher Columbus, \"a great personal success\" for her.[25] In an interview, YohÃ© said the music, \"had to be specially written for me â crammed so to speak, into my voiceâs shrunken circumference.\"[26] While in London, she became a favorite of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII).[4] The next year she played the title role in the comic opera Dandy Dick Whittington, at the Avenue Theatre, written by George Robert Sims and composed by Ivan Caryll.[27] Sims noted that YohÃ© \"could be rude [to writers, composers and conductors] if she didn't get just what she wanted.\"[25]",
