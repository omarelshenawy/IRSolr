				"after": "Some aircraft use wheels for takeoff and then jettison them soon afterwards for improved aerodynamic streamlining without the complexity, weight and space requirements of a retraction mechanism. In these cases, the wheels to be jettisoned are sometimes mounted onto axles that are part of a separate \"dolly\" (for main wheels only) or \"trolley\" (for a three-wheel set with a nosewheel) chassis. Landing is then accomplished on skids or similar other simple devices.",
