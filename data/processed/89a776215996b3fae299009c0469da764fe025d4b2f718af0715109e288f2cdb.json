				"previous": "On computer systems with low floating-point precision, this formula can have large rounding errors if the distance is small (if the two points are a kilometer apart on the surface of the Earth, the cosine of the central angle comes out 0.99999999). For modern 64-bit floating-point numbers, the spherical law of cosines formula, given above, does not have serious rounding errors for distances larger than a few meters on the surface of the Earth.[2] The haversine formula is numerically better-conditioned for small distances:[3]",
				"after": "Historically, the use of this formula was simplified by the availability of tables for the haversine function: hav(Î¸)Â =Â sin2(Î¸/2).",
