				"previous": "The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight, Mercury-Atlas 6 by John Glenn in 1962. There were 1200 journalists covering the mission, with the BBC coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages. The Soviet newspaper Pravda featured a quote from Boris Nikolaevich Petrov, Chairman of the Soviet Interkosmos program, who described the flight as an \"outstanding achievement of American space sciences and technology.\"[58] It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time sawâeither live or delayedâthe Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon.[59] The Apollo 8 broadcasts won an Emmy Award, the highest honor given by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.[60]",
				"after": "Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an atheist, later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from Genesis.[61] O'Hair wished the courts to ban American astronautsâwho were all government employeesâfrom public prayer in space.[61] Though the case was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States for lack of jurisdiction,[62] it caused NASA to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the Apollo program. Buzz Aldrin, on Apollo 11, self-communicated Presbyterian Communion on the surface of the Moon after landing;[63] he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years, and only obliquely referred to it at the time.[63]",
