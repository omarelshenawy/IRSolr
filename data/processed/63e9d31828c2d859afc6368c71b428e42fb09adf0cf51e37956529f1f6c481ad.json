				"previous": "West of the original campus and the Medical Center, Greek Row and the bulk of the Vanderbilt residence halls are found.[87] From north to south, Carmichael Towers, Greek Row, Branscomb Quadrangle, and Highland Quadrangle house the vast majority of on-campus residents in facilities ranging from the double-occupancy, shared-bathroom dorms in Branscomb and Towers to the apartments and lodges in Highland Quadrangle.[87] This part of campus is newer than the others; Vanderbilt's westward growth did not start until the 1950s.[citation needed] This portion of campus was built by tearing down small single-family houses and duplexes dating from the early 20th century, and so the area has significantly less green space than the arboretum on the original campus and is more indicative of the university's urban locale.[citation needed]",
				"after": "Memorial Gymnasium, Vanderbilt Stadium, Hawkins Field, McGugin Center, and all the other varsity athletic fields and facilities are to be found in the extreme west of campus.[87] The Student Recreation Center and its associated intramural fields are located south of the varsity facilities.[87]",
