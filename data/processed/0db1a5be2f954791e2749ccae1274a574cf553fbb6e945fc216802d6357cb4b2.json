Cults, according to Wallis, are generally described as \"oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant [and] non-exclusive\", making \"few demands on members\", without possessing a \"clear distinction between members and non-members\", having \"a rapid turnover of membership\" and as being transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the \"cultic milieu\".[33][34] In their book Theory of Religion, American sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge propose that the formation of cults can be explained through the rational choice theory.[35] In The Future of Religion they comment \"...in the beginning, all religions are obscure, tiny, deviant cult movements.\"[36]",
