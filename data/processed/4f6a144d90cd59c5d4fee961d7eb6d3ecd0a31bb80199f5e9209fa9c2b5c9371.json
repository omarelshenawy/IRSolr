				"after": "The history of the city of Phoenix begins with Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War. In 1867 he saw in the Salt River Valley a potential for farming, much like that already cultivated by the military further east, near Fort McDowell. He formed a small community that same year about 4Â miles (6Â km) east of the present city. Lord Darrell Duppa suggested the name \"Phoenix\", as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.[8][21]",
