This basin, spreading throughout Orange, Lake, Volusia, and Seminole Counties, is home to the greater Orlando metropolitan area, where 2 million people live and major tourist attractions are located.[19] The topography of the middle basin varies between clearly distinguishable banks along the river and broad, shallow lakes. Two of the largest lakes in the middle basin are created by the river: Lake Harney and Lake Monroe. The shallow 9-square-mile (23Â km2) Lake Harney is fed by the long narrow Puzzle Lake; immediately north is the Econlockhatchee River, which joins to increase the volume of the St. Johns where larger boat traffic navigation becomes easier. The river veers west, touching on Lake Jesup before it empties into Lake Monroe, passing the city of Sanford. Lake Monroe is a large lake at 15 square miles (39Â km2), with an average depth of 8 feet (2.4Â m), draining a surrounding watershed of 2,420 square miles (6,300Â km2).[20] Sanford has adapted to the lake by building some of its downtown area on the waterfront; citizens are able to use boat transportation and Sanford's public dock to commute into town.[21]",
