				"For the Eulerian velocity as a monochromatic wave of any nature in a continuous medium: one readily obtains by the perturbation theory â with as a small parameter â for the particle position",
				"In many situations, the mapping of average quantities from some Eulerian position x to a corresponding Lagrangian position Î± forms a problem. Since a fluid parcel with label Î± traverses along a path of many different Eulerian positions x, it is not possible to assign Î± to a unique x. A mathematically sound basis for an unambiguous mapping between average Lagrangian and Eulerian quantities is provided by the theory of the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) by Andrews and McIntyre (1978)."

				"after": "The Stokes drift was formulated for water waves by George Gabriel Stokes in 1847. For simplicity, the case of infinite-deep water is considered, with linear wave propagation of a sinusoidal wave on the free surface of a fluid layer:[7]",
