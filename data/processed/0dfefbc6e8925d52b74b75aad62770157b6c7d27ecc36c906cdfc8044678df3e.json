Because there is no meteorological centre in Nathu La, systematic measurements of meteorological data (such as temperature and rainfall) are not available for the region.[16] However, it is known that in the higher reaches of the Himalayas around the region, summer temperature never exceeds 15Â Â°C (59Â Â°F).[17]",
