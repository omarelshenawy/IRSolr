It is ranked among the top-five medical schools in the United States[235] and operates the UCSF Medical Center, which ranks among the top 15 hospitals in the country.[236] UCSF is a major local employer, second in size only to the city and county government.[237][238][239] A 43-acre (170,000Â m2) Mission Bay campus was opened in 2003, complementing its original facility in Parnassus Heights. It contains research space and facilities to foster biotechnology and life sciences entrepreneurship and will double the size of UCSF's research enterprise.[240] All in all, UCSF operates more than 20 facilities across San Francisco.[241] The University of California, Hastings College of the Law, founded in Civic Center in 1878, is the oldest law school in California and claims more judges on the state bench than any other institution.[242] San Francisco's two University of California institutions have recently formed an official affiliation in the UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science & Health Policy.[243]",
