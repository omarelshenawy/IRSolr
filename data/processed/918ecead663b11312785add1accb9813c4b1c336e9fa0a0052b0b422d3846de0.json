				"previous": "Other listed buildings in Neilston include Nether Kirkton House and Crofthead Mill, both Category B.[46] Nether Kirkton House is a mansion and the former home of whisky heiress Marion Buchanan,[48] and Crofthead Mill is Neilston's largest and oldest cotton mill, dating in part from 1792 but predominantly 1880 after much of the original building was destroyed by fire.[18] The mill is now used by J & M Murdoch & Son Ltd., a transport, waste disposal and recycling company.[49]",
				"after": "Travellers historically used the Levern Valley as a route to and from the Ayrshire coast. An ancient road from Glasgow to Kilmarnock known as the Flush was the most common path and can still be seen near Neilston.[10] The major A736 road (Lochlibo Road) from Irvine to Braehead runs to the north of Neilston. The nearest motorway is the M77, of which Junction 4 at Newton Mearns is the interchange for Neilston.",
