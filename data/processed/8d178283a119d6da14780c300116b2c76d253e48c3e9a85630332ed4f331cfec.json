				"after": "The Macintosh project was begun in 1979 by Jef Raskin, an Apple employee who envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh,[5] but the spelling was changed to \"Macintosh\" for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc., the audio equipment manufacturer.[6] Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the name with its changed spelling so that Apple could use it, but the request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name.[7] (A 1984 Byte Magazine article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after \"early users\" misspelled \"McIntosh\".[8] However, Jef Raskin had adopted the Macintosh spelling by 1981,[9] when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab. This explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for \"legal reasons.\")",
