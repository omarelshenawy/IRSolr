				"previous": "Many of Canberra's suburbs are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title.[123] Street names typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of Duffy are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of Dunlop are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of Page are named after biologists and naturalists.[123] Most diplomatic missions are located in the suburbs of Yarralumla, Deakin and O'Malley.[124] There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of Fyshwick, Mitchell and Hume.[125]",
