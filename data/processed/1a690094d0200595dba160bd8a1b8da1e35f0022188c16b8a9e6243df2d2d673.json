				"after": "An early development for the Airbus A380, dubbed P500, incorporated two A340-sized fuselages arranged side-by-side in a \"double bubble\" configuration, joined together by an outside housing. This would have been the widest airliner ever built, however the design was scrapped in favor of a lighter, double-deck design. In the 1990s, Boeing and Sukhoi also proposed very wide aircraft that could be configured for 12 abreast seating with three passenger aisles.[41][42]",
