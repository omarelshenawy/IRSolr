				"previous": "Initial studies looked at turbojets and turbofans, but the lower frontal cross-sectional area of turbojets in the end was shown to be a critical factor in achieving superior performance. The competing Russian Tu-144 initially used a turbofan with reheat, but changed to a turbojet without reheat[4] with considerable improvement in performance.",
				"after": "Development of the engine and engine accessories was the responsibility of Bristol Siddeley, while Snecma was responsible for the variable intake, the exhaust nozzle/thrust reverser/noise attenuation and the afterburner. Britain was to have a larger share in production of the Olympus 593 as France had a larger share in fuselage production.",
