				"Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea.",
				"The island has an elongated shape: it spans 260Â km (160Â mi) from east to west, is 60Â km (37Â mi) at its widest point, and narrows to as little as 12Â km (7.5Â mi) (close to Ierapetra). Crete covers an area of 8,336Â km2 (3,219Â sqÂ mi), with a coastline of 1,046Â km (650Â mi); to the north, it broaches the Sea of Crete (Greek: ÎÏÎ·ÏÎ¹ÎºÏ Î Î­Î»Î±Î³Î¿Ï); to the south, the Libyan Sea (Greek: ÎÎ¹Î²ÏÎºÏ Î Î­Î»Î±Î³Î¿Ï); in the west, the Myrtoan Sea, and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately 160Â km (99Â mi) south of the Greek mainland."
