				"after": "Gophers are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae, characterized by fur-lined, external cheek pouches used to gather and transport food.[41] The cheek pouches of geomyids such as the camas pocket gopher are controlled by a set of muscles,[42] with a sphincter controlling the opening and closing of the pouch. A pair of muscles attached to the premaxilla pull the pouches forward, and paired retractor muscles pull the pouches back.[42] These retractor muscles extend back and up from the cheek surfaces, forming a band 7â10Â cm (2.8â3.9Â in) long and about 2Â cm (0.79Â in) wide[6] attached to aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi muscle.[42]",
