				"previous": "In 940, the founder of Goryeo, King Taejo, changed the city's name to \"Gyeongju\",[28] which literally means \"Congratulatory district\".[29] In 987, as Goryeo adopted a system of having three additional capitals in politically important provinces outside Gaegyeong (nowadays Kaesong), Gyeongju was designated as \"Donggyeong\" (\"East Capital\"). However, that title was removed in 1012, the 3rd year of King Hyeongjong, due to political rivalries at that time,[28][30] though Gyeongju was later made the seat of Yeongnam Province.[18] It had jurisdiction over a wide area, including much of east-central Yeongnam,[18] although this area was greatly reduced in the 13th century.[28] Under the subsequent Joseon (1392â1910) dynasties, Gyeongju was no longer of national importance, but remained a regional center.[18] In 1601, the city ceased to be the provincial capital.[31]",
				"after": "Over these centuries, the city's relics suffered numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story wooden pagoda at Hwangnyongsa.[18][33] During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield,[18] and Japanese forces burned the wooden structures at Bulguksa.[34][35] Not all damage was due to invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, a great deal of damage was done to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off statuary.[36]",
