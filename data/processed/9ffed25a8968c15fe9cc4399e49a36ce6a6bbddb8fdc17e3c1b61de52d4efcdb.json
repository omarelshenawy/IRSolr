				"previous": "A number of early Western role-playing video games used a highly tactical form of combat, including parts of the Ultima series, which introduced party-based, tiled combat in Ultima III: Exodus (1983),[118] Ultima III would go on to be ported to many other platforms and influence the development of later titles,[119] as did Japan's Bokosuka Wars[120] released that same year.[121] Conventionally, however, the term tactical RPG (known as simulation RPG in Japan) refers to the distinct subgenre that was born in Japan; the early origins of tactical RPGs are difficult to trace from the American side of the Pacific where much of the early RPG genre developed.[122] Tactical RPGs are descendents of traditional strategy games, such as chess,[17] and table-top role-playing and strategic war games, such as Chainmail, which were mainly tactical in their original form.[122][123] The format of a tactical CRPG is also like a traditional RPG in its appearance, pacing and rule structure.",
				"after": "Many tactical RPGs can be both extremely time-consuming and extremely difficult. Hence, the appeal of most tactical RPGs is to the hardcore, not casual, computer and video game player.[124] Traditionally, tactical RPGs have been quite popular in Japan but have not enjoyed the same degree of success in North America and elsewhere.[125][126] However, the audience for Japanese tactical RPGs has grown substantially since the mid-90s, with PS1 and PS2 titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden Tactics, Vanguard Bandits, and Disgaea enjoying a surprising measure of popularity, as well as hand-held war games like Fire Emblem.[127] (Final Fantasy Tactics for the PS1 is often considered the breakthrough title outside of Japan.[128][129]) Older TRPGs are also being re-released via software emulationâsuch as on the Wii's Virtual Consoleâand hand-held systems, giving games a new lease on life and exposure to new audiences.[130] Japanese video games such as these are as a result no longer nearly as rare a commodity in North America as they were during the 1990s.",
