				"Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation",
				"The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters , and , often iteratively by \"tuning\" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in process control). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if MIMO systems are considered."
