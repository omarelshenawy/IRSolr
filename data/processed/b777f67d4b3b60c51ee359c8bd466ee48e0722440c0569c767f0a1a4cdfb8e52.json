				"previous": "In 1996, relations between British Airways and USAir, in which BA held a stake then valued at $500 million, soured,[142][143] despite Ayling's preference to \"...remain a major investor in USAir\",[144] and BA later sold its share in the company.[104][145] Ayling had also pursued partnership and antitrust immunity with American Airlines,[146][147] however this was unsuccessful due to the conditions placed on the deal by regulatory authorities,[148] the most painful of which would have been the sacrifice of landing slots at Heathrow,[149][150] and in part caused the breakdown of the partnership with USAir as well.[148]",
				"after": "In 1997, Ayling dropped BA's traditional Union Flag tailfin livery in favour of world design tailfins,[151] in an effort to change the airline's image to be more cosmopolitan; several members of the senior management had expressed negative opinions of nationalism within the company.[152] This move quickly came under fire by the media for making hundreds of employees redundant while squandering money on expensive rebranding.[137][153][154] Several influential figures, such as former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, spoke out against abandoning the Union Flag scheme and BA turning its back on the nation.[155] British Airways' long-time rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of BA's public relations blunder and adopted the British flag along with the slogan \"Britain's national flagcarrier\", recognising the value and prestige of bearing the flag.[156] Ayling eventually declaring the fleet would sport a dual livery; half Union Flag, half the world design tailfins. On 6 June 1999, he announced that all newly delivered and overhauled BA planes would bear the Union Flag, based on a design first used on Concorde; the cosmopolitan scheme was abandoned.[36][157]",
