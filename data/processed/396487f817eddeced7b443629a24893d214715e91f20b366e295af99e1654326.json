Scott faced difficulty in securing the role, as Fox executives had desired a white actress for the part instead; Scott's agent fought for her to be given an audition, which proved successful. The season also brought in two new executive producersâMichael Duggan and Chip Johannessen, who had previously written episodes in earlier seasons.",
