				"previous": "Although Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County, Washington, access routes to the mountain run through Cowlitz County to the west. State Route 504, locally known as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway, connects with InterstateÂ 5 at Exit 49, 34 miles (55Â km) to the west of the mountain. That northâsouth highway skirts the low-lying cities of Castle Rock, Longview and Kelso along the Cowlitz River, and passes through the Vancouver, WashingtonâPortland, Oregon metropolitan area less than 50 miles (80Â km) to the southwest. The community nearest the volcano is Cougar, Washington, in the Lewis River valley 11 miles (18Â km) south-southwest of the peak. Gifford Pinchot National Forest surrounds Mount St.Â Helens.",
				"after": "During the winter of 1980â1981, a new glacier appeared. Now officially named Crater Glacier, it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier. Shadowed by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches, it grew rapidly (14 feet (4.3Â m) per year in thickness). By 2004, it covered about 0.36 square miles (0.93Â km2), and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe. Typically, by late summer, the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions. As of 2006, the ice had an average thickness of 300 feet (100Â m) and a maximum of 650 feet (200Â m), nearly as deep as the much older and larger Carbon Glacier of Mount Rainier. The ice is all postâ1980, making the glacier very young geologically. However, the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the preâ1980 glaciers combined.[9][10][11][12][13]",
