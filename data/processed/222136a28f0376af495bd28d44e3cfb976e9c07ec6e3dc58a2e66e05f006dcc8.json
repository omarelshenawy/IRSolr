				"previous": "Other methods are used for more recent events. Optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic radionucleide dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. Dendrochronology can also be used for the dating of landscapes. Radiocarbon dating is used for geologically young materials containing organic carbon.",
				"after": "The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.",
