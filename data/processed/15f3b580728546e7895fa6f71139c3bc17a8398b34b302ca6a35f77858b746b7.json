				"after": "The design of the building incorporates three setback features designed to provide visual continuity with the surrounding skyline,[8] each reflecting the height of a nearby building. The first setback, on the east side of the building, aligns with the cornice line of the Wrigley Building to the east; the second, on the west side, aligns with River Plaza to the north and with the Marina City Towers to the west. The third setback, on the east side, relates to 330 North Wabash building (formerly known as IBM Plaza).[9] However, some views distort the alignment of the second setback.a[âº] The setbacks and rounded edges of the building combat vortex formation which may occur in the \"Windy City\".[10] The body of the building is raised 30 feet (9.1Â m) above the main Wabash entrance and 70 feet (21Â m) above the Chicago River.[11] The building uses clear low-emissivity coated glass and a curved wing-shaped polished stainless steel mullion system that projects 9 inches (23Â cm) from the glass line. It incorporates a brushed stainless steel spandrel panels and clear anodized aluminum.[9]",
