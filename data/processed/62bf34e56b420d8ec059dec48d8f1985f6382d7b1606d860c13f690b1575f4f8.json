				"after": "The video, directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino (who had previously directed Madonna's videos for \"Open Your Heart\" and \"Justify My Love\") features Madonna, her dancers (including the first collaboration with Jamie King, that later would become the choreographer and director for her Drowned World, Re-invention, Confessions and Sticky & Sweet concert tours), and her chihuahua, Chiquita, in black leather outfits. Madonna's look and outfit for this video is \"latex and leather\" to symbolize the \"constrictions of our society.\" Her hair, which appears brown in the video was actually blonde at the time. She had leather strips painstakingly braided into her hair to blend with her dark roots. The frizzy afro she sports halfway through the video was actually a hairpiece. The costume was sent to be displayed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame shortly after the video was filmed.",
