This mistake was recognised only after the ship was 300 miles (480Â km) leeward of the island.[28] Overcrowding, malnutrition, accidents and disease had already killed several mariners and approximately 62Â enslaved Africans.[30] James Kelsall later claimed that there was only four days' water remaining on the ship, when the navigational error was discovered and Jamaica was still 10â13 sailing days away.[31]",
