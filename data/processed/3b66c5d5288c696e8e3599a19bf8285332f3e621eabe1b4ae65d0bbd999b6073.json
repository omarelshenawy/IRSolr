				"after": "Caesar's assassination caused political and social turmoil in Rome; without the dictator's leadership, the city was ruled by his friend and colleague, Mark Antony. Soon afterward, Octavius, whom Caesar adopted through his will, arrived in Rome. Octavian (historians regard Octavius as Octavian due to the Roman naming conventions) tried to align himself with the Caesarian faction. In 43Â BC, along with Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Caesar's best friend,[57] he legally established the Second Triumvirate. This alliance would last for five years. Upon its formation, 130â300 senators were executed, and their property was confiscated, due to their supposed support for the Liberatores.[58]",
