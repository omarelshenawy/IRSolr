The Kaveri Delta begins to form 16 kilometres (9.9Â mi) west of the city where the river divides into two streamsâthe Kaveri and the Kollidamâto form the island of Srirangam.[64][79][80] By road it is 912 kilometres (567Â mi) south of Hyderabad, 322 kilometres (200Â mi) south-west of Chennai and 341 kilometres (212Â mi) south-east of Bangalore.[81] The topology of Tiruchirappalli is almost flat, with an average elevation of 88 metres (289Â ft). A few isolated hillocks rise above the surface,[82] the highest of which is the Rockfort;[83][84] its estimated age of 3,800 million years makes it one of the oldest rocks in the world.[85][86] Other prominent hillocks include the Golden Rock, Khajamalai,[87] and one each at Uyyakondan Thirumalai and Thiruverumbur.[88]",
