				"previous": "A BÃ©zier curve of degree n can be converted into a BÃ©zier curve of degree nÂ +Â 1 with the same shape. This is useful if software supports BÃ©zier curves only of specific degree. For example, systems that can only work with cubic BÃ©zier curves can implicitly work with quadratic curves by using their equivalent cubic representation.",
