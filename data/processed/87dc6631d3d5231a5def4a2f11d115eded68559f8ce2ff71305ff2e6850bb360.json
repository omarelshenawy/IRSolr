				"previous": "A phagocyte has many types of receptors on its surface that are used to bind material.[2] They include opsonin receptors, scavenger receptors, and Toll-like receptors. Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies or with complement. \"Complement\" is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction.[27] Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and Toll-like receptorsâso called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the Toll geneâbind to more specific molecules. Binding to Toll-like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause inflammation.[2]",
				"after": "The killing of microbes is a critical function of phagocytes[28] that is performed either within the phagocyte (intracellular killing) or outside of the phagocyte (extracellular killing).",
