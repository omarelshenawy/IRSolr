In other words, for example, even though and (for real Î¸) correspond to the same physical quantum state, they are not interchangeable, since for example and do not (in general) correspond to the same physical state. However, and do correspond to the same physical state. This is sometimes described by saying that \"global\" phase factors are unphysical, but \"relative\" phase factors are physical and important.",
