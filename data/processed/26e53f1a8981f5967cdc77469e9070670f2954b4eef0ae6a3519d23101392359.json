Jess Dam, a huge flood-control and hydroelectric structure, blocks the Rogue River 157 miles (253Â km) from its mouth.[85] Built by the USACE between 1972 and 1976, it impounds Lost Creek Lake.[86] The dam, which is 345 feet (105Â m) high and 3,600 feet (1,100Â m) long,[86] prevents salmon migration above this point.[76] When the lake is full, it covers 3,428 acres (1,387Â ha) and has an average depth of 136 feet (41Â m).[86] Ranked by storage capacity, its reservoir is the seventh-largest in Oregon.[87]",
