				"previous": "Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, meaning it obtains nutrients from decomposing organic matter.[38] It grows scattered or clustered in small groups on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm;[27] in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut.[26] The mushroom prefers low-lying logs in areas that are periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy.[27] A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark.[39] R.Â  palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States,[28] or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.[31]",
				"after": "Described as having a circumboreal distribution,[40] R.Â palmatus has been reported from Canada,[40][41] Iran,[42] Hungary,[43] Italy,[44] Poland,[45] Slovakia,[46] Denmark, Sweden, Norway,[47] Germany,[48] the area formerly known as the USSR,[16] Korea,[49] Japan,[40] and New Zealand.[50] In the United States it has been found in Indiana,[51] and elsewhere in eastern North America.[28] Although often described as \"rare\", a 1997 study suggests that it may be relatively common in Illinois.[27] It has been suggested that an increase in the number of dead elms, a byproduct of Dutch elm disease, has contributed to its resurgence.[5][52]",
