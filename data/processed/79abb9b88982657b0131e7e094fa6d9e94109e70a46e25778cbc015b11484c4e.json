				"previous": "Between 1501 and 1503, Mayor John Rightwise had the original market cross demolished[19] and replaced with an elaborate new cross. This was octagonal in shape, stood on a plinth 30 feet (9Â m) wide, and rose to a height of 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21Â m). The central structure contained an oratory, occupied by a priest.[11]",
				"after": "Rightwise's new market cross only survived in its original form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 of the participants in Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich.[20] In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00Â am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.[19]",
