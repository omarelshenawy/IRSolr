				"Airbus says that some A380s may not be delivered to customers or even built. This decision came when Airbus had not met the 'Accord and Satisfaction' for three already built aircraft for an undisclosed Japanese airline. \"Without referring to any specific airline, I can assure you that we have cases where airlines are in the order backlog but not in the production plan,â chief executive officer Tom Enders said in August 2014 during a conference call to discuss earnings with Bloomberg. \"We are watching the situation carefully, and know about the strengths and weaknesses of customers.â Among customers that have ordered superjumbos yet remain undecided about actually taking them is Virgin Atlantic, with six units on the order book. Qantas had also planned to top up its existing fleet by as many as eight airplanes, an expansion that has been thrown into doubt amid a cost-cutting drive. Amedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s, has yet to find a single client for the jet.[275]"
