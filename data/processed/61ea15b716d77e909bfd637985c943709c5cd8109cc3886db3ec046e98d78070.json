You shoot a lot of things when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I really wish she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future.\"[62] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008;[63] a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.[64]",
