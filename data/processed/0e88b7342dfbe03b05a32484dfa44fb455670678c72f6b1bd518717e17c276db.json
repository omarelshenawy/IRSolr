The species has also been found in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, where it is thought to have been introduced from potted plants imported from Europe during the early colonization of Cape Town.[58] In Scandinavia, it is absent in areas with very cold climates, like Finland or Norway, but it is found in southern Sweden. It is thought to be the most prevalent low altitude species of Armillaria in Great Britain and France. The upper limits of its altitude vary by region. In the French Massif Central, it is found up to 1,100Â m (3,600Â ft), while in Bavaria, which has a more continental climate, the upper limit of distribution reaches 600Â m (2,000Â ft).[59] In Serbian forests, it is the most common Armillaria between elevations of 70 to 1,450Â m (230 to 4,760Â ft).[60] Field studies suggest that A.Â gallica prefers sites that are low in organic matter and have high soil pHs.[61][62]",
