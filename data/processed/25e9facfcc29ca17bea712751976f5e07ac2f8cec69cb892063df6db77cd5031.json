				"after": "OTV-1, the first X-37B, launched on its first mission â USA-212 â on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on 22 April 2010 at 23:58Â UTC. The spacecraft was placed into low Earth orbit for testing.[18] While the U.S. Air Force revealed few orbital details of the mission, amateur astronomers claimed to have identified the spacecraft in orbit and shared their findings. A worldwide network of amateur astronomers reported that, on 22 May 2010, the spacecraft was in an inclination of 39.99Â degrees, circling the Earth once every 90Â minutes on an orbit 249 by 262 miles (401 by 422Â km).[39][40] OTV-1 reputedly passed over the same given spot on Earth every four days, and operated at an altitude of 255 miles (410Â km), which is typical for military surveillance satellites.[41] Such an orbit is also common among civilian LEO satellites, and the spaceplane's altitude was the same as that of the ISS and most other manned spacecraft.",
