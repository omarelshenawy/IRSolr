				"previous": "A small number of Assyrians live in Basra, a significant amount of which are refugees fleeing persecution from ISIS in the Nineveh Plains, Mosul, and northern Iraq. There are remnants of the pre-Islamic gnostic sect of Mandaeans, whose headquarters were in the area formerly called Suk esh-Sheikh, with a small community of 3000 people or less. Basra is also home to a minority of Afro-Iraqi peoples.",
