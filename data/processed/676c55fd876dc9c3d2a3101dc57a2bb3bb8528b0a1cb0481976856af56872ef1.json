				"The following chart presents the annual net orders recorded and delivered aircraft by Airbus and Boeing, respectively, since 1991: [11][12]",
				"Additional letters are sometimes appended to the model name as a suffix, including \"ER\" to designate an \"extended range\" version, such as the 777-300ER, or \"LR\" to designate a \"long range\" version, for example 777-200LR. Other suffix designators include \"F\" for \"freighter\", (747-400F) \"C\" for \"convertible\" aircraft that can be converted between a passenger and freighter configuration (727-100C) and \"M\" for \"combi\" aircraft that are configured to carry both passengers and freight at the same time (757-200M, 747-400M). Passenger aircraft that are originally manufactured as passenger aircraft and later converted to freighter configuration by Boeing carry the suffix \"BCF\" designating a Boeing converted freighter (747-400BCF)."
