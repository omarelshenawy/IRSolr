				"previous": "Bill Rancic, The Apprentice's season one winner in 2004, was originally hired to manage the project for a $250,000 salary.[94][95] Rancic's title was President of the Trump International Hotel and Tower,[94] but the title was somewhat misleading, because he was in fact learning on the job as an \"Apprentice\".[96] Rancic's contract was renewed after his first year, but in September 2005 it appeared that his employment with Trump would finish at the end of his second year in April 2006.[97] During 2005 Donald Trump, Jr., who had been involved in the building since its earliest stages in 1999, was overseeing the construction with weekly visits, while Rancic worked on sales and marketing.[98] In December 2005, Rancic made it clear that he wanted to continue working for Trump,[99] and in April 2006 his contract was renewed for a third year.[100] In that year Donald Trump's children began to assume prominent public roles as in the Trump Organization;[101][102] by January 2007 all three adult Trump children (Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump) were executives in the acquisitions and development division of the organization.[84] By the time the Chicago Trump Tower's hotel opened in the building in January 2008, Donald Trump and his three adult children were in the spotlight, overseeing the construction.[103][104]",
				"after": "Bovis Lend Lease, noted for work on Disneyland Paris, Petronas Towers, and the Time Warner Center, was the construction company.[7] James McHugh Construction Co, the concrete subcontractor, implemented a comprehensive formwork for the construction of the building. At the completion of construction the building was the tallest formwork structure in the world,[18] and follows in the footsteps of its neighbor, Marina City, as well as Chicago's Two Prudential Plaza, as past recordholders.[77] Concrete moulding was used, because using a traditional ironwork structure would have required a building footprint that would have been too big for the property size, proportional to the height of the designed building. A steel frame would have had to be 25 feet (7.6Â m) wider to have supported a building of this proportion. Concrete will counteract the force of wind with the force of gravity of the 360,000-short-ton (330,000Â t) building.[10] A new chemical process that leveraged more fluid liquid concrete facilitated pumping concrete up several hundred feet to the elevating construction site.[10] Although previous technology limited formwork to 700 feet (210Â m), this technology permitted the pumping of concrete 1,700 feet (520Â m) high.[1]",
