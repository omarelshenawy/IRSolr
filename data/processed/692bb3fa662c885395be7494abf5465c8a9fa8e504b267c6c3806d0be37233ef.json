				"previous": "The state of Shu was conquered by the State of Qin in 316 BC, and a new city was founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi (who as a matter of fact had argued against the invasion). This can be seen as the beginning of the Chinese Chengdu. Chengdu is the only major city in China to have remained in the same location with the same name after more than 2000 years,[16] although it was also known as Yizhou (çå·) for a long time, and was given other names at other times.",
				"after": "As a central city for at least 2000 years, Chengdu's influence gradually expanded from the Sichuan basin to Western China. At its height, Chengdu was once named \"One of the Five Metropolis\" in China and was the second largest (æ¬ä¸çäº Yangzhou first Yizhou (Chengdu) second) in history. During the Three-Kingdom period, Zhuge Liang, the prime minister of Shu kingdom, called Chengdu \"the land of abundance\". Li Bai, the famous poet during the Tang dynasty, eulogized the city as \"Chengdu lies above empyrean\". Su Shi, the eminent writer during the Song dynasty, hailed Chengdu as \"the southwestern metropolis\".",
