				"after": "On Sunday 30 September, the body of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was discovered at about 1Â am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying in a pool of blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body.[47] However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others[48] on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road,[49] and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design.[47] Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.[50]",
