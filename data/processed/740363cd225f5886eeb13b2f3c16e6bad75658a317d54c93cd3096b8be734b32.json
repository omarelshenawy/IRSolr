A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field.[67] Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The StoneâWeierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.",
