The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles.[36] The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport, although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island.[37] A fertile coastal strip 150 to 300 metres (490 to 980Â ft) wide lies inland from the beach.[36]",
