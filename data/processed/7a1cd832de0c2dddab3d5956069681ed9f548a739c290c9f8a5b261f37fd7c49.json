These questions include: How many migrants were there? When did the \"Saxons\" gain political ascendency? What happened to the 'Romano-Brittonic' peoples in the south-east of Britain? The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of invaders, migrants and acculturated indigenous people. The ratios and relationships between these formative elements at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement are the subject of enquiry. The traditional interpretation[j] of the settlement of Britain has been subject to profound reappraisal, with scholars embracing the evidence for both migration and acculturation.
