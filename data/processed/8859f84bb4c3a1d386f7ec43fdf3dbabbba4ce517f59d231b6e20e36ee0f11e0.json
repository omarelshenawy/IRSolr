Thus, the Hingham yard was closed, and the yard diversified its interests. The yard constructed a 28-foot (8.5Â m) blast furnace, a wind tunnel, draglines, and steel for an aqueduct of the Boston's Metropolitan District Commission, a transformer for Boston Edison, among other things. The yard was faced with inflation, increasing material costs, and demands for higher wages.[1]",
