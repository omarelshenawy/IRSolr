				"after": "The English \"museum\" comes from the Latin word, and is pluralized as \"museums\" (or rarely, \"musea\"). It is originally from the Ancient Greek ÎÎ¿ÏÏÎµá¿Î¿Î½ (Mouseion), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the Muses (the patron divinities in Greek mythology of the arts), and hence a building set apart for study and the arts,[3] especially the Musaeum (institute) for philosophy and research at Alexandria by Ptolemy I Soter about 280 BCE.[4] The first museum/library is considered to be the one of Plato in Athens.[5] However, Pausanias gives another place called \"Museum,\" namely a small hill in Classical Athens opposite the Akropolis. The hill was called Mouseion after Mousaious, a man who used to sing on the hill and died there of old age and was subsequently buried there as well.[6]",
