				"after": "The DC-8-71 to DC-8-73 were straightforward conversions of the -61 to -63, replacing the JT3D engines with more fuel-efficient 22,000Â lb (98.5Â kN) CFM56-2 high-bypass turbofans in new housings built by Grumman, along with new engine pylons and fairing of the air intakes below the nose. The DC-8-71 achieved the same end but required more modification because the -61 did not have the improved wings and relocated engines of the -62 and -63. Maximum takeoff weights remained the same, but there was a slight reduction in payload because of the heavier engines. All three models were certified in 1982 and a total of 110 60-Series DC-8s were converted by the time the program ended in 1988.[citation needed]",
