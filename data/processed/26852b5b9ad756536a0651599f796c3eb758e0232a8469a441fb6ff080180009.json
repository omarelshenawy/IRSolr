				"previous": "The fruit bodies produced by the fungus are 7 to 15Â cm (2.8 to 5.9Â in) wide and 6 to 20Â cm (2.4 to 7.9Â in) tall.[9] They are fleshy cauliflower-like masses with a stout central stem that splits into a few lower primary branches before branching densely above. The stem is short and thickâbetween 1.5 and 6Â cm (0.6 and 2.4Â in) in diameterâand tapers downward. Initially white, in age both the stem and branches turn pale yellow to buff to tan.[13] Old fruit bodies can fade to become almost white,[19] or may be ochre due to fallen spores.[14] The branching pattern is irregular, with the primary branches few and thickâtypically 2â3Â cm (0.8â1.2Â in)âand the final branches slender (2â3Â mm),[13] and usually terminated with five to seven branchlets.[7] The branchlet tips are pink to purplish-red. The flesh is solid and white,[13] and has an odor described variously as indistinct[20] or pleasant.[21] A drop of Melzer's reagent applied to the stem tissue reveals a weak amyloid staining reaction that often requires more than 30 minutes to develop. This reaction can be used to help distinguish R.Â botrytis from other similar fungi.[7]",
				"after": "Spores are produced by basidia on the outer surface of the branches. Viewed in deposit, the spores are pale yellow. Microscopically, they have fine longitudinal or oblique striations that often fuse together in a vein-like network. They range in shape from roughly cylindrical to sigmoid (curved like the letter \"S\"), and their dimensions are 12â16 by 4â5Â Âµm.[22][23] Basidia are four-spored (occasionally two-spored), and measure 59â82 by 8â11Â Âµm. The sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach to the spores) are 4â8Â Âµm long. The hymenium and subhymenium (the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium) combined are about 80Â Âµm thick. Hyphae comprising the subhymenium are interwoven, 2.5â4.5Â Âµm in diameter, thin-walled, and clamped.[7]",
