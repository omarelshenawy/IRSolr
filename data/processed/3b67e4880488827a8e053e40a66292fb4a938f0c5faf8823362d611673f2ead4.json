				"previous": "On October 1, 1967 Frontier purchased Central Airlines, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. The addition of Central added eleven Convair 600s and sixteen DC-3s to the fleet and many new cities. Central's Convair 600s were Convair 240s that had been retrofitted with Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops. Frontier eventually phased out the Convair 600s but continued to use its Convair 580s until May 31, 1982 when they were parked and eventually sold.[1]",
				"after": "Al Feldman became president in March 1971 and converted the jet fleet to Boeing 737-200s, eliminating the 727s. The 737-200 was Frontier's only jet until McDonnell Douglas MD-80s were added beginning May 20, 1982.[1]",
