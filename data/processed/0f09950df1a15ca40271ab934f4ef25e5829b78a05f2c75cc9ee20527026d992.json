				"after": "The species was first described scientifically, by German botanist Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn, as Geaster triplex in 1840. The earlier genus name Geaster, introduced by Italian botanist Pier Antonio Micheli in 1727 in Nova Plantarum Genera, is considered an orthographical variant of Geastrum.[2] Junghuhn, who was living in Indonesia and extensively surveyed its fungal flora, discovered the type specimen on Mount Panggerangi on the island Java, at an elevation between 3,000 to 5,000 feet (910 to 1,520Â m). Today, the type specimen is kept at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden.[3] The morphological feature used by Junghuhn to differentiate G.Â triplex from other similar earthstars was the collar-like structure of the inner layer of the exoperidium.[4] American mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd would later erroneously suggest that the species was a \"giant form\" of Geastrum saccatum.[5]",
