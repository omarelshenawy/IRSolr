				"previous": "In 2006, the carrier became the 85th worldwide in passing the IATA Operational Safety Audit.[10] In March that year, Naples was added to the route network,[11] and in June the KyivâVilnius and SimferopolâVilnius routes were launched in codeshare agreement with Lithuania's national carrier flyLAL.[12] In SeptemberÂ 2006Â (2006-09), Aerosvit was the first airline to operate both inbound and outbund passenger flights at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport.[13][14] and in October, the airline celebrated the six-millionth passenger carried since it started operations.[15]",
				"after": "In 2007, due to cooperation with Delta Air Lines, the number of destinations in the United States increased, allowing onward travel from New York to cities such as Los Angeles and Portland. It was in the same year that Aerosvit Airlines and Donbassaero began to build (at the initiative of their joint main shareholder Privat Group) the strategic alliance Ukrainian Aviation Group. Also, in this year, the fleet was supplemented with a third long haul aircraft Boeing 767 and eleventh and twelfth mid-range Boeing 737s, whilst the start of code share flights with Belavia on the Kyiv-Minsk route took place. In AugustÂ 2007Â (2007-08), it was announced that a contract was signed with Boeing for the acquisition of seven Boeing 737-800s and purchase rights for another seven;[17] in a deal valued at more than US$500Â million, the operation marked the company's first direct purchase of aircraft since its foundation.[18][19] These new aircraft would replace the airline's 13-strong Boeing 737 Classic fleet;[20] the first of them was handed over by the manufacturer in MarchÂ 2012Â (2012-03).[21] In DecemberÂ 2007Â (2007-12), the airline began the commercialisation of e-tickets on its website.[22]",
