Northwest also served Hawaii from the West Coast, and Georgia and Florida from Chicago.[16] On June 1, 1959, Northwest accepted its first turboprop jet aircraft, the Lockheed L-188 Electra, from its manufacturer. Northwest Airlines started flying the three-engine Boeing 727 jet airliner in November 1964, when its first short fuselage series 51 was delivered.[17] Many examples of the stretched series 251 followed.",
