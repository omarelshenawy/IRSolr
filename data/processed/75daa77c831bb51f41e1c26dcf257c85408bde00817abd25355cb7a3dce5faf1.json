Barber responded angrily with a five-page rebuttal, and suggesting that the Chicago newspapers not print \"the opinions of people who display a deplorable amount of ignorance and likewise seem inclined to say 'Stinking Fish'Â \".[27] Warner reacted with resignation, stating that he had not yet seen the new coin \"but I'll wager it doesn't look like the model\".[27] A major objection by critics was that Barber had lowered the relief of Warner's badge to ensure the new coins met the standards of circulating coins and could stack properly; critics saw this as unnecessary as the coins were to be merely souvenirs, unlikely to enter circulation.[28]",
