				"previous": "The original Model 525 CitationJet was developed as a replacement for the Citation and Citation I, being launched in 1989.[1] Basically an all new aircraft, the CitationJet used a modified version of the Citation's forward fuselage, but with a new supercritical laminar flow wing, and a new T-tail configured tailplane. It is powered by two Williams FJ44 turbofans, and features EFIS avionics and single pilot certification. The CitationJet's fuselage is 11 inches (27Â cm) shorter than the Citation I's, but has a lowered center aisle for increased cabin height. The CitationJet's first flight was on April 29, 1991, with its first delivery on March 30, 1993.[1]",
				"after": "The Cessna Citation CJ1 (also Model 525) was developed as an improved version of the original CitationJet.[2] The CJ1 improved on the CitationJet by adding a more-modern EFIS avionics suite and a moderate increase in maximum takeoff weight. The CJ1 has been replaced by the CJ1+, which shares the same airframe but has an additional updated avionics package, and FADEC to allow the engines to be controlled by computer rather than mechanical controls. The GE Honda HF120 engine is offered as a retrofit to the CJ1.[3]",
