				"after": "Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) describes an accident in which an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the ground, a mountain, water, or an obstacle.[2] The pilots are generally unaware of the danger until it is too late. The term was coined by engineers at Boeing in the late 1970s.[3] Accidents where an aircraft is already damaged and uncontrollable at the time of the collision (also known as uncontrolled flight into terrain) are not considered CFIT. Terrorist incidents and suicide-by-pilot are different from CFIT, even if the aircraft is crashed into a natural structure.",
