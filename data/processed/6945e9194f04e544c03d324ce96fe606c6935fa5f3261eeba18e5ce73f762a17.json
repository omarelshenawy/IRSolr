				"previous": "In 2004, a stalemate in federal support of Amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as resumption of deferred maintenance. In fiscal 2004 and 2005, Congress appropriated about $1.2Â billion for Amtrak, $300Â million more than President George W. Bush had requested. However, the company's board requested $1.8Â billion through fiscal 2006, the majority of which (about $1.3Â billion) would be used to bring infrastructure, rolling stock, and motive power back to a state of good repair. In Congressional testimony, the DOT Inspector General confirmed that Amtrak would need at least $1.4Â billion to $1.5Â billion in fiscal 2006 and $2Â billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo. In 2006, Amtrak received just under $1.4Â billion, with the condition that Amtrak would reduce (but not eliminate) food and sleeper service losses. Thus, dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers. Only Auto Train and Empire Builder services continue regular made-on-board meal service. In 2010 the Senate approved a bill to provide $1.96Â billion to Amtrak, but cut the approval for high-speed rail to a $1Â billion appropriation.[122]",
