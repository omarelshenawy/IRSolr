				"after": "Donald Bradman was the youngest son of George and Emily (nÃ©e Whatman) Bradman, and was born on 27 August 1908 at Cootamundra, New South Wales (NSW).[11] He had a brother, Victor, and three sistersâIslet, Lilian and Elizabeth May.[11] One of his great-grandfathers was one of the first Italians to migrate to Australia in 1826.[12] Bradman's parents lived in the hamlet of Yeo Yeo, near Stockinbingal. His mother Emily gave birth to him at the Cootamundra home of Granny Scholz, a midwife. That house is now the Bradman Birthplace Museum. Emily had hailed from Mittagong in the NSW Southern Highlands, and in 1911, when Don Bradman was about two-and-a-half years old, his parents decided to relocate to Bowral, close to Mittagong, to be closer to Emily's family and friends, as life at Yeo Yeo was proving difficult.[11][13][14]",
