				"Coulomb friction, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:",
				"Dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' (\"stiction\") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces."
