				"previous": "Amel-Marduk was the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar II. He reigned only two years (562 â 560 BC). According to the Biblical Book of Kings, he pardoned and released Jehoiachin, king of Judah, who had been a prisoner in Babylon for thirty-seven years. Allegedly, because Amel-Marduk tried to modify his father's policies, he was murdered by Neriglissar, his brother-in-law.",
			"after": [
				"Neriglissar appears to have been a more stable ruler, conducting a number of public works, restoring temples etc.",
				"He conducted successful military campaigns against Cilicia, which had threatened Babylonian interests. Neriglissar however reigned for only four years, being succeeded by the youthful Labashi-Marduk. It is unclear if Neriglissar was himself a member of the Chaldean tribe, or a native of the city of Babylon."
