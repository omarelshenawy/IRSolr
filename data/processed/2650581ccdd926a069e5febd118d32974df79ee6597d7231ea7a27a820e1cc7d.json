				"previous": "On April 16, 2010, United resumed merger talks with Continental Airlines. (The two airlines had previously discussed merging in 2008.)[42] The board of directors of both Continental and UAL Corporation's United Airlines reached an agreement to combine operations on May 2, 2010. The combined carrier would retain the United Airlines name, but use Continental's logo and livery, and Continental's CEO Jeff Smisek would head the new company. The merger was contingent upon shareholder and regulatory approval.[43]",
				"after": "The ContinentalâUnited merger was approved by the European Commission in July 2010 and by the US Justice Department on August 27, 2010.[44][45] On September 17, 2010, United's shareholders approved the merger deal with Continental Airlines.[46] Both carriers planned to begin merging operations in 2011 to form the world's biggest carrier.[47] On October 1, 2010, UAL Corporation completed its merger with Continental Airlines and changed its name to United Continental Holdings, Inc. The airline received a single operating certificate from the FAA on November 30, 2011.[48] On March 3, 2012, Continental and United merged their passenger service systems, frequent-flier programs, and websites which officially eliminated the Continental name and brand as far as the public was concerned.[49]",
