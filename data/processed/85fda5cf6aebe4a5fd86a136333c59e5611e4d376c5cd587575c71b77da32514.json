				"previous": "By the time the definitive B-17G appeared, the number of guns had been increased from seven to thirteen, the designs of the gun stations were finalized, and other adjustments were completed. The B-17G was the final version of the Flying Fortress, incorporating all changes made to its predecessor, the B-17F,[57] adopting the remotely operated \"chin turret\" for forward defense from the YB-40 \"gunship\" version, and in total 8,680 were built,[64] the last one (by Lockheed) on 28 July 1945.[65] Many B-17Gs were converted for other missions such as cargo hauling, engine testing and reconnaissance.[66] Initially designated SB-17G, a number of B-17Gs were also converted for search-and-rescue duties, later to be redesignated B-17H.[67]",
				"after": "Late in World WarÂ II, at least 25 B-17s were fitted with radio controls and television cameras, loaded with 20,000Â lb (9,100Â kg) of high-explosives and dubbed BQ-7 \"Aphrodite missiles\" for Operation Aphrodite. The operation, which involved remotely flying Aphrodite drones onto their targets by accompanying CQ-17 \"mothership\" control aircraft, was approved on 26 June 1944, and assigned to the 388th Bombardment Group stationed at RAF Fersfield, a satellite of RAF Knettishall.[68]",
