				"previous": "New Roman cursive script, also known as minuscule cursive, was in use from the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; â¨aâ©, â¨bâ©, â¨dâ©, and â¨eâ© had taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters were proportionate to each other. This script evolved into the medieval scripts known as Merovingian and Carolingian minuscule.",
				"after": "It was not until the Middle Ages that the letter â¨Wâ© (originally a ligature of two â¨Vâ©s) was added to the Latin alphabet, to represent sounds from the Germanic languages which did not exist in medieval Latin, and only after the Renaissance did the convention of treating â¨Iâ© and â¨Uâ© as vowels, and â¨Jâ© and â¨Vâ© as consonants, become established. Prior to that, the former had been merely allographs of the latter.",
