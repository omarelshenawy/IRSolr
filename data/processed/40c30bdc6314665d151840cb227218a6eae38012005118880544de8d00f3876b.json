				"after": "The dam that holds back the waters of Lake Burley Griffin was named Scrivener Dam after Charles Robert Scrivener.[47] The dam was designed and built by Rheinstahl Union Bruckenbau in West Germany,[60][64] and utilised state-of-the-art post-tensioning techniques to cope with any problems or movements in the riverbed.[55] This was required because of the quartz porphyry and geological faulting upon which the dam sits.[64] About 55,000 cubic metres (72,000Â cuÂ yd) of concrete was used in its construction. The dam is 33 metres (108Â ft) high and 319 metres (1,047Â ft) long with a maximum wall thickness of 19.7 metres (65Â ft). The dam is designed to handle a once in 5,000 year flood event.[65] Construction began in September 1960 and the dam was locked in September 1963.[64]",
