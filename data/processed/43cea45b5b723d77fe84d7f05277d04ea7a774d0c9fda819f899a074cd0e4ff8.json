				"after": "Historically the LNC had invested much of its income from burials and fares, and used the dividends from these investments to pay for cemetery upkeep.[56] Although Alliance Property kept the name \"London Necropolis Company\" for its funeral business, it was a property developer with no interest in the funeral industry, and saw little reason to spend large amounts maintaining the cemetery, proceeding with the proposed crematorium, or promoting new burials of bodies or cremated remains.[56] The rising popularity of cremation meant the rate of burials was at a historic low, while the Victorian character of the cemetery had fallen out of fashion.[56] The income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds, and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness.[56] Over the course of the 1960s most undertaking work at Brookwood came to an end.[141]",
