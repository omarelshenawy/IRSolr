				"previous": "The Kingdom of Georgia reached its zenith in the 12th to early 13th centuries. This period during the reigns of David IV (called David the Builder, r. 1089â1125) and his granddaughter Tamar (r. 1184â1213) has been widely termed as Georgia's Golden Age or the Georgian Renaissance[26] This early Georgian renaissance, which preceded its Western European analogue, was characterized by impressive military victories, territorial expansion, and a cultural renaissance in architecture, literature, philosophy and the sciences.[27] The Golden age of Georgia left a legacy of great cathedrals, romantic poetry and literature, and the epic poem \"The Knight in the Panther's Skin\".[28]",
				"after": "David the Builder initiated the Georgian Golden Age by driving the Seljuk Turks from the country, winning the major Battle of Didgori in 1121, and expanding Georgian cultural and political influence southward into Armenia and eastward to the Caspian Sea.[18]",
