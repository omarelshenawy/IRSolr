				"previous": "In about 1593, Galileo constructed a thermometer, using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.",
				"after": "In 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman Thomas Harriot and others, among the first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. The name \"telescope\" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, Giovanni Demisiani,[113] at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei.[114] The name was derived from the Greek tele = 'far' and skopein = 'to look or see'. In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects.[115] By 1624 Galileo had used[116] a compound microscope. He gave one of these instruments to Cardinal Zollern in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of Bavaria,[117] and in September he sent another to Prince Cesi.[118] The Linceans played a role again in naming the \"microscope\" a year later when fellow academy member Giovanni Faber coined the word for Galileo's invention from the Greek words Î¼Î¹ÎºÏÏÎ½ (micron) meaning \"small\", and ÏÎºÎ¿ÏÎµá¿Î½ (skopein) meaning \"to look at\". The word was meant to be analogous with \"telescope\".[119][120] Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo's microscopes, and published in 1625, appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound microscope.[121]",
