				"after": "The introduction of the tulip to Europe is usually attributed to Ogier de Busbecq, the ambassador of FerdinandÂ I, Holy Roman Emperor to the Sultan of Turkey, who sent the first tulip bulbs and seeds to Vienna in 1554 from the Ottoman Empire.[11] Tulip bulbs were soon distributed from Vienna to Augsburg, Antwerp and Amsterdam.[12] Its popularity and cultivation in the United Provinces (now the Netherlands)[13] is generally thought to have started in earnest around 1593 after the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established the hortus academicus.[14] He planted his collection of tulip bulbs and found they were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the Low Countries;[15] shortly thereafter the tulip began to grow in popularity.[16]",
