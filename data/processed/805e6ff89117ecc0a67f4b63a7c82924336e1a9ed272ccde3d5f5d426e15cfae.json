				"after": "Gradually, as the university grew, more buildings were constructed on campus and a trolley system was built to connect the growing university to downtown Grand Forks. However, there were several major interruptions in the life of the university. In 1918, UND was the hardest-hit single institution in the country by the flu epidemic which killed 1,400 people in North Dakota alone.[12] Later that year, classes were suspended so the campus could become an army base for soldiers during World War I.[12] During the Great Depression, UND provided free housing to students willing to do manual labor on campus.[13] \"Camp Depression,\" as it was called, consisted of railroad cabooses that housed eight male students each.[13] \"Camp Depression\" students did not get regular meals from the cafeteria and had to be satisfied with only free leftovers. However, a number of Grand Forks citizens often opened their homes and kitchen tables to many of these young men.[13]",
