				"previous": "In Munich, Germany in 1957 Rudolf MÃ¶ssbauer, in what has been called one of the \"landmark experiments in twentieth-century physics\",[36] discovered the resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption of gamma rays by atoms in a solid metal sample containing only 191Ir.[37] This phenomenon, known as the MÃ¶ssbauer effect (which has since been observed for other nuclei, such as 57Fe), and developed as MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, has made important contributions to research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.[27] MÃ¶ssbauer received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, at the age 32, just three years after he published his discovery.[38] In 1986 Rudolf MÃ¶ssbauer was honored for his achievements with the Albert Einstein Medal and the Elliot Cresson Medal.",
				"after": "Iridium is one of the nine least abundant stable elements in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001Â ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times more abundant, platinum is 10 times more abundant, and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant.[4] Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium.[4] In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5Â ppm or more.[40] The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic (\"iron-loving\") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.[19]",
