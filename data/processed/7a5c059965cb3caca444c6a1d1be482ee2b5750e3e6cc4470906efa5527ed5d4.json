				"previous": "The Fourier series coefficients (and inverse transform), are defined by:",
				"after": "Parameter T corresponds to the sampling interval, and this Fourier series can now be recognized as a form of the Poisson summation formula. Thus we have the important result that when a discrete data sequence, s[n], is proportional to samples of an underlying continuous function, s(t), one can observe a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform, S(Æ). That is a cornerstone in the foundation of digital signal processing. Furthermore, under certain idealized conditions one can theoretically recover S(Æ) and s(t) exactly. A sufficient condition for perfect recovery is that the non-zero portion of S(Æ) be confined to a known frequency interval of width 1/T. When that interval is [-0.5/T, 0.5/T], the applicable reconstruction formula is the WhittakerâShannon interpolation formula.",
