				"previous": "McCay's first three films were the earliest animated works to have a commercial impact; their success motivated film studios to join in the infant animation industry.[69] Other studios used McCay's combination of live action with animation, such as the Fleischer Studios series Out of the Inkwell (1918â1929)[15] and Walt Disney's Alice Comedies series (1923â1927).[70] McCay's clean-line, high-contrast, realistic style set the pattern for American animation to come, and set it apart from the abstract, open forms of animation in Europe.[71] This legacy is most apparent in the feature films of the Walt Disney Animation Studios, for example in FantasiaÂ (1940), which included anthropomorphic dinosaurs animated in a naturalistic style, with careful attention to timing and weight. Shamus Culhane, Dave and Max Fleischer, Walter Lantz, Otto Messmer, Pat Sullivan, Paul Terry, and Bill Tytla were among the generation of American animators who drew inspiration from the films they saw in McCay's vaudeville act.[72] Gertieââ'âs reputation was such that animation histories long named it as the first animated film.[50]",
				"after": "Around 1921, McCay worked on a second animated film featuring Gertie, titled Gertie on Tour. The film was to have Gertie bouncing on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, attempting to eat the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., wading in on the Atlantic City shore, and other scenes.[73] The film exists only in concept sketches and in one minute of film footage in which Gertie plays with a trolley and dances before other dinosaurs.[74]",
