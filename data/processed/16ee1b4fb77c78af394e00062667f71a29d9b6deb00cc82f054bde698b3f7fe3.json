				"after": "North Campus is the most contiguous campus, built independently from the city on a large plot of farm landâapproximately 800 acres (3.2Â km2)âthat the university bought in 1952.[37] It is newer than Central Campus, and thus has more modern architecture, whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or gothic in style. The architect Eero Saarinen, based in Birmingham, Michigan, created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building.[38] North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings. Each of the bell towers houses a grand carillon. The North Campus tower is called Lurie Tower.[39] The University of Michigan's largest residence hall, Bursley Hall, is located on North Campus.[34]",
