				"previous": "The last axiom needs the most explanation. If X is an object of C, an \"equivalence relation\" R on X is a map RâXÃX in C such that for any object Y in C, the induced map Hom(Y,R)âHom(Y,X)ÃHom(Y,X) gives an ordinary equivalence relation on the set Hom(Y,X). Since C has colimits we may form the coequalizer of the two maps RâX; call this X/R. The equivalence relation is \"effective\" if the canonical map",
