				"previous": "While the first ocean sunfish to be held in an aquarium in the United States is claimed to have arrived at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in August 1986,[41] other specimens have previously been held at other locations. Marineland of the Pacific, located on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, California, held an ocean sunfish in its warm-water tank as early as 1957,[42] and in 1964 held a 650-pound specimen, claimed as the largest ever captured at that time.[43] However, another 1000-pound specimen was brought alive to Marineland Studios Aquarium, near St. Augustine, Florida, in 1941.[44]",
				"after": "As of 2010[update], Monterey Bay Aquarium was the only location in the United States where the sunfish was displayed.[45] Because sunfish had not been kept in captivity on a large scale before, the staff at Monterey Bay was forced to innovate and create their own methods for capture, feeding, and parasite control. By 1998, these issues were overcome, and the aquarium was able to hold a specimen for more than a year, later releasing it after its weight increased by more than 14 times.[22] Mola mola has since become a permanent feature of the Open Sea exhibit.[19] Monterey Bay Aquarium's largest sunfish specimen was euthanized on February 14, 2008, after an extended period of poor health.[46]",
