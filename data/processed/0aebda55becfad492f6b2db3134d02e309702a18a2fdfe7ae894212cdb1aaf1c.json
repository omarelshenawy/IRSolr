In earlier times it may have spawned the legend of the Cat Sidhe or \"Fairy Cat\".[171][172] The fabulous Loch Ness Monster, possibly a form of \"water horse\", has a long history; the first recorded sighting allegedly took place in 565 AD.[173] More recently, the Stronsay Beast was an unidentified cryptid washed ashore in the Orkney islands in the 19th century.[174]",
