				"after": "At Midhurst, West Sussex, Holden designed Tudor-style faÃ§ades for the Sir Ernest Cassel-funded King Edward VII Sanatorium (1903â06). The building features long wings of south-facing rooms to maximise patients' exposure to sunlight and fresh air. The design is in keeping with the building's rural setting, with faÃ§ades in the local tile-hung style.[25][31] Pevsner called this \"certainly one of the best buildings of its date in the country\" and \"a model of how to build very large institutions\".[32] He designed the sanitorium's V-shaped open-air chapel so that it could be used for both outdoor and indoor worship.[25][31] Both buildings are Grade II listed.[33][34] Other hospitals he designed in this period include the British Seamen's Hospital in Istanbul (1903â04) and the Women's Hospital in Soho, central London (1908).[16]",
