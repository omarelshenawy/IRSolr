				"previous": "Born into the families of a goldsmith and a watch maker, MirÃ³ grew up in the Barri GÃ²tic neighborhood of Barcelona.[2] His father was Miquel MirÃ³ Adzerias and his mother was Dolors FerrÃ .[3] He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13, a medieval mansion. In 1907 he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja, to the dismay of his father. He studied at the Cercle ArtÃ­stic de Sant Lluc[4] and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the Dalmau Gallery, where his work was ridiculed and defaced.[5] Inspired by Cubist and surrealist exhibitions from abroad, MirÃ³ was drawn towards the arts community that was gathering in Montparnasse and in 1920 moved to Paris, but continued to spend his summers in Catalonia.[2]",
				"after": "MirÃ³ initially went to business school as well as art school. He began his working career when he was a teenager as a clerk, although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown.[6] His early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists exhibited in Barcelona, was inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul CÃ©zanne. The resemblance of MirÃ³'s work to that of the intermediate generation of the avant-garde has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period.[7]",
