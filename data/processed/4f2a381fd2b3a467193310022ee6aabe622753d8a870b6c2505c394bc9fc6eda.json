				"previous": "U.S. Numbered Highways are the original interstate highways, dating back to 1926. U.S. Highways are also numbered in a grid: even numbered for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). Three-digit highways, also known as \"child routes,\" are branches off their main one- or two-digit \"parents\" (for example, U.S. RouteÂ 202 is a branch of U.S. Route 2). However, USÂ 101, rather than a \"child\" of USÂ 1, is considered a \"mainline\" U.S. Route.",
				"after": "State highways are the next level in the hierarchy. Each state and territory has its own system for numbering highways, some more systematic than others. Each state also has its own design for its highway markers; the number in a circle is the default sign, but many choose a different design connected to the state, such as an outline of the state with the number inside. Many states also operate a system of county highways.",
