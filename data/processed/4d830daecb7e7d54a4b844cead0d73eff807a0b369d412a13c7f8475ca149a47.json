				"previous": "The Goths' success is marked by the expansion of the multiethnic \"SÃ¢ntana de MureÅ-Chernyakhov culture\".[19] Settlements of the culture appeared in Moldavia and Wallachia at the end of the 3rdÂ century,[82] and in Transylvania after 330.[56] These lands were inhabited by a sedentary population engaged in farming and cattle-breeding.[29] Pottery, comb-making and other handicrafts flourished in the villages.[83] Wheel-made fine pottery is a featuring item of the period, but hand-made cups of the local tradition were also preserved.[84][85] Plowshares similar to those made in nearby Roman provinces and Scandinavian-style brooches indicate trade contacts with these regions.[86] \"SÃ¢ntana de MureÅ-Chernyakhov\" villages, sometimes covering an area exceeding 20 hectares (49 acres), were not fortified[87] and comprised two types of houses: sunken huts with walls made of wattle and daub and surface buildings with plastered timber walls.[87] Sunken huts had for centuries been typical for settlements east of the Carpathians,[88] but now they appeared in distant zones of the Pontic steppes.[89]",
				"after": "The multiethnic Gutthiuda was divided into smaller political units or kuni, each headed by tribal chiefs or reiks.[90] In case of emergency, the tribal chiefs' council elected a supreme leader who was known as iudex regum (\"judge of kings\")[91] by St Ambrose.[92] Christian prisoners of war were the first missionaries among the Goths.[93] Ulfilas, himself a descendant of a Cappadocian captive, was ordained bishop \"of the Christians in the land of the Goths\"[94] in 341.[93][95] Expelled from Gutthiuda during a persecution of Christians, Ulfilas settled in Moesia in 348.[96]",
