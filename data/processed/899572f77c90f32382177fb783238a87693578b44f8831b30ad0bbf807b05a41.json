				"after": "DETA was Mozambique's flag carrier until 1980.[28] Following allegations of corruption,[29] the airline was restructured and renamed LAMÂ â Linhas AÃ©reas de MoÃ§ambique early that year.[10] Four more Boeing 737-200s were ordered in 1981. The Douglas DC-8-62 that had been ordered at the end of the DETA era arrived in 1982. In 1983, a Douglas DC-10-30 was ordered. Also in 1983, a MaputoâManziniâMaseru service that was flown using F-27 equipment was launched in cooperation with Lesotho Airways. The DC-10-30 joined the fleet in 1984, and new services to East Berlin, Copenhagen and Paris were started.[28] At MarchÂ 1985Â (1985-03), the carrier had 1,927 employees. At this time, the DC-10-30 and three Boeing 737-200s (including a convertible one) worked on a route network radiating from Maputo that served Beira, Berlin-Schonefeld, Dar-es-Salaam, Harare, Johannesburg, Lisbon, Lusaka, Manzini, Maseru, Nampula, Paris, Pemba, Sofia and Quelimane.[29] TACV Cabo Verde Airlines leased the DC-10 in the weekends during 1985.[30]",
