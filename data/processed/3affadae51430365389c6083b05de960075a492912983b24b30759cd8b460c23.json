Its maximum gross weight was increased to 92,000Â lb (42,000Â kg).[7] By this time, the aircraft was nicknamed \"Grandpappy\" by 20th Troop Carrier Squadron airmen.[14] It displayed nose art depicting an elephant carrying on its back a large crate labeled \"supplies\".[13] During World War II, the XC-105 carried freight and personnel to and from Florida, and throughout the Caribbean, based out of Albrook Field beginning in June 1943. Hundreds of young women were flown in \"Grandpappy\" from Miami to the Canal Zone to engage in US government work; these trips were dubbed the \"Georgia Peach Run\".[13] \"Grandpappy\" traveled to the Galapagos, landing on Baltra Island at the same airfield built following the XB-15 aerial survey of May 1940.[13]",
