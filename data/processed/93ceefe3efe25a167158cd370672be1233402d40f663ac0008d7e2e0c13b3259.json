				"previous": "The oldest known sundial is from Egypt, it dates back to around 1500 BC (19th Dynasty), and was discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 2013.[12] Sundials have their origin in shadow clocks, which were the first devices used for measuring the parts of a day.[13] Ancient Egyptian obelisks, constructed about 3500Â BC, are also among the earliest shadow clocks.[6][14][15]",
				"after": "Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts.[12] One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices.[6][16] A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500Â BC, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.[17]",
