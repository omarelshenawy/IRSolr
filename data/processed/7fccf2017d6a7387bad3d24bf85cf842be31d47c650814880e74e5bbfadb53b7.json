It consists of a low desert plain rising gently to a low central escarpment with the highest point the 134Â m (440Â ft) Mountain of Smoke (Jabal ad Dukhan).[123][124] Bahrain had a total area of 665Â km2 (257Â sqÂ mi) but due to land reclamation, the area increased to 765Â km2 (295Â sqÂ mi), which is slightly larger than Hamburg or the Isle of Man.[124]",
