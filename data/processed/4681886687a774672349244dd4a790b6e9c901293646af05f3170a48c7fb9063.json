				"previous": "The Municipal Council is responsible for citywide issues, including managing the budget, maintaining civic infrastructure, and overseeing museums and major cultural centers.[134] Since the government operates under a \"powerful mayor, weak council\" approach, the council's leaderâthe metropolitan mayorâhas the authority to make swift decisions, often at the expense of transparency.[135] The Municipal Council is advised by the Metropolitan Executive Committee, although the Committee also has limited power to make decisions of its own.[136] All representatives on the Committee are appointed by the metropolitan mayor and the Council, with the mayorâor someone of his or her choosingâserving as head.[136][137]",
				"after": "Meanwhile, district councils are chiefly responsible for waste management and construction projects within their respective districts. They each maintain their own budgets, although the metropolitan mayor reserves the right to review district decisions. One-fifth of all district council members, including the district mayors, also represent their districts in the Municipal Council.[134] All members of the district councils and the Municipal Council, including the metropolitan mayor, are elected to five-year terms.[138] Representing the Justice and Development Party, Kadir TopbaÅ has been Mayor of Istanbul since March 2004.[139]",
