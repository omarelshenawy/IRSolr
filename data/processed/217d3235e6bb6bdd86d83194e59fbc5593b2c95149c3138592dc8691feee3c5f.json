				"previous": "The building on Fayette and Holliday Streets had been in a state of decline for twoÂ decades. It was not until 1873, when a fire spread from the Holliday Street Theater to the \"Assembly Rooms\", that the City Council dedicated the resources to erect a new building for City College. A lot was acquired on North Howard Street opposite West Centre Street and the Council allocated $150,000 for the construction of the new building designed by Baltimore architect Edmund G. Lind.[20] The new English Gothic revival-styled building faced east on Howard Street and was dedicated on February 1, 1875. The school moved in the following week.[21]",
