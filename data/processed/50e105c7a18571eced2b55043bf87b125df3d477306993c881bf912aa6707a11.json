M.Â elegans is similar in appearance to M.Â aurantiomarginata, and some have considered them synonymous.[20] M.Â elegans is larger, with a cap diameter up to 3.5Â cm (1.4Â in) and stipe length up to 12Â cm (4.7Â in), darker, and has pale greenish-yellow colors on the gill edges and stipes that stain dull reddish-brown in age.[21] M.Â leaiana is readily distinguished from M.Â aurantiomarginata by the bright orange color of its fruit bodies, its clustered growth on rotting wood, and the presence of a gelatinous layer on its stipe.[22] M.Â strobilinoides closely resembles M.Â aurantiomarginata in shape, size, spore morphology, and the presence of hairs at the stipe base. It has a cap color that ranges from scarlet to yellow, and features scarlet edges on widely spaced, pale pinkish-orange to yellow gills.[23]",
