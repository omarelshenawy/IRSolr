				"previous": "In August 1901, Harvey's son Hal and brother-in-law Ernest Halliday opened a large bathhouse on Silver Springs Creek, across the lagoon from Hotel Monte Ne. The indoor pool was the first in Arkansas.[3] It was 25 by 50Â ft (7.6 by 15Â m) and 7 feet (2Â m) deep and included springboards and slides. Water from the spring flowed into the swimming pool, half of which was sectioned off and featured heated water piped in from a wood-fired boiler. The bathhouse also had a two-lane bowling alley. The pool continued to be a popular attraction throughout the life of Monte Ne until the opening of an outdoor pool in Willola, Arkansas in 1923.[3]",
				"after": "In April, Harvey began seeking industries to move to Monte Ne, but few actually did. Monte Ne's small downtown area had at one time a general store, a livery stable a gristmill, and a post office. The General store also serve as a host for school plays and as well as a Masonic Lodge. The post office erroneously changed the town's name to Vinda (a misreading of a local wine ranch called Vinola), but later formally changed it to Monte Ne.",
