				"previous": "The accessory drive is a gearbox that forms part of a gas turbine engine.[1] Although not part of the engine's core, it drives the accessories, fuel pumps etc., that are otherwise essential for the operation of the engine or the aircraft on which it is mounted. Accessory drives on large engines handle between 400â500Â hp.[2]",
				"after": "Power for the accessory drive is taken from the central shaft linking the turbine and compressor sections of the engine. This requires an internal gearbox that couples the drive to a radial driveshaft[3] or towershaft[4] that drives an external gearbox.",
