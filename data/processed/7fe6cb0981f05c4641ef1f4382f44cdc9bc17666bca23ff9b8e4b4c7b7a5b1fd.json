				"previous": "The Raft of the Medusa fuses many influences from the Old Masters, from the Last Judgment and Sistine Chapel ceiling of Michelangelo (1475â1564) and Raphael's Transfiguration,[37] to the monumental approach of Jacques-Louis David (1748â1825) and Antoine-Jean Gros (1771â1835), to contemporary events. By the 18th century, shipwrecks had become a recognised feature of marine art, as well as an increasingly common occurrence as more journeys were made by sea. Claude Joseph Vernet (1714â1789) created many such images,[38] achieving naturalistic colour through direct observationâunlike other artists at that timeâand was said to have tied himself to the mast of a ship in order to witness a storm.[39]",
				"after": "Although the men depicted on the raft had spent 13Â days adrift and suffered hunger, disease and cannibalism, GÃ©ricault pays tribute to the traditions of heroic painting and presents his figures as muscular and healthy. According to the art historian Richard Muther, there is still a strong debt to Classicism in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid \"unpictorial\" costumes. Muther observes that there is \"still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death\".[24]",
