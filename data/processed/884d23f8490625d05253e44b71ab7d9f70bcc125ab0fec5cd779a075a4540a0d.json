				"previous": "Hydrodynamics concerns the flow of water around the ship's hull, bow, stern and over bodies such as propeller blades or rudder, or through thruster tunnels. Resistance â resistance towards motion in water primarily caused due to flow of water around the hull. Powering calculation is done based on this. Propulsion â to move the vessel through water using propellers, thrusters, water jets, sails etc. Engine types are mainly internal combustion. Some vessels are electrically powered using nuclear or solar energy. Ship motions â involves motions of the vessel in seaway and its responses in waves and wind. Controllability (maneuvering) â involves controlling and maintaining position and direction of the vessel",
