				"previous": "More mountains and highlands help to split the interior into a series of relatively isolated regions suitable for wet-rice cultivation; the rice lands of Java are among the richest in the World.[8] Java was the first place where Indonesian coffee was grown, starting in 1699. Today, Coffea arabica is grown on the Ijen Plateau by small-holders and larger plantations.",
				"after": "The area of Java is approximately 150,000Â km2.[9] It is about 1,000Â km (620Â mi) long and up to 210Â km (130Â mi) wide. The island's longest river is the 600Â km long Solo River.[10] The river rises from its source in central Java at the Lawu volcano, then flows north and eastward to its mouth in the Java Sea near the city of Surabaya. Other major rivers are Brantas, Citarum, Cimanuk and Serayu.",
