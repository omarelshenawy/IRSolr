				"previous": "In March 2007, Johnson began suggesting standing for the position of Mayor of London in the 2008 mayoral election.[175] His candidacy was not initially taken seriously within the Conservative Party, who instead considered Nick Boles the party's main contender for the job.[176] However, after Boles had to withdraw and no other well-known candidate was forthcoming, Cameron agreed to back Johnson's candidacy.[177] He was reassured by London's free newspaper, The Evening Standard, that they would support him throughout the campaign.[34] In July 2007, he officially announced his candidacy,[178][179] and was selected as Conservative candidate in September after gaining 75% of the vote in a public London-wide primary.[180][181] There was some anger in Henley among party members and constituents who felt that Johnson was abandoning them for London.[182] Right-wing journalists Simon Heffer and Peregrine Worsthorne described Johnson as not being serious enough to hold the role of Mayor of London,[183] Worsthorne noting that the \"harder he tried [to be serious], the more insincere, incoherent, evasive and even puerile he looked and sounded\".[184] Labour incumbent Ken Livingstone took Johnson more seriously than many others were doing, referring to him as \"the most formidable opponent I will face in my political career.\"[185] Livingstone's campaign focused on portraying Johnson as an upper-class toff who was out of touch with the lives of most Londoners, also alleging that he was a bigot, as evidenced by racist and homophobic language that he had used in his Telegraph column.[186] This situation was exacerbated when the far right British National Party urged its supporters to give their second preference votes to Johnson.[187][188]",
				"after": "Johnson's candidacy was primarily funded by sympathetic individuals in London's financial sector.[189] The Conservative Party hired Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby to run Johnson's campaign.[190] Aware of Johnson's propensity for committing gaffes, Crosby prevented him from holding interviews with the print and broadcast media in favour of radio talk shows and daytime television which asked \"easier\" questions.[191][192] Crosby also made Johnson tell fewer jokes and have a simpler haircut to help make him appear more serious.[191] Johnson's campaign focused on reducing youth crime, making public transport safer, and replacing the 'bendy buses' with a new fleet of Routemasters.[193] Johnson's campaign capitalised on his popularity, even among those who opposed his policies.[194] His political opponents complained that a common attitude among voters was that \"I'm voting for Boris because he is a laugh\".[193] The campaign targeted Conservative-leaning suburbs in outer London to capitalise on a sense of being overlooked by the Livingstone administration which had paid most attention to inner London areas.[195][192] Johnson also focused on counteracting his image as a bigot; he declared that \"I'm absolutely 100% anti-racist; I despise and loath racism\".[196] Publicly emphasising his own Turkish ancestry,[197] he went contrary to Conservative policy by declaring his support for an earned amnesty for illegal immigrants.[198]",
