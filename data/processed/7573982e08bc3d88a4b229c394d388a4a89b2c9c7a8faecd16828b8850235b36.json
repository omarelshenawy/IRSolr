				"previous": "In the spring of 1912, in search of a change from his unrewarding clerical job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket.[34] He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, he would be able to finance his winter studies of music and literature.[35] His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional,[n 3] and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright.[37][38] Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: \"Because of Alington I call myselfÂ ... an old Salopian\".[39] Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea.[40] In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.[41]",
				"after": "Cardus did not find his duties at Shrewsbury onerous.[42] He made frequent trips to Manchester, for HallÃ© concerts or to watch Thomas Beecham conduct at the Manchester Opera House.[43] He found time for other work; thus, in 1913, he was the music critic for the northern edition of The Daily Citizen.[4] This short-lived newspaper was an official organ of the early Labour Party;[44] mainly out of admiration for Bernard Shaw Cardus had joined the Independent Labour Partyâa separate organisation from the main bodyâbut quickly lost interest in socialism: \"Their creed or system was obviously not to be a means to an end but an end in itself\".[45] According to Brookes, the influence of Shrewsbury School affected Cardus to the extent that \"[t]he playing fields of an English public school were for him a more natural setting than the iconoclastic frenzy of the Lyons cafÃ© where socialism vied with Richard Strauss for pride of place in the race to modernity\".[46] The Daily Citizen paid poorly, and Cardus's association with it soon ended.[47][n 4]",
