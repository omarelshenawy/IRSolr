				"previous": "Franco's troops conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind campaign during the first two months of 1939. Tarragona fell on 15 January,[197] followed by Barcelona on 26 January[198] and Girona on 2 February.[199] On 27 February, the United Kingdom and France recognized the Franco regime.[200]",
				"after": "Only Madrid and a few other strongholds remained for the Republican forces. On 5 March 1939, the Republican army, led by the Colonel Segismundo Casado and the politician JuliÃ¡n Besteiro, rose against the prime minister Juan NegrÃ­n and formed the National Defence Council (Consejo Nacional de Defensa or CND) to negotiate a peace deal.[201] NegrÃ­n fled to France on 6 March,[202] but the Communist troops around Madrid rose against the junta, starting a brief civil war within the civil war.[citation needed] Casado defeated them, and began peace negotiations with the Nationalists, but Franco refused to accept anything less than unconditional surrender.[203]",
