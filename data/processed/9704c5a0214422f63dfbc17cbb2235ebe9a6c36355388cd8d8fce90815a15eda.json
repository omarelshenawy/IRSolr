				"after": "Freedom from Want is considered one of Rockwell's finest works.[20] Of the four paintings in the Four Freedoms, it is the one most often seen in art books with critical review and commentary. Although all were intended to promote patriotism in a time of war, Freedom from Want became a symbol of \"family togetherness, peace, and plenty\", according to Linda Rosenkrantz, who compares it to \"a 'Hallmark' Christmas\".[25] Embodying nostalgia for an enduring American theme of holiday celebration,[26] the painting is not exclusively associated with Thanksgiving, and is sometimes known as I'll Be Home for Christmas.[27] The abundance and unity it shows were the idyllic hope of a post-war world, and the image has been reproduced in various formats.[25]",
