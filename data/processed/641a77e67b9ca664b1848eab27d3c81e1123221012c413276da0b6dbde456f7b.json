				"The Martinair fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of November 2014)[26][27]",
				"In 2006 Martinair purchased four Boeing 747-400s from Singapore Airlines. These passenger planes were converted to freighters to replace the older Boeing 747-200Fs. In 2009 three out of the four 747s were stored because of the economic crisis. In the end of 2010 two of the 747-400s were leased to Air Cargo Germany.[28][29] The remaining 747 (PH-MPS) returned into service in May 2011 with an untitled colour scheme, because Martinair wasn't sure yet if the plane would remain operating for them.[30] As of January 2015 the PH-MPS remains active in Martinair's fleet as the only 747BCF. The two ex-ACG planes are stored and the remaining 747BCF is currently operating for Saudi Arabian Airlines"
