				"after": "In 1939, as the occupation regime was being established, the Nazis confiscated Polish state property and much private property.[22][23] Countless art objects were looted and taken to Germany, in line with a plan that had been drawn up well in advance of the invasion.[24] The looting was supervised by experts of the SS-Ahnenerbe, Einsatzgruppen units, who were responsible for art, and by experts of Haupttreuhandstelle Ost, who were responsible for more mundane objects.[23] Notable items plundered by the Nazis included the Altar of Veit Stoss and paintings by Raphael, Rembrandt, Leonardo da Vinci, Canaletto and Bacciarelli.[23][25] Most of the important art pieces had been \"secured\" by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that \"over 90%\" of the art previously in Poland was in their possession.[23] Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned FÃ¼hrermuseum in Linz, while other art became the private property of Nazi officials.[23] Over 516,000Â individual art pieces were taken, including 2,800Â paintings by European painters; 11,000Â works by Polish painters; 1,400Â sculptures, 75,000Â manuscripts, 25,000Â maps, and 90,000Â books (including over 20,000Â printed before 1800); as well as hundreds of thousands of other objects of artistic and historic value.[24] Even exotic animals were taken from the zoos.[26]",
