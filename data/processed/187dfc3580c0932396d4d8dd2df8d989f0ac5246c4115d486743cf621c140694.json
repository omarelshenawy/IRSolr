				"Yemenia dates its origins back to Yemen Airlines,[5] a company that was founded in the second half of the 1940s[2] and owned by Ahmad bin Yahya, then King of Yemen.[6]",
				"When the Yemen Arab Republic was proclaimed in 1962, Yemen Airlines was issued a new airline licence on 4 August of that year (which remains valid until today), thus becoming the flag carrier of the country, with its head office in the Ministry of Communication Building in Sana'a.[6] In 1967, the airline entered a co-operation with United Arab Airlines, which lasted until 1972. During that period, it was known as Yemen Arab Airlines.[5]"
