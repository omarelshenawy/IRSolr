				"previous": "In an interview with Martin Bashir, later included in the 2003 broadcast of Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson acknowledged that his father hurt him when he was a child, recalling that Joseph often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that \"if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you.\"[23][24]",
				"after": "In 1965, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothersâa band formed by their father and which included brothers Jackie, Tito, and Jermaineâas backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. In 1966, Jackson began sharing lead vocals with his older brother Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to The Jackson 5.[15] That following year, the group won a major local talent show with Jackson performing James Brown's \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\".[25] From 1966 to 1968 the band toured the Midwest, frequently performing at a string of black clubs known as the \"chitlin' circuit\" as the opening act for R&B artists that included Sam and Dave, The O'Jays, Gladys Knight, and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows and other adult acts were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances.[26][27] In August 1967, while touring the East coast, the group won a weekly amateur night concert at The Apollo Theater in Harlem.[28]",
