The undercroft stands outside the museum building. It is a single-storey structure consisting of seven pairs of bays divided into two compartments, one of four and the other of three bays. It is entered through the portico added to the west front of the country house in 1886 by way of a pair of arched doorways in Norman style. The doorway to the right (south) is original, dating from the late 12thÂ century, while the other doorway is a replica dated 1886.[163] The older doorway has been described as \"the finest decorated Norman doorway in Cheshire\".[164] It is in good condition with little evidence of erosion and Greene considers that this is because it has always been protected from the weather.[55] The portico leads into the four-bay compartment. This has a tiled floor and contains a medieval-style fireplace.[165] The roof is ribbed vaulted.[166] On the east wall is a two-arched doorway leading to the former cloisters. To the north another archway leads to the three-bay compartment.[163] This also has a tile floor and contains the brick wine bins added in the 1780s.[165] The roof of this compartment has groined vaults.[166] The undercroft also contains a bell mould, reconstructed from the fragments of the original mould found in the excavations.[165]",
