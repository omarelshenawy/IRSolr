				"previous": "McKinleyâs good standing with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district.[47] Delegates to the county conventions thought he could attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated.[47] By that time, Hayes had been nominated for President, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign.[48] Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff, defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency.[48] McKinleyâs victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.[49]",
				"after": "McKinley first took his congressional seat in October 1877, when President Hayes summoned Congress into special session.[b] With the Republicans in the minority, McKinley was given unimportant committee assignments, which he undertook conscientiously.[51] McKinleyâs friendship with Hayes did McKinley little good on Capitol Hill; the President was not well-regarded by many leaders there.[52] The young congressman broke with Hayes on the question of the currency, but it did not affect their friendship.[53] The United States had effectively been placed on the gold standard by the Coinage Act of 1873; when silver prices dropped significantly, many sought to make silver again a legal tender, equally with gold. Such a course would be inflationary, but advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased money supply would be worth the inflation; opponents warned that âfree silverâ would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the United States in international trade.[54] McKinley voted for the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money, and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode Hayesâ veto of the legislation. In so doing, McKinley voted against the position of the House Republican leader, his fellow Ohioan and friend, James Garfield.[55]",
