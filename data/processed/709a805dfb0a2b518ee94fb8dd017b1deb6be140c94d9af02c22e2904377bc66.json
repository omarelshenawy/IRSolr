				"after": "The McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink is a multipurpose venue located along the western edge of Millennium Park opposite the streetwall of the Historic Michigan Boulevard District. On December 20, 2001, it became the first attraction in Millennium Park to open,[14][108] a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage.[14] The $3.2Â million plaza was funded by a donation from the McCormick Tribune Foundation.[109] For four months a year, it operates as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink, a free public outdoor ice skating rink.[110] It is generally open for skating from mid-November until mid-March and hosts over 100,000 skaters annually. It is known as one of Chicago's better outdoor people watching locations during the winter months.[111][112] The rink is operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs rather than the Chicago Park District,[113][114] which operates most major public ice skating rinks in Chicago.[110]",
