				"after": "In the 2000s, use of the term \"child abuse images\" increased by both scholars and law enforcement personnel because the term \"pornography\" can carry the inaccurate implication of consent (or even harlotry) and create distance from the abusive nature of the material.[7][8][9][27][28] Similar terms such as \"child abuse material\", \"child sexual abuse material\", \"documented child sexual abuse\", and \"depicted child sexual abuse\" are also used, as are the acronyms CAM and CAI.[27] The term \"child pornography\" retains its legal definitions in various jurisdictions, along with related terms such as \"indecent photographs of a child\" and others .[7][8][9][29] In 2008, the World Congress III against the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents stated in their formally adopted pact that \"Increasingly the term 'child abuse images' is being used to refer to the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents in pornography. This is to reflect the seriousness of the phenomenon and to emphasize that pornographic images of children are in fact records of a crime being committed.\"[30]",
