				"after": "Laporte died suddenly, and Benjamin Lumley took over the management in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti's late operas, Don Pasquale and La fille du rÃ©giment. Initially, relations between Lumley and Michael Costa, the principal conductor at Her Majesty's were good. Verdi's Ernani, Nabucco and I Lombardi received their British premiÃ¨res in 1845â46, and Lumley commissioned I masnadieri from the composer. This opera received its world premiÃ¨re on 22 July 1847, with the Swedish operatic diva Jenny Lind in the role of Amalia, and the British premiÃ¨res of two more Verdi operas, I due Foscari and Attila, followed in 1847â48.[37] Meanwhile, the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued. In 1847, Costa finally transferred his opera company to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and the theatre relinquished the sobriquet, 'Italian Opera House', to assume its present title, Her Majesty's Theatre.[38]",
