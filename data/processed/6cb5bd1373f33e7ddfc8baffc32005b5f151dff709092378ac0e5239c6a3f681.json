				"previous": "Antarctica is the coldest of Earth's continents. The coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was â89.2Â Â°C (â128.6Â Â°F) at the Soviet (now Russian) Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983.[47] For comparison, this is 11Â Â°C (20Â Â°F) colder than subliming dry ice at one atmosphere of partial pressure, but since CO2 only makes up 0.039% of air, temperatures of less than -150Â Â°C would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica. Antarctica is a frozen desert with little precipitation; the South Pole itself receives less than 10Â cm (4Â in) per year, on average. Temperatures reach a minimum of between â80Â Â°C (â112Â Â°F) and â90Â Â°C (â130Â Â°F) in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between 5Â Â°C (41Â Â°F) and 15Â Â°C (59Â Â°F) near the coast in summer. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it. Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.[48]",
				"after": "East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48Â in) in 48 hours have been recorded.",
