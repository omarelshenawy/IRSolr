				"previous": "Robert Limbert, a sometime taxidermist, tanner, and furrier from Boise, explored the area, which he described as \"practically unknown and unexploredÂ ...\" in the 1920s after hearing stories from fur trappers about \"strange things they had seen while ranging the region\".",
				"after": "Limbert wrote: \"I had made two trips into the northern end, covering practically the same region as that traversed by a Geological Survey party in 1901. My first was a hiking and camping trip with Ad Santel (the wrestler), Dr. Dresser, and Albert Jones; the second was with Wes Watson and Era Martin (ranchers living about four miles [6Â km] from the northern edge). The peculiar features seen on those trips led me to take a third across the region in the hope that even more interesting phenomena might be encountered.\"[22]",
