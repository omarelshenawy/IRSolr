				"previous": "Hong Kong is located on China's south coast, 60Â km (37Â mi) east of Macau on the opposite side of the Pearl River Delta. It is surrounded by the South China Sea on the east, south, and west, and borders the Guangdong city of Shenzhen to the north over the Shenzhen River. The territory's 1,104Â km2 (426Â sqÂ mi) area consists of Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula, the New Territories, and over 200 offshore islands, of which the largest is Lantau Island. Of the total area, 1,054Â km2 (407Â sqÂ mi) is land and 50Â km2 (19Â sqÂ mi) is inland water. Hong Kong claims territorial waters to a distance of 3 nautical miles (5.6Â km). Its land area makes Hong Kong the 179th largest inhabited territory in the world.[3][10] In comparison to North American cities, Hong Kong is tiny yet heavily populated. An example could be the city Edmonton, with a metro population of about 1.4 Million, making the city considerably smaller in population than Hongkong's 7.4 Million. However, Edmonton's metro area totals nearly 10,000Â km2 (3,900Â sqÂ mi) making the city almost ten times larger than Hong kong. Also, The Greater Los Angeles area is over 87,000Â km2 (34,000Â sqÂ mi), and with 18 million residents, has an incredibly low density when compared to Hong Kong and is 79 times larger in area.",
				"after": "As much of Hong Kong's terrain is hilly to mountainous with steep slopes, less than 25% of the territory's landmass is developed, and about 40% of the remaining land area is reserved as country parks and nature reserves.[118] Low altitude vegetation in Hong Kong is dominated by secondary rainforests, as the primary forest was mostly cleared during the Second World War, and higher altitudes are dominated by grasslands. Most of the territory's urban development exists on Kowloon peninsula, along the northern edge of Hong Kong Island, and in scattered settlements throughout the New Territories.[119] The highest elevation in the territory is at Tai Mo Shan, 957 metres (3,140Â ft) above sea level.[120] Hong Kong's long and irregular coast provides it with many bays, rivers and beaches.[121] On 18 September 2011, UNESCO listed the Hong Kong National Geopark as part of its Global Geoparks Network. Hong Kong Geopark is made up of eight Geo-Areas distributed across the Sai Kung Volcanic Rock Region and Northeast New Territories Sedimentary Rock Region.[122]",
