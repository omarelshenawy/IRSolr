It could cruise at a then-fast 120Â mph (193Â km/h), and had a top speed of 135Â mph (217Â km/h). The four-passenger (plus one pilot) load was considered too small for airline use. A number of private owners placed orders for the design, and by the end of 1928, 68 of this original design had been produced. In the 1929 National Air Races in Cleveland, Vegas won every speed award.",
