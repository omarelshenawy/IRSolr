				"previous": "The 900-strong Texan army was ready to meet the enemy. Houston, urged by Texas Secretary of War Rusk, who had caught up with the militia to consult with the general at the insistence of President Burnet, began the action. By 3:30 p.m., Houston had formed his men into battle lines for the impending assault, screened from Mexican view by trees and by a slight ridge that ran across the open prairie between the opposing armies. Santa Anna's failure to properly post lookouts proved fatal to his chances of victory.[21]",
				"after": "At 4:30 p.m. on April 21, scout Deaf Smith announced the burning of Vince's Bridge, which cut off the only avenue of reinforcement and retreat for both armies without having to cross water more than 10 feet (3.0Â m) deep. The main Texan battle line moved forward with their approach screened by the trees and rising ground. As they emerged from the woods, the order was given to \"advance\" and a fifer began playing the popular tune \"Will you come to the bower I have shaded for you?\"[3][23]",
