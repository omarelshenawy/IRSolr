				"previous": "The new half dollars first went on sale at noon on April 30, 1948, the anniversary of George Washington's 1789 inauguration as President. They were sold from a booth on the steps of the Sub-Treasury Building in New York, by employees of the Franklin Savings Bank dressed in Revolutionary-era garb.[16]",
				"after": "The Roosevelt dime had been designed by Sinnock, and had provoked complaints by citizens viewing Sinnock's initials \"JS\" on the coin as those of Joseph Stalin, placed there by some Kremlin infiltrator within the Mint. Even though Sinnock's initials (placed on the cutoff of Franklin's bust) were expressed \"JRS\", the Mint still received similar complaints, to which they responded with what numismatic historian Walter Breen termed \"outraged official denials\".[7][15] According to The New York Times, \"People wrote in demanding to know how the Bureau of the Mint had discovered that Joe Stalin had a middle name.\"[17] Another rumor was that the small \"o\" in \"of\" was an error, and that the coins would be recalled. This claim died more quickly than the Stalin rumor.[15]",
