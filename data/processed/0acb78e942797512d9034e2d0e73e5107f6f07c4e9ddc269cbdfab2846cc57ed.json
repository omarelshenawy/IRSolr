				"after": "The greater crested tern is a large tern with a long (5.4â6.5Â cm, 2.1â2.6Â in) yellow bill, black legs, and a glossy black crest that is noticeably shaggy at its rear. The breeding adult of the nominate subspecies T. b. bergii is 46â49Â cm (18â19Â in) long, with a 125â130Â cm (49â51Â in) wing-span; this subspecies weighs 325â397Â g (11.4â14.0Â oz).[13] The forehead and the underparts are white, the back and inner wings are dusky-grey. In winter, the upperparts plumage wears to a paler grey, and the crown of the head becomes white, merging at the rear into a peppered black crest and mask.[16]",
