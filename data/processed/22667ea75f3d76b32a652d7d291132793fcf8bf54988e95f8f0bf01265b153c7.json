				"The meridian radius of curvature can be shown[3][4] to be equal to",
				"The determination of the meridian distance, that is the distance from the equator to a point at a latitude on the ellipsoid is an important problem in the theory of map projections, particularly the Transverse Mercator projection. Ellipsoids are normally specified in terms of the parameters defined above, , , ,Â  but in theoretical work it is useful to define extra parameters, particularly the eccentricity, , and the third flattening . Only two of these parameters are independent and there are many relations between them:"
