				"after": "Mark Satin (born 1946) is an American political theorist, author, and newsletter publisher, best known for contributing to three political perspectivesÂ â neopacifism in the 1960s, New Age politics in the 1970s and 1980s, and radical centrism in the 1990s and 2000s. After emigrating to Canada at the age of 20 to avoid serving in the Vietnam War, Satin co-founded the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme to assist war resisters in Canada, and wrote the Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada (1968), which sold nearly 100,000 copies. His book New Age Politics (1978) described an emerging culture focused on simple living, decentralism, and global responsibility, and he expanded these themes in the political newsletter New Options (1984â92). He also co-drafted the foundational statement of the U.S. Green Party, \"Ten Key Values\", in 1984. After a period of political disillusion, Satin launched a new political newsletter and wrote Radical Middle (2004). Both projects criticized political partisanship and sought to promote mutual learning across social and cultural divides, but the book was not warmly received by many on the traditional left or right of the American political spectrum.
