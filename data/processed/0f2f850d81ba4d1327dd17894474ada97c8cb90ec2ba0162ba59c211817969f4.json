				"after": "The original 777 interior, also known as the Boeing Signature Interior, features curved panels, larger overhead bins, and indirect lighting.[61] Seating options range from six abreast in first class up to 10 across in economy.[149] The 777's windows were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787, and measure 15-inch (380Â mm) by 10-inch (250Â mm) in size (all models outside the 777-8X and 777-9X).[150] The cabin also features \"Flexibility Zones\", which entails deliberate placement of water, electrical, pneumatic, and other connection points throughout the interior space, allowing airlines to move seats, galleys, and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements.[149] Several aircraft have also been fitted with VIP interiors for non-airline use.[151] Boeing designed a hydraulically damped toilet seat cover hinge that closes slowly.[152]",
