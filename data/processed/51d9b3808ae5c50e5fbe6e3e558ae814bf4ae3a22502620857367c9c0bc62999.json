				"after": "Atlanta has a reputation as a \"city in a forest\" due to an abundance of trees that is rare among major cities.[210][211][212][213][214] The city's main street is named after a tree, and beyond the Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. The city is home to the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native dogwoods are in bloom. However, the nickname is also factually accurate, as the city's tree coverage percentage is at 36%, the highest out of all major American cities, and above the national average of 27%.[215] Atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticedâit was the main reason cited by National Geographic in naming Atlanta a \"Place of a Lifetime\".[209][216]",
