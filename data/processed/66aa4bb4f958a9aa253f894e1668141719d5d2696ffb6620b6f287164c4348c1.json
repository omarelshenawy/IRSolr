The agreement was signed by Olga Pleshakova, CEO Transaero Airlines, and Chris Kennedy, Chief Financial Officer for EasyJet. According to the agreement, Transaero Airlines will distribute a proportion of seats on EasyJet flights on the Moscow (Domodedovo) â London (Gatwick) route. This agreement applies to the flights since 27 October 2013 that are operated under the following codes: from London UN7401/U28401 and UN7403/U28403 as well as from Moscow UN7402/U28402 and UN7404/U28404.
