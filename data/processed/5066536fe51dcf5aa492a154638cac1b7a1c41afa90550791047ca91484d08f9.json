				"previous": "During the electoral campaign, Johnson had confided to Brian Paddick that he was unsure how he would retain his current lifestyle while relying upon the Mayoral salary of Â£140,000 a year.[215] Dealing with this problem, he agreed to continue writing his Telegraph column alongside his Mayoral position, thus earning him a further Â£250,000 a year.[216] His team recognised that this would prove controversial with the electorate, and made him promise to donate a fifth of his Telegraph fee to a charitable cause providing bursaries for students of journalism and Classics. Johnson resented this, and ultimately did not pay a full fifth.[217] The situation generated controversy when he was questioned regarding his Telegraph fee on BBC's HARDtalk; here, he referred to the Â£250,000 as \"chicken feed\", something that was widely condemned given that Â£250,000 was roughly ten times the average yearly wage for a British worker.[218][219][220]",
				"after": "Johnson made no major changes to the mayoral system as developed by Livingstone.[221] He did however reverse a number of measures implemented by Livingstone's administration, by ending the city's oil deal with Venezuela, abolishing The Londoner newsletter, and scrapping the half yearly inspections of black cabs (although the latter were reinstated three years later).[221] Abolishing the western wing of the congestion charging zone,[222] he cancelled plans to increase the congestion charge for four-wheel drives.[223] He also sought to claim credit for projects like Crossrail and the 2012 Olympic Games which had been introduced by the Livingstone administration.[224] He introduced a public bicycle scheme which had been planned by Livingstone's administration; colloquially known as \"Boris Bikes\", the system cost Â£140 million and was a significant financial loss although proved popular.[225] Despite Johnson's support of cycling in London â and his much publicised identity as a cyclist himself â his administration was heavily criticised by cycling groups who argued that he had failed to make the city's roads safer for cyclists.[226] As per his election pledge, he also commissioned the development of the New Routemaster buses for central London.[227] He also ordered the construction of a cable-car system that crossed the River Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks.[228] In financing these projects, Johnson's administration had borrowed Â£100 million,[229] while public transport fares had increased by 50%.[230]",
