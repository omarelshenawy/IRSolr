				"previous": "On flowering plants the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and lower leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50Â cm long and 14Â cm across (19Â inches long and 5Â inches wide).[6][7] They become smaller higher up the stem,[1][2] and less strongly decurrent down the stem.[1] The flowering stem is solid and 2â2.5Â cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence,[2] usually following damage.[8] After flowering and seed release the stem and fruits usually persist in winter,[9] drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.[7]",
				"after": "Flowers are pentamerous with (usually) five stamen, a 5-lobed calyx tube and a 5-petalled corolla, the latter bright yellow and an 1.5â3Â cm (0.5â1Â inch) wide. The flowers are almost sessile, with very short pedicels (2Â mm, 0.08Â in). The five stamens are of two types, with the three upper stamens being shorter, their filaments covered by yellow or whitish hairs, and having smaller anthers, while the lower two stamens have glabrous filaments and larger anthers.[4][note 1] The plant produces small ovoid (6Â mm, 0.24Â in) capsules that split open by way of two valves, each capsule containing large numbers of minute brown seeds less than a millimetre (0.04Â in)[10] in size, marked with longitudinal ridges. A white-flowered form, V.Â thapsus f. candicans, is known to occur.[11] Flowering lasts for up to three months from early to late summer (June to August in northern Europe),[2] with flowering starting at the bottom of the spike and progressing irregularly upward; each flower opens for part of a day and only a few open at the same time around the stem.[9]",
