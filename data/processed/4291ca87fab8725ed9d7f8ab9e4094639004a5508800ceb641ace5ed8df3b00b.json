				"previous": "The current taxonomic arrangement of the Banksia genus is based on George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series.[6] In this arrangement, B.Â integrifolia is placed in Banksia subg. Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes; Banksia sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and Banksia ser. Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae,[14] but this was not supported by George.",
				"after": "B.Â integrifolia's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows:",
