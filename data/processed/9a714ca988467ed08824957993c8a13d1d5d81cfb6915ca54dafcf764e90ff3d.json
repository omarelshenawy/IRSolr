				"previous": "In 1865, Edwards began a 12-year residence in San Francisco, California. At the 1870 United States Census, Edwards reported himself as a non-voting foreign-born resident, a comedian by trade, living in a home worth $1,000.[9] Edwards lived in San Francisco with a white woman listed in the census as \"Mariana\", born in England, age 40, and a 16-year-old Chinese servant named Heng Gim.[9] The woman Mariana was likely Edwards's wife,[10] the former Marianne Elizabeth Woolcott Bray who was born about 1822â1823 in New Street, Birmingham.[6] In 1851 at the age of 28, Bray married Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, and the two went to Australia to manage Brooke's then-new theater company. It was there that Edwards met Brooke and his wife, but after several years of the two men working together, Brooke remarried in February 1863, taking Avonia Jones (1836â1867)[11] as his second wife. Brooke died in an accident at sea in January 1866, and Avonia Jones Brooke died in New York City the next year.[12] Later reports spoke of Edwards marrying Brooke's widow, without naming her.[10]",
				"after": "In 1868â1869 Edwards leased and managed the Metropolitan Theater,[13] and he was a founding member of the acting company of the California Theatre, which opened in January 1869.[14] The theater was directed and managed by actor John McCullough, and among the more notable productions was As You Like It in May 1872, with McCullough playing Orlando and Edwards the banished Duke Senior. Walter M. Leman, who carried the part of Adam, opined in 1886 that \"never since time was has Shakespeare's charming idyl been better put upon the stage.\"[15]",
