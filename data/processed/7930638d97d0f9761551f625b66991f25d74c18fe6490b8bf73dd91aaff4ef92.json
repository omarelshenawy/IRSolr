				"previous": "In addition to the Canton site there are many memorials to McKinley. There is a monument at his birthplace in Niles; 20Â Ohio schools bear his name.[228] Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death.[229] Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley's death that he would be ranked among the great presidents.[230] Statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states; his name has been bestowed on streets, civic organizations, and libraries. Mount McKinley in central Alaska is named for the former president; its summit, at 20,320 feet (6,190Â m), is the highest point in North America. Until its name was changed to Denali National Park, the park in which it is located was known as Mount McKinley National Park.[228]",
				"after": "McKinleyâs biographer, H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history.[231] However, the young, enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessorâs death. The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations. Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded; by 1920, according to Gould, McKinleyâs administration was deemed no more than âa mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Rooseveltâsâ.[221] Beginning in the 1950s, McKinley received more favorable evaluations; nevertheless, in surveys ranking American presidents, he has generally been placed near the middle, often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland.[221] Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinleyâs presidency profoundly affected the nationâs future, he more followed public opinion than led it, and that McKinleyâs standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency.[232]",
