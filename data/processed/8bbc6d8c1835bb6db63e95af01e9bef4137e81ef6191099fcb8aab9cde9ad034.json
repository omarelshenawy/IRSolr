				"after": "Appaloosas are used extensively for both Western and English riding. Western competitions include cutting, reining, roping and O-Mok-See sports such as barrel racing (known as the Camas Prairie Stump Race in Appaloosa-only competition) and pole bending (called the Nez PercÃ© Stake Race at breed shows). English disciplines they are used in include eventing, show jumping, and fox hunting. They are common in endurance riding competitions, as well as in casual trail riding. Appaloosas are also bred for horse racing, with an active breed racing association promoting the sport. They are generally used for middle-distance racing at distances between 350 yards (320Â m) and 0.5 miles (0.80Â km); an Appaloosa holds the all-breed record for the 4.5 furlongs (3,000Â ft; 910Â m) distance, set in 1989.[85][86]",
