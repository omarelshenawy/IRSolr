				"previous": "The DC-10 was first ordered by launch customers American Airlines with 25 orders, and United Airlines with 30 orders and 30 options in 1968.[5][6] The first DC-10, a series 10, made its maiden flight on August 29, 1970.[7] Following a test program with 929 flights covering 1,551 hours, the DC-10 received its type certificate from the FAA on July 29, 1971.[8] It entered commercial service with American Airlines on August 5, 1971 on a round trip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago. United Airlines began DC-10 service on August 16, 1971.[9] American's DC-10s had 206 seats and United's had 222; both had six-across seating in first-class and eight-across (four pairs) in coach.[10] The DC-10's similarity to the Lockheed L-1011 in design, passenger capacity, and launch date resulted in a sales competition that affected profitability of the aircraft.",
				"after": "The first DC-10 version was the \"domestic\" series 10 with a range of 3,800Â miles (3,300Â nmi, 6,110Â km) with a typical passenger load and a range of 2,710Â miles (2,350Â nmi, 4,360Â km) with maximum payload. The series 15 had a typical load range of 4,350Â miles (3,780Â nmi, 7,000Â km).[11][12] The series 20 was powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D turbofan engines, whereas the series 10 and 30 engines were General Electric CF6. Before delivery of its aircraft, Northwest's president asked that the \"series 20\" aircraft be redesignated \"series 40\" because the aircraft was much improved over the original design. The FAA issued the series 40 certificate on October 27, 1972.[13]",
