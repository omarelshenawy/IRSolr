In the promotional tour, \"Give It 2 Me\" was performed as the fifth song of the setlist. Madonna wore a shiny black dress with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots.[51] Every time the chorus played, Madonna and her back-up dancers jumped up and down, while waving their hands up in the air. The performance was backed by laser lights in the background and two movable screens, which displayed Williams, performing his lines.[52]",
