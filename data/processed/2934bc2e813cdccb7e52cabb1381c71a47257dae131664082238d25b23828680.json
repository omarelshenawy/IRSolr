				"previous": "Banksia sphaerocarpa is a variable species that differs in plant size, flower size and leaf size across its range. The variability is marked enough that five varieties are recognised. This species is generally a shrub 0.4â2Â m (1â7Â ft) tall. Plants are smaller in northern parts of the range, and grow larger in the southeast, with var. dolichostyla and rarely var. caesia reaching 4Â m (13Â ft) in height. All varieties bear a lignotuber, a swollen starchy root crown from which the plant resprouts after bushfire. The new stems are finely hairy but become smooth with maturity. The leaves are stiff, narrow and linear, and measure 2.5â10Â cm (1â4Â in) in length, on a petiole 2â3Â mm (0.1Â in) long. Leaves of most varieties are 1â1.5Â mm in width, and have a pointed tip,[2] but var. latifolia has wider leaves, 2â2.5Â cm (0.8â1Â in), and a blunter tip.[3] The foliage is green, or a more pale blue-grey in the case of caesia and dolichostyla.",
				"after": "The inflorescences are generally globular and measure 5 to 8Â cm (2â3Â in) in diameter,[4] although larger forms, such as var. dolichostyla, are more oval in shape. Flowering from January to July, the blooms are yellow, orange or brownish in colour.[2] They take five to eight weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering. Anthesis takes place over two weeks, as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence. Three weeks before the flowers open, the spikes develop a strong musky smell. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground.[5] The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain curled around the flower spike. Up to 60Â follicles develop on the globular spikes. The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour, measuring 1.5â3Â cm (0.6â1.2Â in) long, 0.5â0.8Â cm (0.2â0.3Â in) high, and 1â2.5Â cm (0.4â1Â in) wide. The follicles are flat with pronounced 'shoulders', giving a rectangular appearance in cross section.[2] Specimens of var. sphaerocarpa in the Whicher Range, Jarrah Forest and the vicinity of Nannup have larger follicles.[3] The seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate), and measure 2.0â2.6Â cm (0.8â1Â in) in length, containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring 1â1.4Â cm (0.4â0.6Â in) long by 0.5â1.3Â cm (0.2â0.5Â in) wide.[2]",
