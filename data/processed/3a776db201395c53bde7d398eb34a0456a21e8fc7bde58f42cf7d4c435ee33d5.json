				"after": "The quantitative theory of risk and portfolio management started with the mean-variance framework of Harry Markowitz (1952), who caused a shift away from the concept of trying to identify the best individual stock for investment. Using a linear regression strategy to understand and quantify the risk (i.e. variance) and return (i.e. mean) of an entire portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities, an optimization strategy was used to choose a portfolio with largest mean return subject to acceptable levels of variance in the return. Next, breakthrough advances were made with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) developed by Treynor (1962), Mossin (1966), William F. Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Ross (1976).",
