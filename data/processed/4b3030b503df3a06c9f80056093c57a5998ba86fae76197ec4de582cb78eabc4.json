				"previous": "Most of the staff employed at construction sites across the country are foreign short-term workers from neighboring poorer Arab states, India and East Asia. This is generally because of UAE government welfare, most locals would rather rely on these benefits and not go to work.[133] Workers building a new terminal at Dubai International Airport went on strike in sympathy.[134] Another strike took place in October 2007. 4,000 strikers were arrested. Most of them were released some days later and those who are not local were then deported from Dubai.[135]",
