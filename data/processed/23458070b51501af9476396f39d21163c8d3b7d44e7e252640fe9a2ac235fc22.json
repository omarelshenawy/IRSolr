				"after": "Seeds with maximum germination potential develop (in C.Â moschata) by 45 days after anthesis, and seed weight reaches its maximum 70 days after anthesis.[45] Some varieties of C.Â pepo germinate best with eight hours of sunlight daily and a planting depth of 1.2 centimeters (0.47Â in). Seeds planted deeper than 12.5 centimeters (4.9Â in) are not likely to germinate.[46] In C.Â foetidissima, a weedy species, plants younger than 19 days old are not able to sprout from the roots after removing the shoots. In a seed batch with 90 percent germination rate, over 90 percent of the plants had sprouted after 29 days from planting.[47]",
