Two of Maryland's counties, Howard and Montgomery, are the second and eleventh wealthiest counties in the nation respectively. Also, the state's poverty rate of 7.8 percent is the lowest in the country.[101][102][103] Per capita personal income in 2006 was US$43,500, 5th in the nation. Maryland ranked No. 1 with the most millionaires per capita in 2013, with a ratio of 7.7 percent.[104] As of May 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 5.5 percent.[105]",
