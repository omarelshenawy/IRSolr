It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn on a wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet. A pocket watch is to be carried in a pocket. Watches evolved in the 17thÂ century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14thÂ century. The first watches were strictly mechanical, driven by clockwork. As technology progressed, mechanical devices, used to control the speed of the watch, were largely superseded by vibrating quartz crystals, producing accurately timed electronic pulses.[1] Some watches use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time. The first digital electronic watch was developed in 1970.[2]",
