				"after": "The acquisition of five ex-BEA de Havilland Comet 4B series for Â£2 million following the award in 1970 of a major, two-year contract to operate IT flights on behalf of Lyons Tours resulted in a significant increase in Channel Airways's charter capacity. Unlike the other aircraft in Channel's fleet, the Comets continued to be flown in BEA's basic paint scheme, with the BEA logo and the Union Jack removed from the tail and forward, lower fuselage respectively, and the BEA name taped over with Channel Airways's name on the upper fuselage. They also continued to be flown in a comparatively spacious, 109-seat, single class configuration.[20][21][68]",
