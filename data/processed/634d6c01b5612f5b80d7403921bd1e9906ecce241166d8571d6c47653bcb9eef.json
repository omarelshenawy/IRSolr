				"Cranes are large, tall birds with long legs and long necks. Unlike the similar-looking but un-related herons, cranes fly with necks extended. Most have elaborate and noisy courtship displays or \"dances\". When in a group, they may also \"dance\" for no particular reason, jumping up and down in an elegant manner, seemingly just for pleasure or to attract a mate."
