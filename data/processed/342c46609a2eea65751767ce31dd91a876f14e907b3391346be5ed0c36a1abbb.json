				"previous": "Since 1997, the U.S. military has used more than 80 F-4 Phantoms converted into robotic planes for use as aerial targets for combat training of human pilots.[101] The F-4s were supplemented in September 2013 with F-16s as more realistically maneuverable targets.[101]",

				"By 2012 the International Anti-Poaching Foundation was using UAVs.[102]",
				"In June 2012, WWF announced it will begin using UAVs in Nepal to aid conservation efforts following a successful trial of two aircraft in Chitwan National Park, with ambitions to expand to other countries, such as Tanzania and Malaysia. The global wildlife organization plans to train ten personnel to use the UAVs, with operational use beginning in the fall.[103][104] In August 2012, UAVs were used by members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in Namibia to document the annual seal cull.[105] In December 2013, the Falcon UAV was selected by the Namibian Govt and WWF to help combat rhino poaching.[106] The drones will be monitoring rhino populations in Etosha National Park and will use RFID sensors.[107]"
