				"previous": "Within three weeks of recording the Bronson transaction, Florida Ranch Lands had wrapped up deals with 47 owners. Eventually, the firm negotiated agreements with 51 owners to buy 27,443 acres (11,106Â ha; 43Â sqÂ mi) for more than $5 million, an average price of $182 per acre. Disney wanted to announce his ownership of the land and his plans for Walt Disney World on November 15, 1965, but the secret was divulged earlier than that, when, in October 1965, Emily Bavar, editor of the Sentinelââ'âs Florida magazine, was in Anaheim for Disneyland's 10th anniversary celebration. During an interview with Walt Disney, Bavar asked whether he was buying up vast acreage in Central Florida. Disney was caught unawares, and Bavar suspected that the rumor was true. Therefore, on October 21, 1965, a story by Bavar, written in the first person and acknowledging that she was sticking her neck out, predicted Disney would build a new theme park on the huge tract. After piecing together more information from various sources, the paper led its Sunday edition three days later with a story headlined, \"We Say: `Mystery Industry' Is Disney\".",
				"after": "Disney allowed Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the next day, October 25, that he intended to build \"the greatest attraction in the history of Florida\" in Central Florida. Disney came in person to Orlando for the formal announcement with Burns on November 15.[6] Disney explained the plans for the site, including Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, (EPCOT), also known as Progress City, was to be a futuristic planned city. He envisioned a working city with commercial and residential areas that also continued to showcase and test new ideas and concepts for urban living.",
