There are four ski areas in Sawtooth National Forest as well as the Rotarun Ski Area just west of Hailey and Dollar Mountain in Sun Valley, but these are just outside the forest's boundary. There are snowshoe loops and 78Â mi (126Â km) of groomed backcountry ski trails around Galena Lodge in the SNRA.[124] Sno-Cat and heliskiing opportunities also exist in the forest. Over 50Â mi (80Â km) of groomed snowmobile trails and warming huts are found in the Fairfield District, and there are 30Â mi (48Â km) in the Cassia Division.[2][3]",
