				"previous": "In microeconomic models, there are usually a finite set of L commodities, and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity. This gives a consumption set of , and each package is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity. In the previous example, we might say there are two commodities: apples and oranges. If we say apples is the first commodity, and oranges the second, then the consumption set and u(0,Â 0)Â =Â 0, u(1,Â 0)Â =Â 1, u(0,Â 1)Â =Â 2, u(1,Â 1)Â =Â 4, u(2,Â 0)Â =Â 2, u(0,Â 2)Â =Â 3 as before. Note that for u to be a utility function onÂ X, it must be defined for every package inÂ X.",
				"after": "In order to simplify calculations, various assumptions have been made of utility functions.",
