				"previous": "Once ready for use, observing flights were expected to be flown 3 or 4 nights a week. Originally scheduled to be operational for 20Â years, in its tentative budget for the fiscal year 2015[1][2] NASA announced that unless Germany's aerospace center would contribute significantly more than previously agreed upon, the observatory would be grounded by 2015.[3][4] The SOFIA Observatory is based at NASA's Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center at LA/Palmdale Regional Airport, California, while the SOFIA Science Center is based out of NASA Ames Research Center, in Mountain View, California.",
				"after": "SOFIA uses a 2.5-meter reflector telescope, which has an oversized, 2.7Â meter diameter primary mirror, as is common with most large infrared telescopes.[5] The optical system uses a Cassegrain reflector design with a parabolic primary mirror and a remotely configurable hyperbolic secondary. In order to fit the telescope into the fuselage, the primary is shaped to an f-number as low as 1.3, while the resulting optical layout has an f-number of 19.7. A flat, tertiary, dichroic mirror is used to deflect the infrared part of the beam to the Nasmyth focus where it can be analyzed. An optical mirror located behind the tertiary mirror is used for a camera guidance system.[6]",
