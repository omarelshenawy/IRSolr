				"after": "Germanium is a shiny grey-white solid.[304] It has a density of 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle.[305] It is mostly unreactive at room temperature[n 31] but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid.[307] Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas.[308] It melts at 938Â Â°C. Germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 Ã 10â2Â Sâ¢cmâ1[307] and a band gap of 0.67Â eV.[309] Liquid germanium is a metallic conductor, with an electrical conductivity similar to that of liquid mercury.[310]",
