				"previous": "It was used for orbital space missions by NASA, the US Department of Defense, the European Space Agency, Japan, and Germany.[16][17] The United States funded Shuttle development and operations except for the Spacelab modules used on D1 and D2âsponsored by Germany.[16][18][19][20][21] SL-J was partially funded by Japan.[17]",
				"after": "At launch, it consisted of the \"stack\", including the dark orange external tank (ET);[22][23] two white, slender solid rocket boosters (SRBs); and the Orbiter Vehicle, which contained the crew and payload. Some payloads were launched into higher orbits with either of two different upper stages developed for the STS (single-stage Payload Assist Module or two-stage Inertial Upper Stage). The Space Shuttle was stacked in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and the stack mounted on a mobile launch platform held down by four frangible nuts[24] on each SRB, which were detonated at launch.[25]",
