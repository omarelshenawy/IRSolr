For example, Bristol is about 2.5 degrees west of Greenwich (East London), so when it is local noon in Bristol, it is about 10 minutes past local noon in London.[1] The use of time zones accumulates these differences into longer units, usually hours, so that nearby locales can share a common standard for timekeeping.",
