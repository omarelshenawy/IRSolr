				"German is the third most taught foreign language in the English-speaking world, after French and Spanish.[60]",
				"German is the main language of about 100 million[24] people in Europe (as of 2005), or 13% of all Europeans; it is the 2nd most spoken native language in Europe after Russian, above French (77 million speakers in 2014[61]) and English (64 million speakers in 2004). It is therefore the most spoken first language in the EU. It is the 2nd most known foreign language in the EU.[62] It is one of the official languages of the European Union, and one of the three working languages of the European Commission, along with English and French. Among citizens of the EU-15 countries, 32% say they can converse in German (either as a mother tongue or as a second or foreign language).[63] This is assisted by the widespread availability of German TV by cable or satellite."
