				"previous": "The first five games were directed by Sakaguchi, who also provided the original concepts.[63][89] He drew inspiration for game elements from anime films by Hayao Miyazaki; series staples like the airships and chocobos are inspired by elements in Castle in the Sky and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, respectively.[90] Sakaguchi served as a producer for subsequent games until he left Square in 2001.[63][89] Yoshinori Kitase took over directing the games until Final FantasyÂ VIII,[91][92][93] and has been followed by a new director for each new title. Hiroyuki Ito designed several gameplay systems, including Final FantasyÂ Vââ'âs \"Job System\", Final FantasyÂ VIIIââ'âs \"Junction System\" and the Active Time Battle concept, which was used from Final FantasyÂ IV until Final FantasyÂ IX.[63][91] In designing the Active Time Battle system, Ito drew inspiration from Formula One racing; he thought it would be interesting if character types had different speeds after watching race cars pass each other.[94] Ito also co-directed Final FantasyÂ VI with Kitase.[63][91] Kenji Terada was the scenario writer for the first three games; Kitase took over as scenario writer for Final FantasyÂ V through Final FantasyÂ VII. Kazushige Nojima became the series' primary scenario writer from Final FantasyÂ VII until his resignation in October 2003; he has since formed his own company, Stellavista. Nojima partially or completely wrote the stories for Final FantasyÂ VII, Final FantasyÂ VIII, Final FantasyÂ X, and Final Fantasy X-2. He also worked as the scenario writer for the spin-off series, Kingdom Hearts.[95] Daisuke Watanabe co-wrote the scenarios for Final FantasyÂ X and XII, and was the main writer for the XIII games.[96][97][98]",
				"after": "Artistic design, including character and monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyÂ VI. Amano also handled title logo designs for all of the main series and the image illustrations from Final FantasyÂ VII onward.[89] Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyÂ VII through Final FantasyÂ X;[63][89] for Final FantasyÂ IX, however, character designs were handled by ShukÅ Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa.[99] Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyÂ VII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy.[100] Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida. Mihara was the character designer for Final FantasyÂ XI, and Yoshida served as character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics, the Square-produced Vagrant Story, and Final FantasyÂ XII.[36][101]",
