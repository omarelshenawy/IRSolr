				"after": "The actor Richard Harris bought the lease for Â£75,000 in 1969 after discovering that the American entertainer Liberace had made an offer but had not put down a deposit.[25] Reading of the intended sale in the Evening Standard, Harris bought it the following day,[25] describing his purchase as the biggest gift he had ever given himself.[25] In his autobiography, the entertainer Danny La Rue recalled visiting the house with Liberace, writing, \"It was a strange building and had eerie murals painted on the ceilingÂ ... I sensed evil\".[26] Meeting La Rue later, Harris said he had found the house haunted by the ghosts of children from an orphanage that had previously occupied the site and that he had placated them by buying them toys.[26] Harris employed the original decorators, Campbell Smith & Company Ltd., to carry out restoration,[27] using Burges's drawings from the Victoria and Albert Museum.[25]",
