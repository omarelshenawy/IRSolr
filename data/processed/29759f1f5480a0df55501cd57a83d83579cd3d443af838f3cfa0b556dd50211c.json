				"previous": "To determine the degree of fractionation that takes place in a given plant, the amounts of both 12 C and 13 C isotopes are measured, and the resulting 13 C/12 C ratio is then compared to a standard ratio known as PDB.[note 5] The 13 C/12 C ratio is used instead of 14 C/12 C because the former is much easier to measure, and the latter can be easily derived: the depletion of 13 C relative to 12 C is proportional to the difference in the atomic masses of the two isotopes, so the depletion for 14 C is twice the depletion of 13 C.[14] The fractionation of 13 C, known as Î´13C, is calculated as follows:[33]",
				"after": "where the â° sign indicates parts per thousand.[33] Because the PDB standard contains an unusually high proportion of 13 C,[note 6] most measured Î´13C values are negative.",
