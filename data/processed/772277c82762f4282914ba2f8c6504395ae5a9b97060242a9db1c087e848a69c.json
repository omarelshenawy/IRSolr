				"after": "The unpressurized rotodome is 30Â feet (9.1Â m) in diameter, six feet (1.8Â m) thick at the center, and is held 11Â feet (3.4Â m) above the fuselage by two struts.[2] It is tilted down at the front to reduce its air drag during take-offs, and while flying endurance speed (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and SSR antenna phase shifters). The dome uses both bleed air and cooling doors to remove the heat generated by electronic and mechanical equipment. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system[18] to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.",
