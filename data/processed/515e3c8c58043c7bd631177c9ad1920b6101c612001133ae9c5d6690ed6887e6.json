				"after": "Henry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests.[37] Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.[37]",
