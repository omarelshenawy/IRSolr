				"previous": "In the autumn, species arrive from the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew sandpipers and little stints just passing through, pausing for a few days to refuel, others staying for the winter.[33][34] This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings.[35] Offshore, Great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.[32]",
				"after": "Large numbers of ducks winter on the reserve, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, and smaller counts of goldeneyes and northern pintails.[33] Offshore, there may be large \"rafts\" of common scoters, and smaller numbers of common eiders, long-tailed ducks, velvet scoters[35] and red-throated divers. Brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae,[36] and hundreds of European golden plovers may roost on the reserve at high tide.[32] In the evenings, large flocks of pink-footed geese fly over Titchwell on their way to roost, and barn owls and hen harriers quarter the marshes.[33] This is the season for flocks of lesser redpolls, sometimes accompanied by a rarer common redpoll,[35] and snow buntings are to be found on the beach.[32]",
