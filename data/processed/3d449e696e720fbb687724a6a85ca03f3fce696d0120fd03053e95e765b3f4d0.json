				"after": "Immediately following the Civil War, the academy enjoyed unprecedented fame as a result of the role its graduates had played.[31] However, the post-war years were a difficult time for the academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former confederate states.[32] The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first black cadet, James Webster Smith of South Carolina.[32][33] Smith endured harsh treatment and was eventually dismissed for academic deficiency under controversial circumstances in 1874.[34] As a result, Henry O. Flipper of Georgia became the first black graduate in 1877, graduating 50th in a class of 76.[32][35] Two of the most notable graduates during this period were George Washington Goethals from the class of 1880, and John J. Pershing from the class of 1886.[32] Goethals gained prominence as the chief engineer of the Panama Canal,[36] and Pershing would become famous for his exploits against the famed Pancho Villa in Mexico and later for leading American Forces during World War I.[37]",
