				"previous": "Michigan Stadium is the largest college football stadium in the nation and one of the largest football-only stadiums in the world, with an official capacity of 109,901[156] (the extra seat is said to be \"reserved\" for Fritz Crisler[157]) though attendanceâfrequently over 111,000 spectatorsâregularly exceeds the official capacity.[158] The NCAA's record-breaking attendance has become commonplace at Michigan Stadium, especially since the arrival of head coach Bo Schembechler. U-M has fierce rivalries with many teams, including Michigan State, Notre Dame, and Ohio State; ESPN has referred to the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry as the greatest rivalry in American sports.[159] U-M also has all-time winning records against Michigan State, Notre Dame, and Ohio State.[160]",
				"after": "The men's ice hockey team, which plays at Yost Ice Arena, has won nine national championships,[161] while the men's basketball team, which plays at the Crisler Center, has appeared in five Final Fours and won the national championship in 1989. The men's basketball program became involved in a scandal involving payments from a booster during the 1990s. This led to the program being placed on probation for a four-year period. The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992â1993 and 1995â1999 seasons in which the payments took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.[162]",
