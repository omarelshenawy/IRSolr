These include the Tourism and Arts Festival, which marks the opening of the tourism season from at the end of May or beginning of June.[88][89] At the opposite end of the season, the Alanya International Culture and Art Festival is held in the last week of May, and is a notable Turkish festival.[90] Other regular festivals include the Alanya Jazz Days, which has been held since 2002 in September or October at the KÄ±zÄ±l Kule, which is otherwise home to the municipal ethnographic museum. The Jazz Festival hosts Turkish and international jazz musicians in a series of five free concerts.[91]",
