				"after": "In the Quattrocento, it was traditional for condottieri like Hawkwood to be buried in major public churches, even when their careers had produced mixed results for the city-state in question. The genre of the equestrian statue was revived during the Quattrocento for the purpose of commemorating condottieri; Donatello's Equestrian Statue of Gattamelata (c.Â 1447â1453) in Padua is the first surviving bronze equestrian statue since Ancient Rome.[24] Tibertino Brandolino was interred at San Francesco in Venice; Jacopo de' Cavalli at SS. Giovanni e Paolo in Rome; Paolo Savelli at Basilica dei Frari in Venice, along with a wooden equestrian statue on a marble sarcophagus,[25] whichâalong with the bronze horses on the faÃ§ade of St. Markâmay have inspired Uccello's Hawkwood;[26] and Konrad Aichelberg at a church in Pisa.[27] When such burials were not possible, frescoes were an acceptable substitute: Guidoriccio da Fogliano was painted on horseback by Simone Martini in Palazzo Pubblico in Siena in 1328; Pietro Farnese was depicted in a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© equestrian monument atop a sarcophagus in the Florence Cathedral in 1363.[27]",
