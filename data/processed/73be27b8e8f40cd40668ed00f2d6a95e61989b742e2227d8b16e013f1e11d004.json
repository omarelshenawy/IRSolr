The relative complement of B in A (also called the set-theoretic difference of A and B), denoted by A \\ B (or A â B), is the set of all elements that are members of A but not members of B. Note that it is valid to \"subtract\" members of a set that are not in the set, such as removing the element green from the set {1, 2, 3}; doing so has no effect.",
