				"previous": "The SilahtaraÄa Power Station, a coal-fired power plant along the Golden Horn, was the sole source of Istanbul's electricity between 1914, when its first engine room was completed, and 1952.[274] Following the founding of the Turkish Republic, the plant underwent a number of renovations to accommodate the city's increasing demand; its capacity grew from 23 megawatts in 1923 to a peak of 120 megawatts in 1956.[274][275] Capacity proceeded to decline until the SilahtaraÄa Power Station reached the end of its economic life and shut down in 1983.[274] The state-run Turkish Electrical Authority (TEK) brieflyâbetween its founding in 1970 and 1984âheld a monopoly on the generation and distribution of electricity, but now the authorityâsince split between the Turkish Electricity Generation Transmission Company (TEAÅ) and the Turkish Electricity Distribution Company (TEDAÅ)âcompetes with private electric utilities.[275]",
				"after": "The Ottoman Ministry of Post and Telegraph was established in 1840 and the first post office, the Imperial Post Office, opened near the courtyard of Yeni Mosque. By 1876, the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the vast Ottoman Empire had been established.[277] Sultan AbdÃ¼lmecid I issued Samuel Morse his first official honor for the telegraph in 1847, and construction of the first telegraph lineâbetween Istanbul and Edirneâfinished in time to announce the end of the Crimean War in 1856.[278] A nascent telephone circuit began to emerge in Istanbul in 1881 and after the first manual telephone exchange became operational in Istanbul in 1909, the Ministry of Post and Telegraph became the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone.[277][279] Of course, Istanbul's telecommunications infrastructure has developed substantially in the century since. GSM cellular networks arrived in Turkey in 1994, with Istanbul among the first cities to receive the service.[280] Today, mobile and landline service is provided by a number of private companies, after TÃ¼rk Telekom, which split from the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone in 1995, was privatized in 2005.[277][280] Postal services remain under the purview of what is now the Post and Telegraph Organization (retaining the acronym PTT).[277]",
