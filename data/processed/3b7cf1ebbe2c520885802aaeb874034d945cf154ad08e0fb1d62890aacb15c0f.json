Li encompasses not a definitive object but rather a somewhat abstract idea; as such, it is translated in a number of different ways. Most often, li is described using some form of the word \"rite\" or \"reason\", \"ratio\" in the pure sense of Vedic á¹ta, but it has also been translated as \"custom\", \"mores\", and \"rules of proper behavior\", among other terms.",
