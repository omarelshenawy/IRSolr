				"previous": "During the 1970s the world's commuter airline market began to evolve from the 20-seat class to larger and more comfortable cabins. Short Brothers of Northern Ireland created the Skyvan then the 330 which had 36 seats.",
				"after": "The Short 360 is a 36-seat derivative of the 30â33 seat Short 330. In high density configuration, 39 passengers could be carried. The two Short airliners have a high degree of commonality and are very close in overall dimensions. The later 360 is easily identified by a larger, swept tail unit mounted on a revised rear fuselage. The 360 has a 3'0\" (91Â cm) fuselage \"plug\" which gave sufficient additional length for two more seat rows (six more passengers), while the extra length smoothed out the aerodynamic profile and reduced drag.[1] Seating is arranged with two seats on the starboard side of the cabin and one seat on the port side. The 360's power is supplied by two Pratt & Whitney PT6A-65Rs. The development was announced in 1980, with the prototype's first flight on 1 June 1981[2] and type certification awarded on 3 September 1981.",
