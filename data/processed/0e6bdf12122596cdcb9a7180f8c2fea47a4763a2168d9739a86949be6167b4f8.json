				"after": "As a direct result of watching his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat.[19] Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost,[17] in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials.[20] He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously.[14] He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives.[14] The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.[21]",
