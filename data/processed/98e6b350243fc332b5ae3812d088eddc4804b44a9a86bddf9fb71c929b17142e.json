				"after": "The airline was established by Continental and other regional shareholders in the former U.S. Trust Territory and started operations on May 16, 1968 as Air Micronesia,[9] hence the nickname and callsign \"Air Mike\". Service was started with a Boeing 727-100, number 475, which was nicknamed \"Ju-Ju,\" and a Douglas DC-6. It also operated two Grumman SA-16/ HU-16 Albatross amphibians to fly from Chuuk (Truk) to Pohnpei (Ponape), until an airfield could be built that could accommodate the 727. The 727's underside was coated with teflon, due to it having to operate on coral runways. Additionally, the plane had to carry spare parts and a mechanic, as well as open-water survival gear and (beginning in 1975) onboard doppler radar, then a rarity.[citation needed]",
