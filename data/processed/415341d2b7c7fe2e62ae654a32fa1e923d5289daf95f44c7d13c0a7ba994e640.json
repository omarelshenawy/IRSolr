				"previous": "However, Hawkwood was the de facto commander-in-chief (Captain-General) of Florence's military from 1377 until immediately prior to his death in 1394.[14][15] Hawkwood won many victories for Florence, including his suppression of the Ciompi revolt in January 1382,[16] but contemporary Florentines would have regarded Hawkwood's successful retreat from Milan late in his career, across three riversâincluding the notorious Oglio[11]âand across a barren countryside, as his \"greatest military feat\".[17]",
				"after": "Hawkwood, now in his seventies, made preparations to return to England, where he had been sending money to acquire land, and set up a chantry. Just as he was liquidating his affairs in Italy, he died, on March 17, 1394.[18][19]",
