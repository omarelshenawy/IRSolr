				"after": "As the 247 emerged from its test and development phase, the company further showcased its capabilities by entering a long-distance air race in 1934, the MacRobertson Race from England to Australia. During the 1930s, aircraft designs were often proven in air races and other aerial contests. A modified 247D was entered, flown by Col.Roscoe Turner and Clyde Pangborn.[17] The 247, race number \"57,\" was essentially a production model but all airliner furnishings were removed to accommodate additional fuselage fuel tanks (eight in total).[18] The MacRobertson Race attracted aircraft entries from all over the globe including prototypes as well as established production types with the gruelling course considered an excellent proving ground as well as an opportunity to gain worldwide attention. Turner and Pangborn came in second place in the transport section (and third overall), behind the Boeing 247's eventual rival, the new Douglas DC-2.[19]",
