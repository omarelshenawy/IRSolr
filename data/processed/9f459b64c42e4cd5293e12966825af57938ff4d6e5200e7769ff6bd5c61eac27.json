				"after": "The Latin names of some of these letters are disputed. In general, however, the Romans did not use the traditional (Semitic-derived) names as in Greek: the names of the plosives were formed by adding /eË/ to their sound (except for â¨Kâ© and â¨Qâ©, which needed different vowels to be distinguished from â¨Câ©) and the names of the continuants consisted either of the bare sound, or the sound preceded by /e/. The letter â¨Yâ© when introduced was probably called \"hy\" /hyË/ as in Greek, the name upsilon not being in use yet, but this was changed to \"i Graeca\" (Greek i) as Latin speakers had difficulty distinguishing its foreign sound /y/ from /i/. â¨Zâ© was given its Greek name, zeta. This scheme has continued to be used by most modern European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet. For the Latin sounds represented by the various letters see Latin spelling and pronunciation; for the names of the letters in English see English alphabet.",
