				"previous": "In the early 20th century G. H. Hardy and Littlewood proved many results about the zeta function in an attempt to prove the Riemann Hypothesis. In fact, in 1914, Hardy proved that there were infinitely many zeros of the zeta function on the critical line",
				"after": "This led to several theorems describing the density of the zeros on the critical line.",
