The northernmost part of the wild area, including Marion Brooks Natural Area, is in the Deep Valleys section, home to some of the most remote and wild areas of the state; streams here have cut deep valleys with steep-sided slopes.[78][79][80] In the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, the Mosquito Creek gorge is up to 500 feet (150Â m) deep, while the Red Run gorge in the north is almost 900 feet (270Â m) deep.[81]",
