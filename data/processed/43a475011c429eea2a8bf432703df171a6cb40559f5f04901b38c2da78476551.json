				"previous": "The Ministry of Public Security of Poland (Polish: Ministerstwo BezpieczeÅstwa Publicznego or MBP) was a postwar communist, secret police, intelligence and counter-espionage service operating from 1945 to 1954 under minister for Public Security general StanisÅaw Radkiewicz, and supervised by Jakub Berman of the Politburo. Its main goal was the eradication of the anti-communist structures and socio-political base of the underground Polish Secret State as well as, the persecution of soldiers of the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) and Freedom and Independence (WiN) active during World War II. In that capacity, MPB remained known mainly through its own regional offices called UrzÄd BezpieczeÅstwa Publicznego or UBP (Office of Public Security, official name); and UrzÄd BezpieczeÅstwa or UB (Office, or Department of Security).[1]",
