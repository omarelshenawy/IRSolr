				"previous": "Sullivan's deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under \"Musical Quotations\", but other echoes may not have been conscious: Hughes cites the concluding bars of \"Tell a tale of cock and bull\" from The Yeomen of the Guard as an example of Handel's influence, and another critic, Edward Greenfield, found a theme in the slow movement of the Irish Symphony \"an outrageous crib\" from Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.[215][216]",
				"after": "Sullivan was trained in the classical style, and contemporary music did not greatly attract him.[217] Harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of Auber, Donizetti, Balfe and Schubert.[217] Later he drew on Gounod and Bizet. Mendelssohn's influence, conspicuous in early works, appears intermittently in later ones. As a contemporary writer observed, Sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself.[218] Yet, in the field of harmony, Hughes writes, Sullivan remained an eclectic: \"He had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality\".[217]",
