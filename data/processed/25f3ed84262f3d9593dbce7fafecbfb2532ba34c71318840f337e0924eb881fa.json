Next largest is Old Rhodes Key at 660 acres (270Â ha), then Sands Key 420 acres (170Â ha), Totten Key 380 acres (150Â ha) and Little Totten Key at 200 acres (81Â ha), with 37 smaller islands arranged in a north-south line 5 to 8.7Â mi (8 to 14Â km) east of the mainland shoreline.[106] The keys shift from barrier islands with rocky cores in the north to coral rock platforms in the south. All are fringed with mangroves, with subtropical vegetation and hardwood forests in the interiors, including gumbo limbo, mahogany, ironwood, torchwood and satinleaf. Insects include Schaus' swallowtail, an endangered species, as well as dense clouds of mosquitoes in the wet season, preyed upon by dragonflies. Marsh rabbits and raccoons, together with mice and rats comprise the primary mammalian species. Reptiles include rattlesnakes and a variety of lizards, as well as an occasional crocodile.[108]",
