				"previous": "Hoover's business began to flourish, and, a year after Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the 'beater bar' - a metal bar attached to the rotating brush roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the upright vacuum cleaner.[8] Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the beater bars alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct 'tap' than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, and led to a 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as \"Positive Agitation\". 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans' rang more true now than ever.",
				"after": "In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It utilized a Model 575 motor with a modified suction impeller, which was mounted on a unique aluminum body featuring runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made.",
