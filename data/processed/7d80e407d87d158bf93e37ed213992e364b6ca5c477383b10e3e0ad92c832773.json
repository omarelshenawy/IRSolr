Researchers theorized that the introduction of this species in the park occurred during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Sightings in Biscayne Bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums that were destroyed during the hurricane,[127] though the researcher who first proposed the theory has since retracted the assertion.[128] More recent lionfish sightings are probably from more established populations in the Florida Keys to the south of the park.[129] Also likely originating from human captivity, Burmese pythons have been observed near the park's boundary along the mainland.[125] Exotic plant species which pose the highest risk to native plant communities include Brazilian-pepper, torpedo grass, tuberous sword fern, guava and portiatree.[124]",
