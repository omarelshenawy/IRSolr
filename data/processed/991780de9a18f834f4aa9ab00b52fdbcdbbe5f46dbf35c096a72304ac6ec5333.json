				"after": "Medical genetics seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease.[83] When searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease, researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease. At the population level, researchers take advantage of Mendelian randomization to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases, a method especially useful for multigenic traits not clearly defined by a single gene.[84] Once a candidate gene is found, further research is often done on the corresponding geneÂ â the orthologous geneÂ â in model organisms. In addition to studying genetic diseases, the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to the field of pharmacogenetics: the study of how genotype can affect drug responses.[85]",
