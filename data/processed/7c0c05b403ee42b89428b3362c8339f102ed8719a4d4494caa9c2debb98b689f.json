				"previous": "The house has an L-shaped plan, and the exterior is plain, of red brick, with Bath stone dressings and green roof slates from Cumberland.[32] With a floor plan of 50Â feet by 50 feet (15Â m) square,[36] 2,500 square feet (230Â m2), Burges went about its construction on a grand scale. The architect R. Norman Shaw remarked that the concrete foundations were suitable \"for a fortress\".[37] This approach, combined with Burges's architectural skills and the minimum of exterior decoration, created a building that Crook described as \"simple and massive\".[36] Following his usual pattern, Burges re-worked many elements of earlier designs, adapting them as appropriate. The frontages come from the other townhouse he designed, the McConnochie House in Cardiff, although they have been reversed, with the arcaded, street front from the McConnochie House forming the garden front of the Tower House.[38] The staircase is consigned to the conical tower, avoiding the error Burges made at the earlier house, where he placed the staircase in the middle of the hall.[36] The cylindrical tower and conical roof derive from Castell Coch, and the interiors are inspired from examples at Cardiff Castle.[33][36] The house has two main floors, with a basement below and a garret above.[7] The ground floor contains a drawing room, a dining room and a library, while the first floor has two bedrooms and an armoury.",
				"after": "The architectural writer Bridget Cherry wrote that \"the sturdy exterior gives little hint of the fantasy [Burges] created inside\",[39] interiors which the art historian and Burges scholar Charles Handley-Read described as \"at once opulent, aggressive, obsessional, enchanting, their grandeur border[ing] on grandiloquence\".[38] Each room has a complex iconographic scheme of decoration: in the hall it is Time; in the drawing room, Love; in Burges's bedroom, the Sea. Massive fireplaces with elaborate overmantels were carved and installed, described by Crook as \"veritable altars of artÂ ... some of the most amazing pieces of decoration Burges ever designed\".[40] Handley-Read considered that Burges's decorations were \"unique, almost magical [and] quite unlike anything designed by his contemporaries\".[38]",
