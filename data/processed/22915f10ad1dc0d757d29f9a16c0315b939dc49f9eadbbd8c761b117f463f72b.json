				"previous": "The first two prototypes were equipped with two Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engines, the first of these, N329J, flying on 4 September 1957. The second of these was also equipped with the wing-mounted \"slipper tanks\", which was originally to be an option. Lockheed attempted to arrange a contract to produce the Orpheus in the US, but when these negotiations failed they re-engined the second prototype, N329K, with four Pratt & Whitney JT12 in 1959. The slipper tanks were removed and placed on the first prototype, N329J. N329J served as Clarence Johnson's personal transport for some time. The JT12 fit proved successful and was selected for the production versions, the first of which flew in mid 1960.[2] These versions entered commercial service in 1961.",
