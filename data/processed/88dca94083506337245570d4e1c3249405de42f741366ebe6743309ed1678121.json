Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.[295] A 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50% of England's gene pool contains Germanic Y chromosomes.[296] Another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that \"about 75% of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in the British isles by about 6,200 years ago, at the start of the British Neolithic or Stone Age\", and that the British broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people.[297][298][299]",
