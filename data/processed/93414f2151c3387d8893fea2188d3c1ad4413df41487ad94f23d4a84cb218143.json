				"Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction.[64] In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called Î³, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.[65]"

				"The current models of cosmology are based on Einstein's field equations, which include the cosmological constant Î since it has important influence on the large-scale dynamics of the cosmos,",
				"where is the spacetime metric.[115] Isotropic and homogeneous solutions of these enhanced equations, the FriedmannâLemaÃ®treâRobertsonâWalker solutions,[116] allow physicists to model a universe that has evolved over the past 14Â billionÂ years from a hot, early Big Bang phase.[117] Once a small number of parameters (for example the universe's mean matter density) have been fixed by astronomical observation,[118] further observational data can be used to put the models to the test.[119] Predictions, all successful, include the initial abundance of chemical elements formed in a period of primordial nucleosynthesis,[120] the large-scale structure of the universe,[121] and the existence and properties of a \"thermal echo\" from the early cosmos, the cosmic background radiation.[122]"
