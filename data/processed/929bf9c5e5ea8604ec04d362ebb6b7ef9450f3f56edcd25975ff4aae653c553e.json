				"previous": "Since the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations.[141][142] It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a plumb bob was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.[143]",
				"after": "Some have argued that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion,[144] although this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers.[145][146]",
