				"after": "The MD-11 is a medium- to long-range widebody airliner, with two engines mounted on underwing pylons and a third engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer. It is based on the DC-10, but features a stretched fuselage, increased wingspan with winglets, refined airfoils on the wing and tailplane, new engines and increased use of composites.[1] The winglets are credited with improving fuel efficiency by about 2.5%.[12] The MD-11 has a smaller empennage than the DC-10 it is based upon.[13]",
