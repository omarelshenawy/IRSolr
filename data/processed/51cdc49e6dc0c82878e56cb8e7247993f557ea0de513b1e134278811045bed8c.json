				"previous": "Just as one classifies conic sections and quadratic forms into parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic based on the discriminant , the same can be done for a second-order PDE at a given point. However, the discriminant in a PDE is given by due to the convention of the xy term being 2B rather than B; formally, the discriminant (of the associated quadratic form) is with the factor of 4 dropped for simplicity.",
				"after": "If there are n independent variables x1, x2 , ..., xn, a general linear partial differential equation of second order has the form",
