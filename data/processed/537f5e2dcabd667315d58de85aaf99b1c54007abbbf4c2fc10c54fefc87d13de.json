A choice edible fungus, it was originally described in 1998 by mycologists GastÃ³n GuzmÃ¡n and Fidel Tapia from Veracruz, Mexico. Its distribution was later revealed to be far more widespread, when several molecular studies demonstrated it is rather common in the West Coast of the United States (Kuo 2008, O'Donnell et al. 2011), Israel (Masaphy et al. 2009, Barseghyan et al. 2012), Australia (Elliott et al. 2014, Richard et al. 2014) and Cyprus (Loizides et al. 2015).[1] [2]",
