				"previous": "As of March 2012[update] the Bundeswehr employs 183,000 professional soldiers and 17,000 volunteers.[101] The German government plans to reduce the number of soldiers to 170,000 professionals and up to 15,000 short-term volunteers.[102] Reservists are available to the Armed Forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[102] According to SIPRI, Germany was the fourth largest exporter of major arms in the world in 2014.[103]",
				"after": "The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term \"defense\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of January 2015[update], the German military has about 2,370 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 850 Bundeswehr troops in the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, 670 German soldiers in Kosovo, and 120 troops with UNIFIL in Lebanon.[104]",
