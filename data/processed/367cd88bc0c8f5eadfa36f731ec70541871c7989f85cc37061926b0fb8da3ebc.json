				"after": "The cover to the June 1914 issue of Vanity Fair, an American magazine published from 1913 to 1936 by CondÃ© Montrose Nast, the first of many published by his company CondÃ© Nast Publications. Nast purchased a men's fashion magazine titled Dress in 1913 and renamed it Dress and Vanity Fair. In 1914, the title was shortened to Vanity Fair. During its run, it competed with The New Yorker as the American establishment's top culture chronicle and featured writing by Thomas Wolfe, T. S. Eliot, P. G. Wodehouse, and Dorothy Parker. However, it became a casualty of the Great Depression and declining advertising revenues, and it was folded into Vogue in 1936. In 1983, CondÃ© Nast revived the title as a new publication.",
