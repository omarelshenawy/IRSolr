				"Security is the degree of resistance to, or protection from, harm. It applies to any vulnerable and valuable asset, such as a person, dwelling, community, nation, or organization.",
				"As noted by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM) in the OSSTMM 3, security provides \"a form of protection where a separation is created between the assets and the threat.\" These separations are generically called \"controls,\" and sometimes include changes to the asset or the threat.[1]"
