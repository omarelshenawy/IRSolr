				"after": "The term \"Ramblin' Wreck\" has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the car that now bears the name has been in existence. The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of Central America.[1] The Wrecks were constructed from whatever the engineers could findâmostly old tractor and automotive partsâand were kept running by the engineers' ingenuity and creativity. Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as \"Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech.\"[1]",
