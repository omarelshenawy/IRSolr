Let be a square matrix whose columns are those eigenvectors, in any order. Then we will have , where is the diagonal matrix such that is the eigenvalue associated to column of . Since the columns of are linearly independent, the matrix is invertible. Premultiplying both sides by we get . By definition, therefore, the matrix is diagonalizable.",
