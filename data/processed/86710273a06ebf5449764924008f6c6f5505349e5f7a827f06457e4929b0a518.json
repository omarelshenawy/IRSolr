				"after": "The two most significant contributors to Darjeeling's economy are tourism and the tea industry. Darjeeling tea, due to the unique agro-climatic conditions of Darjeeling, has a distinctive natural flavour, is internationally reputed and recognised as a geographical indicator.[2] Darjeeling produces 7% of India's tea output, approximately 9,000,000 kilograms (20,000,000Â lb) every year.[23] The tea industry has faced competition in recent years from tea produced in other parts of India as well as other countries like Nepal.[47] Widespread concerns about labour disputes, worker layoffs and closing of estates have affected investment and production.[48] Several tea estates are being run on a workers' cooperative model, while others are being planned for conversion into tourist resorts.[48] More than 60% of workers in the tea gardens are women.[39] Besides tea, the most widely cultivated crops include maize, millets, paddy, cardamom, potato and ginger.[49]",
