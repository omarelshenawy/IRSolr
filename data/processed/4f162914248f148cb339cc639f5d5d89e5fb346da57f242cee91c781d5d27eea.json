Steve Jobs said a 7-inch screen would be \"too small to express the software\" and that 10Â inches was the minimum for a tablet screen.[61] Like the iPhone, the iPad is designed to be controlled by bare fingers; normal, non-conductive gloves and styli do not work,[62] although there are special gloves and capacitive styli designed for this use.[63][64]",
