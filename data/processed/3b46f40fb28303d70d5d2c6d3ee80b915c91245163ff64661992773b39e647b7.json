Franchthi Cave is one of the better known examples of this era, as it was occupied during all three of these phases.[11] Neolithic settlements in Greece, dating from the 7th millennium BC,[10] are the oldest in Europe by several centuries, as Greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the Near East to Europe.[12]",
