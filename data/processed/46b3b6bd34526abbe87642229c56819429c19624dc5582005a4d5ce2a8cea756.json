The existence of such a theory was first conjectured by Edward Witten (pictured) at a string theory conference in 1995. Witten's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution. Prior to this, string theorists had identified five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared at first to be very different, work by several physicists showed that the theories could be related by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was based in part on the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity. Some physicists believe that a complete formulation of M-theory could provide a framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature. Modern attempts to formulate the theory include matrix theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. According to Witten, the M in M-theory can stand for \"magic\", \"mystery\", or \"membrane\" according to taste, and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known.
