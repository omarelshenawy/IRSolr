				"previous": "In medicine, Hippocrates (c. 460 BCÂ â c. 370 BC) and his followers were the first to describe many diseases and medical conditions and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, still relevant and in use today. Herophilos (335â280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the nervous system. Galen (129Â â c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operationsâincluding brain and eye surgeriesâ that were not tried again for almost two millennia.",
				"after": "In Hellenistic Egypt, the mathematician Euclid laid down the foundations of mathematical rigor and introduced the concepts of definition, axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his Elements, considered the most influential textbook ever written.[27] Archimedes, considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time,[28] is credited with using the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of Pi.[29] He is also known in physics for laying the foundations of hydrostatics, statics, and the explanation of the principle of the lever.",
