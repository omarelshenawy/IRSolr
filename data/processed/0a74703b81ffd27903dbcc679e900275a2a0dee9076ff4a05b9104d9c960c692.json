				"after": "In June 1986 Madonna released her third studio album, True Blue, which was inspired by and dedicated to Sean Penn.[48] Rolling Stone magazine was generally impressed with the effort, writing that the album \"sound[s] as if it comes from the heart\".[49] It spawned three number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Live to Tell\", \"Papa Don't Preach\" and \"Open Your Heart\", and two more top-five singles: \"True Blue\" and \"La Isla Bonita\".[27][39] The album topped the charts in over 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time and became her best-selling studio album of her career to this date with sales of 25 million.[50] In the same year, Madonna also starred in the critically panned film Shanghai Surprise for which she was awarded the Golden Raspberry Award for \"worst actress\". She also made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe's Goose and Tom-Tom, both co-starring Penn.[51] The next year, Madonna was featured in the film Who's That Girl. She contributed four songs to its soundtrack, including the title track and \"Causing a Commotion\".[27]",
