				"after": "Disneyland's version of the ride is called Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters (or BLAB by Disney aficionados), like the Magic Kingdom version, also uses infrastructure from previous attractions. The space the ride takes up was first occupied by the Circle-Vision 360Â° theater. The space was transformed in 1997 when Tomorrowland received a major makeover, and the Circle-Vision theater became part of the queue line for the infamous Rocket Rods. The Rocket Rods were prone to breakdowns, and ran from 1998 to 2000. After closing, the queue line stood empty for several years until AstroBlasters opened in 2005. AstroBlasters occupies the space formerly used by the Rocket Rods' queue. A key difference between Astro Blasters and Space Ranger Spin is that in Astro Blasters, the laser guns can be removed from their mounts to allow for more accurate shooting (similar to Men in Black: Alien Attack), while in Space Ranger Spin, they cannot be removed from their mounts and have limited movement. Also a point of interest is that Zurg's machine is actually taken from the Walt Disney World version, only half-destroyed, implying that this version is a sequel to the original.",
