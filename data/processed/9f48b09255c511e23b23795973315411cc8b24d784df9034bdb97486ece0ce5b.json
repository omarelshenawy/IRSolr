The latter is preferable.\"[96] Another Australian writer, quoting him extensively in 1932, observed, \"Mr. Cardus is a gifted writer and a most impartial critic.\"[97] By 1936 he was known to a considerable section of the Australian public as a cricket writer, although he was hardly known there in his musical capacity.[98]",
