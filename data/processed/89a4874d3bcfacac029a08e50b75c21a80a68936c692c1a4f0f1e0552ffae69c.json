				"previous": "The nation enjoyed great international prestige during the final years of the Empire.[11] Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful, both of which boosted Princess Isabel's popularity.[144] JosÃ© do PatrocÃ­nio, a \"leading abolitionist journalist, an inveterate republican notable for his disrespect for the Imperial Family, not only renounced his former views\" but also \"took a leading role in organizing a 'Black Guard'.\" This was an association of former slaves dedicated to the monarchy's defense, and which also harassed republican meetings.[144]",
				"after": "The cabinet responsible for enacting the law abolishing slavery suffered a vote of no confidence on 3 May 1889 and was forced to resign.[145] Pedro II called JosÃ© AntÃ´nio Saraiva to form a new cabinet. Saraiva, a highly pragmatic politician, cared neither for monarchy nor republic, so long as he held power.[84] He frankly warned the Emperor that Isabel had little chance of reigning as empress and that the government itself should take an active role in facilitating a peaceful transition to a republic.[84] The Emperor accepted this proposal, without bothering to inform his daughter and heiress.[84] Pedro II's behavior in this meeting revealed how little commitment he had to the monarchy. He gave little consideration to his daughter's opinion, or that of the Brazilian people who overwhelmingly supported the imperial system. The reason, unknown to but a very few, was that Pedro II was very sympathetic towards the idea of a republican system.[c][78][146] Through action and inaction, consciously and unconsciously, he had been sabotaging both the monarchy and the prospects of his daughter's future reign for nearly a decade. A quite astonished historian Heitor Lyra remarked: \"Was he not the head of the Brazilian monarchy, it would be said that he had been allied with the Republic's advertisers!\"[79] Saraiva, however, changed his mind and declined the office. Pedro II instead appointed Afonso Celso de Assis Figuereido, viscount of Ouro Preto, in his place.[145]",
