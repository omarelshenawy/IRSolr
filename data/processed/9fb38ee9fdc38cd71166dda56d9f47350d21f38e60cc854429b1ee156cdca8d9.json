Both men battled for the votes of the electorate (the Convocation of the university) through manifestos and newspaper correspondence. The election came at a time of public debate about Britain's role in India particularly after the Indian Mutiny of 1857â58. Although generally regarded as the superior to Williams in scholarship, MÃ¼ller had the double disadvantage (in the eyes of some) of being German and having liberal Christian views. At the end of the hard-fought campaign, Williams won by a majority of over 230 votes, and held the chair until his death in 1899. MÃ¼ller, although deeply disappointed by his defeat, remained in Oxford for the rest of his career, but never taught Sanskrit there. (FullÂ article...)",
