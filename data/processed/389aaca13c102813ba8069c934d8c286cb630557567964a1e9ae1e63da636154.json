				"after": "During the 1894 season, the Melbourne Cricket Club and Sydney Cricket Ground combined to organise another English tour of Australia. They asked Andrew Stoddart to raise a team, and Peel was chosen.[57] Peel was successful in the opening first-class matches of the tour. He took five wickets in innings against South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales; after three games, he had taken 23 wickets, and he and Briggs provided the main threat with the ball.[5][58] Against Victoria, Peel also scored 48 and 65 with the bat.[5] He played a leading role in the first Test, which Wisden described as \"probably the most sensational match ever played either in Australia or in England\".[59] Australia scored 586 in their first innings; England scored 325 and, following-on, scored 437 to leave a target of 177 to win. At the end of the fifth day's play, Australia had scored 113 for two,[60] and were overwhelming favourites to win.[61]",
