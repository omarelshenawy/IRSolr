				"previous": "The scientific name derives from Greek; Hydrobates is from hudro, water, and bates, walker,[11] and pelagicus is from pelagikos, of the sea.[12][13] There are two recognised subspecies, the North Atlantic nominate subspecies, H. p. pelagicus (Linnaeus, 1758), and the Mediterranean H. p. melitensis (Schembri, 1843).[2] Although there is some genetic support for classifying the southern form as a separate species,[14] the morphology is not considered sufficiently different from that of the nominate subspecies to justify a split.[3]",
				"after": "The storm petrel is a small bird, 14â18Â cm (5.5â7.1Â in) in length with a 36â39Â cm (14â15Â in) wingspan.[16] It weighs 20â38Â g (0.71â1.34Â oz), with an average of 28Â g (0.99Â oz).[17] It is square-tailed and has all-black plumage except for a snow-white rump that extends to the sides of the tail base and a broad white band on the underwings. Juveniles in fresh plumage can also show a narrow white bar on the upperwing. The plumage becomes dark brown rather than black as it becomes worn.[18] There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although in the Mediterranean subspecies, at least, most captured birds can be sexed using a formula which involves multiplying the wing length by the length of the white rump band; females are slightly larger and have a longer white rump than males.[19] The Mediterranean subspecies has longer wings and a heavier bill on average than the nominate form, but neither sex nor subspecies can be determined by observation at sea.[20]",
