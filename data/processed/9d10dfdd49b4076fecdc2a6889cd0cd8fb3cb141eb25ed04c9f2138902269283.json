A white pelican logo is used by the Portuguese bank Montepio Geral,[122] and a pelican is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian 1 lek coin, issued in 1996.[123] The name and image were used for Pelican Books, an imprint of non-fiction books published by Penguin Books.[4] The seal of the Packer Collegiate Institute, a pelican feeding her young, has been in use since 1885.[124]",
