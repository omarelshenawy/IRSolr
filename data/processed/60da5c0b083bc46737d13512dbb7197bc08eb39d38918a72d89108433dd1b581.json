				"previous": "Monopropellant rockets use a single propellant decomposed by a catalyst. The most common monopropellants are hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide.",
			"after": [
				"Rocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of exhaust which has been accelerated to a high-speed.",
				"The exhaust must be a fluid, usually a gas created by high pressure (10-200 bar) combustion of solid or liquid propellants, consisting of fuel and oxidiser components, within a combustion chamber. (An exception is water rockets, which use water pressurised by compressed air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or manual pumping.)"
