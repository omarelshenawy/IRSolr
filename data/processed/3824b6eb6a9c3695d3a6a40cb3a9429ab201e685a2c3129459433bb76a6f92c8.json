				"after": "Bruce Castle is now a museum, holding the archives of the London Borough of Haringey, and housing a permanent exhibition on the past, present and future of Haringey and its predecessor boroughs, and temporary displays on the history of the area.[31] Other exhibits include an exhibition on Rowland Hill and postal history,[34] a significant collection of early photography, a collection of historic manorial documents and court rolls related to the area,[36] and one of the few copies available for public reading of the Spurs Opus, the complete history of Tottenham Hotspur.[37] In 1949, the building was Grade I listed;[38] the round tower was separately Grade I listed at the same time,[39] and the 17th-century southern and western boundary walls of the park were Grade II listed in 1974.[40][41] In 1969 the castle became home to the regimental museum of the Middlesex Regiment[42] whose collection was subsequently transferred to the National Army Museum.[43]",
