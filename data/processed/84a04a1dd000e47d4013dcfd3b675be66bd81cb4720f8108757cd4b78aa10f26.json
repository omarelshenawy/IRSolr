				"previous": "White paramilitary violence against African Americans intensified. Many blacks were fearful of this trend, and men like Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton began speaking of separating from the South. This idea culminated in the 1879â80 movement of the Exodusters, who migrated to Kansas.",
				"after": "White Democrats first passed laws to make voter registration and elections more complicated. Most of the rules acted overwhelmingly against blacks, but many poor whites were also disfranchised. Interracial coalitions of Populists and Republicans in some states succeeded in controlling legislatures in the 1880s and 1894, which made the Democrats more determined to reduce voting by poorer classes. When Democrats took control of Tennessee in 1888, they passed laws making voter registration more complicated and ended the most competitive political state in the South. Voting by blacks in rural areas and small towns dropped sharply, as did voting by poor whites.[75][76]",
