				"previous": "Throughout its operational history, the AV-8B has gained a reputation as a \"widow maker\" with its operators,[99] mainly the USMC, because of the number of accidents in which the AV-8B has been involved. Accidents have in particular been connected to the amount of time the aircraft spends taking off and landing, which are the most critical phases in flight.[99][116] As of July 2013[update], approximately 110 aircraft have been damaged beyond repair since the type entered service in 1985,[165] the first accident having occurred in March that year.[166]",
