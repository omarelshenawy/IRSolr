Its first warden, Paul Kroegel, joined forces with Bradley to enforce the illegality of bird-hunting in Florida.[19] By 1904, the various Audubon organizations had 34 wardens employed in ten states.[15] Conservationist publications were optimistic that Bradley and other wardens would be successful in their enforcement; in AOU's January 1904 issue of The Auk, an editor wrote: \"The natives are beginning to realize that the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who are not to be trifled with. The Bradleys have the reputation of being the best rifle shots in that vicinity and they would not hesitate to shoot when necessary.\"[20]",
