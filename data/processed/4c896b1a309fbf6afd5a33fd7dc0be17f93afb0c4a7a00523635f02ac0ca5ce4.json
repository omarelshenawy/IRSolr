				"after": "The diet of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is varied and available from a range of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat.[31] Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks (Allocasuarina and Casuarina, including A.Â torulosa and A.Â verticillata), but also Eucalyptus (including E.Â maculata flowers and E.Â nitida seeds), Acacia (including gum exudate and galls), Banksia (including the green seed pods and seeds of B.Â serrata, B.Â integrifolia, and B.Â marginata), and Hakea species (including H.Â gibbosa, H.Â rugosa, H.Â nodosa, H.Â sericea, H.Â cycloptera, and H.Â dactyloides). They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced Pinus radiata and to other introduced trees, including Cupressus torulosa, Betula pendula and the buds of elm Ulmus species.[32][33] In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), alongside native species.[34]",
