There are two main sets of initiations in KÄlacakra, eleven in all. The first of these two sets concerns preparation for the generation stage meditations of KÄlacakra. The second concerns preparation for the completion stage meditations known as the Six Yogas of KÄlacakra. Attendees who don't intend to carry out the practice are often only given the lower seven initiations.",
