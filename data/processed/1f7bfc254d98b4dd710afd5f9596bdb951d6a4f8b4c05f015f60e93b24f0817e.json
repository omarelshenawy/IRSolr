				"previous": "On 1 April 2008, JAL merged the operations of its subsidiary Japan Asia Airways (JAA) into JAL mainline operations. JAA had operated all JAL group flights between Japan and Taiwan between 1975 and 2008 as a separate entity due to the special political status of Taiwan.[37]",
				"after": "In 2009, Japan Airlines suffered steep financial losses, despite remaining Asia's largest airline by revenue.[38] As a result, the airline embarked on staff cuts and route cutbacks in an effort to reduce costs.[38][39] The carrier also received a Â¥100 billion credit line from the Japanese government that year.[38] In September 2009, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism formed a task force aimed at aiding a corporate turnaround at JAL, which examined various cost-cutting and strategic partnership proposals.[40]",
