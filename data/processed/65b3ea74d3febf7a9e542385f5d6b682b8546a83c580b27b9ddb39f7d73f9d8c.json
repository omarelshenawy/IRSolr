				"after": "At one stage, Bradman went 13 first-class innings without a century, the longest such spell of his career,[76] prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded his confidence and altered his technique.[75] After three Tests, the series was oneâone and Bradman had scored 133Â runs in five innings. The Australians travelled to Sheffield and played a warm up game before the Fourth Test. Bradman started slowly and then, \"...Â the old Bradman [was] back with us, in the twinkling of an eye, almost\".[77] He went on to make 140, with the last 90Â runs coming in just 45Â minutes. On the opening day of the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds), England were out for 200, but Australia slumped to 3/39, losing the third wicket from the last ball of the day.[78] Listed to bat at number five, Bradman would start his innings the next day.",
