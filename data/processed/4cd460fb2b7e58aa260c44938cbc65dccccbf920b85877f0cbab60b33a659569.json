				"after": "The discovery of iridium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Native platinum used by ancient Ethiopians[28] and by South American cultures[29] always contained a small amount of the other platinum group metals, including iridium. Platinum reached Europe as platina (\"small silver\"), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the department of ChocÃ³ in Colombia.[30] The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.[31]",
