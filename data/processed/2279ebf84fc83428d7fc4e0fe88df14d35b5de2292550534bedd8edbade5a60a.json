Although the region appears mountainous, these are not true mountains: instead millions of years of erosion have made this a dissected plateau, causing the \"mountainous\" terrain seen today. The hardest of the ancient rocks are on top of the ridges, while the softer rocks eroded away forming the valleys.[39][40]",
