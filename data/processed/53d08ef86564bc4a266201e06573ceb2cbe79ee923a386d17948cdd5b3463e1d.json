				"after": "Lady Bute's Bedroom comprises the upper two floors of the Keep, with a coffered, double-dome ceiling that rises up into the tower's conical roof.[111] The room was completed after Burges's death and, although he had created an outline model for the room's structure, which survives, he did not undertake detailed plans for its decoration.[104][109][111][c] His team attempted to fulfil his vision for the roomâ\"would Mr Burges have done it?\" William Frame asked Nicholls in a letter of 1887âbut the interior decoration was the work of Lonsdale between 1887 and 1888, with considerable involvement from Bute and his wife.[104][109]",
