				"previous": "Cameroon is viewed as rife with corruption at all levels of government. In 1997, Cameroon established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational,[32] and in 2012, Transparency International placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt.[33] On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive under the direction of the National Anti-Corruption Observatory.[32] There are several high corruption risk areas in Cameroon, for instance, customs, public health sector and public procurement.[34]",
				"after": "Human rights organisations accuse police and military forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists.[35][36][37][38] Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities,[37][38] and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents at the behest of the government.[36] However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.[37]",
