				"Italy has a capitalist mixed economy, ranking as the third-largest in the Eurozone and the eighth-largest in the world.[104] The country is a founding member of the G7, G8, the Eurozone and the OECD.",
				"Italy is regarded as one of the world's most industrialised nations and a leading country in world trade and exports.[105][106][107] It is a highly developed country, with the world's 8th highest quality of life[19] and the 25th Human Development Index. In spite of the recent global economic crisis, Italian per capita GDP at purchasing power parity remains approximately equal to the EU 27 average,[108] while the unemployment rate (12.6%) stands slightly above the Eurozone average.[109] The country is well known for its creative and innovative business,[110] a large and competitive agricultural sector[111] (Italy is the world's largest wine producer),[112] and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, food, design and fashion industry.[113][114][115]"
