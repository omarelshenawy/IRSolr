				"previous": "In November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo would also serve as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's mascot in the 1960s.",
				"after": "In October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favor of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of Action Comics, for example, read \"DC Superman.\" An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as anthologies like House of Mystery or team series such as Justice League of America, the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a bat for \"House of Mystery.\" This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as trademarks, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.",
