It is from the Coleridge poem that the usage of albatross as a metaphor is derived; someone with a burden or obstacle is said to have \"an albatross around their neck\", the punishment given in the poem to the mariner who killed the albatross. In part due to the poem, there is a widespread myth that (all) sailors believe it disastrous to shoot or harm an albatross; in truth, sailors regularly killed and ate them,[22] e.g., as reported by James Cook in 1772. On the other hand, it has been reported that sailors caught the birds, but supposedly let them free again;[39] the possible reason is that albatrosses were often regarded as the souls of lost sailors,[40] so that killing them was supposedly viewed as bringing bad luck.[39] The head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the Cape Horners, i.e. sailors who have rounded Cape Horn on freighters under sail; captains of such ships even received themselves the title \"albatrosses\" in the Cape Horners' organisation.[39]",
