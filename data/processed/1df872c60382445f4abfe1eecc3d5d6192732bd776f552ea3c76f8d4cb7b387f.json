				"previous": "George Woodcock reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B. Greene had been members of the socialist First International[124]",
				"after": "Two individualist anarchists who wrote in Benjamin TuckerÂ´s Liberty were also important labor organizers of the time. Joseph Labadie (April 18, 1850 â October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist, and poet. In 1883 Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with \"the great natural lawsÂ ... without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes.\" However, he supported community cooperation, as he supported community control of water utilities, streets, and railroads.[125] Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the Haymarket anarchists, he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetrators. In 1888, Labadie organized the Michigan Federation of Labor, became its first president, and forged an alliance with Samuel Gompers.",
