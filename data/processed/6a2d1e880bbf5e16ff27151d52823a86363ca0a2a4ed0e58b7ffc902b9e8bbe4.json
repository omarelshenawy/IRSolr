While much Native American spiritualism exists in a tribal-cultural continuum, and as such cannot be easily separated from tribal identity itself, certain other more clearly defined movements have arisen among \"traditional\" Native American practitioners, these being identifiable as \"religions\" in the prototypical sense familiar in the industrialized Western world.",
