				"previous": "The first design of the AMCA was a pure triple delta wing configuration with two V-shaped tail wings with tailless configuration and only two air brakes with a total length of 13.9 metres with a wing span of 11.4 m and an empty weight of around 12 tonnes with advance stealth capability.[22] The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the single-piece rudder and two air brakes located in the upper rear part of the fuselage, one each on either side of the fin.",
				"after": "AMCA's second design proposal was first showcased at Aero India 2009.[23] The previous proposal which was shown as a part of Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) included cantilever wings with a V-shaped twin tail and a medium-sized tail-wing with serpentine air intake and blended large Leading-edge root extension (LERX), total length was 13.9 m and wing span of 10.8 with empty weight of around 12 tonnes, with overall nose on low obserbility design.[24][25] The previous design boosted design based stealth featrue which were further optimized by the use of airframe shaping, composite material, edge matching fuselage, RAPs, body conforming antennae and engine bay cooling, RAMs, weapons bay, special coatings for polycarbonate canopy and other stealth features, the aircraft had a weight of 16-18 tonnes with 2-tonnes of internal weapons and four-tonnes of internal fuel with a combat ceiling of 15-km, max speed of 1.8-Mach at 11-km.[24][26][27]",
