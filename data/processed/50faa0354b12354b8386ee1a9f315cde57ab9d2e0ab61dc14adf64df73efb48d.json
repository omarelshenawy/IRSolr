				"after": "The beak of the Rodrigues solitaire was slightly hooked, and its neck and legs were long.[22] One observer described it as the size of a swan.[23] The skull was 170 millimetres (6.7Â in) long, flattened at the top with the fore and hind parts elevated into two bony ridges structured with cancellous bone.[24] A black band (a contemporary description described it as a \"frontlet\"[a]) appeared on its head just behind the base of the beak. The plumage of the Rodrigues solitaire was described as grey and brown. Females were paler than males and had light-coloured elevations on the lower neck.[23]",
