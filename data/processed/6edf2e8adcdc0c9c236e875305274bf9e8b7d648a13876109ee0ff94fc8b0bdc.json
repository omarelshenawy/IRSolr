				"previous": "Aeroflot became the sole shareholder of Donaviaâa domestic airline then-named Aeroflot-Don[29]âin DecemberÂ 2006Â (2006-12), when it boosted its stake in the company from 51% to 100%;[30] soon afterwards, Aeroflot-Nord was created following the buyout of Arkhangelsk Airlines.[31] As of March 2007[update], Aeroflot was owned by the Russian Government via Rosimushchestvo (51.17%), National Reserve Corporation (27%) and employees and others (19%), and has 14,900 employees.[32]",
				"after": "In FebruaryÂ 2010Â (2010-02), the Russian government announced that all regional airlines owned by the state through the holding company Rostechnologii would be consolidated with the national carrier Aeroflot in order to increase the airlines' financial viability.[34] The merger was completed in late NovemberÂ 2011Â (2011-11) in a deal worth US$81Â million, Aeroflot's sister company Aeroflot-Finance became the major shareholder of Vladivostok Avia, Saravia and Rossiya Airlines, and the sole shareholder of both SAT Airlines and Orenair.[33] It was reported in JanuaryÂ 2012Â (2012-01) that Saravia was sold to private investors, as the recent-acquired regional airline was not in line with Aeroflot's business strategy.[35] It was reported in JuneÂ 2013Â (2013-06) that in the third quarter of the same year Aeroflot would combine its subsidiaries Vladivostok Air and SAT Airlines into a new subsidiary regional carrier based in the Russian Far East.[36] The subsidiary was effectively created in SeptemberÂ 2013Â (2013-09) and was originally named Taiga Airline before later being renamed Aurora Airline.[37][38] The new company, 51%-owned by Aeroflot, was expected to link Moscow with the Russian Far East, whereas SAT Airlines and Vladivostok Avia were expected to cease operations in early 2014.[39]",
