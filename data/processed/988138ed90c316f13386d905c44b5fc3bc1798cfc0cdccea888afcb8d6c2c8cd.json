Unlike most parts of India, the residents show significant passion for football.[253] The city is home to top national football clubs such as Mohun Bagan A.C., East Bengal F.C., Prayag United S.C., and the Mohammedan Sporting Club.[254][255] Calcutta Football League, which was started in 1898, is the oldest football league in Asia.[256] Mohun Bagan A.C., one of the oldest football clubs in Asia, is the only organisation to be dubbed a \"National Club of India\".[257][258] Football matches between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, dubbed as the Kolkata derby, witness large audience attendance and rivalry between patrons.[259]",
