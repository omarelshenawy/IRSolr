				"previous": "TCA's procurement of the Viscount generated considerable interest from airlines and industry figures across the United States, including American aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, Hughes purchased 15 Viscounts immediately after personally flying one.[52][53] U.S. Capital Airlines became an important operator of the Type 700 Viscount,[N 8] using it heavily throughout the eastern U.S. routes; it was reported in 1958 that Capital had accumulated over 350,000 flight hours on its Viscounts, more than any other operator.[54] Continental Airlines and Northeast Airlines also became US Viscount operators.[55]",
				"after": "The first airline in Latin America to operate the Viscount was Cubana de AviaciÃ³n. Cubana's -755D Viscounts, delivered in 1956, were placed on the Havana-Miami and Varadero-Miami routes, and were successful at raising Cubana's market share on these routes.[56] During the 1958 Cuban elections, a Cubana Viscount was hijacked by gunmen aligned with the 26th of July Movement, the aircraft crash-landed in the sea, reportedly killing 17 of the 20 occupants.[57] When the U.S. government imposed its embargo on Cuba in 1962, Cubana decided to sell all of its Viscounts. They were replaced by Soviet-built turboprop aircraft.[citation needed]",
