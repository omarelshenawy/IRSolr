				"previous": "Channel Airways was one of the earliest, post-World War II British independent airlines. Former Royal Air Force squadron leader Reginald \"Jack\" Jones[1] founded Channel Airways in June 1946 as an aerial joy ride business, which was incorporated as East Anglian Flying Services on 16 August 1946.[27] The new airline was majority-owned by Jones and his family, who held more than 80% of its shares.[2][3]",
				"after": "Commercial operations commenced on 16 August 1946 with a single, early-1930s vintage, three-seat Puss Moth, offering joy rides at 10s (50p as of early-2012[28]) a time from a landing strip near the Kent seaside town of Herne Bay.[2][29] Soon after, this aircraft also operated air taxi flights to destinations all over the UK.[30]",
