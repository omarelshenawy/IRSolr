				"previous": "The first airline to offer cheaper transatlantic fares was Icelandic airline LoftleiÃ°ir in 1964, often referred to as \"the Hippie Airline\". Many young Americans travelled to Europe after graduation, to experience the \"old-world culture\", and they were more concerned with getting there cheaply than comfortably or even exactly on time. LoftleiÃ°ir were not famous for speed or punctuality, but flying with the company became a sort of rite of passage for those young \"hippies\", one of whom was Bill Clinton, later US President.[15]",
				"after": "The first airline offering no-frills transatlantic service was Freddie Laker's Laker Airways, which operated its famous \"Skytrain\" service between London and New York City during the late 1970s. The service was suspended after Laker's competitors, British Airways and Pan Am, were able to price Skytrain out of the market.[citation needed]",
