				"after": "The campus fare-free bus transit system began in 1990 and runs throughout the campus and surrounding neighborhoods.[48] In 2005 the university started testing Hybrid buses on the service's main route.[87] The first hybrid bus on the system used a proprietary diesel-electric propulsion system, known as a Hybrid Booster Drive (HBD), and was developed by the Electric Vehicle Institute (EVI) within the BGSU College of Technology.[87] The system is made up of four routes.[88][89] It includes major stops at various residence halls, academic buildings and athletic buildings.[89] The campus has a phone application that allows the students to track the location of the different buses around campus. This application also gives an estimated time on the buses arrival to the bus stops.",
