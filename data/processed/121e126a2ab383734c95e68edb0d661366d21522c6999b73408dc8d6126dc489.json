				"A simple example of a field is the field of rational numbers, consisting of numbers which can be written as fractions a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â  0. The additive inverse of such a fraction is simply âa/b, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that a â  0) is b/a. To see the latter, note that"
