				"after": "In April 1941 the Germans, Italians and Hungarians invaded Yugoslavia leading to the swift collapse of the Yugoslav state and the surrender of the Yugoslav army. Many Serb detachments refused to surrender and took to the hills. In the wake of the invasion, the Chetniks were the first of the two resistance movements to be founded.[39] The pre-war Chetnik leader PeÄanac soon came to an arrangement with NediÄ's collaborationist regime in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia.[21] Colonel DraÅ¾a MihailoviÄ, who was \"interested in resisting the occupying powers\", set up his headquarters in Ravna Gora and named his group \"The Ravna Gora Movement\" in order to distinguish it from the PeÄanac Chetniks and others calling themselves Chetniks who engaged in collaboration with the Germans.[21] But as the other Chetnik groups acted as adjuncts to the occupation, the word \"Chetnik\" again became associated with MihailoviÄ's force.",
