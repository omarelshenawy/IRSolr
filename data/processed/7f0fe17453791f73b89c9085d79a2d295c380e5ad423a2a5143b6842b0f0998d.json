				"after": "According to Neubronner, there were a dozen different models of his camera. In 1907 he had sufficient success to apply for a patent. Initially his invention \"Method of and Means for Taking Photographs of Landscapes from Above\" was rejected by the German patent office as impossible, but after presentation of authenticated photographs the patent was granted in December 1908.[11][12] (The rejection was based on a misconception about the carrying capacity of domestic pigeons.[9]) The technology became widely known through Neubronner's participation in the 1909 International Photographic Exhibition in Dresden[13] and the 1909 International Aviation Exhibition in Frankfurt. Spectators in Dresden could watch the arrival of the pigeons, and the aerial photographs they brought back were turned into postcards.[2][14] Neubronner's photographs won prizes in Dresden as well as at the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.[15]",
