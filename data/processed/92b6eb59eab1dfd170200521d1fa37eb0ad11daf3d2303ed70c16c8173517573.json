				"previous": "Chunkey was a game that consisted of a stone shaped disk that was about 1â2Â inches in diameter. The disk was thrown down a 200-foot (61Â m) corridor so that it could roll past the players at great speed. The disk would roll down the corridor, and players would throw wooden shafts at the moving disk. The object of the game was to strike the disk or prevent your opponents from hitting it.",
