				"after": "The Roosevelt family is a prominent American political family of Dutch origin that produced two United States Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and a First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. The first member of the Roosevelt family in America was Claes van Rosevelt (or Rosenvelt), who arrived in New York (then known as Nieuw Amsterdam) around 1649, possibly as early as 1638. It has been suggested that Claes may have been related to the van Rosevelt family that lived in Oud-Vossemeer in Zeeland province of the Netherlands at that time, but no definite link has been established. Around 1652, Claes Martensen van Rosenvelt bought a farm comprising twenty-four morgens in what is now Midtown Manhattan, including the present site of the Empire State Building.",
