				"after": "The A380 was initially offered in two models, the A380-800 and the A380F. The A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three-class configuration[112] or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration. Then in May 2007, Airbus began marketing a configuration with 30 fewer passengers, (525 total in three classes), traded for 200Â nmi (370Â km) more range, to better reflect trends in premium class accommodation.[113] The design range for the â800 model is 8,500Â nmi (15,700Â km);[114] capable of flying from Hong Kong to New York or from Sydney to Istanbul non-stop. The second model, the A380F freighter, would carry 150Â tonnes of cargo 5,600Â nmi (10,400Â km).[115] The freighter development was put on hold as Airbus prioritised the passenger version and all cargo orders were cancelled. Future variants may include an A380-900 stretch seating about 656 passengers (or up to 960 passengers in an all economy configuration) and an extended-range version with the same passenger capacity as the A380-800.[15]",
