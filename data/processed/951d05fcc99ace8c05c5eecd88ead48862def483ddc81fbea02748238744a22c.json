				"previous": "Let there be an observer C on a disk rotating in the xy plane at a coordinate angular rate of and who is at a distance of r from the center of the disk with the center of the disk at x=y=z=0. The path of observer C is given by , where is the current coordinate time. When r and are constant, and . The incremental proper time formula then becomes",
				"after": "As v=rÏ for a rotating observer, this result is as expected given the time dilation formula above, and shows the general application of the integral form of the proper time formula.",
