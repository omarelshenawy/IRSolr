Three days later he reappeared and would give the same answer to any question posed to him: \"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\" (in Punjabi, \"nÄ kÅ hindÅ« nÄ kÅ musalmÄn\"). It was from this moment that Nanak would begin to spread the teachings of what was then the beginning of Sikhism.",
