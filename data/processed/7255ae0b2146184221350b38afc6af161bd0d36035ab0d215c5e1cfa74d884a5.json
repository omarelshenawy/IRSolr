				"after": "Borobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of Mount Merapi in October and November 2010. Volcanic ash from Merapi fell on the temple complex, which is approximately 28 kilometres (17Â mi) west-southwest of the crater. A layer of ash up to 2.5 centimetres (1Â in)[47] thick fell on the temple statues during the eruption of 3â5 November, also killing nearby vegetation, with experts fearing that the acidic ash might damage the historic site. The temple complex was closed from 5 to 9 November to clean up the ashfall.[48][49]",
