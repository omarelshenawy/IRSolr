				"previous": "Local populations in some occupied Soviet territories actively participated in the killings of Jews and others.[142] But it was ultimately the Germans who organized and channelled these local efforts.[142] Due to shortage of manpower, an order of February 1943 forbid anyone to characterize the peoples of Eastern Europe as \"beasts,\" \"subhumans\" or other derogatory descriptions in order to gain their support in \"the struggle against Bolshevism.\"[143][144] Many of the collaborators enlisted in the Waffen-SS participated in the killings of Jews.[145] In Lithuania, Latvia, and western Ukraine locals were deeply involved in the murder of Jews from the very beginning of the German occupation.[142] The Latvian Arajs Kommando are an example of an auxiliary unit involved in these killings.[142] And Latvian and Lithuanian units left their own countries to murder Jews in Belarus. To the south, Ukrainians killed approximately 24,000 Jews.[142] Some Ukrainians went to Poland where they served as concentration and death-camp guards.[142] UstaÅ¡e militia in Croatian areas also carried out acts of persecution and murder.",
				"after": "Many of the mass killings were carried out in public, a change from previous practice.[142] German witnesses to these killings emphasized the locals' participation.[142]",
