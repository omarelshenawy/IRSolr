				"To find a definition for the square root that allows us to consistently choose a single value, called the principal value, we start by observing that any complex number x + iy can be viewed as a point in the plane, (x, y), expressed using Cartesian coordinates. The same point may be reinterpreted using polar coordinates as the pair (r, Ï), where r â¥ 0 is the distance of the point from the origin, and Ï is the angle that the line from the origin to the point makes with the positive real (x) axis. In complex analysis, this value is conventionally written râeiÏ. If"
