				"previous": "He also concluded that objects retain their velocity unless a forceâoften frictionâacts upon them, refuting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that objects \"naturally\" slow down and stop unless a force acts upon them. Philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by John Philoponus centuries earlier, as had Jean Buridan, and according to Joseph Needham, Mo Tzu had proposed it centuries before either of them; nevertheless, Galileo was the first to express it mathematically, verify it experimentally, and introduce the idea of frictional force, the key breakthrough in validating the concept. Galileo's Principle of Inertia stated: \"A body moving on a level surface will continue in the same direction at constant speed unless disturbed.\" This principle was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (first law).",
