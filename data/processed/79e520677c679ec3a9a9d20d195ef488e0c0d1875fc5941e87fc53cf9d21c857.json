				"previous": "On the outskirts of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes the Screech Owl local nature reserve where flooded clay pits provide a roost for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) each winter.[187] The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, some of which are vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989,[16] and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.[188] The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.[189]",
