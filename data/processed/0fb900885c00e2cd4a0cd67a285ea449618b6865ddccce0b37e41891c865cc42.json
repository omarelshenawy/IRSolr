				"previous": "McCay was concerned with accurate timing and motion; he timed his own breathing to determine the timing of Gertie's breathing, and included subtle details such as the ground sagging beneath Gertie's great weight.[29] McCay consulted with New York museum staff to ensure the accuracy of Gertie's movements; the staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position, so in a scene in which Gertie stood up, McCay had a flying lizard come on screen to draw away viewers' attention.[32] When the drawings were finished, they were photographed at Vitagraph Studios in early 1914.[33]",
				"after": "McCay pioneered the \"McCay Split System\" of keyframe animation, in which major poses or positions were drawn first and the intervening frames drawn after. This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film's actions.[32] McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying, \"Any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club.\"[34] During production of Gertie, he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray,[35] who sued McCay in 1914[36] after taking advantage of McCay's lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of registration marks, tracing paper, and the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action.[37] The suit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersuedâhe received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.[38]",
