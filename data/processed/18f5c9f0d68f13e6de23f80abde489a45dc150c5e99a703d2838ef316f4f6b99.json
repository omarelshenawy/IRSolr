				"previous": "In mammals, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right; in the giraffe it is over 30Â cm (12Â in) longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal;[51] the left nerve is over 2Â m (6Â ft 7Â in) long.[52] Each nerve cell in this path begins in the brainstem and passes down the neck along the vagus nerve, then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly 5Â m (16Â ft) in the largest giraffes.[51] The structure of a giraffe's brain resembles that of domestic cattle.[32]:31 The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass.[53] Its long neck gives it a large amount of dead space, in spite of its narrow windpipe. These factors increase the resistance to airflow. Nevertheless, the animal can still supply enough oxygen to its tissues.[53]",
				"after": "The circulatory system of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than 11Â kg (25Â lb) and measures about 60Â cm (2Â ft) long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5Â cm (3.0Â in).[15] Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute.[31]:76 In the upper neck, a rete mirabile prevents excess blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head.[17] The jugular veins also contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered.[54] Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure (because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them). To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight; preventing too much blood from pouring into them.[17]",
