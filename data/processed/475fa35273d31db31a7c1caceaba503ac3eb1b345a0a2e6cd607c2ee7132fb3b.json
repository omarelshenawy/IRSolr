				"previous": "Fuck begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film Perversion for Profit,[7][8] followed by a clip from SpongeBob SquarePants which states that the word can be used as a \"sentence enhancer\".[7] The documentary includes commentary from film and television writers Kevin Smith and Steven Bochco; comedians Janeane Garofalo, Bill Maher, Drew Carey and Billy Connolly; musicians Chuck D, Alanis Morissette and Ice T; political commentators Alan Keyes and Pat Boone; and journalists Michael Medved and Judith Martin.[1][2][9] The word \"fuck\" is used 857 times during the film.[10][11]",
				"after": "Scholarly analysis is provided by Maledicta publisher Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw[8][13] and Oxford English Dictionary editor Jesse Sheidlower.[14][15][16] Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg says, \"You could think of that [word] as standing in for most of the changes that happened in the 20th century, at least many of the important ones\".[14]",
