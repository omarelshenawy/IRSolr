				"after": "Joseph Smith, Jr. said the book was a translation of Golden Plates. He related that he was shown the location of the plates by an angel at the Hill Cumorah, a hill near his home. Smith had no knowledge of ancient languages, but he said he received the translation through the power of God, with aid of the Urim and Thummim, which he said were with the plates. During the production of the work (which Mormons regard as a translation), Smith obtained the affidavits of Three Witnesses and Eight Witnesses who testified they saw the plates. These affidavits are published as part of the Book of Mormon. When the book was complete, he said he returned the plates to the angel Moroni.",
