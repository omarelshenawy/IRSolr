				"previous": "The giant otter is large, gregarious, and diurnal. Early travellers' reports describe noisy groups surrounding explorers' boats, but little scientific information was available on the species until Duplaix's groundbreaking work in the late 1970s.[19] Concern over this endangered species has since generated a body of research.",
				"after": "The giant otter is clearly distinguished from other otters by morphological and behavioral characteristics. It has the greatest body length of any species in the mustelid family, although the sea otter may be heavier. Males are between 1.5 and 1.7Â m (4.9 and 5.6Â ft) in length from head to tail and females between 1 and 1.5Â m (3.3 and 4.9Â ft). The animal's well-muscled tail can add a further 70Â cm (28Â in) to the total body length.[20][21] Early reports of skins and living animals suggested exceptionally large males of up to 2.4Â m (7.9Â ft); intensive hunting likely reduced the occurrence of such massive specimens. Weights are between 26 and 32Â kg (57 and 71Â lb) for males and 22 and 26Â kg (49 and 57Â lb) for females.[22] The giant otter has the shortest fur of all otter species; it is typically chocolate brown, but may be reddish or fawn, and appears nearly black when wet.[23] The fur is extremely dense, so much so that water cannot penetrate to the skin.[24] Guard hairs trap water and keep the inner fur dry; the guard hairs are approximately 8Â millimeters (one-third of an inch) in length, about twice as long as the fur of the inner coat.[25] Its velvety feel makes the animal highly sought after by fur traders and has contributed to its decline.[26] Unique markings of white or cream fur color the throat and under the chin, allow individuals to be identified from birth.[23] Giant otters use these marks to recognize one another, and upon meeting other otters, they engage in a behavior known as \"periscoping\", displaying their throats and upper chests to each other.",
