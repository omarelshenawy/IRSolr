				"previous": "Marius died in 86Â BC, due to his age and poor health, just a few months after seizing power. Cinna exercised absolute power until his death in 84Â BC. Sulla after returning from his Eastern campaigns, had a free path to reestablish his own power. In 83Â BC he made his second march in Rome and started a more sanguinary time of terror: thousands of nobles, knights and senators were executed. Sulla also held two dictatorships and one more consulship, which established the crisis and decline of Roman Republic.[52]",
				"after": "In the 3rd century BC Rome had to face a new and formidable opponent: Carthage. Carthage was a rich, flourishing Phoenician city-state that intended to dominate the Mediterranean area. The two cities were allies in the times of Pyrrhus, who was a menace to both, but with Rome's hegemony in mainland Italy and the Carthaginian thalassocracy, these cities became the two major powers in the Western Mediterranean â a signal of the imminent war.",
