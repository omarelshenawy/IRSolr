Although it has been known to happen that people have arrived at Raspberry via kayak while on an extreme wilderness adventure, most transportation to and from the island is by floatplane or boat. All inhabitants, tourists, and supplies arrive at the island by first going through the city of Kodiak, Alaska, the nearest town, which is an hour and a half boat ride or a thirty minute float plane ride away.",
