				"after": "London had several streets named Gropecunt Lane including one in the parishes of St Pancras, Soper Lane and St Mary Colechurch, between Bordhawelane (bordello) and Puppekirty Lane (poke skirt)[25][26] near present-day Cheapside. First recorded in 1279 as Gropecontelane and Groppecountelane,[27][28] it was part of a collection of streets which appears to have survived as a small island of prostitution outside Southwark, where such activities were normally confined during the medieval period.[25]",
