				"previous": "China has the world's largest market for automobiles, having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production. Auto sales in 2009 exceeded 13.6Â million[345] and reach 40 million by 2020.[346] A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents,[347] with poorly enforced traffic laws cited as a possible causeâin 2011 alone, around 62,000 Chinese died in road accidents.[348] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles â as of 2012, there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China.[349]",
				"after": "China's railways, which are state-owned, are among the busiest in the world, handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006.[350][351] As of 2013, the country had 103,144Â km (64,091Â mi) of railways, the third longest network in the world.[352] All provinces and regions are connected to the rail network except Macau. The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the world's largest annual human migration takes place.[351] In 2013, Chinese railways delivered 2.106 billion passenger trips, generating 1,059.56 billion passenger-kilometers and carried 3.967 billion tons of freight, generating 2,917.4 billion cargo tons-kilometers.[352]",
