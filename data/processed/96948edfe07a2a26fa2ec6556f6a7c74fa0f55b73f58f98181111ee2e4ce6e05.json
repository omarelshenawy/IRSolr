The number of primate species within tropical areas has been shown to be positively correlated to the amount of rainfall and the amount of rain forest area.[144] Accounting for 25% to 40% of the fruit-eating animals (by weight) within tropical rainforests, primates play an important ecological role by dispersing seeds of many tree species.[145]",
