				"previous": "C.Â maxima originated in South America over 4,000 years ago,[31] probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants are sensitive to frost, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0.[52] C.Â maxima did not start to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century.[5] Types of C.Â maxima include triloba,[53] zapallito,[54] zipinka,[55] Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.Â maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.[56]",
				"after": "C.Â moschata is native to Latin America, but the precise location of origin is uncertain.[57] It has been present in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Peru for 4,000â6,000 years and has spread to Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. This species is closely related to C.Â argyrosperma. A variety known as the Seminole Pumpkin has been cultivated in Florida since before the arrival of Columbus. Its leaves are 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12Â in) wide. It generally grows at low altitudes in hot climates with heavy rainfall, but some varieties have been found above 2,200 meters (7,200Â ft).[8] Groups of C.Â moschata include Cheese, Crookneck (C.Â moschata), and Bell.[56]",
