				"Added biographies should be Featured articles about prominent (or not so prominent) historical figures, and should be added to the first available slot, and then the max= parameter of this section's {{Random portal component}} template should be incremented. A current list of eligible articles can be found here; non-biographies should be nominated to the Selected article section instead. Try to avoid systematic bias; this section's selections were crafted to represent as wide a world view as possible. Lastly, if for some reason you wish to nominate a non-FA biography for inclusion, you can do so in the Nominations section at the bottom of this page."
