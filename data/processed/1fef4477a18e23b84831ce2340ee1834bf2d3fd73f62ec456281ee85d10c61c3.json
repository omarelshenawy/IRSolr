				"previous": "The embryos probably represented near-hatchlings.[63] While the skeletal features were similar to those of the adults, the body proportions were very dissimilar. The head was big with a short snout and very large orbits, whose diameter amounts 39Â % of the entire skull length. The neck was short, contrasting to the very long neck in the adults. Girdle bones and caudals were relatively tiny.[54] The forelimbs were of equal length to the hindlimbs, indicating that newly hatched Massospondylus were quadrupedal, unlike the bipedal adults.[54] The discovery of hatching footprints with manus impressions confirmed their quadrupedality. These impressions show that the hand was not pronated, with palm faces facing each other and the thumb facing forwards.[64] The unpronated manus and the big head indicate that an effective locomotion was not possible for newly hatched Massospondylus.[8] Notably, the near-hatchings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves.[54] Based on the lack of teeth and the ineffective locomotion, scientists speculate that postnatal care might have been necessary.[8][54] This is further supported by evidence that the hatchings remained at the nest sites until they had doubled in size.[64]",
				"after": "Newly hatched juveniles are known from a second prosauropod, Mussaurus; these remains resemble those of the embryonic Massospondylus, suggesting that quadrupedality was present in newly hatched Mussaurus and presumably other prosauropods as well.[8][63] The quadrupedality of the hatchings suggests that the quadrupedal posture of later sauropods may have evolved from retention of juvenile characteristics in adult animals, an evolutionary phenomenon known as pedomorphosis.[54] This discovery therefore \"sheds some light in the evolutionary pathways through which the peculiar adaptations of giant dinosaurs were attained\", stated French paleontologist Eric Buffetaut.[65]",
