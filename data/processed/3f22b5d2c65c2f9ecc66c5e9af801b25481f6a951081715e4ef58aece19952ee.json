				"previous": "Authorities classify the species into three or four subspecies: B. m. musculus, the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations, B. m. intermedia, the southern blue whale of the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda, the pygmy blue whale found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific,[30] and the more problematic B. m. indica, the great Indian rorqual, which is also found in the Indian Ocean and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda.[1]",
				"after": "The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales.[31] The head is flat, U-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the blowhole to the top of the upper lip.[31] The front part of the mouth is thick with baleen plates; around 300 plates (each around one metre (3.2Â ft) long)[31] hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5Â m (1.6Â ft) back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see feeding below).",
