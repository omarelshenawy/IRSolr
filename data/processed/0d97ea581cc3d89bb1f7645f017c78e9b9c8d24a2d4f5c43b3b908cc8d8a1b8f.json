				"previous": "Prior to the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682, up to 90Â percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods: more than 31,000 square miles (80,000Â km2) of eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, and a mix of hardwoods.[12] The forests near the three original counties, Philadelphia, Bucks, and Chester, were the first to be harvested, as the early settlers used the readily available timber and cleared land for agriculture. By the time of the American Revolution, logging had reached the interior and mountainous regions,[12][13] and became a leading industry in Pennsylvania.[12] Trees furnished fuel to heat homes, tannin for the state's many tanneries, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons.[12]",
				"after": "By the early 19th century the demand for lumber reached the Pine Creek Gorge, where the surrounding mountainsides were covered with eastern white pine 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2Â m) in diameter and 150 feet (50Â m) or more tall, eastern hemlock 9 feet (3Â m) in circumference, and huge hardwoods.[6] Each acre (0.4 ha) of these virgin forests produced 100,000 board feet (200Â m3) of white pine and 200,000 board feet (500Â m3) of hemlock and hardwoods. For comparison, the same area of forest today produces a total of only 5,000 board feet (10Â m3) on average. According to Steven E. Owlett, environmental lawyer and author, shipbuilders considered pine from Pine Creek the \"best timber in the world for making fine ship masts\",[14] so it was the first lumber to be harvested on a large scale. The original title to the land that became Colton Point State Park was sold to the Wilhelm Wilkins Company in 1792.[14] Pine Creek was declared a public highway by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 16, 1798,[6] and rafts of spars were floated down the creek to the Susquehanna River, then to the Chesapeake Bay and the shipbuilders at Baltimore.[14][b] The lumbermen would then walk home, following the old Pine Creek Path at the end of their journey.[10]",
