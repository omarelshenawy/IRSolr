The Opies found one area, Headington, where sitting cross-legged was required. At Lydney, children could raise their right hand palm forward, whilst in Bradford-on-Avon the hand was held up with three fingers extended. In some parts of Scotland the custom was to put up one's thumbs, sometimes licking them first. This also occurred in a few places in Lancashire.[2] Anecdotally, the raising of a thumb may also accompany the use of pouce in France.",
