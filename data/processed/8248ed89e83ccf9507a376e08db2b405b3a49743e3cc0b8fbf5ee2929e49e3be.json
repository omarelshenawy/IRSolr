				"previous": "Pristina has an oceanic climate (Cfb in the KÃ¶ppen climate classification), with continental influences. The city features warm summers and relatively cold, often snowy winters.",
				"after": "Pristina is one of the municipalities with the most severe water shortages in the country.[9] Citizens of Pristina have to cope with daily water curbs due to the lack of rainfall and snowfall which has left the city's water supplies in a dreadful condition.[9] The current water resources do not fulfil the needs of the overgrowing population of Pristina. The water supply comes from the two main reservoirs of Batllava and Badovci.[9] However, there are many problems with the water supply that comes from these two reservoirs which supply 92% of the population in Pristina.[10] As such, the authorities have increased their efforts to remedy the situation and to make sure that such crises do not hit the city again.[11]",
