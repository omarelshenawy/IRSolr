				"These statements generalize to any left-module RM over a ring R without modification, and to any right-module upon reversing of the scalar multiplication.",
				"A linear map from V to K (with K viewed as a vector space over itself) is called a linear functional."
			],
				"after": "If V and W are finite-dimensional vector spaces and a basis is defined for each vector space, then every linear map from V to W can be represented by a matrix. This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if A is a real m Ã n matrix, then f(x) = Ax describes a linear map Rn â Rm (see Euclidean space).",
