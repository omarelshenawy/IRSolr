				"after": "\"Express Yourself\" received mainly positive reviews from critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography called the song a \"funky dance anthem\" and reacted positively to its message of a \"female call-to-arms in communication and self-respect.\"[12] Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed that Madonna repudiated the philosophy of her previous single \"Material Girl\" (1985) in \"Express Yourself\", which he described as \"a 30-year-old's view of life unshadowed by rebellion and lingering lapsed Catholic pain.\"[3] In another article from the same newspaper, Carn James declared it as one of her most exuberant songs.[13] Santiago Fouz-HernÃ¡ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, complimented the lyrics of the song, and added that it apparently espouses \"gender fluidity as a road to gender equality.\"[14] In his book Madonna As Postmodern Myth, journalist Georges Claude Guilbert described \"Express Yourself\" as a hymn to freedom, \"an encouragement for all women and all oppressed minorities to resist, to express their ideas and their strength faced with tyranny.\"[15] Biographer Mary Cross noted in her book Madonna: A Biography, how the song paved the way for its music video and became a testament to freedom.[16] Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted in their essays on Madonna, how she decimated \"patriarchal, racist and capitalist constructions\", by the way she pronounced the word \"self\" in \"Express Yourself\". They added that the opening line \"Don't go for second best, baby\" transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem.[17] Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted in her book Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity, that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style was interesting to her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of \"Express Yourself\" did not appear surprising.[8] Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blond Ambition declared that \"the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone had come to know and be shocked by was 'Express Yourself'.\"[18] O'Brien was impressed with the song, and gave a detailed review:",
