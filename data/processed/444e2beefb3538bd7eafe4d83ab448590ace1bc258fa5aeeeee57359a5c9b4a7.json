				"after": "The following equations outline a fully three-dimensional mathematical problem that is very difficult to solve even with simplifying assumptions.[5][28] Until recently, limitations in computational power, forced these equations to be simplified to an Inviscid two-dimensional problem with pseudo losses. Before the advent of computers, these equations were almost always simplified to a one-dimensional problem.",
