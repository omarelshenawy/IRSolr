				"previous": "In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.Â aemula in series Banksia, placing it in B.Â subser. Banksia along with serrata as its sister taxon (united by their unusual seedling leaves) and ornata as next closest relative.[15] This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.[16]",
				"after": "Under George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B.Â aemula's taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows:",
