				"after": "Frog legs are eaten by humans in many parts of the world. Originally, they were supplied from local wild populations, but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply. This resulted in the development of frog farming and a global trade in frogs.[182] The main importing countries are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China.[182] The annual global trade in the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.[183]",
