				"previous": "Ice days (maximum temperature below 0Â Â°C (32Â Â°F)) usually occur from December until February, with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period. Freezing days (minimum temperature below 0Â Â°C (32Â Â°F)) occur much more often, usually ranging from mid-November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid October and as late as mid May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be 10Â cm (4Â in) above ground instead of 150Â cm (59Â in), one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April, but sometimes occurs in May or October too.",
				"after": "Warm days (maximum temperature above 20Â Â°C (68Â Â°F)) in De Bilt are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in De Bilt, however). Summer days (maximum temperature above 25Â Â°C (77Â Â°F)) are usually measured in De Bilt from May until September, tropical days (maximum temperature above 30Â Â°C (86Â Â°F)) are rare and usually occur only in June to August.",
