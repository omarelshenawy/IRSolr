				"after": "Proceedings resumed in March 1706; the Princess Anne County justices sought to empanel two juries, both made up of women. The first was ordered to search Sherwood's home for waxen or baked figures that might indicate she was a witch. The second was ordered to look for \"demon suckling teats\" by examining her.[8][39] In both instances, reluctance on the part of the local residents made it difficult to form a jury and both juries refused to carry out the search.[28][35] On March 7, 1706, Sherwood was examined by a jury of 12 \"ancient and knowing women\" appointed to look for markings on her body that might be brands of the Devil.[40] They discovered two \"marks not like theirs or like those of any other woman.\"[40] The forewoman of this jury was the same Elizabeth Barnes who had previously accused Sherwood of witchcraft.[5]",
