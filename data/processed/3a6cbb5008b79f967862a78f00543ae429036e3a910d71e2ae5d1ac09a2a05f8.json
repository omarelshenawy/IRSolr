				"There were many attempts in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuryâlike those of J. J. Thomson (1881), Oliver Heaviside (1888), and George Frederick Charles Searle (1897), Wilhelm Wien (1900), Max Abraham (1902), Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1904) â to understand how the mass of a charged object depends on the electrostatic field.[48][49] This concept was called electromagnetic mass, and was considered as being dependent on velocity and direction as well. Lorentz (1904) gave the following expressions for longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic mass:"

				"after": "Another way of deriving some sort of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of radiation pressure. In 1900, Henri PoincarÃ© associated electromagnetic radiation energy with a \"fictitious fluid\" having momentum and mass",
