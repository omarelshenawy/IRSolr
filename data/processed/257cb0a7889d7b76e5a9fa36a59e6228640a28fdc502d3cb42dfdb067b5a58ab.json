				"previous": "With the addition of the Marine Corps's ISR / Weapon Mission Kit, the KC-130J tanker variant will be able to serve as an overwatch aircraft and can deliver ground support fire in the form of Hellfire or Griffin missiles, precision-guided bombs, and eventually 30mm cannon fire in a later upgrade.[12] This capability, designated as \"Harvest HAWK\" (Hercules Airborne Weapons Kit), can be used in scenarios where precision is not a requisite, such as area denial.[13] The aircraft retains its original capabilities in refueling and transportation. The entire system can be removed within a day if necessary.[14]",
			"after": [
				"The Super Hercules has been used extensively by the USAF and USMC in Iraq and Afghanistan. Canada has also deployed its CC-130J aircraft to Afghanistan.",
				"C-130Js from several countries have been deployed in support of the US Operation Odyssey Dawn and NATO's Operation Unified Protector during the 2011 Libyan civil war."
