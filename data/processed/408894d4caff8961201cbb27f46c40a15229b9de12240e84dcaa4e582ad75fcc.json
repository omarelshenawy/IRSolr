				"after": "In 1186 the Bremian Prince-Archbishop Hartwig of Uthlede and his bailiff in Bremen confirmedâwithout generally waiving the prince-archiepiscopal overlordship over the cityâthe Gelnhausen Privilege, by which Frederick I Barbarossa granted the city considerable privileges. The city was recognised as a political entity with its own laws. Property within the municipal boundaries could not be subjected to feudal overlordship; this also applied to serfs who acquired property, if they managed to live in the city for a year and a day, after which they were to be regarded as free persons. Property was to be freely inherited without feudal claims for reversion to its original owner. This privilege laid the foundation for Bremen's later status of imperial immediacy (Free Imperial City).",
