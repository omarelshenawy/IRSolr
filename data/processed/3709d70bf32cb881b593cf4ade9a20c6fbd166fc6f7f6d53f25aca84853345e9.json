				"after": "Humans likely first inhabited the South Florida region 10,000 to 20,000Â years ago.[46] Two tribes of Native Americans developed on the peninsula's southern tip: the Tequesta lived on the eastern side and the Calusa, greater in numbers, on the western side. The Everglades served as a natural boundary between them. The Tequesta lived in a single large community near the mouth of the Miami River, while the Calusa lived in 30Â villages. Both groups traveled through the Everglades, but rarely lived within them, remaining mostly along the coast.[46]",
