				"after": "Since its establishment, Garuda Indonesia has changed its branding and livery a few times. During the early years, Garuda color scheme was simple logotype \"Indonesia Airways\" with blue lines and Indonesian flag. In the 1960s, Garuda introduced a red and white color scheme in accordance to the Indonesian national identity and the Indonesian flag. Also in this period \"Garuda Indonesian Airways\" introduced a bird logo: a triangle stylized eagle-like Garuda with red and white shield. The logo was painted on the vertical stabilizer of Garuda's fleet from 1961 to 1969. In the 1970s, a logotype with a unique font replaced the triangular eagle as Garuda's corporate identity, along with a new color scheme consisting of a red and orange \"hockey stick\" line running along the aircraft's windows and vertical stabilizer. This livery used from 1969 to 1985.",
