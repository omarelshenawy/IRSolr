Contemporary cabin aircraft have already become antiques, living pampered lives as show pieces rather than working aircraft. In the 1960s a modification was offered by the Jobmaster company of Renton, Washington, including additional seating, windows, and float installation making Howard DGA-15s attractive to bush operators,[6] and the large cabin proved popular with sky-divers as low-capital-outlay, low-operating-cost jumping platforms.",
