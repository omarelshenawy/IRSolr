				"after": "At an arbitrary point P consider the line PN which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic coordinates P(É¸,Î»,h) are the latitude and longitude of the point N on the ellipsoid and the distance PN. This height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location. The direction of PN will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line. The relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the Earth.",
