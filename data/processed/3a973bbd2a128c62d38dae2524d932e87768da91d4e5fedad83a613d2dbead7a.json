				"previous": "A number of aftermarket modifications and upgrades are available for 90 and 100 Series King Airs.[20] An engine upgrade involves earlier-build 90 Series aircraft being re-engined with the PT6A-135A engines of the C90GT.[21][22] A more radical re-engining program involves the replacement of the PT6s in C90 and E90 King Airs with TPE-331s.",
				"after": "Among the numerous airframe modifications available: a cargo conversion for the 90 model, the CargoLiner, which replaces the rear door with a large pallet accessible cargo door, a heavy duty floor structure and cabin cargo liner, also a crew hatch for cockpit access for the crew in the 90, 100, and 200;[23] a Wing Front Spar Reinforcement Kit for both 90 and 100 Series aircraft,;[20] a modification for the entire King Air line that entails reworking and extending the nose[24] to house a baggage compartment as well as the avionics normally found in the noses of King Air aircraft. Modifications available for the King Air 100 include a belly cargo pod similar to those fitted to the Beech 99 and the Model 1300 version of the King Air 200 series.[25]",
