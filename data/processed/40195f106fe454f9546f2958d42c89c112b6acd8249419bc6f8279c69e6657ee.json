				"after": "Over the past 150 years, a significant change for the Willamette River has been the loss of its floodplain forests, which covered an estimated 89Â percent of a 400-foot (120Â m) band along each river bank in 1850.[130] By 1990 only 37Â percent of this zone was forested; the rest had been converted to farm fields or cleared for urban or suburban uses.[130] The remaining forests close to the river include large stands of black cottonwood, Oregon ash, willow, and bigleaf maple.[130] The central valleyâa former perennial grass prairie interspersed with oaks, ponderosa pines, and other treesâis devoted almost entirely to farming. Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar dominate the forest on the Coast Range side of the basin. Forests to the east in the Cascade Range include Pacific silver fir as well as western hemlock and western red cedar.[13]",
