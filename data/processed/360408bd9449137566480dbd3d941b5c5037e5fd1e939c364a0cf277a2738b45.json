Although the spores have been described as smooth in older literature,[23] when viewed with transmission electron microscopy, they are seen to have minute spots or punctures.[16] The spores develop simultaneously (synchronously) within the ascus, a developmental feature shared with the Sarcoscyphaceae genera Cookeina and Microstoma.[16] Like other members of the Pezizales order, the asci of C.Â geaster have an operculumâa \"lid\"âthat opens when the spores are discharged. However, the operculum of C.Â geaster develops a two-layered ring zone upon dehiscence, making it structurally distinct from members of both the Sarcosomataceae and the Sarcoscyphaceae families.[16]",
