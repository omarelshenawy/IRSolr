				"after": "The earliest-known implementation of a Hoerner-style downward-angled \"wingtip device\" on a jet aircraft was the so-called \"Lippisch-Ãhren\" (Lippisch-ears), allegedly attributed to the Messerschmitt Me 163's designer Alexander Lippisch, and first added to the M3 and M4 third and fourth prototypes of the Heinkel He 162A Spatz jet light fighter for evaluation - this was done in order to counteract the dutch roll characteristic the marked dihedral angle of the original He 162 design's wings possessed. As production of the Third Reich's chosen turbojet-powered emergency fighter was of prime importance at the start of 1945, disruption of the production line to make other types of changes to correct such a problem were not likely to have been available, and the added wingtip devices became a standard feature of the approximately 320 completed He 162A jet fighters built, with hundreds more He 162A airframes going unfinished by V-E Day.[6]",
