It features raked and extended wingtips, a wing aspect ratio of 9.0,[184] a new main landing gear, reinforced nose gear, and extra fuel tanks.[185][186] It also has a strengthened fuselage, wings, empennage, and engine attachments. The -300ER is powered by the GE90-115B turbofan, which is the world's most powerful jet engine in service, with a maximum thrust of 115,300Â lbf (513Â kN).[185] Its maximum range is 7,825 nautical miles (14,492Â km),[187] made possible by higher MTOW and increased fuel capacity.[178][179] The -300ER can fly approximately 34Â percent farther than the -300 with a full load of passengers and cargo.[92][188] Following flight testing, aerodynamics refinements have reduced fuel burn by an additional 1.4Â percent.[85][189]",
