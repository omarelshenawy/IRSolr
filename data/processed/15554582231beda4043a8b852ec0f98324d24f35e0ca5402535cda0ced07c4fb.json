				"previous": "Modernized and up-engined versions are produced today by Cub Crafters of Washington and by American Legend Aircraft in Texas, as the Cub continues to be sought after by bush pilots for its STOL (Short Takeoff and Landing) capabilities, as well as by recreational pilots for its nostalgia appeal. The new aircraft are actually modeled on the PA-11, though the Legend company does sell an open-cowl version with the cylinder heads exposed, like the J-3 Cub. An electrical system is standard from both manufacturers.[citation needed]",
				"after": "The J-3 is distinguished from its successors by having a cowl that exposes its engine's cylinder heads â the exposed cylinders of any J-3's engine were usually fitted with sheet metal \"eyebrow\" air scoops to direct air over the cylinder's fins for more effective engine cooling in flight. There are very few other examples of \"flat\" aircraft engine installations (as opposed to radial engines) in which the cylinder heads are exposed. From the PA-11 on through the present Super Cub models, the cowling surrounds the cylinder heads.[citation needed]",
