				"previous": "According to Timberlake, FutureSex/LoveSounds is like a \"fashion editorial, YSL and Gucci suits, which goes with the sonics\".[15] The album's artworks were shot by American fashion photographer Terry Richardson.[15] The cover features Timberlake stomping a disco ball using his black pointy shoe.",
				"after": "For his new project, Timberlake collaborated with only few producers.[13] With no concrete plans, however, Timberlake's goal for the album was \"'to capture moments' with a vivid, raw, off-the-cuff sound\".[14] Timberlake, who included record production in his repertoire, managed the recording sessions with no formula.[13] His sessions with Timbaland and Danja were described as free-flowing, and he referred to themselves in the process as \"looking like [mad men], a mad scientist\".[16]",
