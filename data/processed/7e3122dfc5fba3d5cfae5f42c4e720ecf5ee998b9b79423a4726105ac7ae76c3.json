				"previous": "Some linguists, especially when discussing the modern Chinese varieties, use the terms \"final\" and \"rime/rhyme\" interchangeably. In historical Chinese phonology, however, the distinction between \"final\" (including the medial) and \"rime\" (not including the medial) is important in understanding the rime dictionaries and rime tables that form the primary sources for Middle Chinese, and as a result most authors distinguish the two according to the above definition.",
