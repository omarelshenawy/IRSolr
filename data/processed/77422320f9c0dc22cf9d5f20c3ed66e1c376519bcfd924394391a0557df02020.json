				"after": "The aftershock caused mass panic as many people were living in the open air after the 25 April quake.[11] \"For the first seconds, it was complete silence. By the fifth second, everybody started to scream\", said an eyewitness. \"It was really, really intense. Even when the shaking stopped, people were still screaming\".[12] The tremor caused fresh landslides, and destroyed some buildings which survived the first quake.[12]",
