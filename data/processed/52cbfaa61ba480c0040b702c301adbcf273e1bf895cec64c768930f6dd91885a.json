				"after": "The name Moreton probably derives from the Old English mor meaning \"marshland\" and tune, meaning \"farm\", thus literally \"a farm at a marsh\". The area where Little Moreton Hall stands today was named Little Moreton to distinguish it from the nearby township of Moreton-cum-Alcumlow, or Greater Moreton. The Moreton family's roots in Little Moreton can be traced to the marriage in 1216 of Lettice de Moreton to Sir Gralam de Lostock, who inherited land there; succeeding generations of the de Lostocks adopted the name of de Moreton.[8] Gralam de Lostock's grandson, Gralam de Moreton, acquired valuable land from his marriages to Alice de Lymme and then Margery de Kingsley. Another grandson, John de Moreton, married heiress Margaret de Macclesfield in 1329, adding further to the estate.[9] The family also purchased land cheaply after the Black Death epidemic of 1348.[10] Four generations after John de Moreton, the family owned sixteen messuages, a mill and 700 acres (280Â ha) of land, comprising 560 acres of ploughland, 80 acres of pasture, 20 acres of meadow, 20 acres of wood and 20 acres of moss.[11] The Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century provided further opportunities for the Moretons to add to their estate,[10] and by the early years of Elizabeth I's reign, William Moreton II owned two water mills and 1,360 acres (550Â ha) of land valued at Â£24 7s 4d, including 500 acres of ploughland, 500 acres of pasture and 100 acres of turbary.[12]",
