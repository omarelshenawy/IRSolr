				"previous": "An alternative characterisation of the Wiener process is the so-called LÃ©vy characterisation that says that the Wiener process is an almost surely continuous martingale with W0 = 0 and quadratic variation .",
				"after": "The Wiener process can be constructed as the scaling limit of a random walk, or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as Donsker's theorem. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is scale invariant.",
