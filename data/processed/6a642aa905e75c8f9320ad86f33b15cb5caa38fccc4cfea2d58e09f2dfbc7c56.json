				"previous": "Some women trained as gymnasts and dancers, and a rare few as female gladiators. The famous \"bikini girls\" mosaic shows young women engaging in apparatus routines that might be compared to rhythmic gymnastics.[384] Women in general were encouraged to maintain their health through activities such as playing ball, swimming, walking, reading aloud (as a breathing exercise), riding in vehicles, and travel.[385]",
				"after": "People of all ages played board games pitting two players against each other, including latrunculi (\"Raiders\"), a game of strategy in which opponents coordinated the movements and capture of multiple game pieces, and XII scripta (\"Twelve Marks\"), involving dice and arranging pieces on a grid of letters or words.[387] A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board), to which the emperor Claudius was notoriously addicted, may have been similar to backgammon, using a dice-cup (pyrgus).[388] Playing with dice as a form of gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the December festival of the Saturnalia with its carnival, norms-overturned atmosphere.",
