				"after": "Banksia attenuata is generally encountered as a tree up to 10Â m (35Â ft) tall. In the north of its range as the climate becomes warmer and dryer, it is often a stunted multistemmed shrub 0.4 to 2Â m (1â7Â ft) tall. Both forms occur in the vicinity of Hill River but there is otherwise a marked demarcation.[2] In the Wheatbelt and east of the Stirling Range, it is a stunted tree. Tree forms have a solid trunk, generally wavy or bent, with 1â2Â cm (0.4â0.8Â in) thick crumbly orange-grey bark which is a red-brown underneath.[3] It regenerates from fire via lignotuber or epicormic buds from its fire-tolerant trunk. It has long narrow shiny green linear leaves 4 to 27Â cm (1.6â11Â in) long and 0.5 to 1.6Â cm (0.2â0.7Â in) wide.[4][5] The leaf margins have v- or u-shaped serrations along their length. The new growth is a pale grey-green, and occurs mainly in the late spring and summer,[6] often after flowering. The brilliant yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) occur from spring into summer and are up 5Â cm (2Â in) wide and up to 25â30Â cm (10â12Â in) tall.[3] They are made up of many small individual flowers; a study at Mount Adams 330Â km (200Â mi) north of Perth revealed a count of 1933 (Â± a standard error of 88) flowers per inflorescence,[7] and another in the Fitzgerald River National Park yielded a count of 1720 (Â± 76) flowers. Anthesis proceeds up the flower spike over about 10 to 20 days, and is asynchronous. That is, a plant produces flower spikes over a several week period and will thus have spikes at different stages of development over the flowering season.[8] Often bright green in bud stage,[9] they are terminal, occurring at the ends of one- to three-year-old branches, and displayed prominently above the foliage.[3] The smell of the open flowers has been likened to a peppery Shiraz wine.[9] Over time, the spikes fade to brown and then grey,[4] and the individual flowers shrivel and lie against the spikes. This coincides with the development of dark furry oval follicles, which measure 2â3.5Â cm (0.8â1.4Â in) long, 1â1.5Â cm (0.4â0.6Â in) high, and 1.4â2Â cm (0.5â0.8Â in) wide.[3] However, only a very small percentage (0.1%) of flowers develop into follicles; the field study at Mount Adams yielded a count of 3.6 Â± 1.2 per cone.[7] The follicles develop and mature over seven to eight months, from February to December, while seed development occurs over four months from September to December.[10]",
