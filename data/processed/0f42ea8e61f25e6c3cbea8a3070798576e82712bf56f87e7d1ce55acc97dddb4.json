				"previous": "Nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived. The Nixon administration and many Washington insiders viewed the NRPC as a politically expedient way for the President and Congress to give passenger trains a \"last hurrah\" as demanded by the public. They expected Amtrak to quietly disappear as public interest waned.[28] Proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief, but their view was that Amtrak would soon support itself. Neither view has proved correct. Popular support has allowed Amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined, while financial results have made a return to private operation infeasible.",
				"after": "Of the railroads that were still offering long-distance passenger service in 1971 only six declined to join Amtrak.[29]",
