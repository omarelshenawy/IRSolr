				"previous": "Later, The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde accused police investigator Jim Keyzer of a conflict of interest when he declined to investigate MediaDefender. Keyzer later accepted a job for MPAA member studio Warner Brothers.[140] The leaked emails revealed that other MPAA member studios hired MediaDefender to pollute The Pirate Bay's torrent database.[141] In an official letter to the Swedish Minister of Justice, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested assistance from the Swedish government to prevent The Pirate bay distributing video clips from the Beijing Olympics. The IOC claimed there were more than oneÂ million downloads of footage from the OlympicsÂ â mostly of the opening ceremony. The Pirate Bay, however, did not take anything down, and temporarily renamed the website to The Beijing Bay.[142]",
				"after": "The trial against the men behind the Pirate Bay started in Sweden on 16 February 2009. They were accused of breaking Swedish copyright law.[143] The defendants, however, continued to be confident about the outcome.[144] Half the charges against the Pirate Bay were dropped on the second day of the trial.[145]",
