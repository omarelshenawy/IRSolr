				"In fact, this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red portion of the \"excess\" area shown in the diagram. So:",

			"after": [
				"Rearranging terms:",
				"As h approaches 0 in the limit, the last fraction can be shown to go to zero.[5] This is true because the area of the red portion of excess region is less than or equal to the area of the tiny black-bordered rectangle; the area of that tiny rectangle, divided by h, is simply the height of the tiny rectangle, which can be seen to go to zero as h goes to zero."
