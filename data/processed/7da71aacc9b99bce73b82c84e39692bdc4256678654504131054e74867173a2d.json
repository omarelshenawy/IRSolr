				"previous": "Production of the first 747-8 Freighter began in Everett in early August 2008.[15][16] On November 14, 2008, Boeing announced a delay to the 747-8 program, citing limited availability of engineering resources within Boeing, design changes, and the recent strike by factory workers.[17][18][19] On July 21, 2009, Boeing released a photograph of the first cargo airplane, its fuselage and main wing assembled.[20]",
				"after": "In February 2009, only one airline customer (Lufthansa) had ordered the 747-8I passenger model, and Boeing announced it was reassessing the 747-8 project. Chief executive Jim McNerney stated that continuation of the project was not a foregone conclusion. The company was assessing various options.[21][22]",
