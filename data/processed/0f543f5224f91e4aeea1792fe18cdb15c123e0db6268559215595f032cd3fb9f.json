				"after": "Barn swallows (and other small passerines) often have characteristic feather holes on their wing and tail feathers. These holes were suggested as being caused by avian lice such as Machaerilaemus malleus and Myrsidea rustica, although other studies suggest that they are mainly caused by species of Brueelia. Several other species of lice have been described from barn swallow hosts, including Brueelia domestica and Philopterus microsomaticus.[49][50] In Texas, the swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius) which is common on species such as the cliff swallow is also known to infest barn swallows.[51]",
