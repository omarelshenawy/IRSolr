				"previous": "The political situation deteriorated further as RadiÄ was assassinated in the National Assembly in 1928, leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929.[45] The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution, and changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia.[46] The HSS, now led by Vladko MaÄek, continued to advocate federalisation of Yugoslavia, resulting in the CvetkoviÄâMaÄek Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia. The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban.[47]",
				"after": "In April 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and Italy. Following the invasion the territory, parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi-backed puppet state. Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and MeÄimurje were annexed by Hungary.[48] The NDH regime was led by Ante PaveliÄ and ultranationalist UstaÅ¡e. The regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma inhabitants of the NDH, exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara GradiÅ¡ka concentration camps.[49]",
