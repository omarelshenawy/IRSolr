				"after": "Bramshill House, in Bramshill, northeast Hampshire, England, is one of the largest and most important Jacobean mansions in England. It was built in the early 17th century by Baron Edward la Zouche of Harringworth, but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later. The design shows the influence of the Italian Renaissance, which became popular in England during the late 16th century. The house was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952.",
