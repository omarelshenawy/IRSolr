				"previous": "The B-17F series was the first version produced at all three BVD sources (i.e. Boeing, Vega and Douglas), and the unlike earlier marks, production was divided into distinct production blocks. Delivered from June 1942, it was the first B-17 version introduced after the U.S. entered WWII It standardized on the manned Sperry ball turret for ventral defense and introduced an enlongated, nearly frameless Plexiglas bombardier's nose enclosure that much improved forward visibility. Beginning in late 1942, until the advent of the G series in late 1943, the F series was deployed to Europe and to the Pacific (See Operational History.)",
				"after": "Two experimental versions of the B-17 were flown under different designations, the XB-38 Flying Fortress and the YB-40 Flying Fortress. The XB-38 was an engine testbed for Allison V-1710 liquid-cooled engines, should the Wright engines normally used on the B-17 become unavailable. The only prototype XB-38 to fly crashed on its ninth flight and the type was abandoned, the V-1710 being kept for fighters.[59][60]",
