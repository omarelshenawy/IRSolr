				"after": "Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub to small tree, and can reach 5Â m (16Â ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface,[9] while deeper layers are reddish in colour.[16] Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire.[13] The new growth is smooth to slightly hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14Â cm (2.2â5.5Â in) in length, and 1.3 to 8Â cm (0.5â3.2Â in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate).[9] The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.Â lanceolata.[16] The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands out against the more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April),[9][16] and peak over December to February.[17] They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused for most of their length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above.[13] They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located at the tip of the style.[5] The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1Â cm (0.4Â in) by 0.8Â cm (0.3Â in) in diameter.[18] It contains two seeds,[5] and has a spike at the end.[19] The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.[19]",
