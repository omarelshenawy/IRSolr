				"previous": "One reason given for these differences is that many early Japanese console RPGs can be seen as forms of interactive manga (Japanese comics) or anime wrapped around Western rule systems at the time,[61] in addition to the influence of visual novel adventure games.[62] As a result, Japanese console RPGs differentiated themselves with a stronger focus on scripted narratives and character drama,[50] alongside streamlined gameplay.[61] In recent years, these trends have in turn been adopted by Western RPGs, which have begun moving more towards tightly structured narratives, in addition to moving away from \"numbers and rules\" in favour of streamlined combat systems similar to action games.[61][63] In addition, a large number of Western independent games are modelled after Japanese RPGs,[64] especially those of the 16-bit era, partly due to the RPG Maker game development tools.[61]",
				"after": "Another oft-cited difference is the prominence or absence of kawaisa, or \"cuteness\", in Japanese culture, and different approaches with respect to character aesthetics.[20] Western RPGs tend to maintain a serious and gritty tone, with predominantly male protagonists exhibiting overtly masculine physical features and mannerisms. JRPG protagonsists tend to be designed with an emphasis on aesthetic beauty, and even male characters are often young, androgynous, shÅnen or bishÅnen in appearance. JRPGs often have cute (and even comic-relief type) characters or animals, juxtaposed (or clashing) with more mature themes and situations; and many modern JRPGs feature characters designed in the same style as those in manga and anime.[56] The stylistic differences are often due to differing target audiences: Western RPGs are usually geared primarily towards teenage to adult males, whereas Japanese RPGs are usually intended for a much larger demographic,[65] including female audiences,[52] who, for example, accounted for nearly a third of Final Fantasy XIII's fanbase.[66]",
