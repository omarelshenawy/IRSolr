				"previous": "Under the development plan, future phases would see the addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal.[22] A fourth runway (parallel to the existing runways 1 and 19 L&R) opened in 2008,[23] and development plans include a fifth runway to parallel the existing runway 12â30.[24] If this runway is built, the current runway will be redesignated as 12L-30R while the new runway will be designated 12R-30L. An expansion of the B concourse, used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals, has been completed, and the building housing Concourses C and D will eventually be knocked down to make room for a more ergonomic building. Because Concourses C and D are temporary concourses, the only way to get to those concourses is via moving walkway from the Concourse C station which is built in the location of the future gates and Concourse D by mobile lounge from the main terminal.[25]",
