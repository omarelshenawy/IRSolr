				"after": "It is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president. As Phillips notes, âno documents, no diaries, no confidential letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems.â[83] From the beginning, McKinleyâs preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, âwhat is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House.â[84] Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinleyâs ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.[85]",
