				"after": "At 17â18Â cm (6.7â7.1Â in) in length, the Pacific swift is the largest of the Apus swifts.[3] It has a 43â54-cm (17â21-in) wingspan.[13] Females are slightly heavier than males, averaging 44.5Â g (1.5Â oz) against 42.5Â g (1.6Â oz).[14] It is similar in general shape to the common swift, although slightly longer-winged and with a more protruding head. The fork of the tail is deeper, and the rump is broader. The upperparts are black, apart from a white rump band and a somewhat greyer head. The underparts are black, although white fringes to the feathers gives the belly a scaly appearance when seen well from below. The tail and the upper wings are black, and the underwings are brown.[3] The eyes are brown and the small bill and very short legs are black.[13] The sexes are identically plumaged, and juveniles differ from the adults only in that the feathers show pale fringes, particularly on the wings. The southern subspecies, A. p. kurodae, has a narrower white rump (15Â mm/0.6Â in against the nominate form's 20Â mm/0.8Â in), a grey throat and blacker underparts.[3] Juveniles of migratory Apus swifts have a partial moult prior to migration, but retain the larger wing feathers. The moult is completed in the wintering grounds, where adults have a complete moult.[15]",
