				"previous": "Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.[78]",
				"after": "The study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the formation and evolution of Galaxies; their morphology (description) and classification; and the observation of active galaxies, and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.",
