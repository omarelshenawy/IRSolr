				"previous": "The end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism in East Europe saw a vast reduction in the number of international services offered. CAAK became Air Koryo in March 1992. In 1993, Air Koryo ordered 3 Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft to carry extra cargo to its destinations in China and Russia. Air Koryo purchased a Tupolev Tu-204-300 aircraft in December 2007 and another Tu-204 in March 2010[8] to replace the aging international fleet.[9] Air Koryo also started modernizing its fleet interiors. With the new Tu-204, Air Koryo would be able to fly to Europe.",
				"after": "In September 2009, Air Koryo ordered a further example of the Tu-204-300 aircraft and in addition a single Tupolev Tu-204-100. Air Koryo was also in talks over possible orders for Sukhoi Superjet 100 to replace the aging Tu-134 and An-24 aircraft.",
