				"previous": "In May 2013, Boeing's board of directors gave formal permission for its Commercial Airplanes division to start offering the 777X to customers.[21] On September 18, 2013, Lufthansa's supervisory board gave approval to order 34 Boeing 777-9X aircraft to replace its 747-400s. At the time, Boeing was reportedly planning to launch the 777X series later in 2013.[22][23][24] In October 2013, Boeing announced that its U.S. facilities in Charleston, Huntsville, Long Beach, Philadelphia, and St. Louis as well as Russian facilities in Moscow would support the 777X design effort.[25]",
				"after": "Boeing officially launched the 777X at the 2013 Dubai Airshow in November 2013, announcing a total of 259 orders and commitments worth more than US$95 billion.[26][27] According to Boeing, this was the largest product launch by dollar value in the history of commercial aviation.[28] In addition to the 34 aircraft commitment from Lufthansa in September 2013, Boeing received orders and commitments at the Dubai Airshow for 150 aircraft from Emirates, 25 aircraft from Etihad Airways, and 50 aircraft from Qatar Airways.[26][29][30]",
