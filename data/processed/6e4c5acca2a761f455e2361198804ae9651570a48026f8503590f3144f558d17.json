				"after": "In 1104, early in the bishopric of Ranulf Flambard, Cuthbert's tomb was opened again and his relics translated to a new shrine behind the main altar of the half-built Norman cathedral. According to the earlier of the two accounts of the event that survive, known as \"Miracles 18â20\" or the \"anonymous account\", written by a monk of the cathedral, when the monks opened the decorated inner coffin, which was for the first time in living memory, they saw \"a book of the Gospels lying at the head of the board\", that is on the shelf or inner lid.[74] The account in \"Miracle 20\" adds that Bishop Flambard, during his sermon on the day the new shrine received Cuthbert's body, showed the congregation \"a Gospel of Saint John in miraculously perfect condition, which had a satchel-like container of red leather with a badly frayed sling made of silken threads\".[75] In addition the book itself has an inscription on folio 1r \"written in a modest book-hand apparently of the later twelfth century\" recording that it was found in the translation.[76]",
