				"after": "Plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh (zeta, Î¶) at high temperature within a limited pressure range.[10] These allotropes, which are different structural modifications or forms of an element, have very similar internal energies but significantly varying densities and crystal structures. This makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, or chemistry, and allows for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions from one allotropic form to another.[8] The densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00Â g/cm3 to 19.86Â g/cm3.[11]",
