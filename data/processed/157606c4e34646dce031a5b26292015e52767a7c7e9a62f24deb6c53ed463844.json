				"previous": "so the transformation RvRâ  preserves both length and angle. It therefore can be identified as a rotation or rotoreflection; R is called a rotor if it is a proper rotation (as it is if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of vectors) and is an instance of what is known in GA as a versor (presumably for historical reasons).",
				"after": "Rotors are a generalization of quaternions to n-D spaces.",
