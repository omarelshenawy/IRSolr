				"previous": "\"Cadets\" underwent training in artillery and engineering studies at the garrison since 1794.[14] In 1801, shortly after his inauguration as president, Thomas Jefferson directed that plans be set in motion to establish at West Point the United States Military Academy.[15] He selected Jonathan Williams (engineer) to serve as its first superintendent.[16] Congress formally authorized the establishment and funding of the school with the Military Peace Establishment Act of 1802, which Jefferson signed on 16 March.[2] The academy officially commenced operations on 4 July 1802.[17] The academy graduated Joseph Gardner Swift, its first official graduate, in October 1802; he later returned as Superintendent from 1812 to 1814.[14] In its tumultuous early years, the academy featured few standards for admission or length of study. Cadets ranged in age from 10 years to 37 years and attended between 6Â months to 6Â years.[14] The impending War of 1812 caused the United States Congress to authorize a more formal system of education at the academy and increased the size of the Corps of Cadets to 250.[14]",
				"after": "In 1817, Colonel Sylvanus Thayer became the Superintendent and established the curriculum, elements of which are still in use as of 2015[update]. Thayer instilled strict disciplinary standards, set a standard course of academic study, and emphasized honorable conduct. Known as the \"Father of the Military Academy,\" he is honored with a monument on campus for the profound impact he had upon the academy.[18][19] Founded as a school of engineering, for the first half of the 19thÂ century, USMA produced graduates who gained recognition for engineering the bulk of the nation's initial railway lines, bridges, harbors and roads.[20][21][22] The academy was the only engineering school in the country until the founding of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1824. It was so successful in its engineering curriculum that it significantly influenced every American engineering school founded prior to the Civil War.[21][22][23]",
