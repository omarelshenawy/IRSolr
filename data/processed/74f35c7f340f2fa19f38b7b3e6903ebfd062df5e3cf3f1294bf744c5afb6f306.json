Written from 1874 to 1876, the poem borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words from Carroll's earlier poem \"Jabberwocky\" in his children's novel Through the Looking Glass. This illustration depicts some of the members of the crew of the vessel trying to hunt the titular Snark.",
