				"Stelae are carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. A selection of the most notable stelae at Takalik Abaj follows:",
				"Stela 1 was found near to StelaÂ 2 and moved near to the administrator's house of the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is 1.36 metres (54Â in) high, 0.72 metres (28Â in) wide and 0.45 metres (18Â in) thick. It bears the sculpture of a standing figure facing to the left, holding a sceptre in the form of a serpent with a dragon mask at the lower end; a feline is on top of the serpent's body. It is similar in style to StelaÂ 1 at El BaÃºl. A badly eroded hieroglyphic text is to the left of the figure's face, which is now completely illegible. This stela is early Maya in style, dating to the Late Preclassic.[165]"
