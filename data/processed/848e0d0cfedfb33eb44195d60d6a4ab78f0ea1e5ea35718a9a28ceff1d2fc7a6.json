				"after": "German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest domestic opponents of Nazism[408] and were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps. Hitler claimed that communism was a Jewish ideology which the Nazis termed \"Judeo-Bolshevism\". Fear of communist agitation was used as justification for the Enabling Act of 1933, the law which gave Hitler his original dictatorial powers. Hermann GÃ¶ring later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that the Nazis' willingness to repress German communists prompted president Paul von Hindenburg and the German elite to cooperate with the Nazis.[citation needed] MI6 assisted the Gestapo via \"the exchange of information about Communism\", and as late as October 1937, the head of the British agency's Berlin station, Frank Foley, described his relationship with Heinrich MÃ¼ller's so-called communism expert as \"cordial\".[409]",
