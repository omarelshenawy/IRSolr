				"The degree of the zero polynomial is either left undefined, or is defined to be negative (usually â1 or ââ).[6]",
				"Like any constant value, the value 0 can be considered as a (constant) polynomial, called the zero polynomial. It has no nonzero terms, and so, strictly speaking, it has no degree either. As such, its degree is undefined. The propositions for the degree of sums and products of polynomials in the above section do not apply if any of the polynomials involved is the zero polynomial.[7]"
