				"previous": "Following credits proclaiming McCay as \"The Famous Cartoonist of the New York Herald\"[12] and \"the first artist to attempt drawing pictures that will move\",[20] McCay sits in a restaurant with a group of colleagues, cartoonist George McManus, actor John Bunny[11] and publisher Eugene V. Brewster[21] among them. McCay bets the group that in one month he can make 4,000 drawings move. The group laughs and gestures that he is drunk or crazy. McCay sets to work in a studio where he directs workers to move around bundles of paper and barrels of ink. A month later, McCay gathers his colleagues in front of a film projector. McCay rapidly sketches characters from the cast of his Little Nemo comic strip.[22]",
				"after": "McCay places a drawing of the character Flip in a wooden slot in front of the camera. The words \"Watch me move\" appear above Flip's head, and he begins to make gestures while smoking his cigar. Blocks fall from the sky and assemble themselves into the character Impie, and the pair's figures distort, disappear, and reappear, before a fantastically-dressed Little Nemo magically materializes. Nemo prevents the two others from fighting and takes control of their formsâhe stretches and squashes them with the raising and lowering of his arms. Nemo then draws the Princess and brings her to animated life. He gives her a rose which has suddenly grown nearby, just as a gigantic dragon appears.[23] The pair seat themselves on a throne in the dragon's mouth[24] and wave to the audience as the dragon carries them away.[23]",
