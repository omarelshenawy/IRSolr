				"previous": "East of the main gatehouse was a two-storey building with a basement. The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation.[56] The purpose of the buildings along the west end of the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.[61]",
