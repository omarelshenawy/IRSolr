				"previous": "In addition to an abnormally short gestation period, ruffed lemurs share another feature with small, nocturnal lemurs by producing the largest litters of the family Lemuridae.[9][11][13] Litters typically include two or three infants, although up to five have been reported.[9][11][19] Birth weights in captivity average between 83 to 101.7Â g (2.93 to 3.59Â oz) and range from 70 to 140 grams (2.5 to 4.9Â oz).[19] Ruffed lemur infants are altricial,[13] and are born with their eyes open and a full coat of fur.[19]",
				"after": "Ruffed lemurs are the only known primates to build arboreal nests, used exclusively for birth and for the first week or two of life.[9][11][14][19] Starting three weeks prior to birth,[13] females begin constructing the nest from twigs, branches, leaves, and vines, locating it within her core area and 10 to 25 metres (33 to 82Â ft) above ground.[11][19] The nests have only one apparent entry point, and are shallow and dish-shaped. During the first couple of weeks, the mother is mostly solitary and does not travel far from the nest, spending as much as 70â90% of her time with the newborns (in captivity).[19] In order to find food, she will leave the infants alone in the nest or, after the first couple of weeks, will carry them in her mouth and stash them in concealed locations in the canopy while she forages.[11][14] Since this early developmental period corresponds with the end of the cold, dry season, which offers the least amount of fruit, energy is conserved for lactation while travel is limited.[13] As the hot, rainy season begins, fruit availability rises, lactation demands rise as well, and females increase their travel distance in search of food.[11]",
