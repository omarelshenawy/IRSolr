				"previous": "For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration), which can be fatal.[70][71] The popular claim that \"a person should consume eight glasses of water per day\" seems to have no real basis in science.[72] Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to 500 ml at mealtime was conducive to weight loss.[73][74][75][76][77][78] Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.[79]",
				"after": "An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the United States National Research Council read: \"An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.\"[80] The latest dietary reference intake report by the United States National Research Council in general recommended (including food sources): 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters of water total for women.[81]",
