				"previous": "Impresario F.Â F. Proctor approached McCay in April 1906 to perform chalk talks for the vaudeville circuit.[42] For $500 per week he was to draw twenty-five sketches in fifteen minutes before live audiences, as a pit band played a piece called \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\".[43] In his The Seven Ages of Man routine, he drew two faces and progressively aged them.[44] His first performance was on June 11, 1906,[43] in a show that also featured entertainer W.Â C. Fields.[43] It was a success, and McCay toured with the show throughout 1907,[45] while managing to complete his comic strip and illustration work on time, often working in hotel rooms or backstage.[46]",
				"after": "As early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to produce a stage version of Little Nemo. In mid-1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant Little Nemo show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert[47] and lyrics by Harry B. Smith.[47] It starred midget Gabriel Weigel as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip.[48] Reviews were positive; it played to sold-out houses in New York and toured for two seasons.[49] McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where Little Nemo played. When the Keith circuit[c] refused McCay to perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise.[50] In several cities, McCay brought his son, who as publicity sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo.[51]",
