G.Â arenophilus and particularly G.Â fulgens are the most similar.[14][15] Though G.Â maritimus and G.Â arenophilus show similarities in their biogeography and ecology, the typically slightly smaller G.Â arenophilus differs from G.Â maritimus morphologically. While G.Â maritimus has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, G.Â arenophilus can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with G.Â maritimus typically displaying larger warts.[14] Like G.Â maritimus, G.Â fulgens has been recorded growing on sand-dune heathland; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of G.Â maritimus. However, G.Â fulgens requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss. Moreover, there are a number of morphological differences; G.Â maritimus mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on G.Â fulgens stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on G.Â maritimus. G.Â fulgens var. luteicystis is even more distinct from G.Â maritimus than the nominate variety.[16] Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different clades within Gymnopilus, suggesting ecological convergence between G.Â arenophilus and G.Â maritimus, and morphological convergence between G.Â fulgens and G.Â maritimus.[9]",
