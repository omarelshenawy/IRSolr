				"previous": "The aircraft requires a crew of three (pilot, copilot, and loadmaster) for cargo operations. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock, such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) M1 Abrams main battle tank, other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with palletized cargo. The cargo compartment is 88 feet (26.82 m) long by 18 feet (5.49 m) wide by 12 feet 4Â inches (3.76 m) high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo that can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock.",
				"after": "Maximum payload of the C-17 is 170,900Â lb (77,500Â kg), and its Maximum takeoff weight is 585,000Â lb (265,350Â kg). With a payload of 160,000Â lb (72,600Â kg) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000Â ft (8,500 m), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about 2,400 nautical miles (4,400Â km) on the first 71 aircraft, and 2,800 nautical miles (5,200Â km) on all subsequent extended-range models that include a sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank. Boeing informally calls these aircraft the C-17 ER.[55] The C-17's cruise speed is about 450 knots (833Â km/h) (Mach 0.74). It is designed to airdrop 102 paratroopers and their equipment.[56] The U.S. Army's Ground Combat Vehicle is to be transported by the C-17.",
