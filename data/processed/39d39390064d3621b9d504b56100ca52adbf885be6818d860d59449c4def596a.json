				"previous": "Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[305] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama has delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[306]",
				"after": "According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68Â percent approval rating[308] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41Â percent in August 2010,[309] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[310] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after Osama bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[311][312] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52Â percent shortly after his second inauguration.[313] Despite him dropping to 39Â percent in his approval ratings in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, he has climbed to 50Â percent in late January 2015 according to the Gallup Organization.[314] Polls show strong support for Obama in other countries,[315] and before being elected President he met with prominent foreign figures including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair,[316] Italy's Democratic Party leader and Mayor of Rome Walter Veltroni,[317] and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[318]",
