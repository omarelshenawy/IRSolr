				"previous": "GerlachovskÃ½ Å¡tÃ­t (translated into English as Gerlachov Peak, GerlachovskÃ½ Peak or Gerlach Peak) is the highest peak in the High Tatras, in Slovakia, and in the whole 1,500Â km (900Â mi.) long Carpathian mountain chain, as well as in northern and eastern Central Europe.",
				"after": "Usually listed at 2,655Â metres AMSL (8,711Â ft), its exact elevation is actually 0.6Â metres (2Â ft) lower. The pyramidal shape of the massif is marked by a huge cirque. Despite its relatively low elevation, the about 2,000Â m vertical rise from the valley floor makes GerlachovskÃ½ Å¡tÃ­t soar. Mistaken for an average mountain in the rugged High Tatras range in the more distant past, it has since played a symbolic role in the eyes of the rulers and populations of several Central European nations, to the point that between the 19th and mid-20thcentury, it had four different names with six name reversals. It managed to be the highest mountain of the Kingdom of Hungary, and of the countries of Czechoslovakia and Slovakia within the span of only about two decades of the 20thcentury.",
