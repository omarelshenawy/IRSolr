				"previous": "In 1997, a Boeing 747-200 (B-HIB) named Spirit of Hong Kong, with a special livery, a big traditional Chinese brushstroke character \"å®¶\" (means family/home), a traditional Chinese wording \"ç¹æ¦®é²æ­¥ æ´åµæ°é«\" painted on the left side of the aircraft and a wording \"The Spirit of Hong Kong 97\" painted on the right side of the aircraft, to commemorate the handover of Hong Kong back to China.[102] On 17 January 2000, Spirit of Hong Kong made a return on a Boeing 747-400 (B-HOX) to celebrate the legendary resilience of Hong Kong with a new special livery depicts a young athlete overcoming a series of challenges to reach his goal. A special wording \"Same Team. Same Dream.\" was painted on the left side of the aircraft and a traditional Chinese wording \"ç©æ¥µé²å é£è¶æ´é«çæ³\" was painted on the right side of the aircraft.[103][104][105] On 30 July 2013, Spirit of Hong Kong made another return, this time, on a Boeing 777-300ER (B-KPB). The livery features 110 people who represent the extraordinary spirit of Hong Kong people. The livery also has the wordings \"The Spirit of Hong Kong é¦æ¸¯ç²¾ç¥è\" The livery is actually an online contest held by Cathay Pacific to call on Hong Kong people to submit creative entries that illustrate the true spirit of the city â along with a full-body photograph of themselves. The judging panel then chose 100 winners and 10 champions â and their silhouettes have been painted on the plane.[106][107]",
				"after": "On 5 July 2002, a Boeing 747-400 (B-HOY), named Asia's world city, carried a special livery, the \"Asia's world city\" brandline, the Brand Hong Kong logotype and the dragon symbol, to promote Hong Kong around the world.[108] In January 2008, a new Boeing 777-300ER (B-KPF) was painted in the Asia's world city livery.[109]",
