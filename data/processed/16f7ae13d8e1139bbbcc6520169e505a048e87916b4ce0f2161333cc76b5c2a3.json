				"This SI unit is named after Isaac Newton. As with every International System of Units (SI) unit whose name is derived from the proper name of a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (N). However, when an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower case letter (newton), except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case. Note that \"degree Celsius\" conforms to this rule because the \"d\" is lowercase.âÂ Based on The International System of Units, section 5.2."
