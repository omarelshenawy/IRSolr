				"previous": "Aircraft designed to operate at transonic or supersonic speeds will incorporate a machmeter. The machmeter is used to show the ratio of true airspeed in relation to the speed of sound. Most supersonic aircraft are limited as to the maximum Mach number they can fly, which is known as the \"Mach limit\". The Mach number is displayed on a machmeter as a decimal fraction.[4]",
