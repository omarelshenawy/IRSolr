				"previous": "It operated the world's largest fleet of de Havilland Comets and was the last in the world to operate them. Dan-Air built a 49-strong Comet fleet between 1966 and 1976.[29][30] It retired the last example in November 1980.[31][32][33] Not all of these airframes saw actual airline service; some had been exclusively acquired for spares.[30] The Comets commanded a lower price than comparable second-hand jets. They were relatively unused as many previous operators had replaced them with the larger and more economical Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 after only a few years. The airframes had many years of service left and cost a fraction of the similarly sized BAC One-Eleven 500 or Boeing 737-200, which were still scarce second-hand. It allowed the airline to replace most of its piston-engined airliners â such as the Avro York, the Bristol 170 Freighter and the Airspeed AS 57 Ambassador â which had reached or were nearing the end of their lives, relatively cheaply.",
				"after": "Dan-Air was the last commercial airline operator of the Ambassador. A small number of this high-winged, twin-engined plane survived in the fleet into the jet era. The last retired in September 1971 after its final JerseyâGatwick scheduled service.[34][35]",
