				"previous": "In the late 1980s, increasing airline hub congestion and the onset of U.S. airport noise regulations fueled a turnaround in 757 sales.[39] From 1988 to 1989, airlines placed 322 orders, including a combined 160 orders from American Airlines and United Airlines.[39][51] By this time, the 757 had become commonplace on short-haul domestic flights and transcontinental services in the U.S.,[50] and had replaced aging 707s, 727s, Douglas DC-8s, and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s.[52] The 757-200's maximum range of 3,900 nautical miles (7,220Â km),[28] which was over one-and-a-half times the 727's,[18] allowed airlines to use the aircraft on longer nonstop routes.[53] The 757 was also flown out of airports with stringent noise regulations, such as John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California,[54] and airports with aircraft size restrictions, such as Washington National Airport near downtown Washington, D.C.[11] The largest U.S. operators, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, would ultimately operate fleets of over 100 aircraft each.[50]",
				"after": "In Europe, British Airways, Iberia, and Icelandair were the 757's largest mainline customers,[55] while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as too large for their narrow-body aircraft needs.[43] Many European charter airlines, including Air 2000, Air Holland, and LTU International,[45] also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s.[50][52] In Asia, where even bigger aircraft were commonly preferred because of large passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders.[56] A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines,[45][57] and the first Asian customer, Singapore Airlines, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240-seat wide-body Airbus A310, just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes.[58] The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in 1987,[50] orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market.[45] Operators such as China Southern, China Southwest, Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.[59]",
