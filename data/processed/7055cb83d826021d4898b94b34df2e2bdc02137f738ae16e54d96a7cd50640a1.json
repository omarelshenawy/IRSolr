				"after": "The windows of the stair turret represent \"the Storming of the Castle of Love\".[7] On the first floor are two bedrooms and an armoury. Burges's bedroom, with a theme of sea creatures, overlooks the garden.[7] Its elaborate ceiling is segmented into panels by gilded and painted beams, studded with miniature convex mirrors set in to gilt stars. Fish and eels swim in a frieze of waves painted under the ceiling, and fish are also carved in relief on the chimneypiece. On the fire-hood, a sculpted mermaid gazes into a looking-glass, with seashells, coral, seaweed and a baby mermaid also represented.[7] Charles Handley-Read described the frieze around the Mermaid fireplace as \"proto-Art Nouveau\" and noted \"the debt of international art nouveau to Victorian Gothic designers, Burges included\".[45] In this room, Burges placed two of his most personal pieces of furniture, the Red Bed, in which he died, and the Narcissus Washstand, both of which originally came from Buckingham Street. [56] The bed is painted blood red and features a panel depicting Sleeping Beauty. The washstand is red and gold; its tip-up basin of marble inlaid with fishes is silver and gold.[57]",
