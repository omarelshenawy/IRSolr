				"previous": "Other factors of concern for the painted turtles include over-collection from the wild,[162] released pets introducing diseases[163] or reducing genetic variability,[161] pollution,[164] boating traffic, angler's hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course lawnmowers or all-terrain vehicles.[165][166][167] Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps.[168] Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.[144][169]",
