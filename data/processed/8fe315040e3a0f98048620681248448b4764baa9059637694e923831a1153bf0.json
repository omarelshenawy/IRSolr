				"previous": "William Godwin's influenced \"the socialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798â1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism).\"[47]",
				"after": "Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809â1865) was the first philosopher to label himself an \"anarchist.\"[48] Some consider Proudhon to be an individualist anarchist,[49][50][51] while others regard him to be a social anarchist.[52][53] Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control.[54] Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists; in the 1840s and 1850s, Charles A. Dana,[55] and William B. Greene introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Benjamin R. Tucker.[56]",
