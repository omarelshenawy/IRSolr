East and West Falkland, the two largest islands, are about 300Â miles (500Â km) east of South America's southern Patagonian coast, at a latitude of about 52Â°S. The Falklands have internal self-government, with the United Kingdom taking responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland (Government House pictured). At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, although Argentina maintained its claim to the islands. In April 1982, Argentine forces occupied the islands. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War. The population (2,932Â inhabitants in 2012) primarily consists of native Falkland Islanders, the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, Gibraltarian and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, and Chile has reversed a population decline. Falkland Islanders have been full British citizens since 1983. Local trades include fishing, tourism and sheep farming. (FullÂ article...)",
