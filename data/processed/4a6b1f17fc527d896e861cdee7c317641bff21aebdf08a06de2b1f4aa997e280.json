				"previous": "Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popesâone in Avignon and one in Romeâclaimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.[100]",
				"after": "The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517â1648), initially sparked by the works of German theologian Martin Luther, a result of the lack of reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Empire's power, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[101] This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618â1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[102] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[103]",
