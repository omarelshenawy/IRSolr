In terms of time value of money, the Green's function (for the time value ODE) is the value of a bond paying Â£1 at a single point in time u â the value of any other stream of cash flows can then be obtained by taking combinations of this basic cash flow. In mathematical terms, this instantaneous cash flow is modeled as a Dirac delta function"
