Although LÃ©vÃªque's solution was specific to heat transfer into a Poiseuille flow, his insight helped lead other scientists to an exact solution of the thermal boundary-layer problem.[4] Schuh observed that in a boundary-layer, u is again a linear function of y, but that in this case, the wall tangent is a function of x.[5] He expressed this with a modified version of LÃ©vÃªque's profile,",
				"after": "Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius derived an exact solution to the above laminar boundary layer equations.[8] The thickness of the boundary layer is a function of the Reynolds number for laminar flow.",
