Known in the late 1990s as the F-X Project, the program was postponed during the presidential mandate of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who in the end of 2002 left the decision for his successor LuÃ­s InÃ¡cio âLulaâ da Silva, who postponed it again in 2003 and 2004.[11] It was postponed indefinitely in 2005.",
