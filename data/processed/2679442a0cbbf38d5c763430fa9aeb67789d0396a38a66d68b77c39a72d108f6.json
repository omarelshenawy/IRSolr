The total area of tiles discovered was about 80 square metres (860Â sqÂ ft), and is \"the largest area of a floor of this type to be found in any modern excavation\".[124] The site has \"the largest, and most varied, excavated collection of medieval tiles in the North West\" and \"the greatest variety of individual mosaic shapes found anywhere in Britain\".[125] The tiles found made a pavement forming the floor of the choir of the church and the transepts. The chancel floor was probably also tiled; these tiles have not survived because the chancel was at a higher level than the rest of the church, and the tiles would have been removed during subsequent gardening. A dump of tiles to the south of the site of the chapter house suggests that this was also tiled.[124] In the 15thÂ century a second tile floor was laid on top of the original floor in the choir where it had become worn.[126] The tiles on the original floor were of various shapes, forming a mosaic.[124] The tiles were all glazed and coloured, the main colours being black, green and yellow. Many of them had been decorated by impressing a wooden stamp into the moist clay before it was fired; these are known as line-impressed tiles.[127] The line-impressed designs included masks of lions or other animals, rosettes, and trefoils.[128] Other tiles or tile fragments showed portions of trees, foliage, birds and inscriptions.[129] In the chapels of the north transept, the burial place of the Dutton family, were tiles depicting mail, thought to be part of a military effigy, and tiles bearing fragments of heraldic designs.[130] The tiles from the upper (later) pavement were all square, and again were line-inscribed with patterns forming parts of larger designs.[131] A related discovery at the excavation was the kiln in which most of the tiles on the site were fired.[132]",
