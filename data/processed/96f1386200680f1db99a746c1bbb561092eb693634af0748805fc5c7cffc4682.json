				"after": "The majority of the school's first pupils joined from Gordon House, which was a successful private school on Hadlow Road run by T. E. Grice; after it was decided that the two schools should not compete, Grice was appointed deputy headmaster of The Judd School.[49] On the opening day, 40 boys were in attendance, rising to 50 by the end of the first term and to 115 in 1902.[50][51][52] In 1917, the school had 244 pupils, which increased to 308 over the next 11 years, and reached 376 in 1935.[15][21][53] In 1952, 380 boys were on the roll, which included 42 sixth form students.[54] Under Denis Rendall, the school experienced a strong growth in numbers;[33] in 1970, there were 463 pupils, increasing to 689 in 1978, and to 742 in 1986.[33] At the last Ofsted inspection in 2007, The Judd School had 933 students.[43] According to the school, as of 2010 the student body is made up of 935 students: 625 in the lower school and 310 in the sixth form, including about 60Â girls.[42] Many students come from affluent backgrounds and very few require free school meals; the number of students with disabilities, learning difficulties and special educational needs is well below the national average. The majority of students go on to higher education at the end of Year Thirteen.[43]",
