				"TheravÄda Buddhists consider much of what is found in the Chinese and Tibetan MahÄyÄna scriptural collections to be apocryphal, meaning that they are not authentic words of the Buddha.[65]",
				"The commentaries, together with the Abhidhamma, define the specific TheravÄda heritage. Related versions of the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka were common to all the early Buddhist schools, and therefore do not define only TheravÄda, but also the other early Buddhist schools, and perhaps the teaching of Gautama Buddha himself."

				"after": "Traditionally, TheravÄda Buddhism has observed a distinction between the practices suitable for a lay person and the practices undertaken by ordained monks (in ancient times, there was a separate body of practices for nuns). While the possibility of significant attainment by laymen is not entirely disregarded by the TheravÄda, it generally occupies a position of less prominence than in the MahÄyÄna and VajrayÄna traditions, with monastic life being hailed as a superior method of achieving Nirvana.[66] The view that TheravÄda, unlike other Buddhist schools, is primarily a monastic tradition has, however, been disputed.[h]",
