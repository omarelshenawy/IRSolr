				"after": "China Southern Airlines was established in 1988, following the government's decision to split the operating divisions of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) into separate airlines.[5] The CAAC was restructured in late 1984 and divided into four major airlines,[6] among which was China Southern Airlines, which became a separate identity on 1 July 1988.[6] with operations starting in 1989. Although controlled by the CAAC, China Southern quickly established relationships with Western companies; in 1990, it launched a maintenance joint-venture with Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa and Lockheed called Guangzhou Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Co. (GAMECO).[6] During 1991, 6 million passengers were carried, and with 38 Boeing jet airliners, China Southern was serving 90 domestic cities and 17 international destinations.[6] In 1992, the airline raised US$537Â million in revenue and posted a $102Â million profits; on 17 December 1992, China Southern signed an order for six Boeing 777s, split between four standard â200 series and two longer-range â200ERs.[7] China Southern, with a number of Chinese airlines, was granted financial independence during the year, with a resultant drawback being the purchase of fuel and airport fees.[6]",
