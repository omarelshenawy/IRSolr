				"(later...) From what I can tell after looking into this briefly is that a short comedic film was make in 2009, The Borghilde Project (note the spelling) and everything comes from that. It doesn't appear to have been a hoax, in that no one I can see was trying to fool anyone -- maybe it's a meme? I don't know, but since both the article, and the sources it uses, don't even seem aware of the film there's something seriously wrong in the presentation. I'm sorry to seem harsh but while it's OK for an article to have gaps, this really leaves the reader with a complete misimpression of the nature of this ... whatever it is.
