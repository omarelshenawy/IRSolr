				"after": "Stobi (Macedonian: Ð¡ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð¸, today Gradsko; AncientÂ Greek: Î£ÏÏÎ²Î¿Î¹) was an ancient town of Paeonia, later conquered by Macedon, and later turned into the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia Salutaris (now in the Republic of Macedonia). It is located on the main road that leads from the Danube to the Aegean Sea and is considered by many to be the most famous archaeological site in the Republic of Macedonia. Stobi was built where the ErigÃ³n river (mod. River Crna) joins the AxiÃ³s river (mod. Vardar), making it important strategically as a center for both trade and warfare. In September 2010, it was announced that part of a â¬53,000 grant by the US government for restoring and conserving landmarks around Macedonia will go to Stobi.",
