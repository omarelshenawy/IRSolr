				"after": "An initial design of the logo was created by Paul Stansifer, a 17-year-old Wikipedia user, whose entry won a design competition run by the site in 2003. Another Wikipedia user, David Friedland, subsequently improved the logo by changing the styling of the jigsaw pieces so that their boundaries seemed indented and simplified their contents to be a single glyph per piece, rather than a jumble of nonsensical multilingual text.[5] In the process, some errors were introduced.[5] In particular, one piece of Devanagari script and one piece of Japanese katakana were incorrectly rendered.[6]",
