				"previous": "Benefiting from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, a diversified industrial base, and an export-oriented agricultural sector, the economy of Argentina is Latin America's third-largest.[168] It has a \"very high\" rating on the Human Development Index[7] and a relatively high GDP per capita,[5] with a considerable internal market size and a growing share of the high-tech sector.[20]",
				"after": "A middle emerging economy and one of the world's top developing nations,[169][N] Argentina is a member of the G-20 major economies. Historically, however, its economic performance has been very uneven, with high economic growth alternating with severe recessions, income maldistribution andâin the recent decadesâincreasing poverty. Early in the 20th century Argentina achieved development,[14] and became the world's seventh richest country.[13] Although managing to keep a place among the top fifteen economies until mid-century,[13] it suffered a long and steady decline and now it's just an upper middle-income country.[170]",
