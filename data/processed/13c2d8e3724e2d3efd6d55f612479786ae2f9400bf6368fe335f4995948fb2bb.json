				"after": "Throughout Yorkshire many castles were built during the Norman-Breton period, particularly after the Harrying of the North. These included Bowes Castle, Pickering Castle, Richmond Castle, Skipton Castle, York Castle and others.[91] Later medieval castles at Helmsley, Middleham and Scarborough were built as a means of defence against the invading Scots.[92] Middleham is notable because Richard III of England spent his childhood there.[92] The remains of these castles, some being English Heritage sites, are popular tourist destinations.[92] There are several stately homes in Yorkshire which carry the name \"castle\" in their title, even though they are more akin to a palace.[93] The most notable examples are Allerton Castle and Castle Howard,[94] both linked to the Howard family.[95] Castle Howard and the Earl of Harewood's residence, Harewood House, are included amongst the Treasure Houses of England, a group of nine English stately homes.[96]",
