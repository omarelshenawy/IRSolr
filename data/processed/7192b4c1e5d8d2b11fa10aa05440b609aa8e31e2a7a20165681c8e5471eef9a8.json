				"after": "Nuthatches forage along tree trunks and branches and are members of the same feeding guild as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops.[56][63] They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. KrÃ¼per's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground.[64] Rock nuthatches forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits or join mixed-species feeding flocks.[4][55][65]",
