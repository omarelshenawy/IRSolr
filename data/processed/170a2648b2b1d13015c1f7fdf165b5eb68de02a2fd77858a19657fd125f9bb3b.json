				"previous": "Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the UK and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.[377][378][379] Other leaders, such as Afghan president Hamid Karzai,[380] Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni,[381] Spanish prime minister JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero,[382] and Venezuelan president Hugo ChÃ¡vez,[383] openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship.[384]",
				"after": "In 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.[385][386] In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world.[387]",
