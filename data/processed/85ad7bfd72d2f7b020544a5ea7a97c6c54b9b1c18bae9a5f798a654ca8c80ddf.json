				"after": "Two weeks after Jumbo's death, a news reporter named C. F. Richtel of the Hartford, Connecticut, Sunday Globe suggested Barnum had killed the elephant \"for advertising purposes\". Richtel was an old enemy of Barnum's, and accused the showman of masterminding Jumbo's death because the elephant had tuberculosis.[64] Barnum sued the newspaper for $50,000. He settled out of court.[67] The editor of the Sunday Globe learned the truth about Jumbo's death when he interviewed Scotty and others who had been present when the elephant died. The editor fired Richtel and published a meek apology to Barnum.[64]",
