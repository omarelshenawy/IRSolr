				"after": "Inglis returned to Cambridge in 1918 and was appointed as the professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics (renamed Mechanical Sciences in 1934).[2][33] On 25 March 1919, he was selected to head the Cambridge University Engineering Department as the successor of Hopkinson, who had died in an air crash the previous year.[2] Though he made no radical changes, such as had occurred under his predecessors, under Inglis' supervision the department became the largest in the university and one of the best engineering schools in the world.[2] He was responsible for expanding the department to meet the increased post-war demand for engineers and for the move from its traditional home at Free School Lane.[34] Inglis acquired the 4-acre (1.6Â ha) Scroope House on Trumpington Street for the department and constructed a 50,000-square-foot (4,600Â m2) laboratory on the site by 1923, followed in 1931 by a structure containing lecture theatres and a drawing office.[14]",
