				"after": "The ZÃ¼rich Opera House (German: ZÃ¼rcher Opernhaus) is one of the principal opera houses in Europe. Built in 1834, it was the first permanent theatre in the heart of ZÃ¼rich and was at the time, the main seat of Richard Wagner's activities. Later in 1890, the theatre was re-built as an ornate building with a neo-classical architecture. The portico is made of white and grey stone ornamented with the busts of Wagner, Weber and Mozart. Later, busts of Schiller, Shakespeare and Goethe were also added. The auditorium is designed in the rococo style. Once a year, it hosts the ZÃ¼rcher Opernball with the President of the Swiss Confederation and the economic and cultural Ã©lite of Switzerland.[76]",
