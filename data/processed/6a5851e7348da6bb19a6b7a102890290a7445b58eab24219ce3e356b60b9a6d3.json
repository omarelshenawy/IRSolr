				"after": "Highly energetic chemical reactions are thought to have produced selfâreplicating molecules around four billion years ago. This was followed a half billion years later by the last common ancestor of all life.[59] The development of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms; the resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with high energy solar radiation, formed a layer of protective ozone (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[60] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[61] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[62] The earliest fossil evidences for life are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland[63] and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.[64][65]",
