				"after": "Egyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the religious belief that life continued after death â even more, it expressed a belief that \"death is a mere phase of life\".[15] Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,[16] and to \"commemorate the life of the tomb ownerÂ ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth.\"[17] In this context, Egyptian mummies encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, are famous; canopic jars preserved the internal organs. A special category of Ancient Egyptian funerary texts clarify the purposes of the burial customs. The early mastaba type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. A Ka statue effigy of the deceased might be walled up in a serdab connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of incense to reach the effigy.[18] The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with reliefs in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a \"false door\", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to received the offerings left by the living.[19]",
