				"previous": "After completion, both Minas Geraes and SÃ£o Paulo sailed to other countries before arriving in Brazil. Minas Geraes left the Tyne on 5 February 1910 and traveled to Plymouth before beginning a voyage to the United States on 8 February.[61][62] The ship was assigned to escort the American armored cruiser North Carolina, carrying the body of the former Brazilian ambassador to the United States Joaquim Nabuco, to Rio de Janeiro.[58][63][64] They arrived in the city on 17 April 1910.[21][58] SÃ£o Paulo left Greenock on 16 September 1910,[65] and stopped in Cherbourg, France, to embark the Brazilian President Hermes da Fonseca.[66][67] Departing on the 27th,[68] SÃ£o Paulo voyaged to Lisbon, Portugal, where Fonseca was a guest of Portugal's King Manuel II. Soon after they arrived, the 5 October 1910 revolution began.[69] Although the President offered political asylum to the King and his family, the offer was refused.[70] There was a rumor that the King was on board and revolutionaries attempted to search the ship, but were denied permission. They also asked for Brazil to land marines \"to help in the maintenance of order,\" but this request was also denied.[71] SÃ£o Paulo left Lisbon on 7 October for Rio de Janeiro,[69][72] and docked there on 25 October.[65]",
