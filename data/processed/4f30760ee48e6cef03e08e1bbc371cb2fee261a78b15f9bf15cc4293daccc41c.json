				"after": "Warhol's production of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first took place in 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil drawings of the subject.[47] In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with a wider variety of hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while inverting and reversing the images.[57] Some in the art world consider Warhol's work completed after his 1968 shootingâwhich occurred the day before the Bobby Kennedy assassinationâ[55] to be less significant than that done before it.[66]",
