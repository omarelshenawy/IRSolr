				"previous": "The main office of The New York Times was attacked during the New York Draft Riots sparked by the beginning of military conscription for the Northern Union Army now instituted in the midst of the Civil War on July 13, 1863. At \"Newspaper Row\", across from City Hall, Henry Raymond, owner and editor of The New York Times, averted the rioters with \"Gatling\" (early machine, rapid-firing) guns, one of which he manned himself. The mob now diverted, instead attacked the headquarters of abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley's New York Tribune until forced to flee by the Brooklyn City Police, who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities.[13]",
				"after": "The newspaper's influence grew during 1870-71 when it published a series of exposÃ©s on William Magear (\"Boss\") Tweed, leader of the city's Democratic Partyâpopularly known as \"Tammany Hall\" (from its early 19th Century meeting headquarters) â that led to the end of the \"Tweed Ring's\" domination of New York's City Hall.[14] In the 1880s, The New York Times transitioned gradually from editorially supporting Republican Party candidates to becoming more politically independent and analytical; in 1884, the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland (former Mayor of Buffalo and Governor of New York State) in his first presidential campaign. While this move cost The New York Timesââ'â readership among its more conservative, business-oriented, upper-class readers, the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years and slowly acquired a reputation for even-handedness and accurate modern reporting, especially by the 1890s under its new later owner/publisher's philosophies, Adolph Ochs of Chattanooga, Tennessee.[15] The New York Times was acquired by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times, in 1896. The following year, he coined the paper's slogan, \"All The News That's Fit To Print\", which has since been printed in a box in the upper right hand corner of the front page;[15] this was a jab at competing papers such as Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal which were now being known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions known by the end of the century as \"yellow journalism\". Under Ochs guidance, continuing and expanding upon the Henry Raymond tradition, (which were from the era of James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herald which predated Pulitzer and Hearst's arrival in New York), The New York Times achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation. In 1904, The New York Times received the first on-the-spot wireless telegraph transmission from a naval battle, a report of the destruction of the Imperial Russian Navy's Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Port Arthur in the Straits of Tsushima off the eastern coast of Korea in the Yellow Sea in the western Pacific Ocean after just sailing across the globe from Europe from the press-boat Haimun during the Russo-Japanese War (one of the most important and history-changing naval battles in history). In 1910, the first air delivery of The New York Times to Philadelphia began.[15] The New York Timesââ'â first trans-Atlantic delivery by air to London occurred in 1919 by dirigible. In 1920, a \"4 A.M. Airplane Edition\" was sent by plane to Chicago so it could be in the hands of Republican convention delegates by evening.[16]",
