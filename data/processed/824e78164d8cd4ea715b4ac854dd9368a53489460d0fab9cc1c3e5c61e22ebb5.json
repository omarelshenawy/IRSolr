				"previous": "The seven-story North and South Office Buildings are situated behind the capitol and overlook the East Wing.[76] The South Office Building was renamed the K. Leroy Irvis Office Building on December 20, 2002, in recognition of former Speaker K. Leroy Irvis.[77] The State Museum and State Archives buildings were constructed in 1964. A 640-by-320-foot (200 by 100Â m) addition, called the East Wing, was dedicated on December 2, 1987.[78] The East Wing replaced the decades-old parking lot and fulfilled Brunner's plan of a People's Court. It was built partially underground, such that the tallest point on the East Wing barely reaches the first floor of the capitol.[78]",
