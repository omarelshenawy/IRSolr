				"previous": "In 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service.[3] The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin.[4] Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets.[5][6] The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies.[5] To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies.[7] This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation.[7] The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner.[5] At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.[3]",
				"after": "By 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the baseline configuration.[8] The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants.[8] While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous,[8] the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets.[3] As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities.[9] Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7.[5][10] Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757.[10] Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.[11][12]",
