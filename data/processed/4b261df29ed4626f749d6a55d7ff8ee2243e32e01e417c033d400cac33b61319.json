				"after": "Air New Zealand began as TEAL (Tasman Empire Airways Limited) in 1940, operating Short Empire flying boats on trans-Tasman routes. Following World War II, TEAL operated weekly flights from Auckland to Sydney, and added Wellington and Fiji to its routings. The New Zealand and Australian governments purchased 50% stakes in TEAL in 1953,[16] and the airline ended flying boat operations in favour of propeller and turboprop airliners by 1960. With the introduction of the DC-8 in 1965, TEAL became Air New Zealandâthe New Zealand government having purchased Australia's 50% stake in the carrier.[16]",
