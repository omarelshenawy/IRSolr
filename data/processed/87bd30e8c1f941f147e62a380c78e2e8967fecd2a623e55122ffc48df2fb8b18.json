				"previous": "Even though the Beagle departed from the GalÃ¡pagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck, these weren't for scientific study but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing. Their shells and bones were thrown overboard, leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses.[99] It has been suggested[100] that this oversight was made because Darwin only reported seeing tortoises on San CristÃ³bal[101] (chathamensis) and Santiago[102] (darwini), both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other. Though he did visit Floreana, the nigra subspecies found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals.[44]",
				"after": "However, Darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands. These were pet tortoises taken by himself (from San Salvador), his captain FitzRoy (two from EspaÃ±ola) and his servant Syms Covington (from Floreana).[103] Unfortunately they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences.[104] Although the British Museum had a few specimens, their provenance within the GalÃ¡pagos was unknown.[105] However, conversations with the naturalist Gabriel Bibron, who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that there were distinct varieties.[106]",
