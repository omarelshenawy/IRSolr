				"previous": "The chancel measures 16Â feet 6Â inches by 22Â feet 9Â inches (5.03 by 6.93Â m), and the main body of the chapel measures 52Â feet 6Â inches by 22Â feet (16 by 6.7Â m).[20] A London merchant, Lewis Roberts, gave \"some hundreds of white and black marble stonesÂ ... towards ye paving of the upper part of the chapel\", according to Francis Mansell in his inventory of 1648.[29] It is unclear when these were added to the floor; some are still in position, although others were removed in the 1864 renovation.[65] The oak pulpit dates from the early 17th century, and has moulded rectangular panels.[66] There is a bell turret on the west end of the roof, which has trefoil-shaped openings on the west and east sides, and panels decorated with trefoils on the other two sides.[20] It was built in about 1915, replacing an earlier turret of similar shape.[3]",
				"after": "The porch at the chapel entrance was moved to its present position when the chapel was extended in 1636.[29] The door jambs are moulded, as are the tops of the columns. The arch is divided into segments, with a rose in the left spandrel and a thistle in the right spandrel.[20] The use of the rose and thistle (national emblems of England and Scotland respectively) in this way dates the porch to the reign of King James I, who used these flowers, halved, as his badge after his accession to the English throne in 1603.[67] Moulded brackets support the entablature, within which the pediment contains palms and cherub-heads in the tympanum.[20] The Latin inscription above the archway is Ascendat oratio descendat Gratia (\"Let prayers ascend, and grace descend\").[3][68][69] The original entrance was covered up when the chapel was extended; it was only re-discovered when the chapel was refaced in Bath stone in 1869.[56][70]",
