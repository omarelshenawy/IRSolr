				"previous": "The collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a few months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.",
				"after": "Other discoveries made with Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula;[120] evidence for the presence of extrasolar planets around Sun-like stars;[121] and the optical counterparts of the still-mysterious gamma ray bursts.[122] HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planets Pluto[123] and Eris.[124]",
