				"previous": "Scout Moor is an upland moor of peat bog and heather in the South Pennines,[3] reaching a maximum elevation of 1,552 feet (473Â m) at its peak, Top of Leach.[6][7] The underlying geologyÂ â a mixture of hard rock and soft shalesÂ â broadly belongs to the Lower Coal Measures. The rock and shales weather at different rates, giving the area a landscape of \"steep escarpments separated by sloping shelves\", although the main dome of the moor is flat and rounded.[7] The moorland covers an area of about 1,347 acres (545Â ha),[8] of which less than 21 acres (8.5Â ha), about 2%, is occupied by the wind farm.[9]",
				"after": "Scout Moor Quarry, a 250-acre (100Â ha) open-pit mine in Edenfield, is used for the extraction of gritstone and sandstone, and formerly had its own railway line.[10] The eastern fringe of Scout Moor Wind Farm extends to Hail Storm Hill (also known as Cowpe Moss), one of the 180 Marilyns of England.[6][11] The presence of coal under Scout Moor led to extensive and unrecorded shallow coal mining in the area during the 18th and 19th centuries. Adits, shafts and coal seams from that period mark the landscape.[12][13]",
