				"previous": "The definitive short-fuselage DC-8 with the same engine that powered the vast majority of 707s, the JT3D. Fourteen earlier DC-8s were converted to this standard. All but the -55 were certified in 1961. The DC-8-51, DC-8-52 and DC-8-53 all had 17,000Â lb (76.1Â kN) JT3D-1 or 18,000Â lb (80.6Â kN) JT3D-3B engines, varying mainly in their weights: 276,000 pounds (125,200Â kg), 300,000 pounds (136,100Â kg) and 315,000 pounds (142,900Â kg) respectively. The DC-8-55 arrived in June 1964, retaining the JT3D-3B engines but with strengthened structure from the freighter versions and 325,000-pound (147,420Â kg) maximum weight. 88 DC-8-50s were built plus the 14 converted from Series 10/30.[citation needed]",
				"after": "The DC-8-71 to DC-8-73 were straightforward conversions of the -61 to -63, replacing the JT3D engines with more fuel-efficient 22,000Â lb (98.5Â kN) CFM56-2 high-bypass turbofans in new housings built by Grumman, along with new engine pylons and fairing of the air intakes below the nose. The DC-8-71 achieved the same end but required more modification because the -61 did not have the improved wings and relocated engines of the -62 and -63. Maximum takeoff weights remained the same, but there was a slight reduction in payload because of the heavier engines. All three models were certified in 1982 and a total of 110 60-Series DC-8s were converted by the time the program ended in 1988.[citation needed]",
