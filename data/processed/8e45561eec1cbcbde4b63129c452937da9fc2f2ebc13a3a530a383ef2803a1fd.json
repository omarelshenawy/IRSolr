				"previous": "On 20 April 2008, Georgian officials claimed a Russian MiG-29 shot down a Georgian Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle and provided video footage from the ill-fated drone showing an apparent MiG-29 launching an air-to-air missile at it. Russia denies that the aircraft was theirs and says they did not have any pilots in the air that day. Abkhaziaâs administration claimed its own forces shot down the drone with an L-39 aircraft \"because it was violating Abkhaz airspace and breaching ceasefire agreements.\"[26] UN investigation concluded that the video was authentic and that the drone was shot down by a Russian MiG-29 or Su-27 using a R-73 heat seeking missile.[27]",
				"after": "The Russian Air Force grounded all its MiG-29s following a crash in Siberia on 17 October 2008.[28] Following a second crash with an MiG-29 in east Siberia in December 2008,[29][30] Russian officials admitted that most MiG-29 fighters in the Russian Air Force were incapable of performing combat duties due to poor maintenance. The age of the aircraft was also an important factor as about 70% of the MiGs were considered to be too old to take to the skies.[31] The Russian MiG-29s have not received updates since the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is because the Russian Air Force chose to upgrade the Su-27 and MiG-31 instead. On 4 February 2009, the Russian Air Force resumed flights with the MiG-29.[32] However, in March 2009, 91 MiG-29s of the Russian Air Force required repair after inspections due to corrosion; approximately 100 MiGs were cleared to continue flying at the time.[33][34] The Russian Air Force started an update of its early MiG-29s to the more current MiG-29SMT standard,[35] but financial difficulties prevented delivery of more than three MiG-29 SMT upgrade to the Russian Air Force.[36] Instead, the 35 MiG-29SMT/UBTs rejected by Algeria were bought by the Russian Air Force.[37][verification needed] Russia placed an order for 16 new-build MiG-29SMTs on 15 April 2014, with delivery expected by 2017.[38]",
