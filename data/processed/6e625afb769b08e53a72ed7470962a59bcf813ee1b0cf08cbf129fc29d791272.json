				"previous": "He began his career with a six year period as editor at the two scientific journals, Nature and Science. He then joined The Economist in 1994, where he remained for seven years, during which time he was stationed in London, Hong Kong and New York in various positions, ranging from Technology Editor to US Business Editor. He took over as editor of WIRED in 2001.",
				"after": "His 2004 article The Long Tail in WIRED was expanded into a book in 2006, titled, The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More.[3][6] It appeared on the New York Times Nonfiction Best Sellers list. The book argues that products in low demand or that have a low sales volume can collectively build a better market share than its rivals, or exceed the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, provided the store or distribution channel is large enough.",
