				"previous": "The PID controller is probably the most-used feedback control design. PID is an initialism for Proportional-Integral-Derivative, referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal. If u(t) is the control signal sent to the system, y(t) is the measured output and r(t) is the desired output, and tracking error , a PID controller has the general form",
				"after": "Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation",
