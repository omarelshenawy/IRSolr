				"previous": "The stone has been exhibited almost continuously in the British Museum since June 1802.[6] During the middle of the 19th century, it was given the inventory number \"EA 24\", \"EA\" standing for \"Egyptian Antiquities\". It was part of a collection of ancient Egyptian monuments captured from the French expedition, including a sarcophagus of NectaneboÂ II (EA 10), the statue of a high priest of Amun (EA 81) and a large granite fist (EA 9).[46] The objects were soon discovered to be too heavy for the floors of Montagu House (the original building of The British Museum), and they were transferred to a new extension that was built onto the mansion. The Rosetta Stone was transferred to the sculpture gallery in 1834 shortly after Montagu House was demolished and replaced by the building that now houses the British Museum.[47] According to the museum's records, the Rosetta Stone is its most-visited single object[48] and a simple image of it has been the museum's best selling postcard for several decades.[49]",
				"after": "The Rosetta Stone was originally displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle that was made for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides to ensure that the cradle fitted securely.[47] It originally had no protective covering, and despite the efforts of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors, by 1847 it was found necessary to place it in a protective frame.[50] Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitorsâwithout a case and free to touchâis now available in the King's Library of the British Museum.[51]",
