By contrast, Japan and Hong Kong, which were also part of the industry, were able to adapt and were not badly affected.[149] Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local elephant populations were healthy, but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causes.[150]",
