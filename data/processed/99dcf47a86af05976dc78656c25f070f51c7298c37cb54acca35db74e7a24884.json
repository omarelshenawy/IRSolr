				"previous": "Hunting was a crucial component of hunter-gatherer societies before the domestication of livestock and the dawn of agriculture, beginning about 11,000 years ago. By the Mesolithic, hunting strategies had diversified with the development of the bow 18,000 years ago and the domestication of the dog about 15,000 years ago. There is fossil evidence for spear use in Asian hunting dating from approximately 16,200 years ago.[14]",
				"after": "Many species of animals have been hunted throughout history. It has been suggested that in North America and Eurasia, caribou and wild reindeer \"may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting\"[15] (see also Reindeer Age), although the varying importance of different species would depend on the geographic location.",
