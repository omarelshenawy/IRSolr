				"previous": "Justin Smith, the sheriff of Larimer County in Fort Collins, Colorado, uses Facebook to disseminate his ideas on matters relating to local, state, and national concerns. He also publicizes crimes, particularly those that his department solves. He has seven thousand followers on the social medium, considered a large number. Smith said that he rarely goes out in public \"when I don't get feedback from folks. ... Facebook is an interesting tool because I think it holds candidates and elected officials more accountable.
