The term \"forks\" refers to the forking of the Red River with the Red Lake River located near downtown Grand Forks.[8] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 20.09 square miles (52.03Â km2), of which, 19.91 square miles (51.57Â km2) is land and 0.18 square miles (0.47Â km2) is water.[1] Since it is in one of the flattest parts of the world, the city has few differences in elevation.[6] There are no lakes in the city limits of Grand Forks, but the meandering Red River and the English Coulee flow through the community and provide some break in the terrain.[24] The Red River Valley is the result of an ancient glacier carving its way south during the last Ice Age. Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of the city.[25]",
