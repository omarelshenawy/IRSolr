				"previous": "In 1979, Messerschmitt-BÃ¶lkow-Blohm (MBB) and British Aerospace (BAe) presented a formal proposal to their respective governments for the ECF, the European Collaborative Fighter[12] or European Combat Fighter.[10] In October 1979 Dassault joined the ECF team for a tri-national study, which became known as the European Combat Aircraft.[12] It was at this stage of development that the Eurofighter name was first attached to the aircraft.[13] The development of different national prototypes continued. France produced the ACX. The UK produced two designs; the P.106[N 1] was a single-engined \"lightweight\" fighter, superficially resembling the JAS 39 Gripen, the P.110 was a twin-engined fighter. The P.106 concept was rejected by the RAF, on the grounds that it had \"half the effectiveness of the two-engined aircraft at two-thirds of the cost\".[8] West Germany continued to refine the TKF-90 concept.[10] The ECA project collapsed in 1981 for several reasons including differing requirements, Dassault's insistence on \"design leadership\" and the British preference for a new version of the RB199 to power the aircraft versus the French preference for the new Snecma M88.[13]",
				"after": "Consequently the Panavia partners (MBB, BAe and Aeritalia) launched the Agile Combat Aircraft (ACA) programme in April 1982.[15] The ACA was very similar to the BAe P.110, having a cranked delta wing, canards and a twin tail. One major external difference was the replacement of the side-mounted engine intakes with a chin intake. The ACA was to be powered by a modified version of the RB199. The German and Italian governments withdrew funding, and the UK Ministry of Defence agreed to fund 50% of the cost with the remaining 50% to be provided by industry. MBB and Aeritalia signed up with the aim of producing two aircraft, one at Warton and one by MBB. In May 1983, BAe announced a contract with the MoD for the development and production of an ACA demonstrator, the Experimental Aircraft Programme.[15][16]",
