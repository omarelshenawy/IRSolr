				"previous": "An experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999. They used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal, and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.",
				"after": "The nanomaterials field includes subfields which develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions.[29]",
