				"previous": "The fossa appears as a diminutive form of a large felid, such as a cougar,[15] but with a slender body and muscular limbs,[9] and a tail nearly as long as the rest of the body.[15] It has a mongoose-like head,[9] relatively longer than that of a cat,[15] although with a muzzle that is broad[9] and short,[15] and with large but rounded ears.[4][15] It has medium brown eyes set relatively wide apart with pupils that contract to slits. Like many carnivorans that hunt at night, its eyes reflect light; the reflected light is orange in hue.[9] Its head-body length is 70â80Â cm (28â31Â in) and its tail is 65â70Â cm (26â28Â in) long. There is some sexual dimorphism, with adult males (weighing 6.2â8.6Â kg or 14â19Â lb) being larger than females (5.5â6.8Â kg or 12â15Â lb).[15] Smaller individuals are typically found north and east on Madagascar, while larger ones to the south and west.[4] Unusually large individuals weighing up to 20Â kg (44Â lb) have been reported, but there is some doubt as to the reliability of the measurements.[15] The fossa can smell, hear, and see well. It is a robust animal and illnesses are rare in captive fossas.[16]",
				"after": "Both males and females have short, straight fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in rut, they may have an orange coloration to their abdomen from a reddish substance secreted by a chest gland secretions, but this has not been consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray or nearly white.[4][15]",
