It may have been restricted to the central and western part of Cuba. Most accounts from the 19th century are based on Gundlach's reports from the immense Zapata Swamp, where the species was somewhat common near the northern edge. By the 1870s, it was becoming rarer and had retreated to the interior.[2] The subfossil skull from Sagua La Grande is the northernmost and easternmost record of the Cuban macaw. One subfossil rostrum was found in a cave. Caves are usually not visited by macaws, but the surrounding region is possibly a former swamp.[7] The Cuban macaw had also inhabited Isla de la Juventud (previously called the Isle of Pines) off Cuba, but Outram Bangs and W. R. Zappey reported that the last pair was shot near La Vega in 1864.[16] Early writers also claimed it lived on Haiti and Jamaica, but this is no longer accepted.[2]",
