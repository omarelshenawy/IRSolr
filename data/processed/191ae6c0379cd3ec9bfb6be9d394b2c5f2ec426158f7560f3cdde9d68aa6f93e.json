				"after": "The orbiter resembles a conventional aircraft, with double-delta wings swept 81Â° at the inner leading edge and 45Â° at the outer leading edge. Its vertical stabilizer's leading edge is swept back at a 50Â° angle. The four elevons, mounted at the trailing edge of the wings, and the rudder/speed brake, attached at the trailing edge of the stabilizer, with the body flap, controlled the orbiter during descent and landing.",
