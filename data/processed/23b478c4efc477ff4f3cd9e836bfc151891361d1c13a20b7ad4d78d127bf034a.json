Many adult turtles have been killed by humans, both accidentally and deliberately, for instance, due to loss of nesting, pollution and coastal development. In addition, human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up eggs.[6] In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.[57]",
