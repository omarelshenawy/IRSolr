				"previous": "Weymouth and Portland have been twinned with the town of Holzwickede in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany since 1986,[26] and the French town of Louviers, in the department of Eure in Normandy, since 1959.[27] The borough and nearby Chickerell have been a Fairtrade Zone since 2007.[28]",
				"after": "The Isle of Portland lies in the English Channel, 3 kilometres (2Â mi) south of Wyke Regis, and 200Â km (120Â mi) west-southwest of London, at 50Â°33â²0â³N 2Â°26â²24â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿50.55000Â°N 2.44000Â°Wï»¿ / 50.55000; -2.44000 (50.55,Â â2.44). Portland is situated approximately halfway along the UNESCO Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site; the site includes 153 kilometres (95Â mi) of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms.[29] The South West Coast Path runs around the coast; it is the United Kingdom's longest national trail at 1,014 kilometres (630Â mi). Portland is unusual as it is connected to the mainland at Abbotsbury by Chesil Beach, a tombolo which runs 29 kilometres (18Â mi) north-west to West Bay.[30] Portland is sometimes defined incorrectly as a tomboloâin fact Portland is a tied island, and Chesil Beach is the tombolo (a spit joined to land at both ends).[31]",
