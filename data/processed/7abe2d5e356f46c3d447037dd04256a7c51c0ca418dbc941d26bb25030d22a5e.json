				"previous": "Subfossil remains of the King Island emu show that the tibia was about 330Â mm (13Â in) long, and the femur was 180Â mm (7Â in) long. The pelvis was 280Â mm (11Â in) long, 64Â mm (2.5Â in) wide at the front, and 86Â mm (3Â in) wide at the back.[8] The tarsometatarsus averaged 232Â mm (9Â in) in length. In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261Â mm (10Â in), whereas it averaged 301Â mm (12Â in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269Â mm (10.5Â in) and 305Â mm (12Â in) in the Kangaroo Island emu. Apart from being smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island emu in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu.[14]",
				"after": "The King Island emu and the mainland emu show few morphological differences other than their significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of the mainland emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu.[9] Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant.[19] The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.[15]",
