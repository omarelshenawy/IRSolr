The generic name also incorporates the Greek term ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï/sauros (\"lizard\"), the most common suffix in dinosaur names. The type species is Albertosaurus sarcophagus; the specific name is derived from Ancient Greek ÏÎ±ÏÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¬Î³Î¿Ï (sarkophagos) meaning \"flesh-eating\" and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name: a combination of the Greek words ÏÎ±ÏÎ¾/sarx (\"flesh\") and ÏÎ±Î³ÎµÎ¹Î½/phagein (\"to eat\").[17] More than 30 specimens of all ages are known to science.[3][13]",
