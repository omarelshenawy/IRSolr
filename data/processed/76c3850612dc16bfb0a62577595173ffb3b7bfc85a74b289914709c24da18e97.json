				"previous": "On 11 June 2004, Thatcher attended the state funeral service for Ronald Reagan.[229] She delivered her eulogy via videotape; in view of her health, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier.[230] Thatcher flew to California with the Reagan entourage, and attended the memorial service and interment ceremony for the president at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.[231]",
				"after": "Thatcher celebrated her 80th birthday at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park, London, on 13 October 2005; guests included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Alexandra and Tony Blair.[232] Geoffrey Howe, by then Lord Howe of Aberavon, was also present, and said of his former leader: \"Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible.\"[233]",
