				"previous": "Several Eastern European museums have aircraft that were stored there after decommissioning and preserved. A surge of restorations began after the fall of the Soviet Union due to Western collectors, resulting in more aircraft appearing for static display. Restored aircraft are normally based on the original armoured cockpit \"tub\" and original engines, but little else.[citation needed]",
