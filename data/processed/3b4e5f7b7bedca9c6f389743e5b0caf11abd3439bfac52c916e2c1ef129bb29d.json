				"previous": "On October 4, 1887, Bennett Jr. sent Julius Chambers to Paris, France to launch a European edition. Following Bennett Jr.'s move to Paris, the New York Herald suffered from his attempt to manage its operation in New York by telegram. In 1924, after Bennett Jr.'s death, the New York Herald was acquired by its smaller rival, the New York Tribune, to form the New York Herald Tribune. In 1959, the New York Herald Tribune and its European edition were sold to John Hay Whitney, then the U.S. ambassador to Britain. In 1966 the New York paper ceased publication. The Washington Post and the New York Times acquired joint control of the European edition, renaming it the International Herald Tribune. Today, the IHT, now owned entirely by the New York Times, remains an English language paper, printed at 35 sites around the world and for sale in more than 180 countries.",
