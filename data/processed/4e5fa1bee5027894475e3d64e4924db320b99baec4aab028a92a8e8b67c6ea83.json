Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist nihilism, antirationalism, neo-primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-Situationist 'cultural terrorism', mysticism, and a 'practice' of staging Foucauldian 'personal insurrections'.\"[179] Post-left anarchist Bob Black in his long critique of Bookchin's philosophy called Anarchy after leftism said about post-left anarchy that \"It is, unlike Bookchinism, âindividualisticâ in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individualâi.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murrayâis not the measure of the good society, what is?\".[180]",
