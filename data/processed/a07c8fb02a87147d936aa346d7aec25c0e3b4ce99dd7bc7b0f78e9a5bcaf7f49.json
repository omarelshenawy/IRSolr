				"after": "Roosevelt intensely disliked being called \"Teddy\", and was quick to point out this fact to those who referred to him as such, though it would become widely used by newspapers during his political career. He attended church regularly. In 1907, concerning the motto \"In God We Trust\" on money, he wrote, \"It seems to me eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins, just as it would be to cheapen it by use on postage stamps, or in advertisements.\" He was also a member of the Freemasons and Sons of the American Revolution.[191]",
