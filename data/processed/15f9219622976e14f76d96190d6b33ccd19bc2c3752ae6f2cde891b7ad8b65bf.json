This is the initial version, having flown on 25 October 1991, and entered service with Lufthansa and Air France in March 1993. It is powered by four CFMI CFM56-5C engines and uses the Honeywell 331â350[A] APU,[91] similar to the -200. Its closest competitor is the Boeing 777-200ER. The A340-300 will be superseded by the A350-900.[92]",
