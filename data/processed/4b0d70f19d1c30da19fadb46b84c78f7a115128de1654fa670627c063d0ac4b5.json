				"after": "Thrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal,[140] particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal. The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors.[140] Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with shredding leads. Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. Thrash has been described as a form of \"urban blight music\" and \"a palefaced cousin of rap\".[141]",
