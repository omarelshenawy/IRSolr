				"after": "This runestone in Bjudby was raised by a man in memory of his son Hefnir who went to England and back, and instead of having a warrior's death overseas, he died at home. Due to the use of the ansuz rune for the o phoneme, Erik Brate argues that Hefnir participated in a late 11th-century expedition to England.[26] He suggests that Hefnir was part of the invasion force sent to England by Sweyn Estridsson, in 1069, and which was intended to defeat William the Conqueror's Normans.[27] The invasion had been planned for two years, but William the conqueror bought off the commander of the force who was Sweyn Estridsson's brother AsbjÃ¶rn.[27] The inscription is in runestone style Pr2 and was carved by two runemasters whose names are normalized as Slode and Brune. Brune's signature is also on SÃ¶ 178 at Gripsholm Castle.",
