				"previous": "Instrumentalism became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy,[30] the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.",
				"after": "Interpreting Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness. From Bertrand Russell's logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's logical atomism, Ernst Mach's phenomenalismâwhereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychologyâand Percy Bridgman's operationalism. Thereby, only the verifiable was scientific and cognitively meaningful, whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless \"pseudostatements\"âmetaphysical, emotive, or suchânot worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.",
