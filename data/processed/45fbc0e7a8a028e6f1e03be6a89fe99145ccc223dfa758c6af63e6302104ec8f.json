				"previous": "Divorce rates in Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most populated economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012.[31] This among other contributing factors such as online dating and the upward mobility of people have been attributed to pushing the average age of marriage in China to 27.[31] Up from 20 in 1950 making it closer to global marriage trends.[31]",
				"after": "Comparisons have been made to a 1986 Newsweek cover and featured article that said \"women who weren't married by 40 had a better chance of being killed by a terrorist than of finding a husband\".[1][32] Newsweek eventually apologized for the story and in 2010 launched a study that discovered 2 in 3 women who were 40 and single in 1986 had married since.[1][33] The story caused a \"wave of anxiety\" and some \"skepticism\" amongst professional and highly educated women in the United States.[1][33] The article was cited several times in the 1993 Hollywood film Sleepless in Seattle starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.[1][34] The Chinese People's Daily noted a United Nations study, mentioned earlier, that in the United States in 2012, nearly half of all women between 25 and 29 were single.[6]",
