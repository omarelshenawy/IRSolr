They will build nests of sedge and grass, about 13Â cm (5Â in) large, which are placed under debris, near shrubs, in short burrows, or high in aquatic vegetation. They may also use old nests of marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) or round-tailed muskrats (Neofiber alleni). Marsh rice rats sometimes make large runways or dig burrows.[146] They are accomplished and willing swimmers, easily swimming for more than 10Â m (30Â ft) under water,[147] and will often seek safety in the water when alarmed.[148] Rice rats in the Florida Keys occasionally climb in vegetation, but never higher than 90Â cm (3Â ft).[149] Marsh rice rats are very clean and extensively groom themselves, perhaps to keep their fur water-repellent.[150] They are aggressive towards conspecifics and emit high-pitched squeaks while fighting.[74] In dense vegetation, the perceptual range (the distance from which an animal can detect a patch of suitable habitat) of marsh rice rats is less than 10Â m (33Â ft).[151] When released outside of their natural wetland habitat, marsh rice rats generally move either upwind or downwind (anemotaxis), perhaps in order to move in a straight line, which is an efficient strategy to find suitable habitat.[152]",
