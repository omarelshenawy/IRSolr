				"previous": "The airspace above Donetsk Oblast was closed by Ukraine below 26,000 feet (7,900Â m) on 1 July 2014 and, on 14 July, below 32,000 feet (9,800Â m).[81][82] The route in Russian airspace that MH17 would have taken was closed below 32,000 feet (9,800Â m) by Russian air control a few hours before the airliner took off.[83] As with other countries Ukraine receives overflight fees for every commercial aircraft that flies through their borders. This may have contributed to the continued availability of civilian flight paths through the conflict zone.[84][85]",
