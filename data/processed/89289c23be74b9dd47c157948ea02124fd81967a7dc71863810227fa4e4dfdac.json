				"after": "Throughout his life James had close relationships with male courtiers, which has caused debate among historians about their nature.[126] After his accession in England, his peaceful and scholarly attitude contrasted strikingly with the bellicose and flirtatious behaviour of Elizabeth,[126] as indicated by the contemporary epigram Rex fuit Elizabeth, nunc est regina Jacobus (Elizabeth was King, now James is Queen).[127] Some of James's biographers conclude that EsmÃ© Stewart (later Duke of Lennox), Robert Carr (later Earl of Somerset), and George Villiers (later Duke of Buckingham) were his lovers.[128] Restoration of Apethorpe Hall, undertaken in 2004â08, revealed a previously unknown passage linking the bedchambers of James and Villiers.[129] Others argue that the relationships were not sexual.[130] James's Basilikon Doron lists sodomy among crimes \"ye are bound in conscience never to forgive\", and James's wife Anne gave birth to seven live children, as well as suffering two stillbirths and at least three other miscarriages.[131] Buckingham himself provides evidence that he slept in the same bed as the King, writing to James many years later that he had pondered: \"whether you loved me nowÂ ... better than at the time which I shall never forget at Farnham, where the bed's head could not be found between the master and his dog\".[132] However, this can be interpreted, in the context of seventeenth-century court life, as non-sexual,[133] and remains ambiguous.[134]",
