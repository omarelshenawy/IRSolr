				"after": "Madonna first performed the song during the Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. It was the fourth song of the concert, after the performance of \"Vogue\". Madonna and her back up singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory appeared on the stage wearing long black see-through robes on top of the bead-incrusted outfits they wore for the \"Vogue\" performance. In the book Madonna The Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, authors Carol Benson and Allen Metz suggest that the reason that Madonna wore all-black for this performance was so the audience would not be distracted from listening to the \"sweet harmonies\" of the sad ballad.[27] The performance included, during the bridge of the song, a fragment of Motown group The Temptations' 1971 hit \"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times in his review of the concert stated that \"On stage, the music isn't so resolutely contemporary. With a live band, directed by Jai Winding on keyboards, the music looks back to Motown (quoting \"Just My Imagination\" in \"Rain\"), girl groups and James Brown\".[28] After the performance of the song was finished, while Madonna and her back up singers left the stage for a costume change, an interlude featuring a pierrot and several dancers in black outfits and with umbrellas began. This interlude featured a choreography partially inspired in the classic Gene Kelly musical Singin' in the Rain and an instrumental version of the song. Madonna, herself called Kelly asking for advice regarding the dancing for that particular part of the show.[29]",
