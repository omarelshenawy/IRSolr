				"previous": "In the mid to late 1920s demand for aircraft began to pick up as air travel and air mail began to increase in practicality and popularity. Additional expansion of the Boeing Plant 1 site was completed in 1925 and the early 1930s. The expansion included new machine shop facilities, a hammer drop facility, paint spraying and coating shops, and some component testing facilities.,.[4][5]",
				"after": "Prior to the completion of Boeing Plant 2, Boeing Plant 1 airplanes were produced and assembled onsite, taken apart, reassembled, taken apart again, barged to Boeing Airfield, flight tested, disassembled, and shipped to the buyer. This cumbersome process was simplified by the completion of Boeing Plant 2, which could also accommodate the larger airframes being produced in the 1930s. The last airplanes produced and assembled at the Boeing Plant 1 site were the Boeing 314 Clipper, and the XB-15, both seaplanes able to be assembled on the launching quay of the Plant 1 Assembly Building.",
