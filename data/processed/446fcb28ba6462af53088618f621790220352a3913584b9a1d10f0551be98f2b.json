				"after": "After the Swedish loss at the battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675, the fleet was to support troop transports to reinforce Swedish Pomerania. It had potential for success as it was equipped with several large, well-armed ships: SvÃ¤rdet (\"the sword\") of 1,800Â tonnes, Ãpplet (\"the orb\") and Nyckeln (\"the key\"), both 1,400Â tonnes, and the enormous Kronan (\"the crown\").[29] Altogether there were 28 large and medium warships and almost the same number of smaller vessels. The supply organization was lacking. There were few experienced high-ranking officers and internal cooperation was poor; Danish contemporaries scornfully described the Swedish navy crews as mere \"farmhands dipped in saltwater\".[30]",
