				"previous": "Iolanthe (1882) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy. The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes. The critics felt that Sullivan's work in Iolanthe had taken a step forward. The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account Iolanthe his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.\"[48] Similarly, the Theatre asserted that \"the music of Iolanthe is Dr Sullivan's chef d'oeuvre. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works...\"[49]",
				"after": "Iolanthe is one of a number of Gilbert's works, including The Wicked World (1873), Broken Hearts (1875), Princess Ida (1884) and Fallen Fairies (1909), where the introduction of men and \"mortal love\" into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo.[50] Gilbert had created several \"fairy comedies\" at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James PlanchÃ©, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.[51]",
