				"previous": "A popular quote incorrectly attributed to Mark Twain is \"The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.\"[89][90] San Francisco's climate is characteristic of the cool-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb)[91] of Californiaâs coast, \"generally characterized by moist mild winters and dry summers\".[92] Since it is surrounded on three sides by water, San Francisco's weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean, which moderate temperature swings and produce a remarkably mild year-round climate with little seasonal temperature variation.",
				"after": "Among major U.S. cities, San Francisco has the coolest daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures for June, July, and August.[93] During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog.[94] The fog has an active Twitter following at @KarlTheFog.[95] The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall, which is the warmest time of the year.",
