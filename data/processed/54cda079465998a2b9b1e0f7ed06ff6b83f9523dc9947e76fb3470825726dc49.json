				"after": "By 1958, the beginnings of the Primorye region's passenger-jet era started with the introduction of the Tupolev Tu-104 airliner, and the Tupolev Tu-114D which completed the first trial, scheduled, non-stop flight from Moscow to Vladivostok (on Aeroflot) in May 1958.[5] When the size of the Ozernye Klyuchi airport restricted Vladivostok Air's expansion, the ground facilities were improved to allow regular flights with Tu-104s (1958), Ilyushin Il-18s (1963), and Antonov An-10s (1964). These improvements to the airport sharply increased passenger volumes. The first brick built terminal opened in February 1961, facilitating the processing of up to 200 passengers at once, marking the beginning of the larger airport known as Vladivostok International Airport.[5]",
