				"previous": "where the â° sign indicates parts per thousand.[33] Because the PDB standard contains an unusually high proportion of 13 C,[note 6] most measured Î´13C values are negative.",
				"after": "For marine organisms, the details of the photosynthesis reactions are less well understood, and the Î´13C values for marine photosynthetic organisms are dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, CO 2 has poor solubility in water, which means there is less CO 2 available for the photosynthetic reactions. Under these conditions, fractionation is reduced, and at temperatures above 14Â Â°C the Î´13C values are correspondingly higher, while at lower temperatures, CO 2 becomes more soluble and hence more available to marine organisms.[34] The Î´13C value for animals depends on their diet. An animal that eats food with high Î´13C values will have a higher Î´13C than one that eats food with lower Î´13C values.[33] The animal's own biochemical processes can also impact the results: for example, both bone minerals and bone collagen typically have a higher concentration of 13 C than is found in the animal's diet, though for different biochemical reasons. The enrichment of bone 13 C also implies that excreted material is depleted in 13 C relative to the diet.[37]",
