				"previous": "In 1963, Jan Mowill initiated the development at Kongsberg VÃ¥penfabrikk in Norway. Various successors have made good progress in the refinement of this mechanism. Owing to a configuration that keeps heat away from certain bearings the durability of the machine is improved while the radial turbine is well matched in speed requirement.[citation needed]",
			"after": [
				"Also known as miniature gas turbines or micro-jets.",
				"With this in mind the pioneer of modern Micro-Jets, Kurt Schreckling, produced one of the world's first Micro-Turbines, the FD3/67.[14] This engine can produce up to 22 newtons of thrust, and can be built by most mechanically minded people with basic engineering tools, such as a metal lathe.[14]"
