				"previous": "In The Third of May the man with raised arms at the focal point of the composition has often been compared to a crucified Christ,[36] and a similar pose is sometimes seen in depictions of Christ's nocturnal Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.[37] Goya's figure displays stigmata-like marks on his right hand,[34] while the lantern at the center of the canvas references a traditional attribute of the Roman soldiers who arrested Christ in the garden.[38] Not only is he posed as if in crucifixion, he wears yellow and white: the heraldic colors of the papacy.[39] In The Third of May, however, there is no attempt to find transcendence, and no sense that the sacrifice of life will lead to salvation.",
				"after": "The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio.[40] Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.[40]",
