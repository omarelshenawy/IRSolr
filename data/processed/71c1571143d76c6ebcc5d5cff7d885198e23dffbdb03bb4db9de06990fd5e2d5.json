				"after": "If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find mean values like 250.4 or 251.1Â grams. A sample mean value of 280Â grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250Â grams. There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2Â grams of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameterÂ Î¼. How do we calculate such an interval? The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample X1,Â ...,Â X25 and hence random variables themselves.",
