				"after": "Suillus brevipes is a mycorrhizal fungus, and it develops a close symbiotic association with the roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus has been shown to form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole,[22] loblolly, eastern white,[23][24] patula,[25] pond,[26] radiata,[27] and red pines.[24] In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry,[28] western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir.[29] Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350Â ppm), lead (200Â ppm), and nickel (20Â ppm).[30]",
