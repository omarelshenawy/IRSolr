				"previous": "At first, the bodies were buried in deep pits and covered with lime, but between September and November 1942, on the orders of Himmler, they were dug up and burned. In early 1943, new gas chambers and crematoria were built to accommodate the numbers.[218]",

				"In The Destruction of the European Jews, Raul Hilberg noted:",
				"In his important study, Peter Longerich observes likewise: \"On the Jewish side there was practically no resistance.\"[221] Hilberg accounts for this compliant attitude by evoking the history of Jewish persecution: as had been the case so many times before down through the centuries, simply appealing to their oppressors, and complying with orders, would hopefully avoid inflaming the situation and so mitigate the damage done to the Jews until the onslaught abated. \"There were many casualties in these times of stress, but always the Jewish community emerged once again like a rock from a receding tidal wave. The Jews had never disappeared from the earth.\" They were \"caught in the straitjacket of their history\", and the realisation that this time was different came too late.[222]"
