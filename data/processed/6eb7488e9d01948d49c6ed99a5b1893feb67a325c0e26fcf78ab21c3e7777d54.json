Because of the large amount of Spanish-speaking immigrants from Mexico Spanish is the second most widespread language. About 14 million Texan residents speak exclusively English which is around two-thirds of the people over five years old in Texas. Due to thousands of Mexican immigrants around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[45] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[46] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[45] For instance, many Texan English words are derived or adopted from Spanish. Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.). This dialect is called Tejano English (TE) and is majorly spoken by working class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[47] Next to Spanish there are several other non-English languages but contrary to Spanish they are not very common (see table).",
