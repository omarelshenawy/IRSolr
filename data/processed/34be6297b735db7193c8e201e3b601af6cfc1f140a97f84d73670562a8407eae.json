				"after": "The population of Fiji is mostly made up of native Fijians, who are Melanesians (54.3%), although many also have Polynesian ancestry, and Indo-Fijians (38.1%), descendants of Indian contract labourers brought to the islands by the British colonial powers in the 19th century. The percentage of the population of Indo-Fijian descent has declined significantly over the last two decades due to migration for various reasons.[58] Indo-Fijians suffered reprisals for a period after the Fiji coup of 2000.[59][60] There is also a small but significant group of descendants of indentured labourers from the Solomon Islands.[citation needed]",
