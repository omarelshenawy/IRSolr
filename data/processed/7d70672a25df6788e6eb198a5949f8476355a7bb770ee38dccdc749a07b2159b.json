				"after": "The Avas is a hill of volcanic origin in Miskolc, Hungary. Its top (234 m above sea level, 104 m above the city) is the highest point of Miskolc proper (although other parts, annexed to the city later, lie higher up in the BÃ¼kk mountains). On the top stands a TV tower with observation deck which is a former symbol of the city and provides a nice panorama.The name of the hill is an archaic Hungarian word meaning \"forbidden\". It was named that at a time it was forbidden for shepherds to graze their herds there because the old wine cellars threatened with caving in.",
