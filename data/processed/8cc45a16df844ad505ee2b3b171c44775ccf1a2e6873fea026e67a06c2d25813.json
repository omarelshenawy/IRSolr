				"previous": "On 7 February 2013, two Su-27s briefly entered Japanese airspace off Rishiri Island near Hokkaido, flying south over the Sea of Japan before turning back to the north.[29] Four Mitsubishi F-2 fighters were scrambled to visually confirm the Russian planes,[30] warning them by radio to leave their airspace.[31] A photo taken by a JASDF pilot of one of the two Su-27s was released by the Japan Ministry of Defense.[32] Russia denied the incursion, saying the jets were making routine flights near the disputed Kuril Islands.[29] In another encounter near Japan, in 2014 a Su-27 nearly collided with an American RC-135.[33]",
				"after": "Russia plans to replace the Su-27, the IAF Su-30MKI and the Mikoyan MiG-29 eventually with the Sukhoi PAK FA stealth fifth-generation multi-role twin-engine fighter.[34]",
