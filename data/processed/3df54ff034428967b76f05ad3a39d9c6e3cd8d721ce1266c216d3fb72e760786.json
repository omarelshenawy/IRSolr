				"previous": "Established in 1967, James Madison College is a smaller component residential college featuring multidisciplinary programs in the social sciences, founded on a model of liberal education. James Madison College is housed in Case Hall. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are tenure track faculty. James Madison College has about 1150 students total, with each freshman class containing about 320 students.[92] Each of Madison's four majorsâSocial Relations and Policy, International Relations, Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy, and Comparative Cultures and Politics[93]ârequires two years of foreign language and one semester of \"field experience\" in an internship or study abroad program. Although Madison students make up about 4% of MSU graduates, they represent around 35% of the MSU's Phi Beta Kappa members.[94]",
				"after": "Also established in 1967, Lyman Briggs College teaches math and science within social, historical and philosophical contexts.[95] Many Lyman Briggs students intend to pursue careers in medicine, but the school supports over 30 coordinate majors, from human biology to computer sciences.[96] Lyman Briggs is one of the few colleges that lets undergraduates teach as \"Learning Assistants.\"[97]",
