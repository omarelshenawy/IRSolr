				"previous": "Metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium or lithium at 1200Â Â°C.[29] It is attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic and perchloric acids.[30] Molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air.[12] At 135Â Â°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride.[31]",
