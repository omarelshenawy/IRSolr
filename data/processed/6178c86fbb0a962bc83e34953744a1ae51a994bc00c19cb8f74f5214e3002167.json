				"after": "Rupert's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and incorporated into the Northwest Territories; a lack of attention to MÃ©tis concerns caused MÃ©tis leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government as part of the Red River Rebellion. In response, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the Manitoba Act in the Canadian House of Commons, the bill was given Royal Assent and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870.[41] Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer Garnet Wolseley because of the rebellion, and Riel fled into exile.[42] The MÃ©tis were blocked by the Canadian government in their attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of Manitoba's entry into confederation. Facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from Ontario, large numbers of MÃ©tis moved to what would become Saskatchewan and Alberta.[41]",
