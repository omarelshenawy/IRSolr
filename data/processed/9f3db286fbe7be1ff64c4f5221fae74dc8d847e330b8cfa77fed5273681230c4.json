When Richard Dybeck visited the stone, in 1863, it was reclining considerably,[82] and in 1925, the stone was reported to have completely fallen down at the bank of the stream. It was not until 1946 that the Swedish National Heritage Board arranged to have it re-erected.[81] It was raised in memory of a man (probably Haursi) by his son, KÃ¡rr, and his brother-in-law. Haursi had returned from Greece a wealthy man, which left his son heir to a fortune.[30][83]",
