				"previous": "The subsequent Han Dynasty ruled China between 206 BCE and 220 CE, and created a lasting Han cultural identity among its populace that has endured to the present day.[48][49] The Han Dynasty expanded the empire's territory considerably with military campaigns reaching Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia and Central Asia, and also helped establish the Silk Road in Central Asia. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.[50] The Han Dynasty adopted Confucianism, a philosophy developed in the Spring and Autumn period, as its official state ideology. Despite the Han's official abandonment of Legalism, the official ideology of the Qin, Legalist institutions and policies remained and formed the basis of the Han government.[51]",
				"after": "After the collapse of Han, a period of disunion known as the period of the Three Kingdoms followed.[52] In 581 CE, China was reunited under the Sui. However, the Sui Dynasty declined following its defeat in the GoguryeoâSui War (598â614).[53][54]",
