The forest was up to 85Â percent hemlock and white pine; hardwoods made up the rest.[49] The Pine Creek watershed, which Upper Pine Bottom Run is part of, was home to large predators such as Wolves, Lynx, Wolverines, Panthers, Fishers, Bobcats and foxes; all except the last three are locally extinct as of 2007. The area had herds of American Bison, Elk and White-tailed Deer, and large numbers of Black Bears, River Otters, and Beavers. Rattlesnakes and insects plagued early explorers and settlers in the region.[5]",
