				"previous": "Ice hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing 350 percent in the last 10 years.[50] In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players,[51] United States had 65,609,[52] Finland 4,760,[53] Sweden 3,075[54] and Switzerland 1,172.[55] While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the Canadian Women's Hockey League, Western Women's Hockey League, Mid-Atlantic Women's Hockey League, and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and Olympic teams, and recreational teams. The IIHF holds a IIHF World Women's Championship tournament annually except in Olympic years.[56]",
				"after": "The chief difference between women's and men's hockey is that body checking is not allowed in women's hockey. After the 1990 Women's World Championship, body checking was eliminated in women's hockey. In current IIHF women's competition, body checking is either a minor or major penalty, decided at the referee's discretion.[57] In addition, players in women's competition are required to wear protective full-face masks.[57]",
