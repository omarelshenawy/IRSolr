				"previous": "Compared to the 747-400, the main changes have been on the wings, which have undergone a complete design overhaul. The sweep and basic structure has been kept to contain costs, but the wing is thicker and deeper, with the aerodynamics recalculated. The pressure distribution and bending moments are different, and the new wing for the passenger version holds 64,225Â USÂ gal (243,120Â L) of jet fuel, and the cargo aircraft 60,925Â USÂ gal (230,630Â L).[84] The increased wing span makes the 747-8 a Category F plane rather than a Category E plane,[85] similar to the Airbus A380.[86] The new wing features single-slotted outboard flaps and double-slotted inboard flaps.[87]",
				"after": "Raked wingtips, similar to the ones used on the 777-200LR, 777-300ER, and 787 aircraft, are used on the new 747 variant instead of winglets used on the 747-400.[88][89] These wingtip structures help reduce the wingtip vortices at the lateral edges of the wings, decreasing wake turbulence and drag, and thereby improving fuel efficiency. Another effort to reduce weight is the introduction of fly-by-wire technology for the majority of the lateral controls.[12]",
