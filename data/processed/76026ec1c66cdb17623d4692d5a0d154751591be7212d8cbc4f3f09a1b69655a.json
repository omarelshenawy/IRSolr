				"after": "With its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[123] Like its neighbours in Western Europe, Germany's road network is amongst the densest in the world.[124] The motorway (Autobahn) network ranks as the third-largest worldwide in length and is known for its lack of a general speed limit.[125] Germany has established a polycentric network of high-speed trains. The InterCityExpress or ICE network of the Deutsche Bahn serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300Â kph (186Â mph).[126] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport, both hubs of Lufthansa, while Air Berlin has hubs at Berlin Tegel and DÃ¼sseldorf. Other major airports include Berlin SchÃ¶nefeld, Hamburg, Cologne/Bonn and Leipzig/Halle.[127] The Port of Hamburg is one of the top twenty largest container ports in the world.[128]",
