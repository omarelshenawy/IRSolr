				"after": "Prokaryotes inhabited the Earth from approximately 3â4 billion years ago.[266][267] No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms over the next few billion years.[268] The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6â2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis.[269][270] The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes.[271] Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants.[272]",
