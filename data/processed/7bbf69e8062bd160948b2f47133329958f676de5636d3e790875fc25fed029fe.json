				"previous": "Following a period of decline during the 1970s and 1980s, Cardiff's population is growing. The local authority area had a population of 346,100 at the 2011 census,[79] compared to a 2001 Census figure of 305,353.[80] Between mid-2007 and mid-2008, Cardiff was the fastest-growing local authority in Wales with population growth rate of 1.2%.[81] According to Census 2001 data, Cardiff was the 21st largest urban area.[82] The Cardiff Larger Urban Zone (a Eurostat definition including the Vale of Glamorgan and a number of local authorities in the Valleys) has 841,600 people, the 10th largest LUZ in the UK.[83] The Cardiff and South Wales Valleys metropolitan area has a population of nearly 1.1Â million people.[84]",
				"after": "Official estimates derived from the census regarding the city's total population have been disputed. The city council has published two articles that argue the 2001 census seriously under reports the population of Cardiff and, in particular, the ethnic minority population of some inner city areas.[85][86]",
