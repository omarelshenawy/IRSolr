				"after": "Before diving, pinnipeds typically exhale to empty their lungs of half the air[68] and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea.[69] Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives.[70][71] While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs,[72] pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse.[73] The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze.[74] The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure.[68] During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.[74]",
