				"previous": "Manchester has formal twinning arrangements (or \"friendship agreements\") with several places.[201][202] In addition, the British Council maintains a metropolitan centre in Manchester.[203] Although not an official twin city, Tampere, Finland is known as \"the Manchester of Finland\" â or \"Manse\" for short. Similarly, Osaka is nicknamed as \"The Manchester of Japan\", Joinville is known as \"the Manchester of Santa Catarina (state)\" and Ahmedabad, India established itself as the centre of a booming textile industry, which earned it the nickname \"the Manchester of India\".[204][205]",
				"after": "Manchester is home to the largest group of consuls in the UK outside London. The expansion of international trade links during the Industrial Revolution led to the introduction of the first consuls in the 1820s and since then over 800, from all parts of the world, have been based in Manchester. Manchester has remained (in consular terms at least) the second city of the UK for two centuries, and hosts consular services for most of the north of England.[207]",
