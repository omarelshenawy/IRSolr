				"after": "In 2005, the Church of Scientology stated its worldwide membership to be eight million, although that number included people who took only the introductory course.[99] In 2007 a church official claimed 3.5 million members in the United States,[100] but a 2001 survey conducted by the City University of New York found only 55,000 people in the United States who claimed to be Scientologists. Worldwide, some observers believe a reasonable estimate of Scientology's core practicing membership ranges between 100,000 and 200,000, mostly in the U.S., Europe, South Africa and Australia.[101] In 2008, the American Religious Identification Survey found that the number of American Scientologists had dropped to 25,000.[102]",
