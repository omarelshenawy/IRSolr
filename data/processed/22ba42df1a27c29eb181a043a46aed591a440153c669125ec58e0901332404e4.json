				"previous": "Transbrasil was born in the State of Santa Catarina as a sister company of S/A IndÃºstria e ComÃ©rcio ConcÃ³rdia, better known by its acronym Sadia. In 1953 Omar Fontana, one of the sons of the founder of Sadia Attilio Fontana noticed a Douglas DC-3 that remained parked at JoaÃ§aba Airport, near ConcÃ³rdia, the whole weekend. Omar Fontana came up with the idea of leasing the aircraft for transporting the products of Sadia to SÃ£o Paulo. In 1954 Sadia acquired its first own Douglas DC-3 and flights became daily, having Omar as one of the crew members. However, since it was not an airline with regular schedule, it could not receive subventions from the government. In order to avoid this restriction, on January 5, 1955 he created Sadia S/A â Transportes AÃ©reos. The first regular flight was operated on March 16, 1956.[3]",
				"after": "Sadia enlarged ConcÃ³rdia Airport so that a Douglas DC-3 could operate with full load and created the first route from ConcÃ³rdia to Videira, FlorianÃ³polis, SÃ£o Paulo-Congonhas. A short time later, Sadia was also operating to Londrina, Bauru, RibeirÃ£o Preto and BrasÃ­lia.[4]",
