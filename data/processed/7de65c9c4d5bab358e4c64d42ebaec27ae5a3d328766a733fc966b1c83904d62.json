Throughout much of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem remained a provincial, if religiously important center, and did not straddle the main trade route between Damascus and Cairo.[148] The English reference book Modern history or the present state of all nations written in 1744 stated that \"Jerusalem is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine\".[149]",
