				"Basra has the first mosque built in Iraq.[citation needed]",
				"Shipping, logistics and transport are also major industries in Basra. Basra is home to all of Iraqâs six ports; Umm Qasr is the main deep-water port with 22 platforms, some of which are dedicated to specific goods (such as sulfur, seeds, lubricant oil, etc.) The other five ports are smaller in scale and more narrowly specialized. Fishing was an important business before the oil boom. The city also has an international airport, with service into Baghdad with Iraqi Airwaysâthe national airline."
