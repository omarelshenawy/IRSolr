				"previous": "On 8 December 2012, Morsi annulled his decree that had expanded his presidential authority and removed judicial review of his decrees, an Islamist official said, but added that the effects of that declaration would stand.[11][112][114][115][116][117] A constitutional referendum was still planned for 15 December. George Isaac of the Constitution Party said that Morsi's declaration did not offer anything new, the National Salvation Front rejected it as an attempt save face, and the 6 April Movement and Gamal Fahmi of the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate said the new declaration failed to address the \"fundamental\" problem of the nature of the Assembly that was tasked with drafting the constitution.[11]",
				"after": "Khaled al-Qazzaz was the secretary on foreign relations from 2012 to 2013 in the Morsi government.[118]",
