				"after": "Hobbs toured Australia for a final time as a player in 1928â29 as part of a strong MCC team,[237] and despite substantial scores in early games, did not bat well.[238] He made little contribution to England's victories in the first two Tests,[239][240] and some critics noticed a decline in his batting, a judgement reinforced when he was out to a poorly-chosen shot in the first innings of the third Test for 20. Australia were able to build up a substantial lead, and overnight rain before the sixth day of the match made them likely winners. England needed 332 to win, but on a pitch growing more difficult as it dried, a total of 100 was considered unlikely.[240][241] Hobbs and Sutcliffe survived to add 105 for the first wicket; observers praised their technique against the turning ball, although the Australian bowlers were criticised for ineffective tactics.[242][243] Hobbs was out for 49;[244] at his suggestion, Douglas Jardine came in to bat next, and England reached the end of the day having lost just one wicket for a score of 199. Next day, the team won the game to take a 3â0 lead in the series with two to play and ensure they retained the Ashes.[245] In the fourth Test, Hobbs scored 74 and shared a partnership of 143 with Sutcliffe as England won by 12 runs;[244] in the final game, won by Australia, he scored 142 on the first day, his final Test century and 12th against Australia.[246] Scoring his hundred at the age of 46 years 82 days, he remained as of 2014 the oldest player to score a Test century.[247] In first-class games on the tour, Hobbs scored 962 runs at 56.58.[37] and 451 runs at 50.11 in the Tests.[66]",
