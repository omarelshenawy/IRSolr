				"previous": "Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[86] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size.[87] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[88] A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[89] Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[90]",
				"after": "From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that moved Indians into the west to their own reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[91] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[92] Victory in the MexicanâAmerican War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[93]",
