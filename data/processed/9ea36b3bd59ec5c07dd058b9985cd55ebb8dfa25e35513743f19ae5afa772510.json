				"In Europe before the development of nationalism, people were generally loyal to a religion or to a particular leader rather than to their nations.[citation needed]",
				"With the emergence of a national public sphere and an integrated, country-wide economy in 18th-century England, people began to identify with the country at large, rather than the smaller unit of their family, town or province. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century, and was actively promoted by the government and by the writers and intellectuals of the time.[10] National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed and adopted. The Union Flag was adopted as a national one, the patriotic song \"Rule, Britannia!\" was composed by Thomas Arne in 1740,[11] and the cartoonist John Arbuthnot created the character of John Bull as the personification of the national spirit.[12]"
