				"previous": "While this terminology results in a simplified way of dealing with kinetic effects relating to the maximum velocity of the MichaelisâMenten equation, it highlights potential problems with the term used to describe effects relating to the Km. The Km relating to the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate should in most cases relate to potential changes in the binding site of the enzyme which would directly result from enzyme inhibitor interactions. As such a term similar to the one proposed above to modulate Vmax should be appropriate in most situations:[43][44]",
