				"after": "In MÄori culture, the \"white heron and the Huia were not normally eaten but were rare birds treasured for their precious plumes, worn by people of high rank\".[35][36] The bold and inquisitive nature of the huia made it particularly easy to capture.[11][15] MÄori attracted the huia by imitating its call and then captured it with a tari (a carved pole with a noose at the end) or snare, or killed it with clubs or long spears. Often they exploited the strong pair bond by capturing one of a pair, which would then call out, attracting its mate, which could be easily captured.[15][25] Opinion on the quality of huia meat as food varied wildly; although not usually hunted for this purpose, the huia was considered \"good eating\" in pies or curried stew[20] by some,[8] but a \"tough morsel\" and \"unfit to eat\" by others.[20]",
