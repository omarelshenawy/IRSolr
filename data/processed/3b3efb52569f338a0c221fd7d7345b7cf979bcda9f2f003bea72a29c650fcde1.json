				"previous": "Istanbul's local public transportation system is a complex network of trams, funiculars, metro lines, buses, bus rapid transit, and ferries. Fares across modes are integrated, using the contactless Istanbulkart, introduced in 2010, or the older Akbil electronic ticket device.[290] Trams in Istanbul date back to 1872, when they were horse-drawn, but even the first electrified trams were decommissioned in the 1960s.[291] Operated by Istanbul Electricity, Tramway, and Tunnel (Ä°ETT), trams slowly returned to the city in the 1990s with the introduction of a nostalgic route and a faster modern tram line, which now carries 265,000 passengers each day.[291][292] The TÃ¼nel opened in 1875 as the world's second-oldest subterranean rail line (after London's Metropolitan Railway).[291] It still carries passengers between KarakÃ¶y and Ä°stiklal Avenue along a steep 573-meter (1,880Â ft) track, while a more modern funicular between Taksim Square and KabataÅ began running in 2006.[293][294]",
				"after": "The Istanbul Metro comprises three lines currently in operation (the M1 and M2 on the European side, and the M4 on the Asian side) with several other lines (such as the M3, M5, M7, and M6 Mini-Metro) and extensions currently under construction.[295][296] The two sides of Istanbul's metro are connected under the Bosphorus with the Marmaray tunnel, inaugurated in 2013 as the first rail connection of any kind between Thrace and Anatolia.[297] With the Marmaray's completion, rail use in the city is expected to increase to 28 percent (from just 4 percent), behind only Tokyo and New York City.[298] Until then, buses provide transportation within and between the two halves of the city, accommodating 2.2 million passenger-trips each day.[299] The Metrobus, a form of bus rapid transit, traverses the Bosphorus Bridge, with dedicated lanes leading to its termini.[300] Ä°DO (Istanbul Seabuses) runs a combination of all-passenger ferries and car-and-passenger ferries to ports on both sides of the Bosphorus, as far north as the Black Sea.[301][302] With additional destinations around the Sea of Marmara, Ä°DO runs the largest municipal ferry operation in the world.[303] The city's main cruise ship terminal is the Port of Istanbul in KarakÃ¶y, with a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour.[304] While most visitors enter Istanbul by air, about half a million foreign tourists enter the city by sea each year.[197]",
