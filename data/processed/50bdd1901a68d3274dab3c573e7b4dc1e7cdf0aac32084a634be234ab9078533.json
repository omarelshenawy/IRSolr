				"after": "Arising near Crater Lake, the Rogue River flows from the geologically young High Cascades through the somewhat older Western Cascades and then through the more ancient Klamath Mountains.[22] The High Cascades are composed of volcanic rock produced at intervals from about 7.6Â million years ago through geologically recent events such as the catastrophic eruption of Mount Mazama in about 5700Â BCE. The volcano hurled 12 to 15 cubic miles (50 to 63Â km3) of ash into the air, covering much of the western U.S. and Canada with airfall deposits. The volcanoâs subsequent collapse formed the caldera of Crater Lake.[23]",
