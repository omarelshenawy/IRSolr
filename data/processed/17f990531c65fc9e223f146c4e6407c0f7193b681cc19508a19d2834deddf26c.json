				"previous": "In 1835â1836, Texans fought and won independence from Mexico. Texas thus became its own independent country with its own president, congress, and monetary system. In 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for Stephen F. Austin.[26] Mirabeau B. Lamar, second president of the newly formed Republic of Texas, advised the commissioners to investigate the area named Waterloo, noting the area's hills, waterways, and pleasant surroundings.[27] Waterloo was selected and the name Austin was chosen as the town's new name.[28] The location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between Santa Fe and Galveston Bay, as well as routes between northern Mexico and the Red River.[29] Austin is also the site where the southern leg of the Chisholm Trail leads to the Colorado River.[30]",
				"after": "Edwin Waller was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital.[26] The original site was narrowed to 640 acres (259Â ha) that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. The 14-block grid plan was bisected by a broad north-south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held.[26][29] The grid plan Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.",
