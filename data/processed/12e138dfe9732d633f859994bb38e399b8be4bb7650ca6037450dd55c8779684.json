				"previous": "Boeing built a final assembly line in Washington at its Renton factory,[33] home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757.[34] Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings.[13][35] Ultimately, about half of the aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies.[36] Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage.[36] Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program,[36] and final assembly of the first aircraft began in January 1981.[21]",
				"after": "The prototype 757 rolled out of the Renton factory on January 13, 1982.[37] The aircraft, equipped with RB211-535C engines,[37] completed its maiden flight one week ahead of schedule on February 19, 1982.[38] The first flight was affected by an engine stall, following indications of low oil pressure.[39] After checking system diagnostics, company test pilot John Armstrong and co-pilot Lew Wallick were able to restart the affected engine, and the flight proceeded normally thereafter.[39] Subsequently, the 757 embarked on a seven-day weekly flight test schedule.[40] By this time, the aircraft had received 136 orders from seven carriers, namely Air Florida, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Monarch Airlines, and Transbrasil.[21]",
