				"previous": "Further, lift-induced drag is only relevant when wings or a lifting body are present, and is therefore usually discussed either in the aviation perspective of drag, or in the design of either semi-planing or planing hulls. Wave drag occurs when a solid object is moving through a fluid at or near the speed of sound in that fluidâor in case there is a freely-moving fluid surface with surface waves radiating from the object, e.g. from a ship.",
				"after": "Drag depends on the properties of the fluid and on the size, shape, and speed of the object. One way to express this is by means of the drag equation:",
