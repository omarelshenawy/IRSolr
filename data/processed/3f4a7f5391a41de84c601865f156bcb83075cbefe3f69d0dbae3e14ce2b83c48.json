It was intended to privatise LOT in 2011.[31] Although advanced talks were undertaken with Turkish Airlines a deal failed to materialise. This was largely due to the inability of Turkish Airlines, as a non-EU airline, to buy a majority of the airline.[29] If they fail to find a new buyer the airline may be floated.[30] LOT lost 145.5 million pln in 2011, compared to a 163.1 million pln loss in 2010.",
