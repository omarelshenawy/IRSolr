Similar to the inscription on U 194, the runic text has an example where a single rune was used for two consecutive letters with one at the end of one word and the other at the start of a second word.[6] The runemaster on both Vs 18 and Vs 19 used the same runes trekuÃ¾an which were transliterated to show two letters and separate words as trek| |kuÃ¾an. Vs 18 and Vs 19 were also sponsored by the same person, Gunnvaldr.",
