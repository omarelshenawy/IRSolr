				"previous": "Below the text the authorship is established: Designed by W. Hogarth, Published according to Act of Parliament. 1 Feb..Â 1751 The Act of Parliament referred to is the Engraving Copyright Act 1734. Many of Hogarth's earlier works had been reproduced in great numbers without his authority or any payment of royalties, and he was keen to protect his artistic property, so had encouraged his friends in Parliament to pass a law to protect the rights of engravers. Hogarth had been so instrumental in pushing the Bill through Parliament that on passing it became known as the \"Hogarth Act\".[11]",
