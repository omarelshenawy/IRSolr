				"previous": "In 1932 the Duchy gave custody of the castle to the Office of Works while retaining ownership. The site is today cared for by English Heritage, the successor to the Office of Works. The surrounding landscape has been protected as a national park since 1951.[23] The castle is a scheduled monument,[24] which means it is a \"nationally important\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change.[26] It is also a GradeÂ I listed building (first listed in 1985),[27] and recognised as an internationally important structure.[28] It has been described as \"perhaps the finest medieval landmark of the Peak District\",[29] and architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner remarked that it is \"By far the most important castle in the countyÂ â in fact the only one of importance\".[30]",
