				"after": "Development of an improved B-29 started in 1944, with the desire to replace the unreliable Wright R-3350 engines with the more powerful four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp-Major radial engine.[3] A B-29A-5-BN (serial number 42-93845) was modified by Pratt & Whitney as a testbed for the installation of the R-4360 in the B-29, with four 3,000Â hp (2,200Â kW) R-4360-33s replacing the 2,200Â hp (1,600Â kW) R-3350s. The modified aircraft, designated XB-44 Superfortress, first flew in May 1945.[4][5] The planned Wasp-Major powered bomber, the B-29D, was to incorporate considerable changes in addition to the engine installation tested in the B-44. The use of a new alloy of aluminum, 75-S rather than the existing 24ST, gave a wing that was both stronger and lighter, while the undercarriage was strengthened to allow the aircraft to operate at weights of up to 40,000Â lb (18,000Â kg) greater than the B-29. A larger vertical fin and rudder (which could fold to allow the aircraft to fit into existing hangars) and enlarged flaps were provided to deal with the increased weight.[6][4][nb 1] Armament was similar to that of the B-29, with two bomb bays carrying 20,000Â lb (9,100Â kg) of bombs, and a further 8,000Â lb (3,600Â kg) externally. Defensive armament was 13 Ã .50Â in (12.7Â mm) machine guns (or 12 machine guns and one 20Â mm cannon) in five turrets.[6][4]",
