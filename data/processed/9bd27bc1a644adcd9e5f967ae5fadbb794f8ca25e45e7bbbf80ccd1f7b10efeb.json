				"after": "The way taken by the Hungarians across the Carpathian Mountains when they started the conquest of the Carpathian Basin varies from source to source.[270] According to Gesta Hungarorum, the Hungarians descended through the northern passes to the lowlands, bypassing Transylvania,[271][272] and only began the invasion of the regions east of the Tisa after the conquest of the western regions.[273] Gesta Hungarorum says the Vlach Gelou of Transylvania died fighting the Hungarians,[274] while his subjects chose \"for themselves as lord TÃ©tÃ©ny\",[275] one of the Hungarian leaders.[276] Anonymus also wrote of Menumorut's defeat, but said he preserved his rule in CriÅana until his death by giving his daughter in marriage to Zolta, heir to ÃrpÃ¡d, the head of the Hungarians.[274][272] In a contrasting account, the Illuminated Chronicle writes of Hungarians fleeing through the eastern passes of the Carpathian Mountains to Transylvania[272] where they \"remained quietly\" and \"rested their herds\"[277] for a while before moving further west.[278] The so-called \"Cluj group\"[225] of small inhumation cemeteriesâgraves with westâeast orientation, often containing remains of horsesâ[279] appeared on both sides of the Apuseni Mountains around 900.[280] Their military character evidences that the people using them formed a \"double defensive line\" organized against the Pechenegs.[280] Transylvanian cemeteries of the \"Cluj group\" cluster around salt mines.[189]",
