				"previous": "Seeing a growing business in online communications utilities, Delrina licensed Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS terminal emulator system in 1993,[69] and used it as the basis for the initial version of its WinComm online communications software.[70] The initial version of the product was originally bundled with WinFax as part of the Delrina Communications Suite, but in March 1994 was issued as a standalone product. It was a relative latecomer to the market, which was then dominated at the time by Datastorm's Procomm series of communications software.",
				"after": "Delrina tried to expand aggressively into this market space, first by acquiring the Canadian online bulletin board service CRS Online,[71] and then using it as a distribution channel for free versions of its WinComm LITE and DOS-based FreeComm products in March 1995.",
