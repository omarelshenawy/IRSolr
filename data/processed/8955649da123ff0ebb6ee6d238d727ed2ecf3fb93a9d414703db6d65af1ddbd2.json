				"previous": "1934 and 1938 saw a further pair of devastating floods that in part brought an end to the area's citrus industry.[56] In 1938, the Santa Ana again burst its banks and flooded Anaheim and Orange in up to 4 feet (1.2Â m) of water, stripping away thousands of acres of rich topsoil and destroying many of the citrus groves. Almost 60 people were killed in the disaster and about 68,400 acres (277Â km2) of land were flooded,[43] despite the fact that the flow in the river was only one-third of that of the 1862 flood.[57] With the extreme damage from the floods, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made the decision to dam and concrete the river beginning in the 1940s, and declared it as the greatest flood hazard in the U.S. west of the Mississippi River.[50] Prado Dam, built in 1941, was designed to capture floodwaters from the Inland Empire about 30 miles (48Â km) upstream from the river's mouth. The dam's impoundment, Prado Flood Control Basin, was designed to handle a 70-year flood.[58]",
				"after": "With the increased flood protection afforded by the Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California housing boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the Santa Ana River watershed began its third and final transitionâfrom agricultural to urban.[50] The population of the Santa Ana River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river's historic floodplainâan area once occupied by farmsâand the river became confined to a narrow channelâa flood similar to the ones surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also heightened the runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known as urban runoff.[50] In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and while much of the runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Damâprobably saving Orange County from an even greater floodâSantiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the Santa Ana Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.[59]",
