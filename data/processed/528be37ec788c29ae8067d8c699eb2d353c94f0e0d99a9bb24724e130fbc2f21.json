				"previous": "The A380 employs an integrated modular avionics (IMA) architecture, first used in advanced military aircraft, such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II,[151] and Dassault Rafale.[152] The main IMA systems on the A380 were developed by the Thales Group.[153] Designed and developed by Airbus, Thales and Diehl Aerospace, the IMA suite was first used on the A380. The suite is a technological innovation, with networked computing modules to support different applications.[153] The data networks use Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet, an implementation of ARINC 664. These are switched, full-duplex, star-topology and based on 100baseTX fast-Ethernet.[154] This reduces the amount of wiring required and minimises latency.[155]",
				"after": "Airbus used similar cockpit layout, procedures and handling characteristics to other Airbus aircraft, reducing crew training costs. The A380 has an improved glass cockpit, using fly-by-wire flight controls linked to side-sticks.[156][157] The cockpit has eight 15 by 20Â cm (5.9 by 7.9Â in) liquid crystal displays, all physically identical and interchangeable; comprising two primary flight displays, two navigation displays, one engine parameter display, one system display and two multi-function displays. The MFDs were introduced on the A380 to provide an easy-to-use interface to the flight management systemâreplacing three multifunction control and display units.[158] They include QWERTY keyboards and trackballs, interfacing with a graphical \"point-and-click\" display system.[159][160]",
