				"after": "The P-8 is a militarized version of the Boeing 737-800 with 737-900-based wings.[40] The fuselage is similar, but longer, than the 737-700-based C-40 Clipper transport aircraft in service with the United States Navy. The P-8 has a strengthened fuselage and Boeing 767-400ER-style raked wingtips, instead of the blended winglets available on 737NG variants.[41] In order to power additional onboard electronics, the P-8 has a 180kVA electric generator on each engine, replacing the 90kVA generator of civilian 737s; this required the redesigning of the nacelles and their wing mountings.[42]",
