				"after": "Delrina was founded in Toronto in 1988 by Zimbabwean expatriate Bert Amato, South African expatriates Mark Skapinker and Dennis Bennie[3] and American Lou Ryan.[4] Delrina was Bennie's second major entrepreneurial start up after co-founding Mission Electronics, a home theatre equipment company. Delrina's business strategy was to \"establish technical and market leadership in niche markets\",[5] which it accomplished with its electronic form and PC-based fax software. A year before the firm was incorporated, Amato and Skapinker had quit their jobs to start work on an electronic forms product[3] which would eventually become PerForm. Both would later meet with Bennie, who was then the Chief Executive Officer of Carolian Systems International, a firm that made business software for Hewlett-Packard. Bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of $1.5 million CAD to finance a new start-up company, \"Delrina\",[3] to develop this idea. In return, Carolian received 51% of Delrina's shares.[6]",
