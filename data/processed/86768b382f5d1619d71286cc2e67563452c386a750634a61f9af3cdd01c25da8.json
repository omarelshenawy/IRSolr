Some pieces were brought to Munkhammar and MÃ¤lhammar where they were used for the construction of fireplaces. Seven remaining pieces were brought to VÃ¤sterby in 1855 in order to be protected by a fence, but when a scholarly enquiry took place in 1897, only four pieces remained. An association of local antiquarians arranged so that the four remaining parts could be reassembled at VÃ¤sterby.[116]",
