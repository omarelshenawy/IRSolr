				"previous": "InterstateÂ 5 begins at the San Ysidro Port of Entry from Mexico in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego. Immediately after the border, I-805 splits off to the northeast and serves as a bypass of I-5 that avoids the downtown San Diego area. I-5 itself continues northwest and intersects with the western end of the SR 905 freeway, a route that connects with the Otay Mesa border crossing. I-5 then continues northward and joins the southern end of SR 75, a highway connecting to Coronado via the Silver Strand. I-5 then enters Chula Vista, briefly leaving the San Diego city limits. It continues along the east side of San Diego Bay where it intersects with SRÂ 54 and enters National City. From there, I-5 veers around the San Diego Naval Base and reenters the city limits of San Diego. I-5 subsequently interchanges with four state routesÂ â SR 15 (the southern end of the extension of I-15), SRÂ 75 and the Coronado Bay Bridge, the western end of SR 94, and the southern end of SR 163. In addition to serving downtown San Diego, I-5 also provides access to Balboa Park from the Pershing Drive exit.[8][9] The portion of I-5 from the border to downtown San Diego is named the \"Montgomery Freeway\" in honor of John J. Montgomery, a pioneer aviator who flew a glider from a location near Chula Vista in 1884.[10]",
				"after": "After leaving downtown, I-5 continues northwest until it reaches its junction with I-8, then turns slightly to the north while passing near SeaWorld and Mission Bay. Thereafter, I-5 interchanges with the western end of SR 52 before passing through the UC San Diego campus in University City near La Jolla. At Nobel Drive (exit 28A), the San Diego LDS Temple towers over I-5.[11] Shortly afterward, I-5 interchanges with the northern terminus of I-805 before continuing north and interchanging with the western end of SRÂ 56. At this interchange, there is a recently completed local bypass that provides the only access to Carmel Mountain Road from both directions and provides the only access to SRÂ 56 going northbound.[8]",
