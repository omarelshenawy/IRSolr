				"The review by Lovette & Rubenstein (2008) is the most recent work on the phylogeny of the group.[8]",
				"Genus sequence follows traditional treatments. This is apparently not entirely correct, with Scissirostrum closer to Aplonis than to Gracula for example, and Acridotheres among the most advanced genera. Too few taxa have already been studied as regards their relationships however, and thus a change in sequence has to wait."
