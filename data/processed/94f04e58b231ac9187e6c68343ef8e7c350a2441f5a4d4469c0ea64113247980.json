				"after": "Ketuanan Melayu (Jawi script: ÙØªÙØ§ÙØ§Ù ÙÙØ§ÙÙ; English for \"Malay dominance\") is a political concept emphasising Malay preeminence in present day Malaysia. The Malays of Malaysia claimed a special position and special rights owing to their long domicile[1] and the fact that the present Malaysian state itself evolved from a Malay polity.[2] The oldest political institution in Malaysia is the system of Malay rulers of the nine Malay states. British colonial government transformed the system and turned it first into a system of indirect rule, then in 1948, using this culturally based institution, they incorporated the Malay monarchy into the blueprints for the independent Persekutuan Tanah Melayu.[3]",
