				"after": "Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle. It does not share similar weather characteristics with its south and east.[clarification needed] Amarillo sits closer in proximity to Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming state capitals than it does to Austin. The region has a surface that is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in playa lakes.[5] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 90.3 square miles (234Â km2), with 89.9Â sqÂ mi (233Â km2) of it land and 0.4Â sqÂ mi (1.0Â km2) of it (0.50%) water. The Amarillo metropolitan area is the 180th-largest in the United States with a population of 236,113 in four counties: Armstrong, Carson, Potter, and Randall.",
