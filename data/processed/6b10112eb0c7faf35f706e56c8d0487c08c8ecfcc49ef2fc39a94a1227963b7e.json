				"previous": "Several later authors instead described the body as brown and the head as bluish-lilac, based on stuffed specimens, and this has become the orthodox image of the bird. Live birds were never described with these colours. Hume has proposed that this colouration is an artifact of the taxidermy specimens having aged and being exposed to light, which can turn grey and black to brown. Such a transformation has also turned an aberrant dickcissel specimen (sometimes referred to as a distinct species, Townsend's dickcissel, Spiza townsendi) from grey to brown.[2]",
				"after": "Confusion over the colouration of the Mascarene parrot has also been furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist FranÃ§ois-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, and the strength of these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish-grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. The illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen which had its tail and wing feathers feathers severely damaged by sulphuric acid in an attempt at fumigation.[2] The Vienna specimen is partially albinistic and has white feathers on the tail, back, and wings.[11] It therefore cannot be used for comparison either.[2]",
