				"after": "The goldcrest breeds in mature lowland and mountain coniferous woodlands, mainly up to 3,000Â m (9,800Â ft), and occasionally to 4,800Â  m (15,800Â ft). It uses spruce, larch, Scots pine, silver fir and mountain pine, and in man-made landscapes also introduced conifers such as douglas fir.[3] Breeding densities of up to 591 pairs per square km (1,530 pairs per square mile) have been recorded in Norway spruce in Ireland, and goldcrests constituted over 60% of all birds found in Welsh Douglas fir and Norway spruce plantations.[5] Broad-leaved woods are used, only when some spruce or firs are also present. Sites such as parks and cemeteries are used only when they offer suitable conifers that are not otherwise locally available. The height and nature of any undergrowth is irrelevant.[3] Unlike more specialised birds such as the Eurasian nuthatch and the Eurasian treecreeper, both of which forage on tree trunks, the kinglets do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size.[26] Once breeding is over, this species will readily move into deciduous trees and shrubs, heathland and similar more open habitats.[3]",
