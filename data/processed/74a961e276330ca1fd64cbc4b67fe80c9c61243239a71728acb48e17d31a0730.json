				"previous": "According to the Financial Times, the bandshell's acoustics are unparalleled compared to any contemporary outdoor venue.[112] Critics say that musicians have lauded the onstage acoustics.[7] Another Financial Times critic noted that Gehry revisited some of his past design motifs, such as his use of stainless steel, and explored new ones such as the trellis and sound system.[113] This sentiment was echoed by others.[7] However, von Rhein noted that the sound is not of uniform quality throughout the venue and opined that the optimal sonics are toward the back of the seated area and front of the lawn.[42]",
				"after": "Despite the praise it has received, the pavilion has its blemishes: the supporting north side of the structure along Randolph Street has attracted criticism for not being pleasing to the eye, and some observers found the exposed supporting proscenium braces offensive.[114] Critic Fred Bernstein of The New York Times felt that the smooth rounded trellis and sharp-edged bandshell were geometrically discordant.[115] A review in the Chicago Tribune criticized the \"ugly concrete structure\" surrounding the mixing console in the midst of the fixed seats as the pavilion's \"biggest design miscalculation\", and called for it be moved.[42] Although modern practice is to locate the sound console in with the audience,[116][117] Gehry said at a symposium after the park's opening that he wanted \"to scrap the big box of a sound booth that sprang up like a weed in the center of the pavilion's seating\".[118] The director of Millennium Park was honored for his contribution to creating \"one of the most accessible parksÂ â not just in the United States but possibly the world\" in a 2005 accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion.[3] The pavilion's stage is reached by gently sloped ramps instead of stairs, as part of the park's overall accessibility design.[3] The decision to save money and not slope the Great Lawn as much as originally planned was not universally popular.[28] However, Gehry said that the actual slope of the lawn was more accommodating to people with disabilities and better able to accommodate activities than the original plan.[119]",
