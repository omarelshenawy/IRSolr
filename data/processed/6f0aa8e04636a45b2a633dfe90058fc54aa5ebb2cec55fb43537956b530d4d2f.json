				"previous": "Local evidence of prehistoric human activity exists in the form of two Neolithic arrowheads found in Altrincham, and further afield, a concentration of artefacts around Dunham.[1] The remains of a Roman road, part of one of the major Roman roads in North West England connecting the legionary fortresses of Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), run through the Broadheath area. As it shows signs of having been repaired, the road was in use for a considerable period of time.[2] The name Altrincham first appears as \"Aldringeham\", probably meaning \"homestead of Aldhere's people\".[3] As recently as the 19th century it was spelt both Altrincham and Altringham.[4]",
				"after": "Until the Normans invaded England, the manors surrounding Altrincham were owned by the Saxon thegn Alweard; after the invasion they became the property of Hamon de Massey,[3][5] though Altrincham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book. The earliest documented reference to the town is from 1290,[6] when it was granted its charter as a Free Borough by Baron Hamon de Massey V.[7] The charter allowed a weekly market to be held, and it is possible that de Massey established the town to generate income through taxes on trade and tolls. This suggests that Altrincham may have been a planned market town, unusual during the Middle Ages, when most communities were agricultural.[8] Altrincham was probably chosen as the site of the planned town rather than DunhamÂ â which would have been protected by Dunham CastleÂ â because its good access to roads was important for trade.[9]",
