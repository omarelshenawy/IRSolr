				"previous": "In 2002, the government opened the service to private tour operators for the first time.[123] The initial private flights were plagued with delays, with both outgoing and return flights postponed for as long as nine days,[122][124] which caused the Bangladesh government to return the Hajj flights' monopoly to Biman.[citation needed]",
				"after": "Biman's handling of Hajj flights has also been beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high.[125] In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the businessâclass seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers.[126] Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights to cope with the backlog of passengers.[127][128]",
