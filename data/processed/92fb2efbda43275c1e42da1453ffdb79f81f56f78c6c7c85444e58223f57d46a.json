				"previous": "In 1966, Canadian Lady made several important changes to their advertising strategy. They introduced television advertising and changed the emphasis from the product to the brand. Ads attempted to build consumer awareness of the single brand name: Wonderbra. Market research showed that women did not want girdles advertised on televisionâgirdles were seen as armor against sex, while bras provided a means of attraction.[18]",
				"after": "Instead of being hidden \"unmentionables\", Wonderbras became more visible icons of female sex-appeal. The company also used pricing to promote Wonderbra as a luxury product with the highest price of any mass-merchandised brand. This strategy also provided greater profits in a very competitive industry. The goal was to have women see their Wonderbras as a cosmeticâa beauty enhancerârather than a functional garment. Playtex, the leading brand at the time, promoted the ease of care and durability of their girdles and brassieres.",
