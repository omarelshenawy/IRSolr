Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less than a day (round trip time, trailhead):[23] Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5â6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1â2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1â2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2â3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4â5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3â4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.",
