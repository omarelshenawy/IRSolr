				"previous": "As an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least a point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test if a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.",
			"after": [
				"During the last 20 years of 20th century, various algorithms have been introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity .",
				"Among these algorithms which solve a sub problem of the problems solved by GrÃ¶bner bases, one may cite testing if an affine variety is empty and solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions. Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries FaugÃ¨re's F4 and F5 algorithms have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity (probably because the evaluation of the complexity of GrÃ¶bner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has be done only in few special cases)."
