				"after": "The City College choir was founded in 1950 by Professor Donald Regier. Originally a co-curricular subject with only 18Â members, by 1954 it had developed into a major subject of study with 74Â students enrolled.[98] Under the direction of Linda Hall, today's choir consists of fourÂ groups: the Mixed Chorus, the Concert Choir, the Singin'/Swingin' Knights, and the Knights and Daze Show Choir.[99] The Mixed Choir is opened to all students at City College and currently has a membership of approximately 135Â students. The Concert Choir is a more selective group consisting of about 50Â students, who must audition for their places in the choir. The Singin'/Swingin' Knights is an even more selective group composed of 25Â students. The Knights and Daze Show Choir is a group of students, who perform a choreographed dance routine while they sing. With the exception of the Knights and Daze Show Choir, which performs jazz and pop music, the choir's repertoire consists of gospel music, spirituals,[99] and Classical works by composers such as Handel and Michael Praetorius.",
