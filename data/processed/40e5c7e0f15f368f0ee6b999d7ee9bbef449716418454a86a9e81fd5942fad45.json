				"after": "A registered National Natural Landmark since 1969, the Glens Natural Area is the main scenic attraction in the park and covers 2,845 acres (1,151Â ha).[96] Among perhaps 2,000 acres (810Â ha) of old-growth forest,[97] two branches of Kitchen Creek cut through the deep gorges of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh and unite at Waters Meet; then flow through Ricketts Glen. These old trees are commonly up to 100 feet (30Â m) tall, with diameters of almost 4 feet (1.2Â m). The park has a great variety of trees as it lies at the boundary between the northern and southern types of hardwoods. In 1993, the state designated the Glens Natural Area a State Park Natural Area, which means that it \"will be protected and maintained in a natural state\".[3] No buildings or latrines are allowed in the natural area, and the bridges in it are built with wood, not steel or concrete.[32]",
