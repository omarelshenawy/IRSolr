				"previous": "We don't need to assume continuity of f on the whole interval. Part I of the theorem then says: if f is any Lebesgue integrable function on [a, b] and x0 is a number in [a, b] such that f is continuous at x0, then",
				"after": "is differentiable for x = x0 with Fâ²(x0) = f(x0). We can relax the conditions on f still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable. In that case, we can conclude that the function F is differentiable almost everywhere and Fâ²(x) = f(x) almost everywhere. On the real line this statement is equivalent to Lebesgue's differentiation theorem. These results remain true for the HenstockâKurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions (Bartle 2001, Thm. 4.11).",
