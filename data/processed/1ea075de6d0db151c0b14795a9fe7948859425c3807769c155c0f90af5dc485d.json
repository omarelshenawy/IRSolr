				"previous": "At this point, BEA decided that the Trident was now too short-legged for its ever-expanding routes, and that an even longer-ranged version was needed. Hawker-Siddeley responded with another upgrade as the Trident 1F. It would have the Spey 511 engines, a 2.8Â m fuselage stretch, a gross weight of 132,000Â lb (60,000Â kg) and up to 128 seats in the original five-abreast configuration. BEA planned to buy 10 1Fs, plus an option for 14 further aircraft.",
				"after": "As work continued on the 1F the changes became so widespread that it was renamed the Trident 2E, E for Extended Range. Now powered by newer Spey 512s with 11,930Â lbf (53.1Â kN) thrust, it also replaced wing leading-edge droops with slats, and extended the span with KÃ¼chemann-style tips.[citation needed] It had a gross weight of 142,400Â lb (64,600Â kg) and a 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometres) range.",
