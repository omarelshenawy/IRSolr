				"previous": "Because PTFE is poorly soluble in almost all solvents, the polymerization is conducted as an emulsion in water. This process gives a suspension of polymer particles. Alternatively, the polymerization is conducted using a surfactant such as PFOS.",
				"after": "PTFE is a thermoplastic polymer, which is a white solid at room temperature, with a density of about 2200Â kg/m3. According to DuPont, its melting point is 600Â K (327Â Â°C; 620Â Â°F).[17] It maintains high strength, toughness and self-lubrication at low temperatures down to 5Â K (â268.15Â Â°C; â450.67Â Â°F), and good flexibility at temperatures above 194Â K (â79Â Â°C; â110Â Â°F).[18] PTFE gains its properties from the aggregate effect of carbon-fluorine bonds, as do all fluorocarbons. The only chemicals known to affect these carbon-fluorine bonds are reactive metals like alkali metals and at higher temperature also e.g. aluminium and magnesium and fluorinating agents such as xenon difluoride and cobalt(III) fluoride.[19]",
