				"previous": "There are ancient, prehistoric copper mines along Lake Superior, and metallic copper was still found there, near the surface, in colonial times. [15] [16] [17] Indians availed themselves of this copper starting at least 5,000 years ago,\"[15] and copper tools, arrowheads, and other artifacts that were part of an extensive native trade network have been discovered. In addition, obsidian, flint, and other minerals were mined, worked, and traded.[16] Early French explorers who encountered the sites[clarification needed] made no use of the metals due to the difficulties of transporting them,[16] but the copper was eventually traded throughout the continent along major river routes. In Saskatchewan, Canada, there also are ancient quartz mines near Waddy Lake and surrounding regions.[18]",
				"after": "In the early colonial history of the Americas, \"native gold and silver was quickly expropriated and sent back to Spain in fleets of gold- and silver-laden galleons,\"[19] the gold and silver mostly from mines in Central and South America. Turquoise dated at 700 A.D. was mined in pre-Columbian America; in the Cerillos Mining District in New Mexico, estimates are that \"about 15,000 tons of rock had been removed from Mt. Chalchihuitl using stone tools before 1700.\"[20][21]",
