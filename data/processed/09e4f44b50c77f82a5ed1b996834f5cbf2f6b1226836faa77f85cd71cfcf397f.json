Their appearance coincides with the settlement and consolidation of the Slavic tribes in the respective areas.[39] Scandinavians had contacts to the Slavs since their very immigration, these first contacts were soon followed by both the construction of Scandinavian emporia and Slavic burghs in their vicinity.[40] The Scandinavian settlements were larger than the early Slavic ones, their craftsmen had a considerably higher productivity, and in contrast to the early Slavs, the Scandinavians were capable of seafaring.[40] Their importance for trade with the Slavic world however was limited to the coastal regions and their hinterlands.[41]",
