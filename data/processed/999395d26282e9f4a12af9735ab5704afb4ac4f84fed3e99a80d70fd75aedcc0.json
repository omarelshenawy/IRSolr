				"after": "In 1961 the United Kingdom, United States and West Germany jointly agreed to purchase nine aircraft developed from the P.1127, for the evaluation of the performance and potential of V/STOL aircraft. These aircraft were built by Hawker Siddeley and were designated Kestrel FGA.1 by the UK.[10] The Kestrel was strictly an evaluation aircraft and to save money the Pegasus 5 engine was not fully developed as intended, only having 15,000 pounds (67Â kN) of thrust instead of the projected 18,200 pounds (81Â kN).[10] The Tripartite Evaluation Squadron numbered ten pilots; four each from the UK and US and two from West Germany.[10] The Kestrel's first flight took place on 7 March 1964.[11]",
