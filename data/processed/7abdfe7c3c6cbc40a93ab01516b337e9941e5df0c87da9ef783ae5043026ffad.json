				"after": "Twenty percent of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine.[220] One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue than any other drug until it became generic in 2011.[221] The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which â fluticasone â is fluorinated.[222] Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbonâfluorine bond is very stable.[223] Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbonâhydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.[222]",
