				"This plot is based on the NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP), which combines the 2001 GISS land station analysis data set (Hansen et al. 2001) with the Rayner/Reynolds oceanic sea surface temperature data set (Rayner 2000, Reynolds et al. 2002). The data itself was prepared through the GISTEMP online mapping tool, and the specific dataset used is available here. This data was replotted in a Mollweide projection with a continuous and symmetric color scale. The smoothing radius is 1200 km, meaning that the reported temperature may depend on measurement stations located up to 1200 km away, if necessary."
