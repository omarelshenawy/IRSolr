				"previous": "A housing shortage existed throughout the Eastern Bloc, especially after a severe cutback in state resources available for housing starting in 1975.[110] Cities became filled with large system-built apartment blocks[111] Western visitors from places like West Germany expressed surprise at the perceived shoddiness of new, box-like concrete structures across the border in East Germany, along with a relative greyness of the physical environment and the often joyless appearance of people on the street or in stores.[112] Housing construction policy suffered from considerable organisational problems.[113] Moreover, completed houses possessed noticeably poor quality finishes.[113]",
				"after": "The near-total emphasis on large apartment blocks was a common feature of Eastern Bloc cities in the 1970s and 1980s.[114] East German authorities viewed large cost advantages in the construction of Plattenbau apartment blocks such that the building of such architecture on the edge of large cities continued until the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc.[114] These buildings, such as the PanelÃ¡ks of Czechoslovakia and PanelhÃ¡z of Hungary, contained cramped concrete apartments that broadly lined Eastern Bloc streets, leaving the visitor with a \"cold and grey\" impression.[114] Wishing to reinforce the role of the state in the 1980s, Nicolae CeauÈescu redeveloped part of Bucharest, Romania with Systematisation of constructing such buildings (Blocs) after the demolition of extensive private housing.[114]",
