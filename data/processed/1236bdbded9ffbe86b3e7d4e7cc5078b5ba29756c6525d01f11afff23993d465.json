Visitors would pass through security checks added after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,[117] then were whisked to the 107th floor indoor observatory at a height of 1,310 feet (400Â m). The columns on each face of the building were narrowed on this level to allow 28Â inches of glass between them. The Port Authority renovated the observatory in 1995, then leased it to Ogden Entertainment to operate. Attractions added to the observation deck included a simulated helicopter ride around the city. The 107th floor food court was designed with a subway car theme and featured Sbarro and Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs.[118][119] Weather permitting, visitors could take two short escalator rides up from the 107th floor viewing area to an outdoor viewing platform on the 110th floor at a height of 1,377Â ft (420Â m).[120] On a clear day, visitors could see up to 50 miles (80Â km).[118] An anti-suicide fence was placed on the roof itself, with the viewing platform set back and elevated above it, requiring only an ordinary railing and leaving the view unobstructed, unlike the observation deck of the Empire State Building.[119]",
