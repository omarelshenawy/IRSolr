				"previous": "As a federal republic, Austria is divided into nine states (German: BundeslÃ¤nder).[9] These states are then divided into districts (Bezirke) and statutory cities (StatutarstÃ¤dte). Districts are subdivided into municipalities (Gemeinden). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social care, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.",
