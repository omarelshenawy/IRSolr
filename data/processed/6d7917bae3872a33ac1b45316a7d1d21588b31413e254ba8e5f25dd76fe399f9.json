				"previous": "The park has had several names through the years, starting with its 1922Â establishment as \"Cherry Springs Scenic Drive\" and the associated \"Cherry Springs 'Class B' public campground\".[22] The 1941Â Pennsylvania Department of Highways official map of Potter County shows it as \"Cherry Springs State Park\".[30] On November 11, 1954, the Pennsylvania Geographic Board officially named it \"Cherry Springs State Forest Picnic Area\". Forrey's 1984Â History of Pennsylvania's State Parks and the 1986Â NRHP nomination form still used this name, but Forrey clarified that it was \"under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of State Parks\".[22][28] Cupper's 1993Â Our Priceless Heritage: Pennsylvania's State Parks 1893â1993 refers to it as \"Cherry Springs State Park\",[31] and this remains the official name as of 2009.[2]",
				"after": "In the post-war era, the park was long known chiefly for its isolated location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952Â it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the second growth forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions as a reminder of the past, as well as displays of new equipment.[10] In 1987Â the Galeton Rotary Club took over sponsorship,[32] and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.[10][33]",
