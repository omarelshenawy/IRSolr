				"previous": "In 2008, it was announced that the Kaveri would not be ready in time for the Tejas, and that an in-production powerplant would have to be selected in the 95 to 100 kilonewton (kN) (21,000â23,000Â lbf) range to allow the aircraft to perform combat manoeuvres with optimal weapons load. The contenders were the Eurojet EJ200 and the General Electric F414.[53][54] IAF sources said that the airframe will have to be redesigned to accommodate the heavier engine, which is to take up to three-four years.[55] After evaluation and acceptance of the technical offer provided by both Eurojet and GE Aviation, the commercial quotes were compared in detail and GE Aviation was declared as the lowest bidder. The deal will cover purchase of 99 GE F414 engines. The initial batch will be supplied by GE and the remainder will be manufactured in India under a transfer of technology arrangement.[56][57]",
				"after": "In March 2005, the IAF placed an order for 20 aircraft, with a similar purchase of another 20 aircraft to follow. All 40 were to be equipped with the F404-GE-IN20 engine.[58][59] In December 2006, a 14-member \"LCA Induction Team\" was formed at Bengaluru to prepare the Tejas for service and assist with its induction into service.[60]",
