				"after": "Court conditions verged on the point of ridiculous during the Salem witch trials. There are many pauses in court records because of the chaos that surrounded trials of the supposed witches. For instance, âafflictedâ girls would throw themselves on the ground in hysterical fits, and when the examinant moved their body the afflicted individuals would cry out in pain.[2] Magistrate Samuel Sewall of Boston recorded his observation about the conditions he found in the meeting house. His diary reads, âWent to Salem, where in the meeting house, the persons accused of witchcraft were examined . . . âtwas awful to see how the afflicted persons were agitatedâ.[10] Such was the case of Elizabeth Howeâs trial which began on May 31 of 1692.[3] The following is a true account of the examination of Elizabeth Howe as witnessed by Samuel Parris.[3] This account is taken from The Salem Witchcraft Papers, Transcripts of the Legal Documents from the Salem Witch Trials.",
