				"previous": "Wired, which touted itself as \"the Rolling Stone of technology,\"[6] made its debut at the Macworld conference on January 2, 1993.[7] A great success at its launch, it was lauded for its vision, originality, innovation and cultural impact.[citation needed] In its first four years, the magazine won two National Magazine Awards for General Excellence and one for Design.",
				"after": "The founding executive editor of Wired, Kevin Kelly, was formerly one of the editors of the Whole Earth Catalog and the Whole Earth Review, and he brought with him many contributing writers from those publications. Six authors of the first Wired issue (1.1) had written for Whole Earth Review, most notably Bruce Sterling (who was highlighted on the first cover[8] ) and Stewart Brand. Other contributors to Whole Earth appeared in Wired, including William Gibson, who was featured on Wired's cover in its first year and whose article \"Disneyland with the Death Penalty\" in issue 1.4 resulted in the publication being banned in Singapore.[9]",
