Muhammad is sometimes addressed by designations deriving from his state at the time of the address: thus he is referred to as the enwrapped (al-muzzammil) in Quran 73:1 and the shrouded (al-muddaththir) in Quran 74:1.[26] In Sura Al-Ahzab 33:40 God singles out Muhammad as the \"Seal of the Prophets\", or the last of the prophets.[27] The Quran also refers to Muhammad as Aá¸¥mad \"more praiseworthy\" (Arabic: Ø£Ø­ÙØ¯â, Sura As-Saff 61:6).",
