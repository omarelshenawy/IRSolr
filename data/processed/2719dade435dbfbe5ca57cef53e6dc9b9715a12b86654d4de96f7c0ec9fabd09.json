				"after": "The first African slaves were brought to Point Comfort, today's Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia, 30 miles down stream from Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[9] As servants were freed, they became competition for resources. Additionally, released servants had to be replaced.[10]",
