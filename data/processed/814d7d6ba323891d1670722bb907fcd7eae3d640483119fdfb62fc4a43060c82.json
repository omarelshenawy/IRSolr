				"The system on which the Japanese era names are based originated in China in 140 BC, and was adopted by Japan in AD 645, during the reign of Emperor KÅtoku.",
				"The first era name to be assigned was \"Taika\" (å¤§å?), celebrating the political and organizational changes which were to flow from the great Taika reform (å¤§åã®æ¹æ°?). Although the regular practice of proclaiming successive era names was interrupted in the late seventh century, it was permanently re-adopted in 701 during the reign of Emperor Mommu (697â707). Since then, era names have been used continuously up through the present day.[1]"
