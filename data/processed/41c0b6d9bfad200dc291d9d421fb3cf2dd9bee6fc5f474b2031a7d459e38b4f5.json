				"after": "Coinage began on the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 following the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper.[1] However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so it was decided to strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead.[2] This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined.[2] During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned.[3] It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested it, though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested it, as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office.[4] It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.[3]",
