				"previous": "North of the prisons, the former corridor continues as the separate Wallkill Valley Rail Trail.[5] Rail trail enthusiasts have been trying to find a way to combine the two rail trails since the 1990s,[11] and in 2004 the town of Shawangunk commissioned an open space study that identified possible ways to accomplish such a connection.[12] A 2008 Ulster County transportation plan included projects to connect the trails,[13] and the town of Shawangunk is currently considering plans to connect the trails by diverting the corridor along Birch Road. The original route of the corridor is 40 feet (12Â m) within the prisons' perimeter fence.[14]",
				"after": "The portion of the former corridor running through the center of Wallkill was converted to a road, Railroad Avenue.[6][11] The southern part of the route, running from Wallkill to the MontgomeryâShawangunk town line, was officially opened[11] as the Jesse McHugh Rail Trail on June 5, 1993.[15] Jesse McHugh was a former Shawangunk town supervisor.[6] The northern portion of the Shawangunk section, which stretches to the border of the prison grounds, is maintained by the town but not officially part of the trail.[11]",
