				"previous": "According to the New York Times the oil-drilling boom in the United States has increased oil production by over 70 percent since 2008 and has reduced the United States oil imports from OPEC by fifty per cent.[13]",
				"after": "Since 2011 the United States absorbed the rapidly increased domestic production of sweet, light, tight oil by reducing like-for-like or similar grade, imported crude oil[14] from Nigerian and other African suppliers.[13] From 2011 to 2013 fifty per cent of oil import reductions impacted light crude (API gravity 35+).[15] Almost 96 per cent of the 1.8 million barrels per day (290,000Â m3/d) of its growth comes from light, sweet crude from tight resource formations.[14] As domestic production continues to increase, the U.S. is facing future challenges of absorbing the light, sweet tight oil.[15]",
