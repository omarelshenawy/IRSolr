				"after": "The snout shape of crocodilians varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while alligators and caimans have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them,[12] and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open.[33] The powerful closing muscles attach at the bottom of the skull, allowing the top of the head to retain a flat profile. The jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.[14]",
