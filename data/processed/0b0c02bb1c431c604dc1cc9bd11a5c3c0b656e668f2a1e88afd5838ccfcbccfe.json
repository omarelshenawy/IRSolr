				"previous": "In the case of a periodic function F with period Î», that is, F(x + Î» â vt) = F(x â vt), the periodicity of F in space means that a snapshot of the wave at a given time t finds the wave varying periodically in space with period Î» (the wavelength of the wave). In a similar fashion, this periodicity of F implies a periodicity in time as well: F(x â v(t + T)) = F(x â vt) provided vT = Î», so an observation of the wave at a fixed location x finds the wave undulating periodically in time with period T = Î»/v.[7]",
				"after": "The amplitude of a wave may be constant (in which case the wave is a c.w. or continuous wave), or may be modulated so as to vary with time and/or position. The outline of the variation in amplitude is called the envelope of the wave. Mathematically, the modulated wave can be written in the form:[8][9][10]",
