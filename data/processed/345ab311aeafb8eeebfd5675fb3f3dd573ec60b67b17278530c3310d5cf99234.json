				"after": "The musical theme predominantly used on British Airways advertising is \"The Flower Duet\" by LÃ©o Delibes.[113] This, and the slogan \"The World's Favourite Airline\" were introduced in 1989 with the launch of the iconic \"Face\" advertisement.[114] The slogan was dropped in 2001 after Lufthansa overtook BA in terms of passenger numbers.[115] \"Flower Duet\" is still used by the airline, and has been through several different arrangements since 1989. The most recent version of this melody was shown in 2007 with a new slogan: \"Upgrade to British Airways\".[116] Other advertising slogans have included \"The World's Best Airline\", \"We'll Take More Care of You\", and \"Fly the Flag\".[117]",
