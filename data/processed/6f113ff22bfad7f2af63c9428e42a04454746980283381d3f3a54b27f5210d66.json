				"previous": "Manchester is mentioned as having a market in 1282.[24] Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of Flemish weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the region's textile industry.[25] Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen, and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in John Leland's words, \"The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire.\"[19] The cathedral and Chetham's buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland's Manchester.[20]",
				"after": "During the English Civil War Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting, Cromwell granted it the right to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals. He was a diligent puritan, turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.[26]",
