				"previous": "For most of their recorded history, Taiwanese aborigines have been defined by the agents of different Confucian, Christian, and Nationalist \"civilizing\" projects, with a variety of aims. Each \"civilizing\" project defined the aborigines based on the \"civilizer\"'s cultural understandings of difference and similarity, behavior, location, appearance and prior contact with other groups of people (Harrell 1996:5â20). Taxonomies imposed by colonizing forces divided the aborigines into named subgroups, referred to as \"tribes\". These divisions did not always correspond to distinctions drawn by the aborigines themselves. However, the categories have become so firmly established in government and popular discourse over time that they have become de facto distinctions, serving to shape in part today's political discourse within the Republic of China (ROC), and affecting Taiwan's policies regarding indigenous peoples.",
				"after": "The Han sailor, Chen Di, in his Record of the Eastern Seas (1603), identifies the indigenous people of Taiwan as simply \"Eastern Savages\" (æ±çª; Dongfan), while the Dutch referred to Taiwan's original inhabitants as \"Indians\" or \"blacks\", based on their prior colonial experience in what is currently Indonesia (Teng 2004:61â5).",
