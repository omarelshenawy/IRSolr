				"previous": "Several scientists who have researched dolphin behaviour have proposed that dolphins' unusually high intelligence in comparison to other animals means that dolphins should be seen as non-human persons who should have their own specific rights and that it is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes or to kill them either intentionally for consumption or unintentionally as by-catch.[106] [107] Four countries â Chile, Costa Rica, Hungary, and India â have declared dolphins to be \"non-human persons\" and have banned the capture and import of live dolphins for entertainment.[108][109]",
				"after": "Dolphins have long played a role in human culture. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology, and many coins from ancient Greece have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin.[110] The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a shipâs wake was considered a good omen.[111] In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin.",
