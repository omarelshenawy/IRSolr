				"after": "Most of the Portuguese expeditions of the Age of Discovery left from Lisbon during the 15th to 17th centuries, including Vasco da Gama's expedition to India in 1497. In 1506, 3,000 Jews were massacred in Lisbon.[24] The 16th century was Lisbon's golden era: the city was the European hub of commerce between Africa, India, the Far East and later, Brazil, and acquired great riches by exploiting the trade in spices, slaves, sugar, textiles and other goods. This period saw the rise of the exuberant Manueline style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th century monuments (including Lisbon's BelÃ©m Tower and JerÃ³nimos Monastery, which were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites). A description of Lisbon in the 16th century was written by DamiÃ£o de GÃ³is and published in 1554.[25]",
