Rivals Star Alliance and Etihad Airlines are also investigating competing options with regard to Virgin Atlantic.[79] China Eastern Airlines joined the alliance on 21 June 2011, along with its subsidiary, Shanghai Airlines, to become the 14th member.[80][81] Later in 2011, on 28 September, China Airlines joined the alliance.[82] In November the same year, Xiamen Airlines committed to be incorporated as a full member by the end of 2012,[83] with their entry supported by China Southern Airlines.[84]",
