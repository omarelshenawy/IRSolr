The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movementâcultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greerâquestioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose and the rise of the miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women.[11] While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.",
