				"after": "Oliver was born Bronwyn Gooda on 22 February 1959,[1] in Gum Flat, west of Inverell in New South Wales. Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, who worked in a pharmacy.[2] Her creativity was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, who went on to become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study.[3] As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, \"Darling, your father and I are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed.\"[4] A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years.[5]",
