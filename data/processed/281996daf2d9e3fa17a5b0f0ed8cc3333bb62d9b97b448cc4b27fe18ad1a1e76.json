				"previous": "The recession forced Jet Airways to discontinue the following routes: AhmedabadâLondon, Birmingham-Brussels, AmritsarâLondon, BangaloreâBrussels, MumbaiâShanghaiâSan Francisco and Brussels-New York JFK.[43] It also had to put an indefinite delay on its expansion plans. Jet Airways was forced to lease out seven of its ten Boeing 777-300ERs to survive the financial crunch. Due to the recession all flights to North America were operated on an Airbus A330 replacing the Boeing 777-300ERs. It also had to sell a brand-new, yet-to-be-delivered Boeing 777-300ER in 2009 and had to defer all new aircraft deliveries by at least two years. The airline planned to restore the Mumbai-Shanghai route by the end of 2011 but never went through with it.[44] As the economic crisis in the eurozone countries worsened, Jet also closed the Delhi-Milan route.[45] Jet Airways relaunched service to New York's JFK International Airport and San Francisco via Abu Dhabi on May 1, 2014, and November 18, 2014, respectively, using its joint venture relationship with Etihad Airways.[46]",
				"after": "Also, Jet Airways will introduce the Mumbai-Paris route using the Airbus A330 aircraft from Mid May 2014 - a mid-day departure from Mumbai to reach evening in Paris CDG and Leaving CDG Paris in night arriving next morning in Mumbai similar to Air India's schedule on Delhi-Paris route.",
