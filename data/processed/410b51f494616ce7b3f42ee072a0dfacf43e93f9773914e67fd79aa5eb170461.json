				"previous": "An estimated 300 species of birds are found in the forest at least part of the year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainsonâs hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common.[51] Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrowâs goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported.[51] pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.[53]",
				"after": "Fish found in Shoshone National Forest include at least six species and subspecies of trout including rainbow, brook and brown trout. The Yellowstone cutthroat trout is widespread throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, but in the forest is mostly limited to the Shoshone River.[57][58] The mountain whitefish is also found in the Shoshone River, while the burbot is found in two streams in the southern regions of the forest.[57]",
