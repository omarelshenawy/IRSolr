However, the slower an airplane goes, the more angle of attack it needs to produce lift equal to the aircraft's weight.[14] As the speed slows further, at some point this angle will be equal to the critical (stall) angle of attack. This speed is called the \"stall speed\". An aircraft flying at its stall speed cannot climb, and an aircraft flying below its stall speed cannot stop descending. Any attempt to do so by increasing angle of attack, without first increasing airspeed, will result in a stall.",
