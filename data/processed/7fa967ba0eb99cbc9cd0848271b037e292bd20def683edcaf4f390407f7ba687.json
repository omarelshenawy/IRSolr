				"previous": "Resistance welding was also developed during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed.[12] At first, oxyfuel welding was one of the more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as metal coverings (known as flux) for the electrode that stabilize the arc and shield the base material from impurities continued to be developed.[13]",
				"after": "World War I caused a major surge in the use of welding processes, with the various military powers attempting to determine which of the several new welding processes would be best. The British primarily used arc welding, even constructing a ship, the \"Fullagar\" with an entirely welded hull.[14][15] Arc welding was first applied to aircraft during the war as well, as some German airplane fuselages were constructed using the process.[16] Also noteworthy is the first welded road bridge in the world, the Maurzyce Bridge designed by Stefan BryÅa of the LwÃ³w University of Technology in 1927, and built across the river SÅudwia near Åowicz, Poland in 1928.[17]",
