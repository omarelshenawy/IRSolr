				"after": "Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, \"I don't use the piano in composition â that would limit me terribly\". Sullivan explained that his process not to wait for inspiration, but \"to dig for it. ... I decide on [the rhythm] before I come to the question of melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation.\"[202] Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was \"vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis\", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve \"the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own.\"[203]",
