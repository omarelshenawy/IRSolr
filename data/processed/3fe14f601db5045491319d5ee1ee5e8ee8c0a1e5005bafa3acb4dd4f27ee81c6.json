				"after": "In 1905, Du Bois and several other African-American civil rights activistsÂ â including Fredrick L. McGhee, Jesse Max Barber and William Monroe TrotterÂ â met in Canada, near Niagara Falls.[55] There they wrote a declaration of principles opposing the Atlanta Compromise, and incorporated as the Niagara Movement in 1906.[56] Du Bois and the other \"Niagarites\" wanted to publicize their ideals to other African Americans, but most black periodicals were owned by publishers sympathetic to Washington. Du Bois bought a printing press and started publishing Moon Illustrated Weekly in December 1905.[56] It was the first African-American illustrated weekly, and Du Bois used it to attack Washington's positions, but the magazine lasted only for about eight months.[57] Du Bois soon founded and edited another vehicle for his polemics, The Horizon: A Journal of the Color Line, which debuted in 1907.[58]",
