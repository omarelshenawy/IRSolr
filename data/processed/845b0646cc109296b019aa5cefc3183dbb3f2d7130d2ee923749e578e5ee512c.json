				"previous": "A decimal-based unit of length, the universal measure or standard was proposed in an essay of 1668 by the English cleric and philosopher John Wilkins.[2] In 1670 Gabriel Mouton, Bishop of Lyon, also suggested a universal length standard with decimal multiples and divisions, to be based on a one-minute angle of the Earth's meridian arc or (as the Earth's circumference was not easy to measure) on a pendulum with a one-second period. In 1675, the Italian scientist Tito Livio Burattini, in his work Misura Universale, used the phrase metro cattolico (lit. \"catholic [i.e., universal] measure\"), derived from the Greek Î¼Î­ÏÏÎ¿Î½ ÎºÎ±Î¸Î¿Î»Î¹ÎºÏÎ½ (mÃ©tron katholikÃ³n), to denote the standard unit of length derived from a pendulum.[3] In the wake of the French Revolution, a commission organised by the French Academy of Sciences and charged with determining a single scale for all measures, advised the adoption of a decimal system (27 October 1790) and suggested a basic unit of length equal to one ten-millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the Equator,[4] to be called mÃ¨tre (\"measure\") (19 March 1791).[5][6][7] The National Convention adopted the proposal in 1793. The first occurrence of metre in this sense in English dates to 1797.[8]",
