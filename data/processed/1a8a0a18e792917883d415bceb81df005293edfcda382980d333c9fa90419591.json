A state is an organized political community occupying a definite territory, having an organized government, and possessing internal and external sovereignty. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by Max Weber, \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.\"[205]",
