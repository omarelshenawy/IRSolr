				"after": "As part of the run-up to the Navy football game, the Corps of Cadets plays the Goat-Engineer game.[217] First played in 1907, it is a game between the \"Goats\" (the bottom half of the senior (Firstie) class academically), and the \"Engineers\" (the top half). The game is played with full pads and helmets using eight-man football rules. The location has changed over the years, with recent venues being Shea Stadium, Michie Stadium, and Daly Field. Legend states that Army will beat Navy if the goats win, and the opposite if the engineers win.[217] In recent years, female cadets have begun playing a flag football contest, so there are now two Goat-Engineer games, played back to back the same night.[218]",
