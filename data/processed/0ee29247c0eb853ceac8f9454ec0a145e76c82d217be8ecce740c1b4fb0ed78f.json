				"after": "John Milton Hay was born in Salem, Indiana, on October 8, 1838.[1] He was the third son of Dr. Charles Hay and the former Helen Leonard. Charles Hay, born in Lexington, Kentucky, hated slavery, and moved to the North in the early 1830s. A doctor, he practiced in Salem and married there in 1831.[2] Helen's father, David Leonard, had moved his family west from Assonet, Massachusetts, in 1818, but died en route to Vincennes, Indiana, and Helen relocated to Salem in 1830 to teach school. Charles was not successful in Salem, and moved, with his wife and children, to Warsaw, Illinois, in 1841.[3]",
