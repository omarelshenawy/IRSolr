After 335 hours of test flying, restricted certification was awarded in October 1995,[2] and the A300-600ST \"Beluga\" entered service. Four more Belugas were constructed, at a rate of roughly one per year, and all five remain in regular service. Their primary task is to carry Airbus components ready for final assembly across Europe between Toulouse, Hamburg and nine other sites, and they do so 60 times per week.[3]",
