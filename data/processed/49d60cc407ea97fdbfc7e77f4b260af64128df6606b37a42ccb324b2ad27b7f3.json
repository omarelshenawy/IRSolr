According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehiclesâin conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasureâcould reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades.[54] This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular needâa bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.[55][56]",
