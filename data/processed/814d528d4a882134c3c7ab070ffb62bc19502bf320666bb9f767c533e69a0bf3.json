				"after": "The A350 features new composite wings with a wingspan that is common to the three proposed variants.[106] With an area of 443Â m2 (4,770Â sqÂ ft)[107] the A350 features the largest wing of a single-deck widebody aircraft in production;[95] this is to be surpassed by the in-development Boeing 777X which is planned to have a wing area of 466.8Â m2 (5,025Â sqÂ ft).[108] The wingspan of 64.8Â m (213Â ft)[107] is 4.5Â m (15Â ft) greater than that of the A330. This is the same span as that of the longer-range variants of the Boeing 777, which have slightly less area.[109] The A350's new wing has a 31.9Â° sweep angle,[107] helping to increase typical cruise speed to MachÂ 0.85 and maximum operating speed to MachÂ 0.89. The A350-1000 have a wing design with about a 4% increase in surface area.",
