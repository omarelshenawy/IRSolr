				"after": "The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolings, or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name \"Carolingian\" (Medieval Latin karolingi, an altered form of an unattested Old High German *karling, kerling, meaning \"descendant of Charles\", cf. MHG kerlinc)[1] derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: Carolus.[2] The family consolidated its power in the late 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and dux et princeps Francorum hereditary and becoming the de facto rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne.",
