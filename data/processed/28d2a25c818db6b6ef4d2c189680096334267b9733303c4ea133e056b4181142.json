				"In mathematics, an algebraic number is a number that is a root of a finite,[1] non-zero polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients (or equivalently â by clearing denominators â with integer coefficients). Numbers such as Ï that are not algebraic are said to be transcendental. Almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental. (Here \"almost all\" has the sense \"all but a countable set\"; see Properties.)"
