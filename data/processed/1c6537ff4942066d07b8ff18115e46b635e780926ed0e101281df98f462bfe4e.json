				"previous": "Delayed delivery was announced by Dmitry Rogozin - vice-premier of Russian Government in charge of defense industry - on February 10, 2012, with first flights planned 2015-2016 and delivery planned 2020.[20] This was soon corrected as the first delivery remains scheduled in 2017.[21]",
				"after": "The baseline MC-21-300 is designed around 180 passengers in single-class configuration and will be followed by a 153-seat -200 with basic and extended-range models, plus a very-long-range MC-21-200LR. A larger 212-seat -400 version is taken under consideration. Initially, a smaller variant, MC-21-100, with a capacity of up to 132 passengers, was also proposed, but, in order to avoid competition with the Sukhoi Superjet 130, it was cancelled.[22] Cargo and business variants are also being considered.[1]",
