				"after": "The Julio-Claudians continued to rule Rome after Augustus' death and they remained in power until the death of Nero in 68Â AD.[75] Augustus' favorites for succeeding him were already dead in his senescence: his nephew Marcellus died in 23Â BC, his friend and military commander Agrippa in 12Â BC and his grandson Gaius Caesar in 4Â AD. Influenced by his wife, Livia Drusilla, Augustus appointed Tiberius, her son from another marriage, as his heir.[76]",
