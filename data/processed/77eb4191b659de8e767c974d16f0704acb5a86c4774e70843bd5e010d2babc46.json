				"previous": "World War II was a major earner for Douglas. The company produced almost 30,000 aircraft from 1942 to 1945 and the workforce swelled to 160,000. Both companies suffered at the end of hostilities, facing an end of government orders and a surplus of aircraft.",
				"after": "After the war Douglas continued to develop new aircraft, including the DC-6 in 1946 and the DC-7 in 1953.[6][7] The company moved into jet propulsion, producing its first for the military â the conventional F3D Skyknight in 1948 and then the more 'jet age' F4D Skyray in 1951.[8] In 1955, Douglas introduced the first attack jet of the United States Navy with the A4D Skyhawk.[9] Designed to operate from the decks of the World War II Essex class aircraft carriers, the Skyhawk was small, reliable, and tough. Variants of it continued in use in the Navy for almost 50 years,[10] finally serving in large numbers in a two-seat version as a jet trainer.[11]",
