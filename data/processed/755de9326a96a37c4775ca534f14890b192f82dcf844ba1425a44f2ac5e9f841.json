				"previous": "Hong Kong International Airport is a leading air passenger gateway and logistics hub in Asia and one of the world's busiest airports in terms of international passenger and cargo movement, serving more than 47Â million passengers and handling 3.74Â million tonnes (4.12Â million tons) of cargo in 2007.[169] It replaced the overcrowded Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon in 1998, and has been rated as the world's best airport in a number of surveys.[170] Over 85 airlines operate at the two-terminal airport and it is the primary hub of Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, Air Hong Kong, Hong Kong Airlines, and Hong Kong Express.[169][171]",
				"after": "The territory's population in 2011 is 7.07 million, with an average annual growth rate of 0.6% over the previous 5 years.[5] Residents from mainland China do not have the right of abode in Hong Kong, nor are they allowed to enter the territory freely.[89] However, the influx of immigrants from mainland China, approximating 45,000 per year, is a significant contributor to its population growth â a daily quota of 150 Mainland Chinese with family ties in Hong Kong are granted a \"one way permit\".[172] Life expectancy in Hong Kong is 79.16 years for males and 84.79 years for females as of 2009, making it one of the highest life expectancies in the world.[3]",
