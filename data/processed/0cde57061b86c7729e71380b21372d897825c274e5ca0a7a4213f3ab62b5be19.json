				"previous": "The armored cruisers built in the midâ to lateâ1890s were often as large and expensive as pre-dreadnought battleships. They combined long range, high speed and an armament approaching that of battleship with enough armor to protect them against quick-firing guns, considered the most important weapons afloat at the time. Their speed was made possible due to another development, Case-hardened steel armorâfirst Harvey armor and then crucially Krupp armor. The higher tensile strength of these armors compared to nickel steel and mild steel made it feasible to put a light yet useful armor belt on a large cruiser. They saved further weight by not requiring a heavy timber backing, as previous armor plating had, to soften and spread the force of the impact from oncoming shells; 2.5 inches (64Â mm) of teak to give a fair surface upon which to attach them was all that was needed. Moreover, this belt could also be much wider than previously, covering the center of the hull, where the ammunition and engines were located, from the main deck to five feet below the waterline. Steel bulkheads added strength to the hull, while armor as thick as the belt covered the guns and heavier protection surrounded the conning tower. With these improvements, the ships became more fully protected than was possible previously. They were also expensive to maintain at fighting strength as they required a greater number of stokers to feed the boilers than a battleship when steaming at flank speed.[18]",
				"after": "The ideas presented by Mahan prompted French Admiral Ernest FranÃ§ois Fournier to write his book La flotte necessaire in 1896. Fournier argued that a fleet of technologically advanced armored cruisers and torpedo craft would be powerful and flexible enough to engage in a wide range of activity and overwhelm potential enemies. French naval and government circles embraced this ideal mutually and even advocates of battleships over cruisers admitted the latter's potential usefulness in scouting and commercial warfare. The result was the building of increasingly large armored cruisers. The Jeanne d'Arc, laid down in 1896, displaced 11,000 tons, carried a mixed armament of 7.6-inch (193Â mm) and 5.5-inch (140Â mm) guns, and had a 6-inch (152Â mm) belt of Harvey armour over her machinery spaces. The 12,300-ton LÃ©on GambettaÂ class and 14,000-ton Edgar QuinetÂ class followed. With a speed of 22.5 knots, the LÃ©on Gambettas were armed with four 7.6-inch (193Â mm) guns in twin turrets and 16 6.5-inch (165Â mm) in four single and six twin turrets and were protected by up to six inches (150Â mm) of Krupp belt armor and nearly eight inches (200Â mm) on their conning towers and turrets. The Edgar Quinets, slightly faster at 23 knots, were armed with 14 7.74-inch (194Â mm) guns and carried up to 6.7 inches (170Â mm) of armor on their belts, almost four inches (99Â mm) on their decks and six inches (150Â mm) on their turrets.[19]",
