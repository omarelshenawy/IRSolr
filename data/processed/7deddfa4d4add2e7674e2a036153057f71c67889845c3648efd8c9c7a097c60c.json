				"after": "Simon Bradstreet (baptised 18 March 1603/4 â 27 March 1697) was a colonial magistrate, businessman, diplomat, and the last governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Arriving in Massachusetts on the Winthrop Fleet in 1630, Bradstreet was almost constantly involved in the politics of the colony, but only became its governor in 1679. He served on diplomatic missions and as agent to the crown in London, and also served as a commissioner to the New England Confederation. He was politically comparatively moderate, arguing minority positions in favour of freedom of speech and for accommodation of the demands of King Charles II following his restoration to the throne.",
