				"previous": "The city is also a landing point on three fiber optic cable systems linking the United States across the Pacific Ocean: C2C, Southern Cross Cable, and VSNL Transpacific. These cable landings, lower energy costs, and tax breaks led to a boom of data centers being built starting about 2010.[86] Data centers include those for Adobe, NetApp, Umpqua Bank, OHSU, and Fortune Data Centers.[86]",
				"after": "Hillsboro serves as the corporate headquarters for Rodgers Instruments, Soloflex, Norm Thompson Outfitters, Eid Passport, and Parr Lumber, among others. Fujitsu and NEC Corporation formerly had factories in Hillsboro.[87]",
