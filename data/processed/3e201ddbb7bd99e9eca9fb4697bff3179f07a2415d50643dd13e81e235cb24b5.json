				"after": "Carnotaurus was the first theropod dinosaur discovered with comprehensive fossil skin impressions.[18] These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw,[18] the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage.[Z] The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail.[AA] Originally, the right side of the skull also was covered with large patches of skinâthis was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the right side of the skull is very different from that of the left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.[18]",
