				"after": "The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray and Dave Davies in 1964. Categorized in the United States as a British Invasion band, The Kinks are recognized as one of the most important and influential rock acts of the era. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk, and country. The group initially consisted of Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals), Pete Quaife (bass guitar, backup vocals), and Mick Avory (drums and percussion). The Davies brothers were the only permanent members, with several personnel changes occurring throughout the band's 32 year run. Avory left in 1984, the result of a dispute with Dave Davies, and was replaced on drums by Bob Henrit. John Dalton played bass for part of 1966 after Quaife was injured in a car accident, and joined as a full-time member when Quaife left to set up his own band in 1969. Dalton remained until the late 1970s, when he was replaced by Jim Rodford. The Kinks were accompanied by various keyboardists, most notably Nicky Hopkins (for studio sessions only), from 1965 to 1968, and John Gosling, from 1970 to 1978.",
