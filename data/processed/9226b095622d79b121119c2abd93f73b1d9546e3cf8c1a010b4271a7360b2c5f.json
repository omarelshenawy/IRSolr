When inflated, it could carry two men, operating a paddle on each side, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket to allow the users to camp on wet ground.[11] The Admiralty was sceptical about potential uses for Halkett's designs; on 8Â May 1845 Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that \"My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service\".[10]",
