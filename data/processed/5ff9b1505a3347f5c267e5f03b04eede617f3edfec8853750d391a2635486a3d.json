				"previous": "Unlike the small diameter fans used in turbofan jet engines, the main rotor on a helicopter has a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air. This permits a lower downwash velocity for a given amount of thrust. As it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree,[13][14] a low disc loading (thrust per disc area) greatly increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use and permits reasonable range.[15][16] The hover efficiency (\"figure of merit\") of a typical helicopter is around 60%.[17] The inner third length of a rotor blade contributes very little to lift due to its low airspeed.[14]",
