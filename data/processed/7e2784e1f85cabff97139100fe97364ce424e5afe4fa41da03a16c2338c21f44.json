				"after": "In an effort to stop Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ's Serbian-led crackdown on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23Â September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. Negotiations under UN Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23Â March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24Â March 1999.[70] Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.[71]",
