It was raised by Ãorsteinn in memory of his father Sveinn and his brother ÃÃ³rir, both of whom went to Greece, and lastly in memory of his mother. The stone is signed by the runemaster Ãpir whose Old Norse is notable for its unorthodox use of the haglaz rune (á¼), as in hut for Old Norse Ãºt (\"out\").[38] The erratic use of the h-phoneme is a dialect trait that has survived and is still characteristic for the modern Swedish dialect of Roslagen, one of the regions where Ãpir was active.[38]",
