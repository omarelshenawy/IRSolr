				"after": "The engine was first produced in 1927 at 450Â hp (340Â kW), which soon improved in the IB version to 525Â hp (390Â kW). This variant saw widespread use in the Hawker Hart family that was the mainstay of British air power during the early 1930s. However it was not long before power output was increased dramatically; the V model provided 695Â hp (520Â kW) at 3,000 rpm with no basic change to the design, while the XVI used in the Miles Master delivered 670Â hp (500Â kW).",
