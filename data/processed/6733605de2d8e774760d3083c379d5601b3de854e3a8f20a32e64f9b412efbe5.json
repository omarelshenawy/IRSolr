				"previous": "The drama program begins engaging students in acting and dramatic writing, directing, and the technical arts in the fourth group. Students practice both rehearsed and improvised performances to create pantomimes, monologues, films, and short plays. Their theatrical work culminates in the eighth group with the performance of one-act plays the students write and direct themselves and the production of a professionally scripted full-length play. Artistically inclined students can extend their arts studies outside of class in optional activities including Art Club, Chorus, Orchestra, Tech Club, Drama Club, and the Variety Show.[88]",
				"after": "Avery Coonley teaches eight core values: appreciation of the individual, civility, gratitude, honesty, kindness and consideration, responsibility, and volunteerism. These ideals are part of the character development program as \"building blocks\", which are reinforced daily on the campus and in the family through literature selections sent home for parent participation.[88]",
