				"after": "After dinner on 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green until about 11Â pm, when the prince suggested a game of baccarat.[9][32] Although the Wilsons did not have a suitably-sized table, Stanley Wilson improvised, putting two card tables alongside the smoking room tableâall of which were of differing sizesâand covered them with a tapestry cloth.[33] Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming. Sitting next to the last-named was Stanley Wilson, who was on Levett's left.[4][d]",
