				"previous": "The following is a simplified classification of dinosaur groups based on their evolutionary relationships, and organized based on the list of Mesozoic dinosaur species provided by Holtz (2008).[2] A more detailed version can be found at Dinosaur classification. The dagger (â ) is used to signify groups with no living members.",
				"after": "Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues.[52][53] Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics; dinosaur mass, speed and blood flow), chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline).[54][55] Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.[56]",
