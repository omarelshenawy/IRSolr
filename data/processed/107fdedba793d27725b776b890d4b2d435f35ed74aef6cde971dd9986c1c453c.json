				"Malta was ruled by a Spanish Aragonese dynasty from 1282 to 1409.[62]",
				"Relatives of the kings of Aragon ruled the island until 1409, when it formally passed to the Crown of Aragon. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchy received the title, \"Count of Malta\". During this time much of the local nobility was created. However, by 1397 the bearing of the title \"Count of Malta\" reverted to a feudal basis with two families fighting over the distinction, which caused some conflict. This led the king to abolish the title. Dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the Maltese, led by the local nobility, rose up against Count Gonsalvo Monroy.[28] Although they opposed the Count, the Maltese voiced their loyalty to the Sicilian Crown, which so impressed Alfonso V of Aragon that he did not punish the people for their rebellion. Instead, he promised never to grant the title to a third party, and incorporated it back into the crown. The city of Mdina was given the title of CittÃ  Notabile as a result of this sequence of events.[28]"
