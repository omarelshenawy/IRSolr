One study counted a total of 193Â signs and 30Â drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism.[63] As a whole, the epigraphy of the Round Church dates from the 10th century,[50] and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, as well as two languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic).[20] The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.[47]",
