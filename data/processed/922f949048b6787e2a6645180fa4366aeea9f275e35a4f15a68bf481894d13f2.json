				"after": "On March 12, 1989, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to the management at CERN that referenced ENQUIRE, a database and software project he had built in 1980, and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: \"Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse.\" Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to propose the term hypermedia.[8]",
