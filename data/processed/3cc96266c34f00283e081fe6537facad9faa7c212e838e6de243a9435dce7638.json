				"previous": "In a separate legal development, Donald Trump was sued by former Chicago Sun-Times publisher F. David Radler and his daughters in February 2008 for rescinding all \"friends and family\" condominium purchases, including Radler's.[80][81] As president of the Sun-Times' holding company, Radler had negotiated the sale of the paper's headquarters building to Trump's consortium. The price of Radler's condo had been discounted by 10%, and only a 5% deposit was required instead of the standard 15%.[80] Radler and family were part of a group of 40 insiders who were able to purchase property at about $500 per square foot ($5,400/m2). When the market value of the property eventually rose to over $1,300 per square foot ($14,000/m2), Trump nullified the \"friends and family\" sales.[82] The insiders were involved in the planning and designing of the building.[83] In January 2007, Trump cited both a clause about \"matters beyond [the] seller's reasonable control\" and the desire to \"have more income to handle potentially higher construction costs\".[83] Despite Trump's concerns about higher construction costs, earlier in the same month, Ivanka Trump, his daughter and an executive of the company, had stated that the construction was $50Â million under budget.[84] In addition to the Radler suit over the validity of the \"friends and family\" discount contracts, a group of four owners sued over revisions to the closing terms, which placed limits on the owner occupancy of condo hotel units and excluded the meeting rooms and ballrooms from the common elements of which the owners have an interest.[85]",
				"after": "In an additional legal issue, on February 8, 2005, Trump had closed on a construction loan of $640 million from Deutsche Bank for the project.[86] He also obtained a $130â135 million junior mezzanine loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investment Group.[87][88] As part of these contracts, Trump had included a $40 million personal guarantee.[89] The contracts also mandated partial repayments for each closed unit sale, and minimum sale prices.[87] In September 2008, due to slow unit sales, Trump sought to extend both loans until mid-2009 because he felt that it was necessary in the business environment and expected from the outset of the contract.[90] On November 10, Deutsche Bank demanded the outstanding loan payment and the $40 million guarantee.[89] Trump filed suit later that month against Deutsche Bank in New York State Supreme Court in an effort to excuse a repayment of more than $330 million that had been due November 7, and to extend the construction loan for an unspecified period of time because of extenuating circumstances arising from the financial crisis of 2007â2010.[89] Trump cited a \"force majeure\" clause that allowed the borrower to delay completion of the project under a catch-all section covering \"any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower\".[87] Trump not only sought an extension, but sought damages of $3 billion from the bank for its use of predatory lending practices to undermine the project and damage his reputation, which he claimed \"is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations.\"[87] At the end of November, Deutsche Bank countersued Trump to force him to uphold his personal payment guarantee from February 2005, after he failed to repay the amount due November 7âa date that already had been extended.[89] The suits did not interfere with Trump's ability to continue drawing on the credit line provided by Deutsche Bank, because without the project's continued financing, Deutsche Bank may have had to assume the role of developer.[89][91] In March 2009, both parties agreed to suspend litigation and resolve the disagreement amicably in an effort to help the project to succeed.[92] In September 2010, an amended loan agreement stopped the litigation and extended the term on an approximately $600 million construction loan for five years.[93]",
