				"after": "Four major eras in commercial airframe production stand out: all-aluminum structures beginning in the 1920s and directly inspired by Hugo Junkers all-metal designs from as far back as 1915, high-strength alloys and high-speed airfoils beginning in the 1940s, long-range designs and improved efficiencies beginning in the 1960s, and composite material construction beginning in the 1980s, partly pioneered by Burt Rutan's designs. In the latest era, Boeing has claimed a lead, designing its new 787 jetliner with a one-piece carbon-fiber fuselage, said to replace \"1,200 sheets of aluminum and 40,000 rivets.\"[6] The Airbus A380 is also built with a large proportion of composite material. Cirrus Aircraft's SR20 design, certified in 1998, was the first general aviation aircraft manufactured with all-composite construction, followed by several other light aircraft in the 2000s.[7]",
