				"previous": "Emerson's first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with Timberline Knives in 1993 for his SPECWAR model.[35] According to Stephen Dick, the editor of Tactical Knives, this collaboration was a result of \"the Navy deciding that only commercial designs would be considered due to failure of a previous custom knifemaker to deliver enough models to satisfy the need\".[35] This model featured a one-side chisel-ground tantÅ blade almost 1/4Â inch (6.35Â mm) thick. Its handle was made from fiberglass-reinforced nylon molded around a near-full tang. Vaughn Neeley of Timberline designed the sheath.[36] The knife was originally a custom piece designed for Naval Special Warfare Group One, and this factory version was soon entered in the trials for the Navy SEALs knife in 1995.[35] Although it was not chosen by the Navy, Stephen Dick reported that a number of members of SEAL Team One privately purchased the knife and were disappointed it was not made the official blade.[35] The Emerson-Neeley SPECWAR knife won Blade Magazineââ'âs 1995 American Made Knife of the Year Award[14] at the magazine's Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia, and that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art in New York City from May 24 to August 15, 1995.[37]",
				"after": "In 1994 the president of Benchmade Knives, Les DeAsis, approached Emerson to manufacture the CQC-6 on a larger scale as a factory production model.[14] Preferring to keep the CQC-6 as a custom-only knife, Emerson instead licensed a similar design of his, the CQC-7.[38][39]",
