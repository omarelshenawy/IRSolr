				"previous": "In 1987, yttrium barium copper oxide was found to achieve high-temperature superconductivity.[36] It was only the second material known to exhibit this property,[36] and it was the first known material to achieve superconductivity above the (economically important) boiling point of nitrogen.[note 7]",
				"after": "Yttrium is found in most rare earth minerals,[8] as well as some uranium ores, but is never found in nature as a free element.[37] About 31Â ppm of the Earth's crust is yttrium,[5] making it the 28th most abundant element there, and 400 times more common than silver.[38] Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150Â ppm (dry weight average of 23Â ppm) and in sea water at 9Â ppt.[38] Lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project have a relatively high content of yttrium.[32]",
