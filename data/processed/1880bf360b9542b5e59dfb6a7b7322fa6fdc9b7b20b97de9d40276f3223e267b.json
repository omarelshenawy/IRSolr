				"after": "After William McKinley won the 1896 U.S. presidential election, Hawaii's annexation was again discussed. The previous president, Grover Cleveland, was a friend of Queen LiliÊ»uokalani. McKinley was open to persuasion by U.S. expansionists and by annexationists from HawaiÊ»i. He met with three annexationists: Lorrin A. Thurston, Francis March Hatch and William Ansel Kinney. After negotiations in June 1897, Secretary of State John Sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii.[75] The U.S. Senate never ratified the treaty. Despite the opposition of most native Hawaiians,[76] the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the U.S.; it became the Territory of Hawaii. The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House on June 15, 1898 by 209 votes in favor to 91 against, and by the Senate on July 6, 1898 by a vote of 42 to 21.[citation needed]",
