				"previous": "Fore River Shipyard has also appeared in multiple films since it was closed. The final scene from the 2005 film The Departed was filmed in the yard.[43] In 2009, the film The Company Men was filmed at the site of the former yard.[44][43] For the 2015 film The Finest Hours, sets are being constructed at the yard, along with a giant water tank.[45]",
				"after": "During the almost one hundred years that the yard was operational, it produced hundreds of ships, submarines, and personal sailing vessels. Among these orders were the civilian ships the Barnacle and the multiple-masted schooners the Thomas W. Lawson and William L. Douglas. The yard also produced military contracts, including USSÂ LawrenceÂ (DD-8) and USSÂ MacdonoughÂ (DD-9). Additionally, submarines were constructed, including USSÂ OctopusÂ (SS-9) for the United States Navy, and others for both the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Royal Navy. As the yard was expanded over the years, it built battleships such as USSÂ New JerseyÂ (BB-16), USSÂ NevadaÂ (BB-36), and the preserved USSÂ MassachusettsÂ (BB-59), itself moored in Battleship Cove. Other naval ships include the preserved heavy cruiser USSÂ SalemÂ (CA-139) (as part of the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum adjacent to the shipyard), USSÂ NorthamptonÂ (CLC-1), and USSÂ Long BeachÂ (CGN-9). Finally, the yard constructed multiple aircraft carriers, including the conversion of the battlecruiser USS Lexington CC-1''s hull into USSÂ LexingtonÂ (CV-2), USSÂ LexingtonÂ (CV-16), USSÂ Bunker HillÂ (CV-17), and USSÂ Philippine SeaÂ (CV-47).[1]",
