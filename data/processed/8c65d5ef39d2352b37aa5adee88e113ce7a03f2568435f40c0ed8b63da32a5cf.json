				"previous": "Following the rise of classical genetics, many biologistsâincluding a new wave of physical scientists in biologyâpursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaverâhead of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundationâissued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.[65]",
				"after": "Like biochemistry, the overlapping disciplines of bacteriology and virology (later combined as microbiology), situated between science and medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century. FÃ©lix d'Herelle's isolation of bacteriophage during World War I initiated a long line of research focused on phage viruses and the bacteria they infect.[66]",
