John Wallis is often credited for introducing the symbol for infinity (modern â), and one conjecture is that he based it on this usage, since 1,000 was hyperbolically used to represent very large numbers. Similarly, |ÆÆ for 5,000 was reduced to â; CC|ÆÆ for 10,000 to â; |ÆÆÆ for 50,000 to â; and CCC|ÆÆÆ for 100,000 to â.",
