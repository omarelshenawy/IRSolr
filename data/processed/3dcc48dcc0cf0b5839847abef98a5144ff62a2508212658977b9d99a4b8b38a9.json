				"previous": "Interstate Highways have the highest speed limits and the highest traffic. Interstates are numbered in a grid: even-numbered routes for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico), and odd-numbered routes are northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean). Three-digit Interstates are, generally, either beltways or spurs of their parent Interstates (for example, InterstateÂ 510 is a spur into the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, and is connected to InterstateÂ 10).",
				"after": "U.S. Numbered Highways are the original interstate highways, dating back to 1926. U.S. Highways are also numbered in a grid: even numbered for eastâwest routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for northâsouth routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). Three-digit highways, also known as \"child routes,\" are branches off their main one- or two-digit \"parents\" (for example, U.S. RouteÂ 202 is a branch of U.S. Route 2). However, USÂ 101, rather than a \"child\" of USÂ 1, is considered a \"mainline\" U.S. Route.",
