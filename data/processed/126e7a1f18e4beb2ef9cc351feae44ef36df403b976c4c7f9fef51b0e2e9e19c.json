				"after": "Birmingham has played an important part in the history of sport. The Football League â the world's first league football competition â was founded by Birmingham resident and Aston Villa director William McGregor, who wrote to fellow club directors in 1888 proposing \"that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season\".[268] The modern game of tennis was developed between 1859 and 1865 by Harry Gem and his friend Augurio Perera at Perera's house in Edgbaston,[269] with the Edgbaston Archery and Lawn Tennis Society remaining the oldest tennis club in the world.[270] The Birmingham and District Cricket League is the oldest cricket league in the world,[271] and Birmingham was the host for the first ever Cricket World Cup, a Women's Cricket World Cup in 1973.[272] Birmingham was the first city to be named National City of Sport by the Sports Council.[273] Birmingham was selected ahead of London and Manchester to bid for the 1992 Summer Olympics,[274] but was unsuccessful in the final selection process, which was won by Barcelona.[275]",
