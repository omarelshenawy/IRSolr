				"previous": "In the following years, the name \"Boulder Dam\" failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names interchangeably and mapmakers divided as to which name should be printed. Memories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name to \"Hoover Dam\". Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, \"I didn't know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with.\"[112]",
