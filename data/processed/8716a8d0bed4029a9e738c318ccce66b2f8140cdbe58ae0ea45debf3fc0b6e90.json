				"after": "...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released in 1988 by Elektra Records, and the first to feature bassist Jason Newsted after the death of Cliff Burton in 1986. The album is musically progressive, with long and complex songs and fast tempos. Producer Flemming Rasmussen was absent during the mixing process, and the production has been criticized as \"dry\". The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice seen through the prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship. The album's front cover features a representation of Lady Justice; the phrase \"...And Justice for All\" appears spray-painted in the lower right corner. Originally released on one vinyl disc, the album was quickly re-released as a double album without additional tracks. The album was included in The Village Voiceââ'âs annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll of the year's best albums, and the single \"One\" earned Metallica its first Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1990. The group's best-selling album at the time and second best-selling ever, it was the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the US, shipping eight million copies by 2003.
