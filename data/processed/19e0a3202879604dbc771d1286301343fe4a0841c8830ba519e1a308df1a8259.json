				"after": "The architectural writer Geoffrey Tyack has written that Nuffield College was Oxford's \"most important architectural project of the immediate post-war years\".[43] Opinions about the architecture merits of the college have varied, although most have been unfavourable. The authors of a 1961 booklet on the architecture of modern Oxford said that it was \"Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction\".[4] The Cotswold style was \"taken absurdly out of context and mercilessly stretched\", and did not \"harmonise with the clumsy tower\", whilst the spire \"[perched] uneasilyÂ ... despite its elaborate base\".[4] An unnamed journalist wrote in The Times in 1959 that the main buildings of the quadrangles were \"somewhat oddly wedded to small basins which irresistibly suggest a Lilliputian Versailles\".[44] The same writer said that the tower rose \"Manhattan-wise for 10 storeys through the twentieth century, only to have a diminutive spire, escaped from the fifteenth, push through its top to steal the last laugh\".[44] Peter Sager, too, thought that the \"high-rise library\" could \"easily stand on the Hudson\".[17] Sir Howard Colvin said that the \"utilitarian function\" of the tower \"accorded ill with its original ornamental purpose\", and that the architects had \"failed to find a satisfactory solution\" to the \"repetitive uniformity of fenestration\".[27] Of the flÃ¨che, Colvin said that it \"makes its contribution to the Oxford skyline without any overt reference to historical precedent\".[27] Geoffrey Tyack also disliked the tower, describing it as \"an ungainly structure\" that was \"lit by a monotonous array of windows punched out of the wall surface\"; however, he thought the hall was \"an effective reinterpretation of the traditional collegiate pattern\".[5]",
