				"previous": "In Chicago, he founded the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which provided advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers.[11][20] In 1887, he established the weekly Saturday Blade, an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboysâan innovation at the time.[21][22] By 1892, the Saturday Blade had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States.[23] Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the Saturday Blade and were reprinted in books by Rand McNally.[24] The success of the Saturday Blade spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892 Boyce bought out the Chicago Ledger, a fiction weekly.[23] In January 1903 he founded the international Boyce's Weekly, which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor leaders such as John Mitchell and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for Boyce's Weekly.[25] Eight months later, Boyce's Weekly was consolidated with the Saturday Blade.[26] Boyce also established the newspapers Farm Business in 1914 and Home Folks Magazine in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the Blade and Ledger into the monthly Chicago Blade & Ledger, which was published until 1937.[1] As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him gain an understanding of America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money.[1][4][27] Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: \"There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. Help yourself and others will help you.\" and \"whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished\".[28]",
				"after": "In 1891, Boyce began working on his own 12-story office building at 30 North Dearborn, known as the Boyce Building, it was designed by Henry Ives Cobb. Even 20Â years later, this building was recognized as the most expensive building (in terms of dollars per cubic foot) in Chicago. In 1907, Boyce consolidated his business operations into another office building, also known as the Boyce Building, at 500â510 North Dearborn. A new four-story office buildingâdesigned by the architectural firm of Daniel Burnhamâwas built on this location in 1912 and expanded during 1913â14 with an additional six stories.[29] This building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 29, 1996.[4][30][31][32]",
