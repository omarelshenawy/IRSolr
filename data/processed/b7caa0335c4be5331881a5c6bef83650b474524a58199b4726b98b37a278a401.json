				"after": "The superb fairywren is common throughout most of the relatively wet and fertile south-eastern corner of the continent, from the south-east of South Australia (including Kangaroo Island and Adelaide) and the tip of the Eyre Peninsula, through all of Victoria, Tasmania, coastal and sub-coastal New South Wales and Queensland, through the Brisbane area and extending inland â north to the Dawson River and west to Blackall; it is a common bird in the suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.[27] It is found in wooded areas, generally with plenty of undergrowth, and has also adapted to urban existence and can be found in gardens and urban parks as long as there is an undergrowth of native plants nearby.[42] Lantana (Lantana camara), a prolific weed in Australia, has also been beneficial in providing shelter in disturbed areas,[27] as has the introduced and invasive blackberry (Rubus spp.)[43] Unlike other fairywrens, it appears to benefit from the urban environment and has out-competed the introduced house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in one study on the grounds of the Australian National University in Canberra.[44] Colonies of wrens can be found in Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney's urbanized centre.[45] It is not found in dense forest nor in alpine environments.[46] Forestry plantations of pine (Pinus spp.) and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.[47]",
