				"previous": "On 31 March 1924, Britain's four pioneer airlines that started up in the immediate post war periodâHandley Page Transport, British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd, Daimler Airways and Instone Air Line Ltdâjoined together to form Imperial Airways Limited,[4] developing routes throughout the British Empire to India, some parts of Africa and later to Canberra, Australia.[5] Meanwhile a number of smaller UK air transport companies had begun operating, and by 1935 many of these had merged to form the original privately owned British Airways Ltd.[6] Following a government review, Imperial Airways and British Airways were nationalised in November 1939 to form the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).[6][7][8]",
				"after": "Post-war, BOAC continued to operate the majority of long-haul services in Britain,[9] other than routes to South America; these were flown by British South American Airways, which was merged back into BOAC in 1949.[10] Continental European and domestic flights were flown by a new nationalised airline, British European Airways Corporation (BEA), which compulsorily took over the scheduled services of existing UK independent airlines.[5] On 2 May 1952, BOAC became the world's first airline to operate jet airliners; the inaugural flight with the de Havilland CometÂ 1 was from London to Johannesburg.[11][12] However, the Comet's service introduction was plagued by structural problems and accidents,[13][14] leading to its withdrawal in 1954 and replacement with the upgraded Comet 4 models in 1958.[6][15][16]",
