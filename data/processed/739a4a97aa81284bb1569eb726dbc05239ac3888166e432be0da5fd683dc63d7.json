				"previous": "Climate varies widely across the watershed. Mean monthly high temperatures are 25.3Â Â°C (77.5Â Â°F) in the upper basin and 33.4Â Â°C (92.1Â Â°F) in the lower basin, and lows average â3.6 and 8.9Â Â°C (25.5 and 48.0Â Â°F), respectively. Annual precipitation averages 6.5 inches (164Â mm), ranging from over 40 inches (1,000Â mm) in some areas of the Rockies to just 0.6 inches (15Â mm) along the Mexican reach of the river.[60] The upper basin generally receives snow and rain during the winter and early spring, while precipitation in the lower basin falls mainly during intense but infrequent summer thunderstorms brought on by the North American Monsoon.[85]",
				"after": "As of 2010, approximately 12.7Â million people lived in the Colorado River basin.[n 6] Phoenix in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed. Population densities are also high along the lower Colorado River below Davis Dam, which includes Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Yuma. Other significant population centers in the basin include Tucson, Arizona; St. George, Utah; and Grand Junction, Colorado. Colorado River basin states are among the fastest-growing in the U.S.; the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66Â percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40Â percent.[89]",
