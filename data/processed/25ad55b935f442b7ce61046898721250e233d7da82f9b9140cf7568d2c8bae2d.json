				"previous": "FlightÂ 93 fragmented violently upon impact. Most of the aircraft wreckage was found near the impact crater.[83] Investigators found some very light debris including paper and nylon scattered up to eight miles (13Â km) from the impact point in New Baltimore, Pennsylvania.[84] Other tiny aircraft fragments were found 1.5 miles (2.4Â km) away at Indian Lake, Pennsylvania.[85] All human remains were found within a 70-acre (28 ha) area surrounding the impact point.[85] Somerset County Coroner Wally Miller was involved in the investigation and identification of the remains. In examining the wreckage, the only human body part he could see was part of a backbone.[86] Miller later found and identified 1,500 pieces of human remains totaling about 600 pounds (272Â kg), or eight percent of the total.[87] The rest of the remains were consumed by the impact.[88] Investigators identified four victims by SeptemberÂ 22 and eleven by SeptemberÂ 24.[89][90] They identified another by SeptemberÂ 29.[91] Thirty-four passengers were identified by OctoberÂ 27.[92] All the people on board the flight were identified by December 21. Human remains were so fragmented that investigators could not determine whether any victims were dead before the plane crashed. Death certificates for the 40 victims listed the cause of death as homicide and listed the cause of death for the four hijackers as suicide.[93] The remains and personal effects of the victims were returned to the families.[94] The remains of the hijackers, identified by the process of elimination, were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as evidence.[95]",
				"after": "Investigators also found a knife concealed in a cigarette lighter.[96] They located the flight data recorder on SeptemberÂ 13 and the cockpit voice recorder the following day.[97][98] The voice recorder was found buried 25 feet (8Â m) below the crater. The FBI initially refused to release the voice recording, rejecting requests by Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher and family members of those on board.[99] The FBI subsequently allowed the relatives of the FlightÂ 93 victims to listen to the recording in a closed session on AprilÂ 18, 2002.[100] Jurors for the Zacarias Moussaoui trial heard the tape as part of the proceedings and the transcript was publicly released on AprilÂ 12, 2006.[101]",
