				"after": "The jaguar, a compact and well-muscled animal, is the largest cat in the New World and the largest carnivorous mammal in Central and South America.[27] Size and weight vary considerably: weights are normally in the range of 56â96Â kg (124â211 lb). Larger males have been recorded to weigh as much as 158Â kg (348Â lb)[28][21] (roughly matching a tigress or lioness), and the smallest females have low weights of 36Â kg (79Â lb).[21] Females are typically 10â20% smaller than males. The length, from the nose to the base of the tail, of the cats varies from 1.12 to 1.85Â m (3.7 to 6.1Â ft). Their tails are the shortest of any big cat, at 45 to 75Â cm (18 to 30Â in) in length.[21][29] Their legs are also short, considerably shorter when compared to a small tiger or lion in a similar weight range, but are thick and powerful. The jaguar stands 63 to 76Â cm (25 to 30Â in) tall at the shoulders.[30] Compared to the similarly colored Old World leopard, this cat is bigger, heavier and relatively stocky in build.[20]",
