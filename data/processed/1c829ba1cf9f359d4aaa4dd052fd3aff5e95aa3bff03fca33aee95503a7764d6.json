				"after": "Stereophonic sound or, more commonly, stereo, is a method of sound reproduction that creates an illusion of directionality and audible perspective. This is usually achieved by using two or more independent audio channels through a configuration of two or more loudspeakers (or stereo headphones) in such a way as to create the impression of sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing.[1] Thus the term \"stereophonic\" applies to so-called \"quadraphonic\" and \"surround-sound\" systems as well as the more common two-channel, two-speaker systems. It is often contrasted with monophonic, or \"mono\" sound, where audio is heard as coming from one position, often centered in the sound field (analogous to a visual field). Stereo sound is now common in entertainment systems such as broadcast radio and TV, recorded music and the cinema.",
