				"previous": "Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope place Pluto's density at between 1.8 and 2.1Â g/cm3, suggesting its internal composition consists of roughly 50â70 percent rock and 30â50 percent ice by mass.[84] Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them, scientists expect that Pluto's internal structure is differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of ice. The diameter of the core is hypothesized to be approximately 7006170000000000000â 1700Â km, 70% of Pluto's diameter.[83] It is possible that such heating continues today, creating a subsurface ocean layer of liquid water some 100 to 180 km thick at the coreâmantle boundary.[83][85] The DLR Institute of Planetary Research calculated that Pluto's density-to-radius ratio lies in a transition zone, along with Neptune's moon Triton, between icy satellites like the mid-sized moons of Uranus and Saturn, and rocky satellites such as Jupiter's Io.[86]",
				"after": "Pluto's mass is 1.31Ã1022Â kg, less than 0.24 percent that of Earth,[87] and its diameter is 7006230600000000000â 2306Â±20Â km, or roughly 66% that of the Moon.[9] Its surface area (7013166500000000000â 1.665Ã107Â km2) is about 10% smaller than that of South America. Pluto's atmosphere complicates determining its true solid size within a certain margin.[8] Pluto's albedo varies from 0.49â0.66.",
