He played over 1,100Â games during a 16-year career, scoring exactly 500Â goals and over 1,000Â points. His total of 66Â goals in 1982â83 remains the Flames' franchise record. McDonald established himself as an offensive forward with three consecutive 40-goal seasons in Toronto in the mid-1970s. He played parts of three seasons in Denver before he was sent to Calgary in 1981 where he spent the remainder of his career. He co-captained the Flames to a Stanley Cup championship in his final season of 1988â89. McDonald won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and sportsmanship in 1983 and in 1988 was named the inaugural winner of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for his leadership and humanitarian presence, in particular through his long association with the Special Olympics. Internationally, he represented Team Canada as a player on two occasions and in a management role three times. McDonald was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. The Flames retired his uniform number 9 in 1990. (FullÂ article...)",
