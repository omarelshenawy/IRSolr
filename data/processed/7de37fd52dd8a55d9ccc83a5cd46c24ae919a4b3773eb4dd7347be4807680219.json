The directions of the axes of the hyperbola are determined by the ordinate of the minimum point of the corresponding parabola . If the ordinate is negative, then the hyperbola's major axis (through its vertices) is horizontal, while if the ordinate is positive then the hyperbola's major axis is vertical."
