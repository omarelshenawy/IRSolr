Five C-140A were flight inspection aircraft for the Air Force Communications Service and were used to perform airborne testing of airport navigational aids from 1962 onwards. They began service during the Vietnam War and remained in service until the early 1990s. The \"Flight Check\" C-140A were a combat-coded aircraft that could be distinguished from the VIP transport version by their distinctive camouflage paint scheme.
