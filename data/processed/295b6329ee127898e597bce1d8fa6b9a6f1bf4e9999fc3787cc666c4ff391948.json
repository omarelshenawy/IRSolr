				"after": "The order Anura (from the Ancient Greek a(n)- meaning \"without\" and oura meaning \"tail\") comprises the frogs and toads. They usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them, shorter forelimbs, webbed toes with no claws, no tails, large eyes and glandular moist skin.[7] Members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs, while those with warty skins are known as toads. The difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule. Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the \"true toads\".[30] Frogs range in size from the 30 centimetres (12Â in) goliath frog (Conraua goliath) of West Africa[31] to the 7.7 millimetres (0.30Â in) Paedophryne amauensis, first described in Papua New Guinea in 2012, which is also the smallest known vertebrate.[32] Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts. They are found worldwide except for polar areas.[33]",
