				"after": "A music video for the song was directed by Madonna's then-husband, filmmaker Guy Ritchie in February 2001 and filmed throughout various parts of Los Angeles, including one location on W. Olympic Blvd and S. Wooster St. The video uses the dance remix version of the song, produced by Above & Beyond, instead of the album's original version.[44] According to Madonna, the video \"shows my character acting out a fantasy and doing things girls are not allowed to do,\" she said in a written statement distributed by her record label, Warner Bros. \"This is an angry song and I wanted a matching visual with an edgy dance mix.\"[44] It premiered on Oxygen TV channel, on March 22, 2001, but was banned from TV broadcasts in many parts of the world, including the most famous MTV and VH1, due to its violent content. It was only aired on MTV and VH1 just once time, during a news segment at a more mature hour of 11:30 p.m. ET.[45] While the video failed to air on both networks, Madonna released it as a DVD single on April 24, 2001,[46] becoming the biggest-selling DVD single of 2001.[47] According to the Andrew Morton, writer of the book Madonna, the video is \"entirely consistent with the themes that she has been exploring for the last twenty years, namely the relationship between the sexes, the ambiguity of gender, and the unresolved conflict, for women in a patriarchal society of being fully female and sexual while exercising control over their lives.\"[48]",
