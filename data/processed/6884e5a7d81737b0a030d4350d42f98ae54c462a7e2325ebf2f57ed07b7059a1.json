				"after": "The Western is a genre of various arts, such as art, comics, fiction, film, games, radio, and television. Westerns are devoted to telling stories set primarily in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West, hence the name. Many feature American Indians, bandits, cowboys, lawmen, outlaws, and soldiers, and as well as spectacular mountain scenery. Some are set in the American colonial era. There are also a number of films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as Junior Bonner (1972) set in the 1970s and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005) in the 21st century. The Western was one of the best-known Hollywood genres from the early 20th century to the 1960s.[citation needed]",
