The Charter was signed by 50 nations on 26Â June (Poland had its place reserved and later became the 51st \"original\" signatory)[citation needed], and was formally ratified shortly after the war on 24Â October 1945. In 1944, the United Nations was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and China at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference [65][66] where the formation and the permanent seats (for the \"Big Five\", China, France, the UK, USA and USSR) of the United Nations Security Council were decided. The Security Council met for the first time in the immediate aftermath of war on 17Â January 1946.[67]",
