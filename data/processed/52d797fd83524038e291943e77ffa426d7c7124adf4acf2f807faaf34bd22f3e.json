Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who colonised Rodrigues between 1691 and 1693 after they were marooned there.[2] Subsequent accounts are by Julien Tafforet, who was also marooned on the island in 1726, and then by the French mathematician Alexandre PingrÃ©, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the 1761 transit of Venus.[3]",
