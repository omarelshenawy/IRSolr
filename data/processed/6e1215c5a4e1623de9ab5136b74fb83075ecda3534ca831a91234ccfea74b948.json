				"previous": "The city hosts the International Association of Science and Technology Parks (IASP) (AsociaciÃ³n Internacional de Parques TecnolÃ³gicos), and a group of IT company executives and business leaders has launched an information sector initiative, MÃ¡laga Valley e-27, which seeks to make MÃ¡laga the Silicon Valley of Europe. MÃ¡laga has had strong growth in new technology industries, mainly located in the Technological Park of Andalusia, and in the construction sector. The city is home to the largest bank in Andalusia, Unicaja, and such local companies as Mayoral, Charanga, Sando, Vera, Ubago, Isofoton, Tedial, Novasoft, Grupo VÃ©rtice and Almeida viajes, and other multinationals such as Fujitsu Spain, Pernod Ricard Spain, Accenture, Epcos, Oracle Corporation, Huawei and San Miguel.[26]",
			"after": [
				"The Holy Week celebration, the August MÃ¡laga Fair (Feria de MÃ¡laga) and the MÃ¡laga Film Festival are the three major events held in the city.",
				"The Holy Week of MÃ¡laga has been observed for five centuries. Processions start on Palm Sunday and continue until Easter Sunday. Images depicting scenes from the Passion are displayed on huge ornate tronos (floats or thrones), some weighing more than 5,000 kilos and carried by more than 250 members of the fraternity of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Esperanza. These tronos highlight the processions that go through the streets led by penitents dressed in long purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles. Drums and trumpets play music and occasionally someone spontaneously sings a mournful saeta dedicated to the floats as they make their way slowly round the streets."
