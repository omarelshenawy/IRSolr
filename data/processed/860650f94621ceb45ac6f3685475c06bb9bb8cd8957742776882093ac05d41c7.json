				"previous": "In 1920, MihailoviÄ married Jelica BrankoviÄ; they had three children. One of his sons, Branko MihailoviÄ, was a communist sympathizer and later supported the Partisans.[177] His daughter, Gordana MihailoviÄ, also sided with the Partisans. She spent most of the war in Belgrade and, after the Partisans took the city, spoke on the radio to denounce her father as a traitor.[178] While MihailoviÄ was in prison, his children did not come to see him, and only his wife visited him.[170] In 2005, Gordana MihailoviÄ personally came to accept her father's posthumous award in the United States. Another son, Vojislav MihailoviÄ, fought alongside his father and was killed in battle in May 1945.[179] His grandson, Vojislav MihailoviÄ (born 1951, named after his uncle) is a Serbian politician, member of the Serbian Renewal Movement and later of the Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement. He was the mayor of Belgrade for one year, from 1999 to 2000 and ran unsuccessfully in the 2000 Yugoslav presidential elections.[180]",
				"after": "Historians vary in their assessments of MihailoviÄ. Tomasevich suggests one main cause of his defeat was his failure to grow professionally, politically or ideologically as his responsibilities increased, rendering him unable to face both the exceptional circumstances of the war and the complex situation of the Chetniks.[181] Tomasevich also criticizes MihailoviÄ's loss of the Allied support through Chetnik collaboration with the Axis, as well as his doctrine of \"passive resistance\" which was perceived as idleness, stating \"of generalship in the general there was precious little.\"[182] Pavlowitch also points to MihailoviÄ's failure to grow and evolve during the conflict and describes him as a man \"generally out of his depth\".[183] Roberts asserts that MihailoviÄ's policies were \"basically static\", that he \"gambled all in the faith of an Allied victory,\" and that ultimately he was unable to control the Chetniks, who, \"although hostile to the Germans and the ItaliansÂ ... allowed themselves to drift into a policy of accommodations with both in the face of what they considered the greatest danger.\"[184]",
