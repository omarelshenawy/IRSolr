				"previous": "In late 2002, after airlines expressed reservations about its emphasis on speed over cost reduction,[73] Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser.[73] The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20Â percent more fuel efficient.[74] The new jetliner was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project.[73] Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history.[74] In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option.[75] Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines.[76] Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays.[77] To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s.[78] The first 787s would ultimately enter service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, three-and-a-half years behind schedule.[79]",
				"after": "In 2007, the 767 received a production boost when UPS and DHL Aviation placed a combined 33 orders for the 767-300F.[80][81] Renewed freighter interest led Boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767-200 and 767-300F with increased gross weights, 767-400ER wing extensions, and 777 avionics.[82] However, net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 2010.[83] During the same period, operators upgraded aircraft already in service; in 2008, the first 767-300ER retrofitted with blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated debuted with American Airlines.[84] The manufacturer-sanctioned winglets, at 11 feet (3.35Â m) in height, improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 6.5Â percent.[84] Other carriers including All Nippon Airways and Delta Air Lines also ordered winglet kits.[85][86]",
