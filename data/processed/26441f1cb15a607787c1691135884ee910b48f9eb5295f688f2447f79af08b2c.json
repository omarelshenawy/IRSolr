				"previous": "Air Astana operates a fleet of 30 aircraft, the youngest fleet in the region and one of the youngest in Europe. As a result of the fleet restructuring and replacing all its Airbus A320 and Boeing 767 aircraft with brand new ones, Air Astana's average fleet age is only 6 years as of 2015. The company plans to expand its fleet to 34 aircraft by 2016 and up to 43 by 2020. And it is also planned to make flights to USA when the Dreamliners arrive.",
