				"after": "The cap is convex to bell-shaped, sometimes developing a broad umbo before expanding and flattening in age; it reaches a diameter of 1.5â2Â cm (0.6â0.8Â in). In maturity, the cap eventually forms a central depression, and, in some old specimens, opens into the hollow stem. The cap surface is slimy to the touch, and has translucent striations along the margin when moist. The cap is strongly hygrophanous, meaning that it will change color depending on its level of hydration. The color ranges from yellowish-brown to golden yellow in young button forms to brownish-gray in age, with greenish-gray tints on the margin. The color later changes to whitish from the center to the margin, finally remaining completely white; dried specimens are straw colored to pale brownish. In contrast to most psilocybin mushrooms, the cap of P.Â aztecorum does not have a strong bluing reaction upon injuryâonly the margin stains slightly green-blue.[1]",
