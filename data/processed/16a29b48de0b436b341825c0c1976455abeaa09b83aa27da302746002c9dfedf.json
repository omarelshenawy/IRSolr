				"previous": "The island has an average temperature of 82.4Â Â°F (28Â Â°C) throughout the year, with an average minimum temperature of 66.9Â Â°F (19Â Â°C) and maximum of 85.4Â Â°F (30Â Â°C). Temperatures do not change drastically throughout the seasons. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than the rest of the island. Between winter and summer, there is only a temperature swing of around 6Â Â°F (3.3Â Â°C). This is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal waters temperatures around the years are about 75Â Â°F in February to 85Â Â°F in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 99Â Â°F (37Â Â°C) at Arecibo,[82] while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40Â Â°F (4Â Â°C) at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal.[83] The average yearly precipitation is 1,687Â mm (66Â in).[84]",
