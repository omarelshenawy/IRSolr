				"previous": "While primarily hunted for their fur, raccoons were also a source of food for Native Americans and early American settlers.[251] According to Ernest Thompson Seton, young specimens killed without a fight are palatable, whereas old raccoons caught after a lengthy battle are inedible.[252] Raccoon meat was extensively eaten during the early years of California, where it was sold in the San Francisco market for $1â3 apiece.[253] American slaves occasionally ate raccoon at Christmas, but it was not necessarily a dish of the poor or rural. The first edition of The Joy of Cooking, released in 1931, contained a recipe for preparing raccoon, and US President Calvin Coolidge's pet raccoon Rebecca was originally sent to be served at the White House Thanksgiving Dinner.[254][255][256] Although the idea of eating raccoons seems repulsive to most mainstream consumers since they see them as endearing, cute, and/or varmints, several thousand raccoons are still eaten each year in the United States.[257][258][259][260]",
