				"previous": "Initially spherical, the fruit bodies are later shallowly saucer- or cup-shaped with rolled-in rims, and measure 2â5Â cm (0.8â2.0Â in) in diameter.[18] The inner surface of the cup is deep red (fading to orange when dry) and smooth, while the outer surface is whitish and covered with a dense matted layer of tiny hairs (a tomentum). The stipe, when present, is stout and up to 4Â cm (1.6Â in) long (if deeply buried) by 0.3â0.7Â cm (0.1â0.3Â in) thick, and whitish, with a tomentum.[18] Color variants of the fungus exist that have reduced or absent pigmentation; these forms may be orange, yellow, or even white (as in the variety albida). In the Netherlands, white fruit bodies have been found growing in the polders.[25]",
				"after": "Sarcoscypha coccinea is one of several fungi whose fruit bodies have been noted to make a \"puffing\" soundâan audible manifestation of spore-discharge where thousands of asci simultaneously explode to release a cloud of spores.[26]",
