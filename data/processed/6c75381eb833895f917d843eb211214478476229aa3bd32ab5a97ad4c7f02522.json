				"previous": "The Series 20 was originally certificated at an MTOW of 94,500Â lb (42,900Â kg) but this was increased to 98,000Â lb (44,000Â kg), some 8 percent up on the higher weight Series 14s and 15s. The aircraft's MLW is 95,300Â lb (43,200Â kg) and MZFW is 84,000Â lb (38,000Â kg). Typical range with maximum payload is 1,000Â nmi (1,900Â km), increasing to 1,450Â nmi (2,690Â km) with maximum fuel. The Series 20, using the same wing as the Series 30, 40 and 50, has a slightly lower basic fuel capacity than the Series 10 (3,679 US gallons).[9][10]",
				"after": "The Series 30 was produced to counter Boeing's 737 twinjet; 662 were built, about 60% of the total. The -30 entered service with Eastern Airlines in February 1967 with a 14Â ft 9Â in (4.50Â m) fuselage stretch, wingspan increased by just over 3Â ft (0.9Â m) and full-span leading edge slats, improving takeoff and landing performance. Maximum takeoff weight was typically 110,000Â lb (50,000Â kg). Engines for Models -31, -32, -33, and -34 included the P&W JT8D-7 and JT8D-9 rated at 14,500Â lbf (64Â kN) of thrust, or JT8D-11 with 15,000Â lbf (67Â kN).",
