				"previous": "As Boeing worked with its suppliers towards production, the design proceeded through a series of test goals. On August 23, 2007, a crash test involving a vertical drop of a partial composite fuselage section from about 15Â ft (4.6Â m) onto a 1Â in (25Â mm)-thick steel plate occurred in Mesa, Arizona;[74][75] the results matched predictions, allowing modeling of various crash scenarios using computational analysis instead of further physical tests.[76][77] While critics had expressed concerns that a composite fuselage could shatter and burn with toxic fumes during crash landings, test data indicated no greater toxicity than conventional metal airframes.[78][79] The crash test was the third in a series of demonstrations conducted to match FAA requirements, including additional certification criteria due to the wide-scale use of composite materials.[75] The 787 meets the FAA's requirement that passengers have at least as good a chance of surviving a crash landing as they would with current metal airliners.[80]",
				"after": "On August 7, 2007, on-time certification of the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine by European and US regulators was received.[81] The alternative GE GEnx-1B engine achieved certification on March 31, 2008.[82] On June 20, 2008, the first aircraft was powered up, for testing the electrical supply and distribution systems.[83] A non-flightworthy static test airframe was built; on September 27, 2008, the fuselage was successfully tested at 14.9 psi (102.7 kPa) differential, which is 150 percent of the maximum pressure expected in commercial service.[84] In December 2008, the 787's maintenance program was passed by the FAA.[85]",
