				"after": "Reconstruction began during the war, with the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 and continued to 1877.[265] It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the war, the most important of which were the three \"Reconstruction Amendments\" to the Constitution, which remain in effect to the present time: the 13th (1865), the 14th (1868) and the 15th (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to guarantee the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a \"republican form of government for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slaveryâand prevent semi-slavery status.[266]",
