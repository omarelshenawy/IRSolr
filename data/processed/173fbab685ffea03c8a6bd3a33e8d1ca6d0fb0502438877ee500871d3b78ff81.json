				"previous": "Bob Ayling's leadership led to a cost savings of Â£750m and the establishment of a budget airline, Go, in 1998.[14] The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years.[15] In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. That year, British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission.[16] The plan fell through in September 2000.[17] British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001.[18] Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001,[8] and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004.[19] In 2005 Willie Walsh, managing director of Aer Lingus and a former pilot, became the chief executive officer of British Airways.[20] BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies in January 2008, taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports.[21]",
				"after": "On July 2008 British Airways announced a merger plan with Iberia, another airline in the Oneworld alliance, wherein each airline would retain its original brand.[22] The agreement was confirmed in April 2010,[23] and in July the European Commission and US Department of Transport permitted the merger and began to co-ordinate transatlantic routes with American Airlines.[24][25] On 6 October 2010 the alliance between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations. The alliance generates an estimated Â£230Â million in annual cost-saving for BA, in addition to the Â£330Â million which would be saved by the merge with Iberia.[26][27] This merger was finalised on 21 January 2011, resulting in the International Airlines Group (IAG), the world's third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest airline group in Europe.[23][28] Prior to merging, British Airways owned a 13.5% stake in Iberia, and thus received ownership of 55% of the combined International Airlines Group; Iberia's other shareholders received the remaining 45%.[29] As a part of the merger, British Airways ceased trading independently on the London Stock Exchange after 23 years as a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[30]",
