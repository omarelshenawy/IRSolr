Modern starfish and brittle stars probably had a common somasteroid ancestor.[83] Starfish are infrequently found as fossils, possibly because their hard skeletal components separate as the animal decays. However, although starfish fossils are uncommon, there are a few places where accumulations of complete skeletal structures occur, fossilized in place in LagerstÃ¤tten â so-called \"starfish beds\".[84]",
