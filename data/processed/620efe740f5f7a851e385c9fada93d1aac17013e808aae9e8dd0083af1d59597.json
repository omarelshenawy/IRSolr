				"previous": "Very few examples remain airworthy, with some still in use for freight duties, and a handful maintained by aviation clubs and enthusiasts. Today only three aircraft remain airworthy in Russia: one, called \"Soviet Union\" at Gorelovo airfield near St.Petersburg, another, called \"Penguin\" has performed its maiden flight after restoration on 1.10.2012 and now is based at Stupino airfield near Moscow. The third aircraft, called \"The Blue Dream\" performed its maiden flight from Tushino airfield to Stupino airfield in May 2014 after more than 10 years repair performed by a team of aero enthusiasts.[6][7] There is also one IL-14 that is possibly airworthy in the United States.[8]",
