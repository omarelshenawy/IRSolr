				"previous": "At MarchÂ 1990Â (1990-03), the fleet consisted of five Boeing 707-320Cs, ten Boeing 727-200s, three Fokker F28-4000s, 16 Fokker F27s (13 -600s, two -500s and one -400), four Lockheed L-100-200s, 21 Ilyushin Il-76s and five Twin Otters.[37] Another drawback hit the carrier following the MarchÂ 1992Â (1992-03) United Nations Security Council Resolution 748,[38] adopted as a consequence of the Libyan government allegedly having supported the terrorists responsible for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103[39][40] and UTA Flight 772.[41][42][43] The resolution saw a trade embargo imposed on Libya, which included the delivery of new aircraft or spare parts that could possibly boost the military capacity of the country, and Libyan Airlines was denied any landing or overflight rights of third-party countries. Thus, all international flights came to an end,[44] and LAA could only operate on domestic routes.[39][45]",
				"after": "In AprilÂ 1999Â (1999-04), civil sanctions against the country were lifted.[44][46][47] It followed Libya handing over two men suspected of being involved in the Lockerbie bombing.[48][49] Intended to replace an ageing fleet of Boeing 707s, 727s and Fokker F27s, a letter of intent worth USDÂ 1.5Â billion was signed with Airbus in October that year; it included Airbus A320s, A330s and A340s.[50][51] The fact that these aircraft had US-manufactured parts once again prevented the deal to be firmed up as a trade embargo over the country, imposed in 1983,[45] was still in force,[46] and Libyan Arab Airlines sought alternative manufacturers to acquire new aircraft for re-fleeting.[50]",
