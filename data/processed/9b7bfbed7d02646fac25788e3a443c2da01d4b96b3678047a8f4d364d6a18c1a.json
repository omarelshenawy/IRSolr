				"after": "The F-111 was an all-weather attack aircraft, capable of low-level penetration of enemy defenses to deliver ordnance on the target.[35] The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit was part of an escape crew capsule.[36] The wing sweep varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The wing included leading edge slats and double slotted flaps over its full length.[37] The airframe was made up mostly of aluminium alloys with steel, titanium and other materials used in places.[38] The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin.[37][38]",
