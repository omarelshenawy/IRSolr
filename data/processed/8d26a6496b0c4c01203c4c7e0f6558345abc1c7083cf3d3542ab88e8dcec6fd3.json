				"after": "The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's Golden Age, during which it became the wealthiest city in the world.[31] Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the Baltic Sea, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading Financial Centre of the world.[32] In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares.[33]",
