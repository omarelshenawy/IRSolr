				"previous": "The Table Rocks offer one of the most popular hiking locations in the Rogue Valley, with over 45,000Â visitors annually.[29][39][63] Over 4,600Â people per year participate in guided hikes through the Table Rock Environmental Education Program, hosted by the Bureau of Land Management and The Nature Conservancy.[64] Lower Table Rock features a walking trail, which climbs approximately 780 feet (240Â m) to the top of the plateau over a distance of 1.75 miles (2.82Â km).[65][66] It has eight interpretive panels along its length, explaining the history, flora, and fauna of the region.[56] Upper Table Rock also has a walking trail, 1.25 miles (2.01Â km) long, ascending approximately 720 feet (220Â m).[65][66] The trails are the most popular with hikers between March and May, when the wildflowers are in bloom. Another peak occurs in September through October.[56] Landmarks such as Mount McLoughlin, Mount Ashland, Roxy Ann Peak, and Pilot Rock are visible on clear days from the edge of the rocks.[65][66]",
				"after": "The Youth Conservation Corps, Boy Scouts, and the Oregon Department of Forestry built the trails leading to the tops of the Table Rocks in the early 1980s, around the same time the plateaus were being nominated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern.[38][39] In June 1999, only two small trees were cut when Shady Cove contractor Randy Hodges rerouted a 3â4-mile (1.2Â km) section of the Lower Table Rock trail to accommodate the growing number of visitors. The project involved decommissioning the old section, expanding the parking lot, and installing 2,200 feet (671Â m) of new trail. Measures to protect the trail were implemented, such as installing rock waterbars and a layer of shale gravel over the clay.[67]",
