				"previous": "The electromagnetic field may be thought of in a more 'coarse' way. Experiments reveal that in some circumstances electromagnetic energy transfer is better described as being carried in the form of packets called quanta (in this case, photons) with a fixed frequency. Planck's relation links the energy E of a photon to its frequency Î½ through the equation:[1]",
				"after": "where h is Planck's constant, named in honor of Max Planck, and Î½ is the frequency of the photon . Although modern quantum optics tells us that there also is a semi-classical explanation of the photoelectric effectâthe emission of electrons from metallic surfaces subjected to electromagnetic radiationâthe photon was historically (although not strictly necessarily) used to explain certain observations. It is found that increasing the intensity of the incident radiation (so long as one remains in the linear regime) increases only the number of electrons ejected, and has almost no effect on the energy distribution of their ejection. Only the frequency of the radiation is relevant to the energy of the ejected electrons.",
