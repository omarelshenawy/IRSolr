It serves the usual functions of longitudinal stability, control and stick force requirements [1] otherwise performed by the separate fixed and movable parts of a conventional horizontal stabilizer. Apart from a higher efficiency at high Mach number, [2] it is a useful device for changing the aircraft balance within wide limits, and for mastering the stick forces. [3]",
