				"previous": "The Church of Scientology holds that at the higher levels of initiation (\"OT levels\"), mystical teachings are imparted that may be harmful to unprepared readers. These teachings are kept secret from members who have not reached these levels. The church says that the secrecy is warranted to keep its materials' use in context and to protect its members from being exposed to materials they are not yet prepared for.[101]",
				"after": "These are the OT levels, the levels above Clear, whose contents are guarded within Scientology. The OT level teachings include accounts of various cosmic catastrophes that befell the thetans.[140] Hubbard described these early events collectively as \"space opera\".",
