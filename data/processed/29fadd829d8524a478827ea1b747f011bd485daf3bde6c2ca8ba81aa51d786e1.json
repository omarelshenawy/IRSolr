				"after": "By removing the original vegetation, rural and urban development of the Johnson Creek watershed induced more rapid storm runoff and expensive floods. As a flood-control measure in the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration of the federal government cleared and lined with rock about 90Â percent of the creek between its mouth and Southeast 158thÂ Avenue, about 15 miles (24Â km) from the mouth, creating an artificial channel 6 feet (2Â m) to 10 feet (3Â m) deep and 25 feet (8Â m) to 50 feet (15Â m) wide.[13] Although substantially altering the stream and its aquatic life, this channel failed to prevent overflows, the largest of which damaged 1,200Â structures in 1964.[8]",
