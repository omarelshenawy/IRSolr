Petrus Christus borrowed the illusionistic carving on the parapet for his 1446 Portrait of a Carthusian.[33] A c. 1449â50 portrait of Marco Barbarigo attributed to a follower of van Eyck is heavily indebted, in that it is also unusually tall and narrow, with a large space above the sitter's head.[25]",
