				"after": "Critics have called the video NSFW, comparing it to the 2013 video for \"Blurred Lines\" by Robin Thicke with Pharrell Williams and T.I..[50][51] In an interview with Capital FM, Thicke responded to a question about the videos' similarity: \"No comment. I'll let you do all the talking. It's a subject that has no good ending.\"[54] Fact magazine called the video's concept simple, and said its production team was unconcerned.[55] According to Spinââ'âs Jordan Sargent, \"Like his new album The 20/20 Experience, in which half the songs run longer than seven minutes, the 'Tunnel Vision' video is self-consciously artistic and mature. But the video is also at times effective, particularly when the editing gets choppier during the bridge.\"[52]",
