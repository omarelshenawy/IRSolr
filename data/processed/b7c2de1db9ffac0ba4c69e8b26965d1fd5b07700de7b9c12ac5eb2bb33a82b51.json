				"previous": "Selfe's capacity for invention was not limited to the realm of machineryÂ â he was also an energetic civic and urban reformer. He had high hopes for Sydney:",
				"after": "From the time of Selfe's return in 1886 from two years' travel in the United States and Europe, he campaigned for improvements to the city of Sydney. These included proposals for a city railway loop, the redevelopment of the Rocks, and a bridge to the North Shore.[25] His obituary in The Sydney Morning Herald notes, \"Mr. Selfe for over twenty years was a strenuous advocate of a circular city railway that should connect up the eastern, western, and northern suburbs of the city with the marine suburbs of the harbour, and stations adjacent to the ferries\".[1] He published plans and proposals elaborating on his ideas, and produced major articles with titles like \"Sydney: past, present and possible\"[26] and \"Sydney and its institutions, as they are, and might be from an engineer's point of view\".[27]",
