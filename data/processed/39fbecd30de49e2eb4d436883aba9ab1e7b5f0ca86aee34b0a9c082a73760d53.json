				"after": "Some art theorists and writers have long made a distinction between the physical qualities of an art object and its identity-status as an artwork.[7] For example, a painting by Rembrandt has a physical existence as an \"oil painting on canvas\" that is separate from its identity as a masterpiece \"work of art\" or the artist's magnum opus.[8] Many works of art are initially denied \"museum quality\" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the Impressionists and non-representational abstract artists are examples. Some, such as the \"Readymades\" of Marcel Duchamp including his infamous 'urinal \"Fountain'\", are later reproduced as \"museum quality replicas\".",
