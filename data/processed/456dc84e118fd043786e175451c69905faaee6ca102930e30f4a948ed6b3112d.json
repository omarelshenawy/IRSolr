				"previous": "The first combat-capable Block 3.0 aircraft first flew in 2001.[77] Increment 2, the first F-22 upgrade program, was implemented in 2005 and enables the aircraft to employ Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). Increment 3.1 provides improved ground-attack capability through synthetic aperture radar mapping and radio emitter direction finding, electronic attack and the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB); testing began in 2009 and the first upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2012.[78][79] Increment 3.2 is a two-part upgrade process; 3.2A focuses on electronic warfare, communications and identification, while 3.2B will allow the F-22 to fully exploit the AIM-9X and AIM-120D missiles.[80][81] The subsequent Increment 3.3 may include the adoption of an open avionics platform and air traffic control updates.[76][82] Upgrades due in 2015 will allow the F-22 to employ the AIM-9X and have full Link 16 reception and transmission capability, and an upgrade scheduled in 2018 will integrate the AIM-120D into the weapons suite.[83] The F-22 fleet is planned to have 36 Block 20 training and 149 Block 30/35 combat aircraft by 2016.",
				"after": "To enable two-way communication with other platforms, the F-22 can use the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) as a gateway. The originally planned MADL integration was cut due to the lack of system maturity.[84] Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are currently competing to connect the F-22 with other platforms while maintaining stealth.[85] Other upgrades being developed include infra-red search and track functionality for the AN/AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector (MLD) and integration of the Visionix Scorpion helmet-mounted cueing system (HMCS) to enable off-boresight missile launches.[81][86] In March 2010, the USAF accelerated software portions of 3.2 to be completed in FY 2013.[87][88]",
