Before its officially recognized discovery, it was called \"eka-iodine\" (from Sanskrit ekaÂ â \"one\") to imply it was one space under iodine (in the same manner as eka-silicon, eka-boron, and others).[79] Scientists tried to find it in nature; given its rarity, these attempts resulted in several false discoveries.[80]",
