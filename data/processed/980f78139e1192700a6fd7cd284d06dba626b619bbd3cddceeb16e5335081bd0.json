				"after": "The reduced or parametric latitude, Î², is defined by the radius drawn from the centre of the ellipsoid to that point Q on the surrounding sphere (of radius a) which is the projection parallel to the Earth's axis of a point P on the ellipsoid at latitude . It was introduced by Legendre[12] and Bessel[13] who solved problems for geodesics on the ellipsoid by transforming them to an equivalent problem for spherical geodesics by using this smaller latitude. Bessel's notation, , is also used in the current literature. The reduced latitude is related to the geodetic latitude by:[7][8]",
