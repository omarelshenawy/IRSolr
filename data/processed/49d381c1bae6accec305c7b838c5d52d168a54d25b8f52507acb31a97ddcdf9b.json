				"previous": "Kurt's characterization Colfer has explained that Kurt \"puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona, but underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point. In later episodes, he goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. [...] He's a tough guy in designer clothes.\"[24] The character is also gay, which is at the crux of many of his conflicts on the show. Colfer has a high vocal range, as displayed in the episode \"Wheels\", in which his character demonstrates the unusual ability (for a man) of singing a \"high F\" (actually an F5). However, his character deliberately pretends to be unable to sing the note in order to spare his father the harassment he would receive for having a gay son.[25] Later, in the episode \"Choke\" when his character is auditioning for NYADA, he sings \"Not the Boy Next Door\" from The Boy from Oz, a song Kurt claims is \"something a little more out there, but much more me\", successfully hitting a High G, a note higher than High F.",
