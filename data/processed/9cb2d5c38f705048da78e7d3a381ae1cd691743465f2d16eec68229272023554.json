Scientists believe liquid water is present in the Saturnian moons of Enceladus, as a 10-kilometre thick ocean approximately 30-40 kilometres below Enceladus' south polar surface,[39][40] and Titan, as a subsurface layer, possibly mixed with ammonia.[41] Jupiter's moon Europa has surface characteristics which suggest a subsurface liquid water ocean.[42] Liquid water may also exist on Jupiter's moon Ganymede as a layer sandwiched between high pressure ice and rock.[43]",
