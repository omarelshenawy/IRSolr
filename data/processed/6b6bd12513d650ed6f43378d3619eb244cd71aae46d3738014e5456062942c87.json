				"Montserrat has competed in every Commonwealth Games since 1994.[32]",
				"Montserrat has its own FIFA affiliated football team, and has competed in the World Cup qualifiers five times but failed to advance to the finals from 2002 to 2018. A field for the team was built near the airport by FIFA. In 2002, the team competed in a friendly match with the second-lowest-ranked team in FIFA at that time, Bhutan, in The Other Final, the same day as the final of the 2002 World Cup. Bhutan won 4â0."

				"Montserrat is divided into three parishes:",
				"The locations of settlements on the island have been vastly changed since the volcanic activity began. Only Saint Peter Parish in the northwest of the island is now inhabited, with a population of between 4,000 and 6,000.[33][34] The other two parishes are still too dangerous to inhabit; the volcano is still active in 2013."
