				"previous": "In June 2009, the Indian Air Force (IAF) selected the C-17 for its Very Heavy Lift Transport Aircraft requirement, it is to replace several types of transport aircraft.[124][125] In January 2010, India requested 10 C-17s through the U.S.'s Foreign Military Sales program,[126] the sale was approved by Congress in June 2010.[127] On 23 June 2010, the Indian Air Force successfully test-landed a USAF C-17 at the Gaggal Airport, India to complete the IAF's C-17 trials.[128] In February 2011, the IAF and Boeing agreed terms for the order of 10 C-17s[129] with an option for six more; the US$4.1 billion order was approved by the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security on 6 June 2011.[130][131] Deliveries began in June 2013 and are to continue until 2014.[132][133] In 2012, the IAF reportedly finalized plans to buy six more C-17s in the 13th five-year plan (2017â2022).[125][134][135]",
				"after": "The aircraft provides strategic airlift and the ability to deploy special forces, such as during national emergencies.[136] They are operated in diverse terrain â from Himalayan air bases in North India at 13,000Â ft (4,000Â m) to Indian Ocean bases in South India.[137] The C-17s are based at Hindon Air Force Station and are operated by the No. 81 Squadron Skylords.[138][139] The first C-17 was delivered in January 2013 for testing and training;[140] it was officially accepted on 11 June 2013.[141] The second C-17 was delivered on 23 July 2013 and put into service immediately. IAF Chief of Air Staff Norman AK Browne called the Globemaster III \"a major component in the IAF's modernization drive\" while taking delivery of the aircraft at Boeing's Long Beach factory.[142] On 2 September 2013, the Skylords squadron with three C-17s officially entered IAF service.[143]",
