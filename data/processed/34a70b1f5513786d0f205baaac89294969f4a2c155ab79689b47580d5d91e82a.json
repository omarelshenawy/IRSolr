				"after": "The black currawong is endemic to Tasmania[2] where it is widespread, although it is uncommon or absent from areas below 200Â m (700Â ft) altitude. It breeds mainly in the Central Highlands, with scattered records elsewhere in Tasmania. Reports of breeding are rare from the northeast. It is found on many islands of Bass Strait, including the Hunter and Furneaux Groups. It was recorded historically from the Kent Group, but its status there is unknown.[21] Within its range it is largely sedentary, although some populations at higher altitudes may move to lower altitudes during winter.[22] Flocks have also been recorded making the 20Â km (12Â mi) long journey across water from Maria Island to the mainland in the morning and returning at nightfall,[21] as well as moving between islands in the Maatsuyker group.[23] The black currawong has expanded into the northeast corner of the island, to Musselroe Bay and Cape Portland.[21]",
