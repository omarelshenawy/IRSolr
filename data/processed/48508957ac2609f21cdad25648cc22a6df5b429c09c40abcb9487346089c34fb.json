				"In addition to use as private touring aircraft, DC-6As and DC-6Bs saw use as newspaper delivery aircraft and were impressed as liaison aircraft with the United States Army Air Force (USAAF).",
				"The DC-6 was a scaled-down four-seat version of the six-seat CW-6. It was rolled out in February 1929 and went into production in two versions, the DC-6A and DC-6B. Both versions gained type certificates in September 1929. The Depression and the Wall Street crash reduced demand for the aircraft and only just over 20 of each model were produced. Some aircraft were taken on charge by the USAAC in 1942."
