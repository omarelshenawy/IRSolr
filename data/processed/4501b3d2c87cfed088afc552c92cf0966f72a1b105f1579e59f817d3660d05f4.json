				"after": "No Lifeguard on Duty received a favorable review from Publishers Weekly.[1] The review concluded: \"The book is sometimes predictable and psychologically simplistic, but Dickinson comes across as a triumphant survivor. Her willingness to recognize her own flaws makes it easy to relate to her positive message and should inspire readers searching for solutions to career and personal conflicts.\"[1] The review praised the author's ability at being: \"honest enough to acknowledge the stimulating aspects of success and glamour, explaining why they lure insecure personalities and imprison them past the point of no return.\"[25] Women's Wear Daily reviewed the book and wrote: \"What keeps the book from becoming too tawdry is Dickinson's sense of humor. She applies a healthy dose to both her conquests and disaster's alike.\"[3][25]",
