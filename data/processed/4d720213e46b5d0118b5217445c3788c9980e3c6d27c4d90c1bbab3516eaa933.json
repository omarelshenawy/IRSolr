				"previous": "The revolutionary committee headed by Niceto AlcalÃ¡-Zamora became the provisional government, with AlcalÃ¡-Zamora as the President and Head of State.[23] The republic had broad support from all segments of society.[24] In May, an incident where a taxi driver was attacked outside a monarchist club sparked anti-clerical violence throughout Madrid and south-west Spain; the government's slow response disillusioned the right and reinforced their view that the Republic was determined to persecute the church. In June and July the ConfederaciÃ³n Nacional del Trabajo called several strikes, which led to a violent incident between CNT members and the Civil Guard and a brutal crackdown by the Civil Guard and the army against the CNT in Seville; this led many workers to believe the Second Spanish Republic was just as oppressive as the monarchy and the CNT announced their intention of overthrowing it via revolution.[25] Elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists.[26] With the onset of the Great Depression, the government attempted to assist rural Spain by instituting an eight-hour day and giving land tenure to farm workers.[27][28]",
				"after": "Fascism remained a reactive threat, helped by controversial reforms to the military.[29] In December, a new reformist, liberal, and democratic constitution was declared. It included strong provisions enforcing a broad secularization of the Catholic country, which many moderate committed Catholics opposed.[30] In October 1931, Republican Manuel AzaÃ±a became prime minister of a minority government.[31][32] In 1933, the right won the general elections, largely due to the anarchists' abstention from the vote, increased right wing resentment of the incumbent government caused by an illegal decree confiscating the land of the aristocracy, the Casas Viejas incident, the socialists' (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) dissatisfaction with the caution of Republicans and perceived brutality of Manuel AzaÃ±a and the formation of a right-wing alliance, Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups; women's newfound right to vote also contributed to this (most women voted for centre-right parties).[citation needed]",
