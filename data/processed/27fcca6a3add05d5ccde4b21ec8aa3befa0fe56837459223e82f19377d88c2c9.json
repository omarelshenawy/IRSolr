				"after": "In 1946, KertÃ©sz had a solo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, featuring photographs from his Day of Paris series. KertÃ©sz said this was one of his greatest times in the United States.[7] In 1952, he and his wife moved to a 12th-floor apartment near Washington Square Park, the setting for some of his best photographs since having immigrated to the US. Using a telephoto lens, he took a series of snow-covered Washington Square, showing numerous silhouettes and tracks. In 1955 he was insulted to have his work excluded when Edward Steichen's The Family of Man show was featured at MoMA. Despite the success of the Chicago show, KertÃ©sz did not gain another exhibit until 1962, when his photographs were shown at Long Island University.",
