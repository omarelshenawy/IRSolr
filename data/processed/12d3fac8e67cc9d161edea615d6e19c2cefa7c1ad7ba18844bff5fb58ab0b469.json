				"after": "The climate of South Florida is located across the broad transition zone between subtropical and tropical climates (Koppen Cf and Aw). Like most regions with this climate type, there are two basic seasons - a \"dry season \" (winter) which runs from November through April, and a \"wet season\" (summer) which runs from May through October. About 70% of the annual rainfall in south Florida occurs in the wet season - often as brief but intense tropical downpours. The dry season sees little rainfall and dew points and humidity are often quite low. The dry season can be severe at times, as wildfires and water restrictions are often in place.",
