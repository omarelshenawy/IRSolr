There are no clear examples of known archaeal pathogens or parasites.[172][173] However, a relationship has been proposed between some species of methanogens and infections in the mouth,[174][175] and Nanoarchaeum equitans may be a parasite of another species of archaea, since it only survives and reproduces within the cells of the Crenarchaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis,[176] and appears to offer no benefit to its host.[177] In contrast, Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms (ARMAN) occasionally connect with other archaeal cells in acid mine drainage biofilms.[178] The nature of this relationship is unknown. However, it is distinct from that of NanarchaeaumâIgnicoccus in that the ultrasmall ARMAN cells are usually seen independent of the Thermoplasmatales cells.",
