The MediaWiki namespace, which defines parts of the site interface, is fully protected; it is impossible for administrators to remove this protection.

Only accounts that are associated with these pages or administrators are able to edit them. This protection applies to any user subpage with a \".css\" or \".js\" extension, whether an equivalent MediaWiki skin exists or not. Administrators may modify these pages, for example, to remove a user script that has been used in an inappropriate way.",
