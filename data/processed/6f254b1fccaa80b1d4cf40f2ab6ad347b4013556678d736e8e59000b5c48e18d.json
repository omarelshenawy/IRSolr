				"previous": "French neo-Gothic had its roots in the French medieval Gothic architecture, where it was created in the 12th Century. Gothic architecture was sometimes known during the medieval period as the \"Opus Francigenum\", (the \"French Art\"). French scholar Alexandre de Laborde wrote in 1816 that \"Gothic architecture has beauties of its own\",[8] which marked the beginning of the Gothic revival in France. Starting in 1828, Alexandre Brogniart, the director of the SÃ¨vres porcelain manufactory, produced fired enamel paintings on large panes of plate glass, for King Louis-Philippe's royal chapel at Dreux. It would be hard to find[who?] a large, significant commission in Gothic taste that preceded this one, save for some Gothic features in a handful of jardins paysagers.",
