				"after": "SilkAir began operations with two leased McDonnell Douglas MD-87 aircraft in 1989, before investing in its own fleet of six Boeing 737-300s, the first of which began operations in 1997. It operated two Airbus A310-200s for a brief period from 1993 to 1995 before they were transferred to Singapore Airlines, and two Fokker 70s from 1995 to 2000. It began replacing its Boeing fleet with Airbus aircraft when the first Airbus A320-200 arrived on September 18, 1998, and retired all Boeing aircraft a year later.[13] Soon after its first A320 was delivered, SilkAir took delivery of its first A319-100 aircraft on September 3, 1999. The A319 is currently utilized on certain routes within Southeast Asia, and to some cities in India, while the larger A320 is used on most of the airline's major routes. On 20 December 2006, SilkAir signed an agreement to purchase 11 Airbus A320-200 aircraft with nine more on option. These aircraft will be delivered between 2009-2012.[14]",
