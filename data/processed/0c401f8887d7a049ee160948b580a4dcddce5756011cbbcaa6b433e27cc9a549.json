				"after": "Intel was founded in Mountain View, California in 1968 by Gordon E. Moore (of \"Moore's Law\" fame), a chemist, and Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Arthur Rock (investor and venture capitalist) helped them find investors, while Max Palevsky was on the board from an early stage.[17] Moore and Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel. Rock was not an employee, but he was an investor and was chairman of the board.[18][19] The total initial investment in Intel was $2.5 million convertible debentures and $10,000 from Rock. Just 2 years later, Intel completed their initial public offering (IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share).[18] Intel's third employee was Andy Grove,[20] a chemical engineer, who later ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high-growth 1990s.",
