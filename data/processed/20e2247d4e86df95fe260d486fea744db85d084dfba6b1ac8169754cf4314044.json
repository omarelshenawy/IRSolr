				"previous": "In 2000, EVA Air embarked on its first major long-haul fleet renewal. The airline became one of the launch customers for the Boeing 777-300ER, ordering four aircraft plus eight options.[5] At the same time, the airline placed three orders for the Boeing 777-200LR. In January 2001, EVA Air ordered its first Airbus aircraft, the A330-200. The Boeing 777 aircraft were intended for United States and European services, while the Airbus A330 aircraft were intended for regional Asian routes.[5]",
				"after": "In 2001, EVA Air began listing public stock offerings on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.[9] Initially, one percent of the company's shares was offered over-the-counter, with one-quarter held by parent company Evergreen Marine Corporation and EVA Air employees, respectively.[5] In 2002, EVA Air underwent internal corporate reforms, with staff reductions and streamlined management.[5] This culminated a process which had begun in 1997, when the Asian financial crisis began affecting profitability.[5] The 2002â2003 SARS contagion also affected passenger traffic for medium-haul flights in Southeast Asia, while long-haul flights to North America, Japan, and Europe were less affected.[5]",
