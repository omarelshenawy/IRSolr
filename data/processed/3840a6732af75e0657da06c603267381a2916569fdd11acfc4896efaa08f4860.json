				"after": "El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism.[3] El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers.[72] Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Acislo Antonio Palomino de Castro y Velasco and Juan AgustÃ­n CeÃ¡n BermÃºdez, described his mature work as \"contemptible\", \"ridiculous\" and \"worthy of scorn\".[73] The views of Palomino and BermÃºdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \"strange\", \"queer\", \"original\", \"eccentric\" and \"odd\".[74] The phrase \"sunk in eccentricity\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \"madness\".[j]",
