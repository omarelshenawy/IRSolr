				"previous": "The endurance of a UAV is not constrained by the physiological limitations of a human pilot. The maximum flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles varies widely.",
				"after": "Because of the small size, weight, low vibration and high power to weight ratio, Wankel rotary engines have been used in UAV aircraft.[160][161] Additionally: the engine rotors cannot seize; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent and it does not require an enriched mixture for cooling at high power. The attributes of the Wankel engine transpire into less fuel usage in UAVs giving greater range or a higher payload.[162]",
