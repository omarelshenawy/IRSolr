				"after": "Bramshill House is located at the approximate centre of a triangular shape formed by Reading, Basingstoke and Farnborough, about 47 miles (76Â km) by road southwest of central London.[1][2] It lies to the northeast of Hartley Wintney, east of Hazeley off the B3349 road, southeast of the village of Bramshill, which lies on the B3011 road. Three main lanes approach the property: Mansion Drive from the B3011 in the southwest, Reading Drive South from the B3011 to the east of Bramshill village from the north, and the shorter Pheasantry Drive which approaches it from the southeast from Chalwin's Copse, just north of the course of the River Hart. There is also a private lane within the grounds, known as Lower Pool Road, which connects Mansion Drive to Reading Drive South, passing the pond and several outer buildings.[2]",
