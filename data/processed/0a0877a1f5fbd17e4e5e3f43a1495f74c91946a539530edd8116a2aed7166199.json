The red-necked grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or, further north, in shrub tundra, and favours sites with abundant emergent vegetation, such as reedbeds.[18] The best breeding habitat is fish-ponds, which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements.[19] The American subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density, and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes.[3]",
