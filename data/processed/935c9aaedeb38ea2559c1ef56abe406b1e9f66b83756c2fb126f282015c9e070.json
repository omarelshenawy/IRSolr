				"previous": "Like all monotremes, it has one orifice,[35] the cloaca, for the passage of faeces, urine and reproductive products.[34] The male has internal testes, no external scrotum and a highly unusual penis with four knobs on the tip,[36] which is nearly a quarter of his body length when erect.[37] The gestating female develops a pouch on her underside, where she raises her young.[38]",
				"after": "The musculature of the short-beaked echidna has a number of unusual aspects. The panniculus carnosus, an enormous muscle just beneath the skin, covers the entire body. By contraction of various parts of the panniculus carnosus, the short-beaked echidna can change shape, the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened, so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines. It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal, extending only as far as the thorax.[39] Whereas the human spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbar vertebra, for the echidna it occurs at the seventh thoracic vertebra.[40] The shorter spinal cord is thought to allow it the flexibility to wrap into a ball.[40]",
