				"after": "The Tosa-class battleships were two dreadnoughts ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy during the early 1920s. The ships were larger versions of the preceding NagatoÂ class, and carried an additional 41-centimeter (16.1Â in) twin-gun turret; their design served as a basis for the Amagi-class battlecruisers. The first ship, Tosa, was canceled according to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty before it could be completed, and was used in experiments testing the effectiveness of its armor scheme before being scuttled in the Bungo Channel. The hull of the second ship, Kaga (model pictured), was converted into an aircraft carrier of the same name. The carrier supported Japanese troops in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War of the late 1930s, and took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, during the Dutch East Indies campaign. She was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942.
