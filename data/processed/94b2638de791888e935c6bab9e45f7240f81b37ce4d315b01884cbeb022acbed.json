				"previous": "Banksia spinulosa var.Â cunninghamii is found in 3 disjunct regions; the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, East Gippsland between Lakes Entrance and Eden, and in the Great Dividing Range in a band from Jervis Bay to Glen Davis in Central New South Wales, while there have been collections northwards in the Dividing Range up into southeast Queensland.[33] It can be an understorey plant under dense as well as open forest cover.[34]",
				"after": "Like other banksias, Banksia spinulosa plays host to a wide variety of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. Banksias have been the subject of many studies about their pollination; B.Â spinulosa is no exception. A 1998 study in Bungawalbin National Park in Northern New South Wales found that B.Â spinulosa var.Â collina inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, including marsupials such as Antechinus flavipes (Yellow-footed Antechinus), which carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectar-eating birds, making them effective pollinators.[35] The same study noted that, unlike other banksias studied, B.Â spinulosa var.Â collina was visited predominantly by native bees rather than the introduced Apis mellifera (European Honeybee).[35]",
