				"previous": "In 2013, the Navy unveiled a $4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island.[106] The Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) was developed to save on training costs with a reusable facility which could emulate electronic, mine and anti-air warfare scenarios instead of real-world training requiring fuel, logistics and deployment costs for ships.[107]",
				"after": "Soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, it was decided that the USS Arizona would remain at the bottom of the harbor as the final resting place for those lost.[108] In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the construction of a memorial over the vessel[108] and the USS Arizona memorial was dedicated in 1962.[108][109] It includes a complex at Halawa Landing (opposite Ford Island) and a structure over the Arizona which receives visitors by ferry.[110] Although the ferries are operated by US Navy personnel, the complex is staffed by the National Park Service.[110]",
