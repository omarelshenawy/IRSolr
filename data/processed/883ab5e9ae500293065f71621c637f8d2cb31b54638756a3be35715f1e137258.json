				"previous": "There are numerous hospitals in Valenzuela like the city-run Valenzuela City Emergency Hospital and the Valenzuela City General Hospital, which is under the national government.[112] There are also privately owned hospitals like Calalang General Hospital, Sanctissimo Rosario General Hospital and Fatima University Medical Center, a tertiary private hospital under the administration of Our Lady of Fatima University.[112][113][114][115] The soon-to-rise Valenzuela City West Emergency Hospital and Dialysis Center is set for construction in a 4,000-square meter lot in barangay Dalandanan, adjacent to Valenzuela City Astrodome and Dalandanan National High School. The new hospital is expected to be finished by later half of 2012 which will render adequate healthcare services to underprivileged residents at a minimal fee.[116]",
				"after": "The city implements VC Cares Program which is designed for individuals who are unable to provide healthcare and basic necessities for themselves or meet special emergency situations of need.[117] While health care service and financial assistance are generally the forms of assistance given, these may be supplemented by other forms of assistance, as well as problem-solving and referral services. Appropriate referrals may be made to other agencies or institutions where complementary services may be obtained.[118]",
