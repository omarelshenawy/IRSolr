				"previous": "What Lavoisier did (although this was disputed at the time) was to conduct the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and give the first correct explanation of how combustion works.[7] He used these and similar experiments, all started in 1774, to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a chemical element.",
				"after": "In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container.[7] He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en gÃ©nÃ©ral, which was published in 1777.[7] In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. á¼Î¶ÏÏÎ¿Î½ \"lifeless\"), which did not support either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the name in French and several other European languages.[7]",
