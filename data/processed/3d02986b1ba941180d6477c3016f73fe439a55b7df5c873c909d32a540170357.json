				"after": "Since their arrival on Madagascar, a biogeographically isolated island with a unique mammalian fauna, lemurs have diversified both in behavior and morphology. Their diversity rivals that of the monkeys and apes found throughout the rest of the world, especially when the recently extinct subfossil lemurs are considered.[1] Ranging in size from the 30Â g (1.1Â oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, probably the world's smallest primate,[2] to the extinct 160â200Â kg (350â440Â lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, the largest known prosimian,[3][4][5] lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate. They went on to fill many niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and large grazing ungulates.[6][7] In addition to the incredible diversity between lemur families, there has also been great diversification among closely related lemurs.[1]",
