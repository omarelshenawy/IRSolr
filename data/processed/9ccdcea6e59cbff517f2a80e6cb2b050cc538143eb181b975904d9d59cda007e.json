				"after": "In September 1952, the United States Navy announced a requirement for a new fighter. It was to have a top speed of Mach 1.2 at 30,000Â ft (9,144.0Â m) with a climb rate of 25,000Â ft/min (127.0Â m/s), and a landing speed of no more than 100Â mph (160Â km/h).[4] Korean War experience had demonstrated that 0.50Â inch (12.7Â mm) machine guns were no longer sufficient and as the result the new fighter was to carry a 20Â mm (0.79Â in) cannon. In response, the Vought team led by John Russell Clark, created the V-383. Unusual for a fighter, the aircraft had a high-mounted wing which necessitated the use of a fuselage-mounted short and light landing gear.",
