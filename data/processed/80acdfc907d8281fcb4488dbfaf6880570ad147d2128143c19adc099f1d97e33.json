				"previous": "On 9 January 2009 Cirrus announced that it would lay off 50 administrative employees and extend the lay off period for 100 of the 500 employees laid off over Christmas 2008. Company spokesman Bill King stated that the cuts were necessary or else the company would not survive the current economic crisis.[48]",
				"after": "In early February 2009, the company's new CEO, Brent Wouters, indicated that the future of the company would likely hinge on the Vision SF50 jet design as production of the piston single-engine SR-series had fallen to 20% of its 2008 rate of 16 aircraft per week. Wouters characterized demand for new aircraft as \"awful\" and added, \"We are increasing our focus on the jet, because that is going to be our future engine for growth in my estimation.\"[49]",
