				"previous": "In 1967, the city and the airlines began work on a plan for development of Atlanta Municipal Airport.[citation needed] Construction began on the present midfield terminal in January 1977 under the administration of Mayor Maynard Jackson. It was the largest construction project in the South, costing $500 million. The complex was designed by Stevens & Wilkinson, Smith Hinchman & Grylls, and Minority Airport Architects & Planners.[20] Named for former Atlanta mayor William Berry Hartsfield, who did much to promote air travel, William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport opened on September 21, 1980, on-time and under budget.[21] It was designed to accommodate up to 55 million passengers per year and covered 2.5 million square feet (230,000 mÂ²). In December 1984 a 9,000-foot (2,700Â m) fourth parallel runway was completed and another runway was extended to 11,889 feet (3,624Â m) the following year.[17]",
				"after": "Although Eastern was a larger airline than Delta until airline deregulation in 1978, Delta was early to adopt the hub and spoke route system, with Atlanta as its primary hub between the Midwest and Florida, giving it an advantage in the Atlanta market. Eastern ceased operations in 1991 due to labor issues leaving Delta with the only major airline hub in Atlanta. American Airlines considered establishing an Atlanta hub around the time of Eastern's demise, but determined that Delta was already too strong there and that the competitive environment was more favorable at Eastern's other hub in Miami.[22]",
