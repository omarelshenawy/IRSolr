It is not known when active use of the monument and Buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased. Sometime between 928 and 1006, King Mpu Sindok moved the capital of the Medang Kingdom to the region of East Java after a series of volcanic eruptions; it is not certain whether this influenced the abandonment, but several sources mention this as the most likely period of abandonment.[7][20] The monument is mentioned vaguely as late as ca. 1365, in Mpu Prapanca's Nagarakretagama, written during the Majapahit era and mentioning \"the vihara in Budur\".[30] Soekmono (1976) also mentions the popular belief that the temples were disbanded when the population converted to Islam in the 15th century.[7]",
