				"previous": "The Curtiss H-4s were soon found to have a number of problems; they were underpowered, their hulls were too weak for sustained operations and they had poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off.[8][9] One flying boat pilot, Major Theodore Douglas Hallam, wrote that they were \"comic machines, weighing well under two tons; with two comic engines giving, when they functioned, 180 horsepower; and comic control, being nose heavy with engines on and tail heavy in a glide.\"[10]",
				"after": "At Felixstowe, Porte made advances in flying boat design and developed a practical hull design with the distinctive \"Felixstowe notch\".[11] Porte's first design to be implemented in Felixstowe was the Felixstowe Porte Baby, a large, three-engined biplane flying-boat, powered by one central pusher and two outboard tractor Rolls-Royce Eagle engines.",
