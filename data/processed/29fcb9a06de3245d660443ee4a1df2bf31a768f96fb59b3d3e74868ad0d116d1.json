				"previous": "Of course, Farsari did not work in isolation. The works (particularly those that were hand-coloured) and practices of the many foreign and Japanese commercial photographers who operated in Yokohama from the 1860s to the 1880s have been termed Yokohama shashin (literally, \"Yokohama photographs\" or \"photography\"). Farsari and its other practitioners â notably Beato, Stillfried, Tamamura, Kusakabe Kimbei, Ogawa Kazumasa, and Uchida Kuichi â produced works that in their subject matter, composition and colouring present a striking combination of the conventions and techniques of Western photography with those of Japanese artistic traditions, particularly ukiyo-e.[22] These photographers also provided the key images by which Meiji-era Japan and the Japanese were known to people in other countries.[23] Interestingly, their images also changed the ways in which Japanese saw their own country. Through their images, foreign photographers publicised sites that interested them, sometimes drawing Japanese attention to hitherto neglected locations. One was the now-important \"Daibutsu\" (great Buddha) at KÅtoku-in, Kamakura.[24] In a similar vein, Farsari's and others' photographs of the mausoleums of TÅshÅ-gÅ« made the once restricted site familiar to a wider audience.[25]",
