				"after": "Eight councillors and a mayor make up the Lethbridge City Council. City voters elect a new government every four years. The last election was October 21, 2013. Lethbridge does not have a ward system, so the mayor and all councillors are elected at large.[87] The 2009â2011 operating budget of the City of Lethbridge was C$250â278Â million, more than half of which came from property tax.[88] One Member of Parliament (MP) representing Lethbridge sits in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and two members of Alberta's legislative assembly (MLAs), representing Lethbridge-East (PC) and Lethbridge-West (PC), sit in the legislative assembly in Edmonton.",
