				"previous": "TWA operated their 40 4-0-4s under the name \"Skyliner\" on scheduled services in the eastern part of the USA between 1 September 1950 and the last flight on 29 April 1961.[2] EAL operated their 4-0-4s in the eastern USA using the class name \"Silver Falcon\". The first EAL schedule was flown on 5 January 1952 and retirement came in late 1962.[3]",
				"after": "Later in their airline career, as they became displaced from the EAL and TWA fleets by turbine-powered aircraft, the 4-0-4s became popular with \"second level\" operators who needed to replace their Douglas DC-3s.[4] One of the last 'major' US airlines with a large fleet of piston engined airliners was Southern Airways who operated 25 model 4-0-4s on a network of scheduled services from Atlanta in October 1961, all ex-Eastern Airlines aircraft.[5] Southern Airways' last 4-0-4 service was flown on 30 April 1978.[6] Martin 4-0-4s were also flown by Piedmont Airlines (former TWA airliners), Ozark Air Lines and Mohawk Airlines during the 1960s. Most of these planes were replaced in 1968 with Fairchild-Hiller/Fokker FH-227B aircraft. In February 2008 the last airworthy 4-0-4, an ex TWA aircraft, was ferried to the Planes of Fame Museum in Valle, Arizona.[7]",
