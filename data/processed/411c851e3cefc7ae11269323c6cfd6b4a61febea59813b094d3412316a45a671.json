				"after": "The DC-8-40 was essentially the -30 but with 17,500Â lb (78.4Â kN) Rolls-Royce Conway 509 turbofan engines for better efficiency, less noise and less smoke. The Conway was an improvement over the turbojets that preceded it, but the Series 40 sold poorly because of the traditional reluctance of U.S. airlines to buy a foreign product and because the still more advanced Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofan was due in early 1961. The DC-8-41 and DC-8-42 had weights of 300,000 and 310,000 pounds (140,000 and 140,000Â kg) respectively, The 315,000-pound (142,880Â kg) DC-8-43 had the 1.5Â° flap setting of the -33 and introduced a 4% leading edge wing extension to reduce drag and increase fuel capacity slightly â the new wing improved range by 8%, lifting capacity by 3.3Â tons (3Â tonnes), and cruising speed by better than 10 knots (19Â km/h; 12Â mph). It was used on all later DC-8s. The first DC-8-40 was delivered in 1960; 32 were built.[citation needed]",
