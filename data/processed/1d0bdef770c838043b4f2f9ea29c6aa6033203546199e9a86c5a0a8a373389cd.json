				"previous": "where Î¸ is the tangent of the Poiseuille parabola intersecting the wall. Although LÃ©vÃªque's solution was specific to heat transfer into a Poiseuille flow, his insight helped lead other scientists to an exact solution of the thermal boundary-layer problem.[4] Schuh observed that in a boundary-layer, u is again a linear function of y, but that in this case, the wall tangent is a function of x.[5] He expressed this with a modified version of LÃ©vÃªque's profile,",
				"after": "This results in a very good approximation, even for low numbers, so that only liquid metals with much less than 1 cannot be treated this way.[4] In 1962, Kestin and Persen published a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions.[6] For the problem of a flat plate with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature at any point in the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function.[3] Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.[7]",
