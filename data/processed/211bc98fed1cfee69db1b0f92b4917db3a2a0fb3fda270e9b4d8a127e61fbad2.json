				"after": "The appearance of the woolly mammoth is probably the best known of any prehistoric animal due to the many frozen specimens with preserved soft tissue and depictions by contemporary humans in their art. Fully grown males reached shoulder heights between 2.7 and 3.4Â m (9 and 11Â ft) and weighed up to 6 tonnes (6.6 short tons). This is almost as large as extant male African elephants, which commonly reach 3â3.4Â m (9.8â11.2Â ft), and is less than the size of the earlier mammoth species M. meridionalis and M. trogontherii, and the contemporary M. columbi. The reason for the smaller size is unknown. Female woolly mammoths averaged 2.6â2.9Â m (8.5â9.5Â ft) in height and were built more lightly than males, weighing up to 4 tonnes (4.4 short tons). A newborn calf would have weighed about 90Â kg (200Â lb). These sizes are deduced from comparison with modern elephants of similar size.[29] Few frozen specimens have preserved genitals, so the gender is usually determined through examination of the skeleton. The best indication of sex is the size of the pelvic girdle, as the birth canal is always wider in females than in males.[30] Though the mammoths on Wrangel Island were smaller than those of the mainland, their size varied, and they were not small enough to be considered \"dwarves\".[31] It has been claimed that the last woolly mammoth populations decreased in size and increased their sexual dimorphism, but this was dismissed in a 2012 study.[32]",
