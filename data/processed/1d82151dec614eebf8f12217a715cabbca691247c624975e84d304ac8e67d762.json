				"previous": "In 1966, the French author HervÃ© Bazin proposed a series of six innovative punctuation marks in his book Plumons lâOiseau (âLet's pluck the birdâ, 1966).[18] These were:[19]",
				"after": "An international patent application was filed, and published in 1992 under WO number WO9219458,[20] for two new punctuation marks: the âquestion commaâ and the âexclamation commaâ. The question comma is a comma in place of the dot underneath the curve of a question mark, while the exclamation comma has a comma in place of the point at the bottom of an exclamation mark. These were intended for use as question and exclamation marks within a sentence, a function for which normal question and exclamation marks can also be used, but which may be considered obsolescent. The patent application entered into national phase exclusively with Canada, advertised as lapsing in Australia on 27 January 1994[21] and in Canada on 6 November 1995.[22]",
