				"previous": "The blue dots represent pulses of light. One cycle of light-pulses between two green ships takes two seconds of \"green time\", one second for each leg.",
				"after": "One of the red ships emits a light pulse towards the greens every second of red time. These pulses are received by ships of the green fleet with two-second intervals as measured in green time. Not shown in the animation is that all aspects of physics are proportionally involved. The light pulses that are emitted by the reds at a particular frequency as measured in red time are received at a lower frequency as measured by the detectors of the green fleet that measure against green time, and vice versa.",
