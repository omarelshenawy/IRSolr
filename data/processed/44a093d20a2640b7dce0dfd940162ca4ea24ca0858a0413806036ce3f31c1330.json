The statue, entitled \"Riding Into the Sunset\", has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950, by Rogers' longtime friend Amon G. Carter.[190] Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue, and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of West Texas.[191] The statue, estimated to cost $25,000 ($239,000 in 2013 dollars) when it was dedicated, stands 9Â feet 11Â inches (3.02Â m) and weighs 3,200 pounds (1,500Â kg).[192] The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: \"Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset.\"[193]",
