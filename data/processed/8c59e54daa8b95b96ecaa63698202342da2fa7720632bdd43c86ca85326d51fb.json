				"previous": "Richard Chenevix Trench (1807-1886) played the key role in the project's first months, but his Church of England appointment as Dean of Westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time it required; he withdrew, and Herbert Coleridge became the first editor.[17]:8â9",
				"after": "On 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published, and research started. His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54-pigeon-hole grid.[17]:9 In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of tuberculosis, aged 30.[16]:x",
