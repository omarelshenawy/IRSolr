				"previous": "Following family tradition, Ibn KhaldÅ«n strove for a political career. In the face of a tumultuous political situation in North Africa, this required a high degree of skill developing and dropping alliances prudently, to avoid falling with the short-lived regimes of the time.[citation needed] Ibn KhaldÅ«n's autobiography is the story of an adventure, in which he spends time in prison, reaches the highest offices and falls again into exile.[citation needed]",
				"after": "At the age of 20, he began his political career at the Chancellery of the Tunisian ruler Ibn Tafrakin with the position of KÄtib al-'AlÄmah, which consisted of writing in fine calligraphy the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, AbÅ« Ziad, the Sultan of Constantine, marched on Tunis and defeated it. Ibn KhaldÅ«n, in any case unhappy with his respected but politically meaningless position, followed his teacher Abili to Fez. Here the Marinid sultan AbÅ« Inan Fares I appointed him as a writer of royal proclamations, which didn't prevent Ibn KhaldÅ«n from scheming against his employer. In 1357 this brought the 25-year-old a 22-month prison sentence. Upon the death of AbÅ« Inan in 1358, the vizier al-HasÄn ibn-Umar granted him freedom and reinstated him in his rank and offices. Ibn KhaldÅ«n then schemed against AbÅ« Inan's successor, AbÅ« Salem Ibrahim III, with AbÅ« Salem's exiled uncle, AbÅ« Salem. When AbÅ« Salem came to power, he gave Ibn KhaldÅ«n a ministerial position, the first position which corresponded with Ibn KhaldÅ«n's ambitions.",
