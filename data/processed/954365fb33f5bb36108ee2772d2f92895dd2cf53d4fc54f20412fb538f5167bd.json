				"after": "The Aviadvigatel company and engine manufacturer Perm Engine Company work on a new engine, without fan and core flows mixing, with a thrust in the 122-153Â kN (27,500-34,500Â lb) thrust range. Aviadvigatel mentions it would be an upgraded version of the PS-12 engine (an uprated variant of PS-90A engine) that features a classic two-shaft high-bypass architecture. The PD-14 will have a gas-generator design from the PS-12 which includes an eight-stage high-pressure compressor and two-stage high-pressure turbine. Its low-pressure section will have four stages and the fan diameter will be 1.9m. The new engine will deliver a 10-15% reduction in fuel burn compared with the CFM International CFM56. Aviadvigatel indicates that the PD-14 will not only be used for the MS-21 family, but also for upgraded derivatives of the Tupolev Tu-204, a modernized and upgraded version of the Ilyushin Il-76 freighter, or the UAC/HAL Il-214/IndoRussian MTA multirole aircraft.[5]",
