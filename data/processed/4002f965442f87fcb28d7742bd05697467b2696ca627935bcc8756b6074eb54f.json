				"after": "Postwar recovery was different in the two Koreas. South Korea stagnated in the first postwar decade. In 1953, South Korea and the United States concluded a Mutual Defense Treaty. In 1960, the April Revolution occurred and students joined an anti-Syngman Rhee demonstration; 142 were killed by police; in consequence Syngman Rhee resigned and left for exile in the United States.[345] Park Chung-hee's May 16 coup enabled social stability. In the 1960s, prostitution and related services earned 25 percent of South Korean GNP.[346] From 1965 to 1973, South Korea dispatched troops to Vietnam and got $235,560,000 allowance and military procurement from the United States.[347] GNP increased fivefold during the Vietnam War.[347] South Korea industrialized and modernized. Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped.[348][349] South Korea had one of the world's fastest-growing economies from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. In 1957 South Korea had a lower per capita GDP than Ghana,[350] and by 2010 it was ranked thirteenth in the world (Ghana was 86th).[351]",
