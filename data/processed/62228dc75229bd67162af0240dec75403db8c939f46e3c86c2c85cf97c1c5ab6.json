The city was originally built on seven hills, but it now spans over an area of nineteen hills (each known as a Jabal, TÃ¡l, Mount or Mountain). The main areas of Amman gain their names from the hills and mountains on whose slopes they lie. The city's elevation changes from mountain to mountain. They range from 700 to 1,100Â m (2,300â3,600Â feet).",
