				"after": "After the end of World War II, the Chetniks were banned in the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 29 November 1945, King Peter II was deposed by the Yugoslav Constituent Assembly after an overwhelming referendum result. Chetnik leaders either escaped the country or were arrested by the authorities. On 13 March 1946, MihailoviÄ was captured by OZNA, the Yugoslav security agency. He was put on trial, found guilty of high treason against Yugoslavia, sentenced to death and then executed by firing squad on 17 July.[135] In 1947, ÄujiÄ was tried and sentenced in absentia for war crimes by Yugoslavia.[136] He was declared a war criminal who as commander of the Dinara Division was responsible for organizing and carrying out a series of mass murders, massacres, tortures, rapes, robberies, and imprisonments, and collaborating with the German and Italian occupiers.[137] He was accused of being responsible for the deaths of 1,500 people during the war.[138] Following his arrival in the United States, ÄujiÄ and his fighters played a role in the foundation of the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks.[139][136] Other Chetniks factions found their way to midwestern United States, especially in Chicago, and also in Australia.[140]",
