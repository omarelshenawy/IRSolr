				"after": "The compound Mahandrihono (\"knows how to wait\") is the most expansive and well-preserved of the rova structures at Ambohimanga.[15] It lies to the east of the central courtyard and sits at a higher elevation than Bevato, symbolically representing its greater political significance. It was first established by Andriambelomasina in the early 18th century during the reign of his father, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriambelomasina surrounded the compound with a stone wall and within it built three houses as residences for his childrenâtwo twin houses (tranokambana) set side by side named Mahandry (\"knows how to wait\") and Tsararay (\"has a good father\"), and a third named Manandraimanjaka (\"has a father who rules\")âtaking pains to illustrate through the names of these houses that he had no intention of usurping his father. When Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana eventually died, Andriambelomasina entombed him behind the twin houses.[12] In Andrianampoinimerina's time this compound corresponded with the Mahandrihono compound at the rova in Antananarivo, being reserved for the king alone with his residence positioned beside the tombs of the ancestors.[26]",
