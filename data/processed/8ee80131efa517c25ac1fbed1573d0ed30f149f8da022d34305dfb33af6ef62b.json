This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones on top of the snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features.[5] It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus,[1] an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000.[4] Most studies have found it to be a member of the related family Carcharodontosauridae.[5][9][10]",
