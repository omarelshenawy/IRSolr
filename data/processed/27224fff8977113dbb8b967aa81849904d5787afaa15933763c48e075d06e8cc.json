				"previous": "As part of a study on adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were introduced to the island of Desecheo and other southern off-shore islands and cays in 1967.[18] Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals.[18]",
				"after": "Arguably the best known of aquatic mammals occurring in Puerto Rican waters is the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) which is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. The archipelago's waters are one of the species' main breeding areas. Manatees gathered local media attention when a two-month manatee nicknamed MoisÃ©s was rescued and raised for 27 months by the Caribbean Stranding Network (CSN). MoisÃ©s was the first successful release of an orphaned, captive-raised manatee to the marine environment in the Caribbean.[19] The animal became a Puerto Rican cultural, as well as scientific, icon when Tony Croatto wrote a song titled \"MoisÃ©s\". A municipality of Puerto Rico, ManatÃ­ is believed to be named after the species.",
