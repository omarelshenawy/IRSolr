				"after": "The Mascarene parrot was first mentioned by the French traveller Sieur Dubois in his 1674 travelogue and only described a few times from life afterwards. At least three live specimens were brought to France in the late 18th century and kept in captivity, two of which were described while alive.[2] Today, two stuffed specimens exist. The holotype, specimen MNHN 211, is in the MusÃ©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, while the other, specimen NMW 50.688, is in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna. The latter specimen was bought from the Leverian Museum during a sale in London in 1806.[2] A third stuffed specimen existed around the turn of the 18th century.[3]",
