				"previous": "The Akash (Sanskrit: Sky or ether) is a medium-range surface-to-air missile system consisting of the command guidance ramjet powered Akash along with the dedicated service specific launchers, battery control radar (the Rajendra Block III), a Central Acquisition radar, battery and group control centres.[12].[88] The Akash project has yielded spinoffs like the Central Acquisition radar and Weapon Locating radar.",
				"after": "The Akash system cleared its user trials with the Indian Air Force in 2007. The user trials had the Akash intercept flying targets at ITR, Chandipur. The Akash missile successfully hit its targets in all of the tests.[89] The Indian Air force has since been satisfied with the performance of the missile and ordered two squadrons of the Akash, with a squadron having eight launchers[90][91][92]",
