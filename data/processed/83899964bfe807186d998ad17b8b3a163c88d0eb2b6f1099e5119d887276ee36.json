				"previous": "Along with the chosen cruising air speed, the time taken by a flight depends mainly on the speed and direction of the winds at flight level, which can result in a tailwind, headwind, or crosswind at various points of the flight, and the ATC route. Flights crossing the middle latitudes often encounter the jet stream, which typically flows in a general eastward direction. As a result, flights traveling from west to east often experience a tailwind and have shorter flight times than for flights traveling from east to west, which experience a headwind. Flight schedules account for this effect in an average sense, but when the jet stream is stronger or weaker than normal, or takes an unusual direction, large differences can occur from scheduled flight times.",
