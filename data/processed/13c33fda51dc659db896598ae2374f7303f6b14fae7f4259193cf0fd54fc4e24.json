				"after": "A sculptor for her entire artistic career, Oliver used paper, cane or fibreglass for her early works.[4][31] However, she found \"fibreglass hazardous and paper too impermanent\",[32] and for most of her career she worked in metal. The metals used for her creations varied: the monumental Vine was fabricated in aluminium, as was the Brisbane sculpture Big Feathers; however most, such as Palm and the 2002 sculpture Lock, were crafted in copper.[3][18][33] All 25 works included in the 1995 publication, Bronwyn Oliver: mnemonic chords, were made in copper, though a handful also utilised other materials such as bronze, lead or, in one case, fibreglass.[34]",
