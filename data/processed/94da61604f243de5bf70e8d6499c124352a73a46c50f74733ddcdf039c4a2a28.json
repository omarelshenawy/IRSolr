				"after": "Mating starts in late autumn and continues to the end of winter.[60] Little is known about mating behaviour or breeding grounds. Females typically give birth once every two to three years at the start of the winter after a gestation period of 10 to 12Â months.[60] The calf weighs about 2.5 tonnes (2.8 short tons) and is around 7 metres (23Â ft) in length. Blue whale calves drink 380â570Â litres (100â150 U.S. gallons) of milk a day. Blue whale milk has an energy content of about 18,300 kJ/kg (4,370 kcal/kg).[61] The calf is weaned after six months, by which time it has doubled in length. Sexual maturity is typically reached at five to ten years of age. In the Northern Hemisphere, whaling records show that males averaged 20â21Â m (66â69Â ft) and females 21â23Â m (69â75Â ft) at sexual maturity,[62] while in the Southern Hemisphere it was 22.6 and 24Â m (74 and 79Â ft), respectively.[63] In the Northern Hemisphere, as adults, males averaged 24Â m (79Â ft) and females 25Â m (82Â ft), while in the Southern Hemisphere males averaged 25Â m (82Â ft) and females 26.5Â m (87Â ft).[62][63] In the eastern North Pacific, photogrammetric studies have shown sexually mature (but not necessarily fully grown) blue whales today average 21.6Â m (71Â ft), with a maximum of over 24.4Â m (80Â ft)[64] â although a 26.5Â m (87Â ft) female stranded near Pescadero, California in 1979.[65]",
