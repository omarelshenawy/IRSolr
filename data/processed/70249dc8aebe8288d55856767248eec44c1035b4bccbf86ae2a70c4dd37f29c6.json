				"after": "After Stalin's 1953 death, a period of de-Stalinization followed, with reformist Imre Nagy replacing Hungarian Stalinist dictator MÃ¡tyÃ¡s RÃ¡kosi.[215] Responding to popular demand, in October 1956, the government appointed the recently rehabilitated reformist WÅadysÅaw GomuÅka as First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, with a mandate to negotiate trade concessions and troop reductions with the Soviet government. After a few tense days of negotiations, on 19 October, the Soviets finally gave in to GomuÅka's reformist requests.[216]",
