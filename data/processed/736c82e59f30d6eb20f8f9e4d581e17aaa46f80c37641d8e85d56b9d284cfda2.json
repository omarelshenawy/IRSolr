				"previous": "The Italian physicist and astronomer Galileo brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to analyze motion in terms of distance traveled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newtonâs laws were superseded by Albert Einsteinâs theory of relativity. For atomic and subatomic particles, Newtonâs laws were superseded by quantum theory. For everyday phenomena, however, Newtonâs three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.",
				"after": "Relativistic corrections are also needed for quantum mechanics, although general relativity has not been integrated. The two theories remain incompatible, a hurdle which must be overcome in developing a theory of everything.",
