				"previous": "On 6 June 2007, Aer Lingus strengthened its relationship with the European manufacturer by ordering six of the new A350-900 and six A330-300. These will be used to expand long-haul operations as well as replacement aircraft for three older models. Deliveries of the A330 began in February 2009 and in 2011 Aer Lingus switched the remaining three A330 orders to the A350-900 model, with delivery no sooner than 2017. The deliveries of the six A350-900 is expected to begin in 2015.[2]",
			"after": [
				"In preparation for the commercial flotation of Aer Lingus on the Dublin stock market, the Irish government agreed to abolish the Shannon Stopover from the end of 2006 in stages.",
				"The company began conditional (or \"grey-market\") share dealings on 27 September 2006 and was formally admitted to the Official Lists of the Irish Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange on 2 October 2006. At the time of the flotation the Irish government maintained a 28% shareholding, while employees held 15%. The stock IPO offer price was E2.20. It has risen as high as E3.28 (March 2007) and is now trading around E1.00, suffering from the general economic downturn, oil price hikes, and repeated staff industrial disputes.[20][21]"
