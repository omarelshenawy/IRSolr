				"previous": "In the western Palaearctic, there is evidence of population decline, but at a level below the threshold required for global conservation concern (i.e., a reduction in numbers of more than 30% in ten years or three generations) and the IUCN Red List categorises this species as of \"Least Concern\".[1] In Great Britain and the Netherlands, there has been a more than 50% decline in population and the song thrush is included in regional Red Lists.[20][35] The decreases are greatest in farmlands (73% since the mid-1970s) and believed to be due to changes in agricultural practices in recent decades.[5] The precise reasons for the decline are not known but may be related to the loss of hedgerows, a move to sowing crops in autumn rather than spring, and possibly the increased use of pesticides. These changes may have reduced the availability of food and of nest sites.[36] In gardens, the use of poison bait to control slugs and snails may pose a threat[26] and in urban areas, some thrushes are killed while using the hard surface of roads to smash snails.[37]",
				"after": "The song thrush's characteristic song, with melodic phrases repeated twice or more, is described by the nineteenth-century British poet Robert Browning in his poem Home Thoughts, from Abroad:",
