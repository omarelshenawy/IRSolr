				"previous": "The Outer Khalkha Mongols had preserved their independence, and only paid tribute to the Qing Empire. However, a conflict between the houses of TÃ¼men Jasagtu Khan and TÃ¶sheetÃ¼ Khan led to a dispute between the Khalkha and the Dzungars over the influence of Tibetan Buddhism. In 1688, as the Khalkhas were fighting wars with Russian Cossacks in the north of their territory, the Dzungar chief, Galdan Boshugtu Khan, attacked the Khalkha from the west and invaded their territory. The Khalkha royal families and the first Jebtsundamba Khutuktu crossed the Gobi Desert and sought help from the Qing Empire in return for submission to Qing authority. In 1690, the Dzungars and Qing forces clashed at the Battle of Ulaan Butun in Inner Mongolia, in which the Qing eventually emerged as the victor.",
				"after": "In 1696, Kangxi personally led three armies, totaling 80,000 in strength, in a campaign against the Dzungars in the First OiratâManchu War. The western section of the Qing army defeated Galdan's forces at the Battle of Jao Modo and Galdan died in the following year.",
