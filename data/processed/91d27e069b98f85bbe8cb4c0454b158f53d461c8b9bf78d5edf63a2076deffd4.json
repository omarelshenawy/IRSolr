				"after": "Dry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems which display a stable behaviour in the absence of friction.[37] These instabilities may be caused by the decrease of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and JoÃ£o ArmÃ©nio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces [38][39] and were later found in periodic rough surfaces.[40] In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' of a glass harp,[41][42] phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.[43]",
