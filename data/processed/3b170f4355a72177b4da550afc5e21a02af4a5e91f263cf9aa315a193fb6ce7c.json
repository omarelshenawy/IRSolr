				"previous": "Much of the state of Florida is situated on a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits of Florida. Spanning two time zones, it extends to the northwest into a panhandle, extending along the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is bordered on the north by the states of Georgia and Alabama, and on the west, at the end of the panhandle, by Alabama. It is near several Caribbean countries, particularly The Bahamas and Cuba. Florida is one of the largest states east of the Mississippi River, and only Alaska and Michigan are larger in water area. The water boundary is 3 nautical miles (3.5Â mi; 5.6Â km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean[22] and 9 nautical miles (10Â mi; 17Â km) offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.[22]",
				"after": "At 345 feet (105Â m) above mean sea level, Britton Hill is the highest point in Florida and the lowest highpoint of any U.S. state.[23] Much of the state south of Orlando lies at a lower elevation than northern Florida, and is fairly level. Much of the state is at or near sea level.",
