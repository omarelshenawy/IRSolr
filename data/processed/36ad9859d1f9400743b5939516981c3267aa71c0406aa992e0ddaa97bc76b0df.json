				"previous": "In 1995, United became the first airline to introduce the Boeing 777 in commercial service.[33] In 1997, United co-founded the Star Alliance airline partnership. In May 2000, United announced a planned US$11.6Â billion acquisition of US Airways, but withdrew the offer in July 2001 before the United States Department of Justice barred the merger on antitrust grounds.[20][34] May 2000 also saw a bitter contract dispute between United and its pilots' union over pay cuts and concessions to fund the ESOP and overtime work, causing summer flight cancellations until a salary increase was agreed upon.[35]",
				"after": "During the September 11, 2001 attacks, two of the four airliners hijacked and crashed by al-Qaeda members were United Airlines aircraft (United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the south World Trade Center tower; United Airlines Flight 93 was crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers fought back against the hijackers). An airline industry downturn resulted, and coupled with economic difficulties, skyrocketing oil prices, and higher labor costs, the company lost US$2.14Â billion in 2001. In the same year United applied for a US$1.5Â billion loan guarantee from the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board established in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[36] After attempts to secure additional capital failed, UAL Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2002 and the ESOP was terminated.[37]",
