				"previous": "The Chuvash Wikipedia accepts fair use content and is generally quite liberal on what content is allowed. One thing which serves as an exception is categorization or listing of people based on their ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Such categories are generally prohibited unless the category is relevant to the main activity of a person.",
				"after": "The Chuvash Wikipedia was created on November 22, 2004. Jimmy Wales used it at Wikimania 2009 as an example of the value of Wikipedia for the languages on the verge of extinction.[2]",
