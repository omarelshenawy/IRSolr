				"after": "The Pisco Sour originated in Lima, Peru.[17][1][18] It was created in the early 1920s by bartender Victor Vaughen Morris, an American who had lived in Peru for several decades. His saloon, Morris' Bar, was popular with both the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners.[19][20] Chilean historian Gonzalo Vial Correa also attributes the Pisco Sour's invention to Gringo Morris from the Peruvian Morris Bar, but with the minor difference of naming him William Morris.[21] Morris often experimented with new drinks, and developed the Pisco Sour as a variety of the Whiskey Sour.[1]",
