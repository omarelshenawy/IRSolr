				"after": "Historically, Illinois was long a major swing state, with near-parity existing between the Republican and the Democratic parties. However, in recent elections, the Democratic Party has gained ground and Illinois has come to be seen as a \"blue\" state in presidential contests.[124][125] Chicago and most of Cook County votes have long been strongly Democratic. However, the \"collar counties\" (the suburbs surrounding Chicago's Cook County, Illinois), can be seen as a Republican stronghold, though the party's strength has weakened in recent decades.[126][127]",
