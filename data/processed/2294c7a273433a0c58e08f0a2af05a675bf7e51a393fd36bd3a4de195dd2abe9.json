				"previous": "The highest free-falling waterfall in the state, Williamsport Falls, is located in downtown Williamsport; a stream named Fall Creek flows through the town and falls 90 feet (27Â m) over a sandstone ledge less than 1,000 feet (300Â m) from the county courthouse.[42] Northeast of Independence is the Black Rock Barrens Nature Preserve, a rare siltstone glade area that, with the adjacent Weiler-Leopold Nature Reserve, supports a diversity of flora including sessile trillium, phlox and wild hyacinth in the moist lowlands and serviceberry, rue anemone, birdsfoot violet and yellow pimpernel on the drier slopes.[43][44][45] Big Pine Creek, the county's largest waterway after the Wabash River, is designated by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources as a scenic canoe trail and passes near Fall Creek Gorge Nature Preserve, an area of cascades and potholes.[46]",
				"after": "According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of 366.40 square miles (949.0Â km2), of which 364.68 square miles (944.5Â km2) (or 99.53%) is land and 1.72 square miles (4.5Â km2) (or 0.47%) is water.[47] Elevations in the county range from 480 feet (150Â m) above sea level where the Wabash River enters Vermillion County to 830 feet (250Â m) in northeastern Prairie Township.[48] The landscape consists mostly of flat or gently sloping moraine overlaying silty and loamy glacial till, except along the Wabash River where sand, gravel, sandstone and shale are exposed.[49] Various forms of silt loam constitute most of the county's soil[50] and are conducive to agriculture.[7] Forests cover about 14% of the county,[51] mainly around major waterways,[52] and consist principally of deciduous hardwoods among which mapleâbeech and oakâhickory forests are the most common.[53] The only coal mines in the county are located in the southeastern part of Steuben Township, near the Wabash River.[54]",
