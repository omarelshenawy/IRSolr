				"after": "Born in the western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, Miller was the youngest of Leslie and Edith Miller's four children.[7][8][9] He was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers Keith and Ross Smith,[9][10] who were half-way through their historic flight from England to Australia at the time Miller was born.[5][7] The three Miller boys played Australian rules football in winter and cricket in summer. Their father had been a successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique,[8] relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford.[11] At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south east.[11][12] As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.[13][14]",
