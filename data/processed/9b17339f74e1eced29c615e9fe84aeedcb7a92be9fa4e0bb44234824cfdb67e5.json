				"after": "Nuthatches are monogamous, and a pair occupies a breeding territory in which it spends the winter as well.[3] Territory sizes range from 2â10Â ha (5â25 acres) in Europe to an average of 30.2Â ha (75 acres) in the sub-optimal conifer forests of Siberia.[15] The male sings to defend his territory and attract a mate. Both sexes have a courtship display with a floating, quivering flight, and the male will also make circular flights with a spread tail and raised head. He will also feed the female while courting her.[10] Despite the lifelong pairing, genetic research in Germany showed that at least 10% of the young in the study area were fathered by another male, usually from an adjacent territory.[16]",
