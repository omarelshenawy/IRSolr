				"after": "Since its inception, Virgin Blue had sponsored many sporting teams in a bid to promote its brand. In February 2007, Virgin Blue signed a two-year sponsorship deal with NRL team the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Rabbitohs are the first rugby league team Virgin Australia has sponsored.[43] Boeing 737â800 VH-VUA has slight changes to its livery to commemorate this sponsorship. The Australian flag held by the \"Virgin Girl\" is replaced by the Rabbitohs' flag. Virgin Australia is also the official sponsor of the National Basketball League (NBL), and the title sponsor of NBL team the Brisbane Bullets.",
