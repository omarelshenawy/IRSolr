				"previous": "In 1997 Virginia Morell renamed a related Chinese form, Sinosauropteryx prima, into a Compsognathus prima;[33] this has found no general acceptance.",
				"after": "The genus Compsognathus gives its name to the family Compsognathidae, a group composed mostly of small dinosaurs from the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods of China, Europe and South America.[26] For many years it was the only member known; however in recent decades paleontologists have discovered several related genera. The clade includes Aristosuchus,[34] Huaxiagnathus,[35] Mirischia,[36] Sinosauropteryx,[9][37] and perhaps Juravenator[38] and Scipionyx.[39] At one time, Mononykus was proposed as a member of the family, but this was rejected by Chen and coauthors in a 1998 paper; they considered the similarities between Mononykus and the compsognathids to be an example of convergent evolution.[7] The position of Compsognathus and its relatives within the coelurosaur group is uncertain. Some, such as theropod expert Thomas Holtz Jr. and co-authors Ralph Molnar and Phil Currie in the landmark 2004 text Dinosauria, hold the family as the most basal of the coelurosaurs,[40] while others as part of the Maniraptora.[41][42]",
