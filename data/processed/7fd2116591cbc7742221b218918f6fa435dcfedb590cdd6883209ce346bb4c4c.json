				"after": "\"Speechless\" is a song by the American recording artist Michael Jackson (pictured), included on his tenth studio album, Invincible (2001). It was released in South Korea as the lead single from the album, and elsewhere as a promotional single. The singer was inspired to write the ballad after a water balloon fight with children in Germany. Jackson collaborated on the production with musicians such as Jeremy Lubbock, Brad Buxer, Novi Novoq, Stuart Bradley and Bruce Swedien. AndraÃ© Crouch and his gospel choir provided backing vocals. Executives at Jackson's record label, Epic Records, responded positively to the track when given a preview several months before Invincibleââ'âs release. The song received mixed reviews from music critics; commentary focused on its aÂ cappellas and lyrics. A clip of Jackson singing \"Speechless\" was included in the 2009 documentary-concert film Michael Jackson's This Is It. (FullÂ article...)",
