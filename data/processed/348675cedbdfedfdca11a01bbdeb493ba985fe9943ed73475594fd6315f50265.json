				"after": "Iridium is one of the nine least abundant stable elements in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001Â ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times more abundant, platinum is 10 times more abundant, and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant.[4] Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium.[4] In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5Â ppm or more.[40] The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic (\"iron-loving\") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.[19]",
