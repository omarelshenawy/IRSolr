				"Russian is written using a Cyrillic alphabet. The Russian alphabet consists of 33 letters. The following table gives their upper case forms, along with IPA values for each letter's typical sound:",
				"Older letters of the Russian alphabet include â¨Ñ£â©, which merged to â¨Ðµâ© (/je/ or /Ê²e/); â¨Ñâ© and â¨Ñµâ©, which both merged to â¨Ð¸â© (/i/); â¨Ñ³â©, which merged to â¨Ñâ© (/f/); â¨Ñ«â©, which merged to â¨Ñâ© (/u/); â¨Ñ­â©, which merged to â¨Ñâ© (/ju/ or /Ê²u/); and â¨Ñ§/â¨Ñ©â©â©, which later were graphically reshaped into â¨Ñâ© and merged phonetically to /ja/ or /Ê²a/. While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The yers â¨Ñâ© and â¨Ñâ© originally indicated the pronunciation of ultra-short or reduced /Å­/, /Ä­/."
