				"previous": "The new clad quarters were struck without mint mark in 1965â1967, regardless of the mint of origin. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were restored. The San Francisco Mint had reopened, but from 1968, it struck quarters only for collectors, for the most part proof coins.[34] The Mint adjusted both sides of the coin for the initiation of clad coinage, lowering the relief (the modified reverse design exists on some 1964-dated silver quarters). The obverse was slightly changed in 1974, with some details sharpened.[35] Mint marks on post-1965 pieces are found on the lower right of the obverse, to the right of Washington's neck.[36]",
				"after": "In January 1973, Representative Richard C. White introduced legislation for commemorative dollars and half dollars for the 1976 United States Bicentennial.[37] On June 6, Mint Director Mary Brooks testified before a congressional committee, and responding to concerns that only the two least-popular denominations would be changed, agreed to support the temporary redesign of the quarter as well.[38] On October 18, 1973, President Richard Nixon signed legislation mandating a temporary redesign of the three denominations for all coins issued after July 4, 1975 and struck before January 1, 1977. These pieces would bear the double date 1776â1976. In addition to circulation pieces, Congress mandated that 45Â million Bicentennial coins be struck in 40%Â silver.[39] Fearful of creating low-mintage pieces which might be hoarded as the cent recently had been, thus creating a shortage of quarters, in December 1974 the Mint obtained congressional approval to continue striking 1974-dated quarters, half dollars and dollars until Bicentennial coinage began. Accordingly, there are no 1975-dated quarters.[40][41][42] Almost two billion Bicentennial quarters were struck,[43] as the Mint sought to assure that there would be plenty of souvenirs of the anniversary.[44] The Mint sold the silver sets, in both uncirculated and proof, for more than a decade before ending sales at the end of 1986.[45] Jack L. Ahr's colonial drummer, which had appeared on the Bicentennial quarter, was replaced after 1976 by Flanagan's original reverse.[34]",
