				"The mile is an English unit of length standardised as exactly 1.609344Â kilometres by international agreement in 1959.",
				"With qualifiers, \"mile\" is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the RomanÂ mile, such as the nauticalÂ mile (now 1.852Â km exactly), the ItalianÂ mile (roughly 1.852Â km), and the ChineseÂ mile (now 500Â m exactly). The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 feet but the greater importance of furlongs in pre-modern England meant that the statuteÂ mile was made equivalent to 5,280Â feet or 1,760Â yards in 1593. This form of the mile then spread to the British-colonized nations who continue to employ the mile. The US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate USÂ surveyÂ mile (6336/3937Â km) continues to see some use. While most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units, the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, Myanmar, the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with vastly less than a million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US."
