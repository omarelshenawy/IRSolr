				"previous": "At this point, Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930, scoring 2,227Â runs at an average of 131.[55] He had played 18Â innings, scoring 10Â centuries, six of which had extended beyond 200.[55] His overall scoring rate was 42Â runs per hour,[56] with 856 (or 38.5% of his tally) scored in boundaries.[55] Significantly, he had not hit a six,[55] which typified Bradman's attitude: if he hit the ball along the ground, then it could not be caught. During this phase of his career, his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a \"machine-like\" approach to batting. The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as, \"heart-breakingÂ ... with his sort of cynical grin, which rather reminds one of the SphinxÂ ... he never seems to perspire\".[57]",
				"after": "Between these two seasons, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according to the rules of the day, would have ended his Test career.[19] A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son.[19] However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.[57]",
