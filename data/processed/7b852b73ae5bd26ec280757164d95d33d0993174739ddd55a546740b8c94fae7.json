				"As of April 2015, the Xiamen Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:[6]",
				"XiamenAir now has a vast order of 70 Boeing 737-800, 30 Boeing 737MAX, and 6 Boeing 787-8, it plans to launch long haul route with the 787-8 which is supposed to be delivered on July 25, 2014. XiamenAir's first intercontinental route is likely to be Xiamen-Amsterdam, which will be a cooperation with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. KLM now operates a 3 weekly Xiamen-Amsterdam flight, and XiamenAir already has a code-share agreement with it. Analyst believes that XiamenAir is likely to profit from flying long-haul flight and building Xiamen as an international hub, but the long-haul may not be profitable initially."
