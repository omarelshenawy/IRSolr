				"previous": "On 29 June 2006, the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and AeromÃ©xico announced that the airline will operate 3 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. AeromÃ©xico will lease the 5 787-8s from ILFC with deliveries scheduled to begin in early 2012, another 2 planes on lease from ILFC will be in service by 2013, and 2 more in 2014. It was originally going to be delivered in 2010 and 2011, but it was delayed for 2 years. From 2006, Consorcio AeromÃ©xico S.A. de C.V., the parent company of AeromÃ©xico at the time, was facing large debts and could not make any profits to pay them off. This forced the company to offer AeromÃ©xico for sale in 2007. In early October, a week-long auction was held, with Grupo Financiero Banamex competing against the Saba family. Finally, in 17 October 2007, Banamex had put forward the highest bid, and the airline was sold to the bank for US$249.1 million. In October, 2010 Aeromexico's largest competitor Mexicana de Aviacion filed for bankruptcy and was placed into administration.",

				"Delta Air Lines, a US airline, signed with AeromÃ©xico for commercial alliances.",
				"On 25 July 2012, AndrÃ©s Conesa, Aeromexico CEO announced the purchase of 10 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, albeit 6 firm orders and 4 options; with this, the company will become the first Mexican carrier to have this kind of equipment. In early July 2012 it was reported that the company was looking at Airbus A320 and A350, but ultimately decided on the aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The new order is added to the package of 20 aircraft that the company had announced in 2011 and nine more Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner already provided. The delivery of the Dreamliners began in the summer of 2013. The total investment is US$11 billion and that includes the acquisition of 90 Boeing 737-8 MAX which will be delivered during 2018.[13][14] The airline took delivery of its first Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (albeit leased from ILFC) in early August 2013 and officially launched commercial service on 1 October 2013.[15]"
