				"A pixel records color at a position. The position is identified by position in the grid of pixels (x, y) and depth to the pixel z.",
				"Stereoscopic vision gives two images of the same scene, from different positions. In the diagram on the right light from the point A is transmitted through the entry points of a pinhole cameras at B and D, onto image screens at E and H."
