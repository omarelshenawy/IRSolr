				"previous": "The rock art of Australia's Indigenous peoples is the oldest and richest in the world, dating as far back as 60,000 years and spread across hundreds of thousands of sites.[297] Traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, \"the last great art movement of the 20th century\";[298] its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye.[299] During the first century of European settlement, colonial artists, trained in Europe, showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land.[300] The naturalistic, sun-filled works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and others associated with the 19th-century Heidelberg Schoolâthe first \"distinctively Australian\" movement in Western artâgave expression to a burgeoning Australian nationalism in the lead-up to Federation.[300] While the school remained influential into the new century, modernists such as Margaret Preston, and, later, Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd, explored new artistic trends.[300] The landscape remained a central subject matter for Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley and other post-World War II artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract.[300][301] The National Gallery of Australia and state galleries maintain collections of Australian and international art.[302] Australia has one of the world's highest attendances of art galleries and museums per head of population.[303]",
				"after": "Australian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions, many of which have since been recorded in writing, are much older.[305] Writers of the 19th-century Bulletin School, such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary. Their works are still very popular; Paterson's bush poem \"Waltzing Matilda\" (1895) is regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.[306] Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australia's most prestigious literary prize, awarded to the best novel about Australian life.[307] Its first recipient, Patrick White, went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.[308] Australian winners of the Man Booker Prize include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan.[309] David Malouf and David Williamson are also renowned writers[310] and Les Murray is regarded as \"one of the leading poets of his generation\".[311]",
