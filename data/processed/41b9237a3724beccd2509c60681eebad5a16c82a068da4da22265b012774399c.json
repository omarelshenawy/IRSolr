				"previous": "Olms from different cave systems differ substantially in body measurements, color and some microscopic characters. Earlier researchers used these differences to support the division into five different species, while modern herpetologists understand that external morphology is not reliable for amphibian systematics and can be extremely variable, depending on nourishment, illness, and other factors even varying among individuals in a single population. Proteus anguinus is now considered a single species. The length of the head is the most obvious difference among various populationsÂ â individuals from StiÄna, Slovenia, have shorter heads on average than those from TrÅ¾iÄ, Slovenia, and the Istrian peninsula, for example.[32]",
				"after": "The black olm (Proteus anguinus parkelj Sket & Arntzen, 1994) is the only recognized subspecies of the olm, endemic to the underground waters near Ärnomelj, Slovenia, an area smaller than 100 square kilometres (39Â sqÂ mi). It was first found in 1986 by members of the Slovenian Karst Research Institute who were exploring the water from DobliÄica karst spring in the White Carniola region.[33]",
