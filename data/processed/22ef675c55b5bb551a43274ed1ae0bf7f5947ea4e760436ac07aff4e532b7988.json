				"Let be an arbitrary matrix of complex numbers with eigenvalues , , ... . (Here it is understood that an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity occurs times in this list.) Then",
				"A matrix that is not diagonalizable is said to be defective. For defective matrices, the notion of eigenvector can be generalized to generalized eigenvectors, and that of diagonal matrix to a Jordan form matrix. Over an algebraically closed field, any matrix has a Jordan form and therefore admits a basis of generalized eigenvectors, and a decomposition into generalized eigenspaces"
