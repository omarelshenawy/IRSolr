				"previous": "Canadian adopted a short-lived new livery in January 1999, less than a year before the airline was merged into Air Canada. The livery, known as \"Proud Wings\", featured a large Canada Goose painted at the tail of the aircraft and the airline's name in a new Celeste font.[3] The new livery, however, came so late that most of the fleet still retained the existing chevron livery by the time of the merger. Until the merger process with Air Canada was completed in 2001, most Canadian aircraft featured a transition livery with an Air Canada tail design while retaining the name \"Canadian\" on the sides.",
				"after": "At the time of its acquisition by Air Canada, it operated a fleet of 163 aircraft. The following is a list of aircraft operated by both Canadian Airlines and CP Air over the years:",
