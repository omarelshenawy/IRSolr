				"Channel coding is concerned with finding such nearly optimal codes that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity.",
				"This capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate R (where R is usually bits per symbol). For any information rate R < C and coding error Îµ > 0, for large enough N, there exists a code of length N and rate â¥ R and a decoding algorithm, such that the maximal probability of block error is â¤ Îµ; that is, it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error. In addition, for any rate R > C, it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error."
