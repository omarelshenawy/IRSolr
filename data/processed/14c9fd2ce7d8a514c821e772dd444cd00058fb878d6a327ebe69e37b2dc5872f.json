				"previous": "Baseball was a reasonably popular sport in Australia in the early 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life. At the time, baseball was generally played in Australia during the winter months, as many of the leading players were enthusiastic cricketers who viewed the sport as a means of improving their fielding skills.[102] As with cricket, Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School, where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop,[103] later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching.[104]",
				"after": "Ponsford improved rapidly and by 1913 he was included in the Victorian schoolboys side for a tournament in Adelaide. He was again selected in the following yearânow as a catcherârepresenting his state at the first national schoolboys championship in Sydney.[103] The tournament coincided with a visit to Australia by two professional major league teams from the United Statesâthe Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants. The manager of the Giants, John \"Mugsy\" McGraw, watched part of the tournament; the Ponsford family claim that McGraw was so impressed with Ponsford's skills that he later spoke to Ponsford's parents about the possibility of Bill playing in the United States.[103]",
