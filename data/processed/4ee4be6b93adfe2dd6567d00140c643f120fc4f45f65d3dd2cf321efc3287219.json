All but the -55 were certified in 1961. The DC-8-51, DC-8-52 and DC-8-53 all had 17,000Â lb (76.1Â kN) JT3D-1 or 18,000Â lb (80.6Â kN) JT3D-3B engines, varying mainly in their weights: 276,000 pounds (125,200Â kg), 300,000 pounds (136,100Â kg) and 315,000 pounds (142,900Â kg) respectively. The DC-8-55 arrived in June 1964, retaining the JT3D-3B engines but with strengthened structure from the freighter versions and 325,000-pound (147,420Â kg) maximum weight. 88 DC-8-50s were built plus the 14 converted from Series 10/30.[citation needed]",
