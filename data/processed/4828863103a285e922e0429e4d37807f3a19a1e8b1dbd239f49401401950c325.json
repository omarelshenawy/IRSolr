According to the architectural drawings made for the HABS, the bottom of the L is 60Â feet 4Â inches (18.39Â m) northâsouth by 35Â feet 8Â inches (10.87Â m) eastâwest. In 1935 the ground floor of this part of the house included the main door and entrance hall, living room, parlor, library, and stairs. The main entrance is on the west side, which has a porch 60Â feet 4Â inches (18.39Â m) wide by 12 feet (3.7Â m) deep, supported by pairs of square pillars with stairs on the north, south, and west sides. The top of the L is 24Â feet 2Â inches (7.37Â m) northâsouth by 40Â feet 6Â inches (12.34Â m) eastâwest, and in 1935 the ground floor of the top of the L had the dining room, gun room, \"brush up room\", toilet, stairs, and a passage to the 1913 addition.[7] The inside corner of the L has a two-story covered porch along the south side, and an open terrace on the east side's ground floor. In 1935 the second story of the original house had four bedrooms and a bathroom in the lower part of the L and two bedrooms and a bath in the upper part, as well as two staircases and hallways.[2][7]",
				"after": "The mansion's stone walls are 2 feet (0.6Â m) thick; the individual building stones are \"field sandstone about 17Â inches square, of various thicknesses\" (17Â inches is 43Â cm).[7] There is a basement below the original house. The lower part of the L is five bays by two bays; the original double-hung sash windows in each bay of the 1850s house have six panes of glass per sash. All the original windows have shutters, these are paneled on the first floor and louvered on the second. The main door is in the Federal style with a large fanlight above the door and sidelights on either side. The attic in the 1850s part of the house is not finished, and the gable roof has \"boxed cornices with returns\".[2][7]",
