				"after": "Measuring 34â39 centimetres (13â15Â in) in length, the western jackdaw is the second smallest member of the genus Corvus.[31] Most of the plumage is a shiny black, with a purple (in subspecies monedula and spermologus) or blue (in subspecies cirtensis and soemmerringii) sheen on the crown,[32] forehead, and secondaries, and a green-blue sheen on the throat, primaries, and tail. The cheeks, nape and neck are light grey to greyish-silver, and the underparts are slate-grey. The legs are black, as is the short stout bill,[31] the length of which is about 75% of the length of the rest of the head.[32] There are rictal bristles covering around 40% of the upper mandible and 25% of the lower mandible.[32] The irises of adults are greyish or silvery white while those of juveniles are light blue, becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age.[31] The sexes look alike,[12][33] though the head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear, particularly just before moulting.[34] Western jackdaws undergo a complete moult from June to September in the western parts of their range, and a month later in the east.[26] The purplish sheen of the cap is most prominent just after moulting.[34]",
