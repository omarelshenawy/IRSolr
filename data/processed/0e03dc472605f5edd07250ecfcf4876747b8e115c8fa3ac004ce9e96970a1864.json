				"previous": "Camp guards were members of the SS-TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde (Death's Head Units).[81] Around 7,000 SS personnel in total were posted to Auschwitz during the war.[82] Of these, 4 percent of SS personel were officers and 26 percent were non-commissioned officers, while the remainder were rank-and-file members.[83] Approximately three in four SS personnel worked in security. Others worked in the medical or political departments, in the camp headquarters, or in the economic administration, which was responsible for the property of dead prisoners.[83] SS personnel at the camp included 200 women, who worked as guards, nurses, or messengers.[84] The overall command authority for the entire camp was Department D (the Concentration Camps Inspectorate) of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (SS Economics Main Office; SS-WVHA).[85]",
				"after": "Auschwitz was considered a comfortable posting by many SS members, due to many amenities and the abundance of slave labor.[86][87] Of the various prisoner groups, SS officers preferred Jehovah's Witnesses for household slaves because of their nonviolent behavior.[88] HÃ¶ss lived with his wife and children in a villa just outside the camp grounds. Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, and children to live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew more crowded, HÃ¶ss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee house, and a theater that hosted regular performances.[84]",
