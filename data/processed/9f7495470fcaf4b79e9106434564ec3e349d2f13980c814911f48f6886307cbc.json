				"previous": "Starfish and other echinoderms are sensitive to marine pollution.[80] The common starfish is considered to be a bioindicator for marine ecosystems.[81] A 2009 study found that P. ochraceus is unlikely to be affected by ocean acidification as severely as other marine animals with calcareous skeletons. In other groups, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution when the pH is lowered. Researchers found that when P. ochraceus were exposed to 21Â Â°C (70Â Â°F) and 770Â ppm carbon dioxide (beyond rises expected in the next century), they were relatively unaffected. Their survival is likely due to the nodular nature of their skeletons, which are able to compensate for a shortage of carbonate by growing more fleshy tissue.[82]",
				"after": "Echinoderms first appeared in the fossil record in the Cambrian. The first known asterozoans were the Somasteroidea, which exhibit characteristics of both groups. Modern starfish and brittle stars probably had a common somasteroid ancestor.[83] Starfish are infrequently found as fossils, possibly because their hard skeletal components separate as the animal decays. However, although starfish fossils are uncommon, there are a few places where accumulations of complete skeletal structures occur, fossilized in place in LagerstÃ¤tten â so-called \"starfish beds\".[84]",
