				"after": "In the United States, Asa Gray negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print Origin.[72] Darwin was delighted by the popularity of the book, and asked Gray to keep any profits.[73] Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton's of New York,[74] who got their edition out in mid January 1860, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this referred to the first printing only as there were four that year.[2][75]",
