				"after": "Adapiforms are extinct strepsirrhines that shared many anatomical similarities with lemuriforms.[29] They are sometimes referred to as lemur-like primates, although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this analogy.[30] Like living strepsirrhines, adapiforms were extremely diverse,[13] with at least 30Â genera and 80Â species known from the fossil record as of the early 2000s.[31][32] They diversified across Laurasia during the Eocene,[29] some reaching North America via a land bridge.[33] They were among the most common mammals found in the fossil beds from that time. A few rare species have also been found in northern Africa.[29] The most basal of the adapiforms include the genera Cantius from North America and Europe and Donrussellia from Europe. The latter bears the most ancestral traits, so it is often considered a sister group or stem group of the other adapiforms.[34]",
