				"previous": "The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit system, as well as Metrobus. Both systems serve the District and its suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976 and presently consists of 91Â stations and 117 miles (188Â km) of track.[195] With an average of about one million trips each weekday, Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country. Metrobus serves over 400,000 riders each weekday and is the nation's sixth-largest bus system.[196] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial areas within central Washington.[197]",
				"after": "Union Station is the city's main train station and services approximately 70,000 people each day. It is Amtrak's second-busiest station with 4.6Â million passengers annually and is the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor and Acela Express routes. Maryland's MARC and Virginia's VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station.[198] Following renovations in 2011, Union Station became Washington's primary intercity bus transit center.[199]",
