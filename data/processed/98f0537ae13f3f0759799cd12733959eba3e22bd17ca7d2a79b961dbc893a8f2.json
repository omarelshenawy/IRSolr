In 1673, during the national search for historic monuments, Abraham Winge reported that there were two runestones standing at Ãrby. In 1684, PeringskiÃ¶ld went to Ãrby in order to document and depict the stones, but he found only one standing (U 373). Instead he discovered the second, or a third runestone, U 374, as the bottom part of a fire stove. The use of the stone as a fireplace was detrimental to the inscription, and the last time someone wrote about having seen it was in 1728. PeringskiÃ¶ld's drawing is consequently the only documentation of the inscription that exists. The height of the stone was 1.5Â m (4Â ft 11Â in) and its width 0.88Â m (2Â ft 11Â in),[64] and it is attributed to the runemaster Ãsmund KÃ¥resson.[65]",
