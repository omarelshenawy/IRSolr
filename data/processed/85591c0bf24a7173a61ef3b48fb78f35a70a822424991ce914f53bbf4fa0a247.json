				"after": "Botkin was living in the university town of Charlottesville, Virginia, and a local friend of his, history professor and genealogist John Eacott \"Jack\" Manahan, paid for Anderson's journey to the United States.[108] She entered the country on a six-month visitor's visa, and shortly before it was due to expire, Anderson married Manahan, who was 20 years her junior, in a civil ceremony on 23 December 1968. Botkin was best man.[109] Jack Manahan enjoyed this marriage of convenience,[110] and described himself as \"Grand Duke-in-Waiting\"[111] or \"son-in-law to the Tsar\".[112] The couple lived in separate bedrooms in a house on University Circle in Charlottesville, and also owned a farm near Scottsville.[113] Botkin died in December 1969.[114] In February of the following year, the lawsuits finally came to an end, with neither side able to establish Anderson's identity.[115]",
