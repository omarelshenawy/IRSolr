				"after": "The first May Day demonstration in Cuba was held in 1890, and consisted of a march followed by a meeting addressed by 18 anarchist speakers. In the following days, strikes by workers in many industries led to the colonial government once again closing the CÃ­rculo de Trabajadores, only to rescind the decision when faced with a manifesto issued in protest by 2,300 workers.[3] Later that year, 11 anarchists were tried for the murder of MenÃ©ndez Areces, a director of the moderate UnÃ­on Obrera (Workers' Union). Though all 11 were found innocent, Captain-General Camilo GarcÃ­a Polavieja used the situation as pretext for shutting down production of El Productor, and repression of anarchists in general.[5] In 1892, another labor congress was held in which it reconfirmed its anarcho-syndicalist principles and expressing solidarity with the women in the working class (a new idea for a predominantly male working class that felt competed against by women in the workplace), declaring, \"It is an urgent necessity not to forget women, who are beginning to fill the workshops of several industries. They are driven by necessity and by bourgeois greed to compete with us. We cannot oppose it; let us help them.\"[3] However, the outcome of this was government suppression of the movement by means of deportation, imprisonment, the suspension of the right to free assembly, and closing of organizations' headquarters to quell organizing efforts.[6]",
