				"after": "During the Warring States period (403â221 BC), the development of private commerce, new trade routes, handicraft industries, and a money economy led to the growth of new urban centers. These centers were markedly different from the older cities, which had merely served as power bases for the nobility.[2] The use of a standardized, nationwide currency during the Qin dynasty (221â206 BC) facilitated long-distance trade between cities.[3] Many Han cities grew large: the Western Han capital, Chang'an, had approximately 250,000 inhabitants, while the Eastern Han capital, Luoyang, had approximately 500,000 inhabitants.[4] The population of the Han Empire, recorded in the tax census of 2 AD, was 57.6 million people in 12,366,470 households.[5] The majority of commoners who populated the cities lived in extended urban and suburban areas outside the city walls and gatehouses.[6] The total urban area of Western-Han Chang'anâincluding the extensions outside the wallsâwas 36Â km2 (14Â sqÂ mi). The total urban area of Eastern-Han Luoyangâincluding the extensions outside the wallsâwas 24.5Â km2 (9.5Â sqÂ mi).[7] Both Chang'an and Luoyang had two prominent marketplaces; each market had a two-story government office demarcated by a flag and drum at the top.[8] Market officials were charged with maintaining order, collecting commercial taxes, setting standard commodity prices on a monthly basis, and authorizing contracts between merchants and customers.[8]",
