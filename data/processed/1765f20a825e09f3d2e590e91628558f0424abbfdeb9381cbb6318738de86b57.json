				"previous": "In 1946, Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale de Transports AÃ©riens (CGTA) was established. It started flights between Algeria and Europe on a charter basis in 1947, but by the end of the decade scheduled flights serving Algiers, Basle, BÃ´ne, Geneva, Marseilles, Paris, Philippeville and Toulouse were operated.[13] Three 34-seater Bretagnes joined a fleet of seven DC-3s in 1952.[14] Compagnie Air Transport (CAT), subsidiary of Air France and Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale Transatlantique, was formed in the late 1940s to connect Basle, Lyon, Marseilles, Paris and Toulouse with Algiers, Constantine and Oran. Seasonal LondonâDeauville and âLe Touquet flights were also undertaken. Following the drop in traffic after 1951, a merging partner was under consideration.[15]",
				"after": "CGTA and CAT merged on 23Â MayÂ 1953Â (1953-05-23) to form the Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale de Transports AÃ©riens Air AlgÃ©rie,[15][16] with a combined fleet that included one Breguet 761, six Bretagnes, five DC-3s and three DC-4s.[17] Following merger, Air AlgÃ©rie commenced seasonal services to Ajaccio, Clermont, Montpellier and Perpignan. Furthermore, Switzerland was added to the regular schedule, a stop at Palma was performed on a weekly basis in partnership with Aviaco, and most of the trans-Mediterranean routes were operated in a pool agreement with Air France, with the French carrier flying 54% of these services and the remainder was left for Air AlgÃ©rie. Flights to the Cote d'Azur were added in the late 1950s.[15]",
