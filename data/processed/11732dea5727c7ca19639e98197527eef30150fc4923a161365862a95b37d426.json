				"previous": "Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said \"Frank [Gehry] is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture,\" and noted that no other architect was being sought.[12] Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architect Adrian Smith approached Gehry several times on behalf of the city,[15] which originally asked him about doing just a facade, but Gehry was uninterested. A few months later the city asked him to get involved in Millennium Park; Gehry felt he would prefer to design a building, but that he could not complete it in time for the Millennium, and that he would need a much larger budget than the city had envisioned.[16]",
				"after": "The city wanted Gehry, the donors supported him, and he was interested in the project.[9] The key component in the modern themes strategy was Gehry's acceptance of the commission in April 1999.[12][15][17] That month, the city announced that the Pritzker family had donated $15Â million to fund Gehry's bandshell and an additional nine donors committed a total of $10Â million.[18][19] The day of this announcement, after it became clear that Cindy Pritzker would fund the project,[16] Gehry agreed to the design request.[20] In November, when his designs for both the pavilion and bridge were unveiled, Gehry already had the basic design for the bandshell, but said the bridge's design was very preliminary and not well-conceived because funding for it was not committed.[21] The BP Pedestrian Bridge is designed to serve as a buffer against street noise, helping the pavilion's acoustics.[22]",
