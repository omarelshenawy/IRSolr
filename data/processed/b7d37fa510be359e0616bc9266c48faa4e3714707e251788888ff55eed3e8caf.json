				"previous": "The other branch of kalam was the Ash'ari school founded by Al-Ash'ari. Some Muslims began to question the piety of indulgence in a worldly life and emphasized poverty, humility and avoidance of sin based on renunciation of bodily desires. Ascetics such as Hasan al-Basri would inspire a movement that would evolve into Tasawwuf (Sufism).[163] Beginning in the 13th century, Sufism underwent a transformation, largely because of efforts to legitimize and reorganize the movement by Al-Ghazali, who developed the model of the Sufi orderâa community of spiritual teachers and students.[164]",
				"after": "This era is sometimes called the \"Islamic Golden Age\".[165] Public hospitals established during this time (called Bimaristan hospitals), are considered \"the first hospitals\" in the modern sense of the word,[166][167] and issued the first medical diplomas to license doctors.[168][169] The Guinness World Records recognizes the University of Al Karaouine, founded in 859, as the world's oldest degree-granting university.[170] The doctorate is argued to date back to the licenses to teach in Muslim law schools.[171] Standards of experimental and quantification techniques, as well as the tradition of citation,[172] were introduced. An important pioneer in this, Ibn Al-Haytham is regarded as the father of the modern scientific method and often referred to as the \"world's first true scientist\".[173][174] The government paid scientists the equivalent salary of professional athletes today.[172] The data used by Copernicus for his heliocentric conclusions was gathered and Al-Jahiz proposed a theory of natural selection.[175][176] Rumi wrote some of the finest Persian poetry and is still one of the best selling poets in America.[177][178] Legal institutions introduced include the trust and charitable trust (Waqf).[179][180]",
