				"East Sussex is a county in South East England. It is bordered by the counties of Kent, Surrey and West Sussex and, to the south, by the English Channel.",
				"The ancient kingdom of Sussex had separate county administrations since the 12th century, with the county town of the eastern division being Lewes [1]. This situation was formalised by Parliament in 1865, and the two parts were given distinct elected county councils in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888."
