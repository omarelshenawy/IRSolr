				"after": "The call to open a college in West Texas began shortly after the arrival of settlers in the area in the 1880s.[10][11] In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A&M to be located in Abilene.[12] However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered that Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend that West Texas secede from the state.[13]",
