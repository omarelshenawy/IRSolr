				"after": "At the end of 1859, PedroÂ II departed on a trip to provinces north of the capital, visiting EspÃ­rito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and ParaÃ­ba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy.[141] The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained.[142][143] Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroÂ II.[144][145] He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation.[92] Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class (including slaves[146]) could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories.[147][148] Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.[149]",
