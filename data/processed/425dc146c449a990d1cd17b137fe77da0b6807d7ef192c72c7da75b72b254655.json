				"previous": "The cap of this species grows up to 15Â cm (6Â in) in diameter,[5] though some North American specimens reach 30Â cm (12Â in) across.[2] Grey-yellow to pale- or walnut-brown, it is slightly downy at first and later becomes smooth with a matte lustre. It is initially convex before flattening out with maturity.[5] The cap skin does not peel away from the flesh.[18] The pores underneath are white at first and become pinkish with maturity. They are adnate to the stalk and bulge downwards as the mushroom ages.[19] The pores bruise carmine or brownish,[20] often developing rusty-brown spots with age,[21] and number about one or two per millimetre.[16] The tubes are long relative to the size of the cap, measuring 2â3Â cm (0.8â1.2Â in) deep in the middle part of the cap.[21] The stalk is initially bulbous before stretching and thinning in the upper part; the lower part of the stalk remains swollen, sometimes shrinking at the base where it attaches to the substrate.[21] It measures 7â10Â cm (2.8â3.9Â in)ârarely to 20Â cm (7.9Â in)[2]âtall, and 2â3Â cm (0.8â1.2Â in) wide, and can bulge out to 6Â cm (2.4Â in) across at the base.[19] It is lighter in colour than the cap, and covered with a coarse brown network of markings,[19] which have been likened to fishnet stockings in appearance.[20] Described as \"very appetising\" in appearance,[22] the flesh is white or creamy, and pink beneath the cap cuticle; the flesh can also develop pinkish tones where it has been cut.[23] It has a slight smell,[18] which has been described as pleasant,[5][24] as well as faintly unpleasant.[19][20] The flesh is softer than that of other boletes,[20] and tends to become more spongy as the mushroom matures.[21] Insects rarely infest this species.[18]",
				"after": "The colour of the spore print is brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. Spores are somewhat fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11â17 by 3â5Â Âµm.[16] The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18â25.6 by 7.0â10.2Â Âµm. Cystidia on the walls of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36â44 by 8.0â11.0Â Âµm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8â44.0 by 7.3â11.0Â Âµm.[17] The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2â8Â Âµm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8â12Â Âµm) globule in the pleurocystidia.[2]",
