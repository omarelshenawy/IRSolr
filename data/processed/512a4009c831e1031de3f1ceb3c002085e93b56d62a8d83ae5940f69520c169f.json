				"after": "Secular portraiture was a rarity in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end of the market in betrothal portraits or royal family commissions.[147] While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed.[99] Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer;[148] his seminal 1432 LÃ©al Souvenir is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance.[149] His Arnolfini Portrait is filled with symbolism,[150] as is the Madonna of Chancelor Rolin, commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.[151]",
