				"after": "Ganoga Lake is the largest tributary of Lake Jean, via a 0.4-mile (0.6Â km) branch of Kitchen Creek. While Lake Jean lies entirely within Ricketts Glen State Park, much of its 1,998-acre (809Â ha) drainage basin extends beyond the park, and Ganoga Lake's 960-acre (390Â ha) watershed accounts for nearly half of the total area. Lake Jean covers 253 acres (102Â ha); the remaining 1,745 acres (706Â ha) of the Lake Jean watershed are 81.0% hardwood forest, 12.6% pastures, 4.7% other lakes (including Ganoga Lake's 78.8 acres (31.9Â ha)), and 1.7% wetlands.[2][9] The park has more than 80 species of vines, shrubs, and trees;[52] black gum, black spruce, eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, eastern larch, red maple, and yellow birch are found in area forests.[8]",
