				"previous": "The third biggest flood, cresting at 29.8 feet (9.1Â m) in Lock Haven, occurred on June 1, 1889,[30] and coincided with the Johnstown Flood. The flood demolished Lock Haven's log boom, and millions of feet of stored timber were swept away.[31] The flood damaged the canals, which were subsequently abandoned, and destroyed the last of the canal boats based in the city.[24]",
				"after": "The most damaging Lock Haven flood was caused by the remnants of Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The storm, just below hurricane strength when it reached the region, made landfall on June 22 near New York City. Agnes merged with a non-tropical low on June 23, and the combined system affected the northeastern United States until June 25. The combination produced widespread rains of 6 to 12 inches (152 to 305Â mm) with local amounts up to 19 inches (483Â mm) in western Schuylkill County, about 75 miles (121Â km) southeast of Lock Haven.[32] At Lock Haven, the river crested on June 23 at 31.3 feet (9.5Â m), second only to the 1936 crest.[30] The flood greatly damaged the paper mill and Piper Aircraft.[33]",
