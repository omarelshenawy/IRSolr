				"after": "Telopea speciosissima, the New South Wales waratah, is a large, erect shrub up to 3 or 4Â metres (10â13Â ft) in height with one or more stems.[3][4] Arising vertically or near vertically from a large woody base, or lignotuber, the stems are little branched. In late spring, there is a spurt of new growth after flowering, with new shoots often arising from old flowerheads.[5] The dark green leaves are alternate and usually coarsely-toothed, ranging from 13 to 25Â cm (5â10Â in) in length.[3] Enveloped in leafy bracts, the flowerheads develop over the winter and begin to swell in early spring,[3][6] before opening to reveal the striking inflorescences. The exact timing varies across New South Wales, but flowering can begin as early as August in the northern parts of its range, and finish in November in the southern, more elevated areas.[5] Spot flowering may also occur around March in autumn.[7] Containing up to 250 individual flowers, the domed flowerheads are crimson in colour and measure 7â10Â cm (3â4Â in) in diameter. They are cupped in a whorl of leafy bracts which are 5 to 7Â cm (2â3Â in) long and also red.[3][5] Variations are not uncommon; some flowerheads may be more globular or cone-shaped than dome-shaped, and the bracts may be whitish or dark red. The tips of the stigmas of some inflorescences may be whitish, contrasting with the red colour of the rest of the flowerhead.[8]",
