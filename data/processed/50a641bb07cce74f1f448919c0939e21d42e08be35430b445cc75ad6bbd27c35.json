				"after": "RosettaDesign, a computational approach to protein design based on Rosetta, began in 2000 with a study in redesigning the folding pathway of Protein G.[46] In 2002 RosettaDesign was used to design Top7, a 93-amino acid long Î±/Î² protein that had an overall fold never before recorded in nature. This new conformation was predicted by Rosetta to within 1.2Â Ã RMSD of the structure determined by X-ray crystallography, representing an unusually accurate structure prediction.[47] Rosetta and RosettaDesign earned widespread recognition by being the first to design and accurately predict the structure of a novel protein of such length, as reflected by the 2002 paper describing the dual approach prompting two positive letters in the journal Science,[48][49] and being cited by more than 240 other scientific articles.[50] The visible product of that research, Top7, was featured as the RCSB PDB's 'Molecule of the Month' in October 2006;[51] a superposition of the respective cores (residues 60â79) of its predicted and X-ray crystal structures are featured in the Rosetta@home logo.[17]",
