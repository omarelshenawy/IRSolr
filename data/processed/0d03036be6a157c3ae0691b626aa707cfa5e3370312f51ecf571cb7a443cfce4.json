				"previous": "Cardiff lies within the north temperate zone and has an essentially maritime climate (KÃ¶ppen: Cfb), characterised by mild weather that is often cloudy, wet and windy.[72] Summers tend to be warm and sunny, with average maximum temperatures between 19 and 22Â Â°C (66 and 72Â Â°F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14Â Â°C (57Â Â°F)âalso the average annual daytime temperature. Rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer.[73]",
				"after": "The northern part of the county, being higher and inlandâfor example, The Garth (Welsh: Mynydd y Garth), about 7 miles (11Â km) north west of Cardiff city centre, (elevation 1,007 feet (307Â m))âtends to be cooler and wetter than the city centre.[citation needed][74]",
