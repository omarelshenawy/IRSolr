				"Ian Bradley, in connection with the 100th anniversary of Gilbert's death in 2011 wrote:",
				"Gilbert's influence on the English language has also been marked, with well-known phrases such as \"A policeman's lot is not a happy one\", \"short, sharp shock\", \"What never? Well, hardly ever!\", and \"let the punishment fit the crime\" arising from his pen.[4] In addition, biographies continue to be written about Gilbert's life and career,[117] and his work is not only performed, but frequently parodied, pastiched, quoted and imitated in comedy routines, film, television and other popular media.[112][118]"
