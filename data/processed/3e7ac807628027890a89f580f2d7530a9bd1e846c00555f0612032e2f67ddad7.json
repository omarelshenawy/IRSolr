				"after": "In March 1940, a partisan unit of the first guerrilla commanders in the Second World War in Europe under Major Henryk DobrzaÅski \"Hubal\" completely destroyed a battalion of German infantry in a skirmish near the village of Huciska. A few days later in an ambush near the village of SzaÅasy it inflicted heavy casualties upon another German unit. To counter this threat the German authorities formed a special 1,000 men strong anti-partisan unit of combined SSâWehrmacht forces, including a Panzer group. Although the unit of Major DobrzaÅski never exceeded 300 men, the Germans fielded at least 8,000 men in the area to secure it.[20][21]",
