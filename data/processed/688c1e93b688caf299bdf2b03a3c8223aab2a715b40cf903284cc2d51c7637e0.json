				"previous": "In January 2013, Air India paid GMR Group a sum of â¹4.15 billion (US$66Â million) towards outstanding dues on account of charges related to the airports at Hyderabad and Delhi. Of the amount paid, â¹3.4 billion (US$54Â million) was paid to clear the user development fee (UDF), airport development fee (ADF) and landing and parking charges at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi. The remaining â¹750 million (US$12Â million) was paid to clear similar fees at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad.[48] In order to raise funds for reconstruction, Air India decided to sell and lease back its aircraft, including the newly acquired Boeing 787 Dreamliners.[49] In March 2013, the airline posted its first positive EBITDA after almost 6 years.[10] The airlines bolstered its financial and physical performance with a 44 per cent slash in its operating losses in 2013-14 and an almost 20 per cent growth in its operating revenue since the previous financial year.[11] As of January 2014, Air India is the third largest carrier in India, after IndiGo and Jet Airways with a market share of just above 19%.[12]",
