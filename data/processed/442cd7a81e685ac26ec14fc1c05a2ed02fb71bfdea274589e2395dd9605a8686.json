				"after": "Built under Babylonian rule (605â539Â BC),[4] the oldest monument at the site is a pyramidal building resembling a ziggurat that includes an access ramp to a water cistern.[31] Fragments of marble column bases with Torus moldings and facetted columns found east of the podium are also attributed to the Babylonian era.[32] The pyramidal structure was superimposed during Persian rule by a massive ashlarpodium constructed from heavily bossed limestone blocks that measured more than 3 metres (9.8Â ft) across by 1 metre (3.3Â ft)thick, which were laid down in courses 1-metre (3.3Â ft) high. The podium stands 22 metres (72Â ft) high, runs50 metres (160Â ft) into the hillside, and boasts a 70-metre (230Â ft) wide faÃ§ade.[10][31] The terrace atop of the podium was once covered by a Greco-Persian style marble temple probably built by Ionic artisans around 500 BCE.[32] The marble temple has been reduced to a few remaining stone fragments due to theft.[31]",
