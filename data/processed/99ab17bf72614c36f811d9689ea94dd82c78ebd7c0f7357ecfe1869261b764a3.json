				"after": "ICEs drive some of the large electric generators that power electrical grids. They are found in the form of combustion turbines in combined cycle power plants with a typical electrical output in the range of 100Â MW to 1Â GW. The high temperature exhaust is used to boil and superheat water to run a steam turbine. Thus, the efficiency is higher because more energy is extracted from the fuel than what could be extracted by the combustion turbine alone. In combined cycle power plants efficiencies in the range of 50Â % to 60Â % are typical. In a smaller scale Diesel generators are used for backup power and for providing electrical power to areas not connected to an electric grid.",
