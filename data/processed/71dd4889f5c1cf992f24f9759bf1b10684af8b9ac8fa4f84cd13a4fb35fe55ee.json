				"previous": "Giraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving \"waistlines\" to trees that are too tall.[25] Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.[25]",
