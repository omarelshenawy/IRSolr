				"previous": "The graph below shows an example of this, producing a fourth-degree polynomial approximating over [â1, 1]. The test points were set at â1, â0.7, â0.1, +0.4, +0.9, and 1. Those values are shown in green. The resultant value of is 4.43 x 10â4",
				"after": "Note that the error graph does indeed take on the values at the six test points, including the end points, but that those points are not extrema. If the four interior test points had been extrema (that is, the function P(x)f(x) had maxima or minima there), the polynomial would be optimal.",
