				"previous": "In 1737, planter William Byrd II commissioned Major William Mayo to lay out the original town grid. Byrd named the city \"Richmond\" after the English town of Richmond near (and now part of) London, because the view of the James River was strikingly similar to the view of the River Thames from Richmond Hill in England, where he had spent time during his youth. The settlement was laid out in April 1737, and was incorporated as a town in 1742.[10]",
