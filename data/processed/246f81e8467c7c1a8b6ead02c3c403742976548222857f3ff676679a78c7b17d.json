				"previous": "Boswell and Johnson discussed the subject during their 1773 tour of the Hebrides. Boswell wrote: \"After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grangeâs being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if MâLeod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island.\"[139]",
				"after": "In the 1860s unsuccessful attempts were made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as Doirneagan Hirt, Hirta's pebbles.[140]",
