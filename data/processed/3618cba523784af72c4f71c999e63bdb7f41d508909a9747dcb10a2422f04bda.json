				"previous": "He commissioned the architect Jacques Catone not only to enlarge the palace, but also to soften its grim fortified appearance. The main faÃ§ade facing the square, the \"front\" of the palace, was given decorative embellishments. The upper loggias (B) to the right of the entrance were glazed. Inside the palace the State Rooms Wing was restyled and the enfilade of state apartments created. A new chapel adorned by a cupola (built on the site marked D) was dedicated to St John the Baptist. This new work helped conceal the forbidding Serravalle Bastion from the courtyard, to create the lighter atmosphere of a Renaissance palazzo.",
				"after": "During the late 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an independent state, it was in reality a province of France.[7] Its rulers spent much of their time at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure of Versailles was greater than that of their own country.",
