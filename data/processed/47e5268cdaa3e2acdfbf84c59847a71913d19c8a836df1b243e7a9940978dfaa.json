				"All of O'Hare's international arrivals (excluding flights from destinations with U.S. border preclearance, flights operated by Aer Lingus and Etihad Airways) are processed at Terminal 5. With the exception of select Star Alliance and Oneworld carriers that board from Terminal 1 or Terminal 3, all non-US carriers depart from Terminal 5, as do certain domestic low-cost carriers (Delta is the only major US carrier that uses Terminal 5, for its nonstop wintertime flight to Paris)."
