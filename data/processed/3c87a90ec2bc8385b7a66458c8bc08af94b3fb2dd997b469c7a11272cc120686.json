				"In 2009 Brown was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.[83]",
				"Upon Bradman's death in February 2001, Brown became the oldest living Australian Test cricketer, greatly amused by the fame that came with the title. Highly regarded by Australian cricketers of the modern era, Steve Waugh invited Brown to present Test debutant Adam Gilchrist with his baggy green.[7] The humble Brown was surprised, thinking himself an unworthy choice. Waugh disagreed, opining that \"Bill is a baggy green icon who represents all that is good about playing for your country. He is humble, self-effacing and respectful, proud to have been afforded the honour of being an Australian Test cricketer, and a man who always looks for the positive in people.\"[19] In March 2008, Brown died in Brisbane at the age of 95.[82] He was the last surviving Invincible to have played Test cricket before World War II and his death leaves only four living members of Bradman's 1948 team.[30]"
