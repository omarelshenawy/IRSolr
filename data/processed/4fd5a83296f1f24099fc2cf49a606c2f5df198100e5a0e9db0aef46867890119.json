				"after": "The British Parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others.[76] Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year.[77] After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution.[78] Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.[79]",
