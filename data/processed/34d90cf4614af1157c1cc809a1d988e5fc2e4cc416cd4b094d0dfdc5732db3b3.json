The great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing,[27] and later the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.[19][28] Manchester was dubbed \"Cottonopolis\" and \"Warehouse City\" during the Victorian era.[27] In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term \"manchester\" is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc.[29] The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester's population.",
