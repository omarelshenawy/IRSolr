				"previous": "The name frog derives from Old English frogga, abbreviated to frox, forsc, and frosc, probably deriving from Proto-Indo-European preu = \"to jump\".[2] About 88% of amphibian species are classified in the order Anura.[3] These include around 4,810 species in 33 families, of which the Leptodactylidae (1,100 spp.), Hylidae (800 spp.) and Ranidae (750 spp.) are the richest in species.[3]",
				"after": "The use of the common names \"frog\" and \"toad\" has no taxonomic justification. From a classification perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered \"true toads\". The use of the term \"frog\" in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term \"toad\" generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins.[4][5] There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat[6] whereas the Panamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin.[7]",
