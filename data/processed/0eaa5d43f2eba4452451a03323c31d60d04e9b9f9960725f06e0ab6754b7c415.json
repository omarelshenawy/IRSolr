				"The China Southern Airlines Passenger fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of May 2015):[47][48]",
				"China Southern Airlines is the only Chinese airline to order and to operate an Airbus A380. The airline initially operated these aircraft on BeijingâHong Kong and BeijingâGuangzhou routes. However, these domestic services struggled to be profitable. Due to the demand limitation of the airlines' international hub at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, few routes from Guangzhou have the demand to support an A380. In effort to make its A380s viable, China Southern started operating A380 on its GuangzhouâLos Angeles route and on the GuangzhouâSydney route. Now the A380 comes to Sydney every summer (southern hemisphere) during its peak travel period."
