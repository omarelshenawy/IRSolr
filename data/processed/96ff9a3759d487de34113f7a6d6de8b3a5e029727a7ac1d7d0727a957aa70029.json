				"after": "In June 1816, the French frigate MÃ©duse departed from Rochefort, bound for the Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette Ãcho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed captain of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20Â years.[5][6] The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-DÃ©sirÃ© Schmaltz, and his wife Reine Schmaltz were among the passengers.",
