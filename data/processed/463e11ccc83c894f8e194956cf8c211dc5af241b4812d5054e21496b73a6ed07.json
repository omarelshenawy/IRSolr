				"after": "The pre-eminent position of DÃ¼rer's image and its derivatives declined from the mid-to-late-18th century, when more live rhinoceroses were transported to Europe, shown to the curious public, and depicted in more accurate representations. Jean-Baptiste Oudry painted a life-size portrait of Clara the rhinoceros in 1749, and George Stubbs painted a large portrait of a rhinoceros in London around 1790. Both of these paintings were more accurate than DÃ¼rer's woodcut, and a more realistic conception of the rhinoceros gradually started to displace DÃ¼rer's image in the public imagination. In particular, Oudry's painting was the inspiration for a plate in Buffon's encyclopedic Histoire naturelle, which was widely copied.[39] In 1790, James Bruce's travelogue Travels to discover the source of the Nile dismissed DÃ¼rer's work as \"wonderfully ill-executed in all its parts\" and \"the origin of all the monstrous forms under which that animal has been painted, ever since\". Even so, Bruce's own illustration of the African white rhinoceros, which is noticeably different in appearance to the Indian rhinoceros, still shares conspicuous inaccuracies with DÃ¼rer's work.[40] Semiotician Umberto Eco argues that DÃ¼rer's \"scales and imbricated plates\" became a necessary element of depicting the animal, even to those who might know better, because \"they knew that only these conventionalized graphic signs could denote Â«rhinocerosÂ» to the person interpreting the iconic sign.\" He also notes that the skin of a rhinoceros is rougher than it visually appears and that such plates and scales portray this non-visual information to a degree.[41]",
