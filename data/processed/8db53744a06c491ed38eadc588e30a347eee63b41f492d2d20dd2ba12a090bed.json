The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels.[127] The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned.[128] The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140Â inches long, 45Â inches wide, and 27Â inches tall (355Â cm x 115Â cm x 69Â cm) and weighs 360 pounds.[129]",
