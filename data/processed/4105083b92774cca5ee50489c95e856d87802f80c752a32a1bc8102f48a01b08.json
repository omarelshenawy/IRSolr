				"LAX serves as a hub for American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Horizon Air, Great Lakes Airlines, and Virgin America. The airport also serves as a focus city for Southwest Airlines, Allegiant Air, Air New Zealand, Qantas, and Volaris. LAX is the only airport to serve as a hub for all three U.S. legacy airlines (American, Delta and United). LAX is also one of four airports in North America that will have scheduled direct air service to all six inhabited continents once Ethiopian Airlines starts flights in June. The other three airports are Toronto-Pearson, Houston-Intercontinental (starting in December) and New York John F. Kennedy Airport."

				"after": "In 1928, the Los Angeles City Council selected 640 acres (1.00Â sqÂ mi; 260Â ha) in the southern part of Westchester for a new airport for the city. The fields of wheat, barley and lima beans were converted into dirt landing strips without any terminal buildings. It was named Mines Field for William W. Mines, the real estate agent who arranged the deal.[10] The first structure, Hangar No. 1, was erected in 1929 and is in the National Register of Historic Places.[11]",
