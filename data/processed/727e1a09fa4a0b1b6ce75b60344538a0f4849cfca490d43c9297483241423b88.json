				"after": "A year later a further discovery was made at Lindow Moss, just 820 feet (250Â m) south-west of the Lindow Woman. On 1Â August 1984, Andy Mould, who had been involved in the discovery of Lindow Woman, took what he thought was a piece of wood off the elevator of the peat-shredding machine.[10] He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it to be a human foot. The police were called and the foot was taken away for examination.[4] Rick Turner, the Cheshire County Archaeologist, was notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of the body,[11] which later became known as Lindow Man.[12] Some skin had been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further deterioration of the body, it was re-covered with peat. The complete excavation of the block containing the remains was performed on 6Â August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the Macclesfield District General Hospital for storage.[11] As the body of Malika Reyn-Bardt had still not been found, it was thought possible the body might be hers, until it was determined to be male, and radiocarbon dated.[8] The owners of the land on which Lindow Man was found donated the body to the British Museum, and on 21Â August it was transported to London.[13]",
