				"after": "Bowling Green is home to many fraternities and sororities. The university began Greek community initiatives during the 1940s and it has slowly flourished into a strong community. Each fraternity and sorority at BGSU promotes community service efforts, academic excellence, philanthropic events, and university involvement each through their own nationally recognized organization. As of 2013[update], 8% of undergraduate men and 12% of undergraduate women were members of Greek organizations.[147] BGSU is demolishing its current Greek Town Homes located on old Fraternity Row, old Sorority Row, and the North and South Greek Conklin buildings while they plan and construct a new Greek Village which will consolidate all of the organizations together on the West side of campus against Wooster Street. The plan consists of 10 buildings divided into 33 sections consisting of 4-Bedroom, 12-Bedroom, and 18-Bedroom style homes. The site lies on top of old Fraternity Row and the North and South Conklin building locations. The demolition is scheduled for the fall of 2014 and the new Greek Village is scheduled to be finished in the fall of 2016.",
