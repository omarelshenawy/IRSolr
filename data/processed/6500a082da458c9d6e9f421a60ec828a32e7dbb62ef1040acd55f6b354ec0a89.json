P. Scott, The Manchester Guardianââ'âs editor, asking for any available post at the paper, as \"the means whereby to continue my education\".[52] To bolster his chances he enclosed specimens of his writing.[53] The result was, first, a temporary unpaid position as Scott's secretary, but in mid-March Scott offered a job on the paper's reporting staff.[54] The writer J. B. Priestley later asserted that Cardus, who did not know shorthand, was engaged not as a reporter, but as a \"writer\".[55] In Cardus's own account of these years he appears to have been fully engaged in reporters' duties, his lack of shorthand being dismissed by the chief reporter, Haslam Mills, who paraphrased Shakespeare: \"Some men are born to shorthand, others achieve shorthand, while others have shorthand thrust upon them\".[56][n 5] Mills advised Cardus to concentrate on style: \"We can be decorative at times; we can even be amusing. Here, possibly, you will find scope\".[57]",
