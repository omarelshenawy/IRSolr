				"previous": "The term witch doctor, a common translation for the South African Zulu word inyanga, has been misconstrued to mean \"a healer who uses witchcraft\" rather than its original meaning of \"one who diagnoses and cures maladies caused by witches\".",
				"after": "In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The thakathi is usually improperly translated into English as \"witch\", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The sangoma is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a fortune teller, and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The inyanga is often translated as \"witch doctor\" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a \"witch doctor\" is in some sense a practitioner of malicious magic). The inyanga's job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the thakatha is almost exclusively female, the sangoma is usually female, and the inyanga is almost exclusively male.",
