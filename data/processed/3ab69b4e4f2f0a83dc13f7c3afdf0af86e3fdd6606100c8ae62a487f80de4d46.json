				"previous": "Due to the height of many branches and the potentially disastrous consequences of a fall, balance is of primary importance to arboreal animals.[1] On horizontal and gently sloped branches, the primary problem is tipping to the side due to the narrow base of support.[1] The narrower the branch, the greater the difficulty in balancing a given animal faces. On steep and vertical branches, tipping becomes less of an issue, and pitching backwards or slipping downwards becomes the most likely failure.[1] In this case, large-diameter branches pose a greater challenge, since the animal cannot place its forelimbs closer to the center of the branch than its hindlimbs.",
