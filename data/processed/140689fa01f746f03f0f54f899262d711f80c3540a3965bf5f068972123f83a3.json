				"after": "Obama is a Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[372] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household\". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as \"non-practicing Methodists and Baptists\"), as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"[373]",
