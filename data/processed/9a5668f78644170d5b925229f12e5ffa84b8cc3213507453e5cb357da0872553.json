				"previous": "Bakersfield lies around 100 miles (160Â km) north of Los Angeles (about a 1Â½-hour drive on I-5 and State Route 99) and about 300Â mi (480Â km) southeast of the state capital, Sacramento (about a 4Â½-hour drive on State Route 99).",
				"after": "Bakersfield has historically referred to its regions by directional names. They are: Central Bakersfield, North Bakersfield, Northeast, East Bakersfield, Southeast, South Bakersfield, Southwest, and Northwest. With the exception of Central and East Bakersfield, all regions extend to the city limits. East Bakersfield generally refers to the former town of Sumner (later renamed East Bakersfield). As a result, the Northeast wraps around East Bakersfield.[35]",
