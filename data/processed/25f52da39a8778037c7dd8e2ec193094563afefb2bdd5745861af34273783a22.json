				"previous": "There are currently thought to be nine subspecies of the Australian magpie, although there are large zones of overlap with intermediate forms between the taxa. There is a tendency for birds to become larger with increasing latitude, the southern subspecies being larger than those further north, except the Tasmanian form which is small.[19] The original form known, as the black-backed magpie and classified as Gymnorhina tibicen, has been split into four black-backed races:",
