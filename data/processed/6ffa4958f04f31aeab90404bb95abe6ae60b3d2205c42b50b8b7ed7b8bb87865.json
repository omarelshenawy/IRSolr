				"previous": "Glide retention in these contexts has occasionally been held to be a shibboleth distinguishing Canadians from Americans. However, in a survey conducted in the Golden Horseshoe area of Southern Ontario in 1994, over 80% of respondents under the age of 40 pronounced student and news without yod.[5]",
				"after": "General American thus undergoes yod-dropping after all alveolar consonants. Some accents of American English preserve the distinction in pairs like loot/lute and do/dew by using a diphthong /Éªu/ in words where RP has /juË/, thus [lut]/[lÉªut], [du]/[dÉªu], etc.[6]",
