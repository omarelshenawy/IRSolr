			"after": [
				"The foundation's functions were, for the first few years, executed almost entirely by volunteers. In 2005, it had only two employees, Danny Wool, a coordinator, and Brion Vibber, a software manager.",
				"As of October 4, 2006[update], the foundation had five paid employees:[83] two programmers, an administrative assistant, a coordinator handling fundraising and grants, and an interim executive director,[84] Brad Patrick, previously the foundation's general counsel. Patrick ceased his activity as interim director in January 2007, and then resigned from his position as legal counsel, effective April 1, 2007.
