				"previous": "In 2006, King went on a \"farewell\" world tour, although he remained active afterward during the last years of his life.[45] The tour was partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore, with whom King had previously toured and recorded, including the song \"Since I Met You Baby\". It started in the United Kingdom, and continued with performances in the Montreux Jazz Festival and in ZÃ¼rich at the Blues at Sunset. During his show in Montreux at the Stravinski Hall he jammed with Joe Sample, Randy Crawford, David Sanborn, Gladys Knight, Leela James, Andre Beeka, Earl Thomas, Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin, Barbara Hendricks and George Duke.[46]",
				"after": "In June 2006, King was present at a memorial of his first radio broadcast at the Three Deuces Building in Greenwood, Mississippi, where an official marker of the Mississippi Blues Trail was erected. The same month, a groundbreaking was held for a new museum, dedicated to King.[47] in Indianola, Mississippi.[48] The B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center opened on September 13, 2008.[49]",
