				"previous": "As a schoolboy, Ian Johnson excelled at a variety of sports. He participated in athletics and Australian rules football, as well as playing as a wicket-keeper for Middle Park State School. In 1936, he became the Victorian amateur squash champion.[4] However, he found his vocation in cricket. In 1934â35, aged only 16, and still a schoolboy at Wesley College, Johnson played his first match for the South Melbourne Cricket Club First XI.[1]",
				"after": "He was given the opportunity to play first-class cricket the following season, playing Tasmaniaânot then involved in the Sheffield Shield competitionâjust 23Â days past his seventeenth birthday.[1][5] He scored 34 and 26 and took two wickets in each innings as Tasmania won by six wickets.[5] He was retained for the next game, scoring 15Â runs in his only innings and taking 3Â wickets for 40Â runs (3/40) in the Tasmanian first innings and 1/27 in the second.[6]",
