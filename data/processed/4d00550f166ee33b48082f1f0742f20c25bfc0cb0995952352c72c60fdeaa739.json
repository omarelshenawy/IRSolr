				"previous": "The Third of May references a number of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas.[25] Pictorial artifice gives way to the epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic paintersâwho were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and deathâcomposed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818â1819) and EugÃ¨ne Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.[32]",
				"after": "The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of martyrdom in Christian art, as exemplified in the dramatic use of chiaroscuro, and the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution.[34] However, Goya's painting departs from this tradition. Works that depicted violence, such as those by Jusepe de Ribera, feature an artful technique and harmonious composition which anticipate the \"crown of martyrdom\" for the victim.[35]",
