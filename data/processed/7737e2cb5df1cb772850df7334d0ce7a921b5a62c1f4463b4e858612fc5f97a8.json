These include Olimpia, Cerro PorteÃ±o and Club Libertad, Club Nacional, Club GuaranÃ­ and Club Sol de AmÃ©rica, which have their own stadiums and sport facilities for affiliated members. The Defensores del Chaco stadium is the main football stadium of the country and is located in the neighbourhood of Sajonia, just a few minutes away from the centre of AsunciÃ³n. Since it is a national stadium sometimes it is used for other activities such as rock concerts. AsunciÃ³n is also the heart of Paraguayan rugby union.",
