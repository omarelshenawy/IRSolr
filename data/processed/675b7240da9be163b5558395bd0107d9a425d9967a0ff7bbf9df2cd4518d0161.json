Adler, who came to believe that the purpose of education was to engage student minds \"in the study of individual works of meritÂ ... accompanied by a discussion of the ideas, the values, and the forms embodied in such products of human art\".[51][52] Robert Maynard Hutchins, head of the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951, brought Adler to the university and implemented a program (known as the Chicago Program and, later, the Hutchins Plan) based on Adler's ideas.[53][54][55]d[âº]",
