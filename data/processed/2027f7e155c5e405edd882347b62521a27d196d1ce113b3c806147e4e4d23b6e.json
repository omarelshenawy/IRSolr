				"after": "George Standridge, Vice President of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, and a Naval Aviator who flew the F/A-18 Hornet in both the U.S. Navy and the Naval Reserve, predicted in 2006 that the F-35 will be four times more effective than legacy fighters in air-to-air combat, eight times more effective in air-to-ground combat, and three times more effective in reconnaissance and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses â while having better range and requiring less logistics support and having around the same procurement costs (if development costs are ignored) as legacy fighters.[14] The design goals call for the F-35 to be the premier strike aircraft through 2040 and to be second only to the F-22 Raptor in air supremacy.[15]",
