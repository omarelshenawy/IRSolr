				"previous": "Full-time undergraduate tuition was $42,690 for 2013â2014.[127] Stanford's admission process is need-blind for US citizens and permanent residents; while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[127] In 2012/13, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[127] Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[127] Stanford's no-loan policy waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $60,000, and most families with incomes below $100,000 are not required to pay tuition (those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced).[127][128] 17% of students receive Pell Grants,[127] a common measure of low-income students at a college.",
				"after": "The Stanford Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversees more than eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes.[129]",
