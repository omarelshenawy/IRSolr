Breese and Eugene Rhodes, the two flight engineers; and Herbert C Rodd, the radio operator. Earlier, E.H. Howard had been chosen to go as one of the flight engineers, but on 2 May, Howard lost a hand in misjudging his distance from a whirling propeller.[2] Consequently, he was replaced by Rhodes in the crew.",
