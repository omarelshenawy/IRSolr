				"after": "Spore deposits are white. Viewed under a light microscope, the spores appear hyaline (translucent), covered with minute wart-like bumps, and are spherical or nearly so, with dimensions of 4.6â5.5 by 4â5Â Âµm. They are amyloid (reacting to Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilous (staining in methyl blue).[13] The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are four-spored with basal clamps, and measure 15â24 by 3â4Â Âµm, and sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that bear the spores) are swollen at the base and roughly 3Â Âµm long. The hyphal system is dimitic, comprising both generative (undifferentiated) and skeletal (structural) hyphae. The thin-walled generative hyphae are hyaline, and have clamp connections; the thick-walled skeletal hyphae are thicker overall and lack such connections. The cortex (the tougher outer layer of flesh) is made of parallel unbranched generative hyphae that are brown, thick-walled, clumped together, and frequently clamped. The internal flesh is made of interwoven generative and skeletal hyphae. Gloeoplerous hyphae (containing oily or granular contents) are also present, protruding into the hymenium as club-like or sharp-pointed gloeocystidia.[19]",
