Former imam of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Moaz al-Khatib, considered a moderate, was elected the president of the coalition, and resigned on 21 April 2013.[5] Riad Seif and Suheir Atassi, both prominent democracy activists and the latter a secular feminist, were elected vice presidents. The post of a third vice president will remain vacant for a Kurdish figure to be elected.[6] Mustafa Sabbagh was elected as the coalition's secretary-general.[7] The coalition has a council of 114 seats, though not all of them are filled.[1]",
