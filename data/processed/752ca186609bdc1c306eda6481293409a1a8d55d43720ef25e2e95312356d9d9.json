				"after": "Starting with information received in July 2010, intelligence developed by the CIA over the next several months determined what they believed to be the location of Osama bin Laden in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles from Islamabad.[290] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[290] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[290] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, resulting in the death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[291][292] DNA testing identified bin Laden's body,[293] which was buried at sea several hours later.[294] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[291][295] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush,[296] and from many countries around the world.[297]",
