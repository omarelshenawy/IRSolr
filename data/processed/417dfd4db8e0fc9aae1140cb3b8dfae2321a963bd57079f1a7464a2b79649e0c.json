				"previous": "The Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Chamber of Commerce was highly praised[by whom?] for its advertising campaign with the slogan \"Wir kÃ¶nnen alles. AuÃer Hochdeutsch.\" which means \"We can [do] everything. Except [speak] Standard German.\" The campaign was clever in boosting Swabian pride for their dialect and industrial achievements.[10] It however failed to impress Northern Germans[11] and neighboring Baden. Dominik Kuhn (Dodokay) became famous in Germany with schwÃ¤bisch fandub videos, dubbing among others Barack Obama with German dialect vocals and revised text.[12]",
