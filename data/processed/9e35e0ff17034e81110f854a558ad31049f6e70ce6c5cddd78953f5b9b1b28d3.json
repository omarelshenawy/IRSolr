Due to the sections' large size, traditional transportation methods proved infeasible,[28] so they are brought to the Jean-Luc LagardÃ¨re Plant assembly hall in Toulouse, France by specialised surface transportation, though some parts are moved by the A300-600ST Beluga aircraft used in the construction of other Airbus models.[29] A380 components are provided by suppliers from around the world; the four largest contributors, by value, are Rolls-Royce, Safran, United Technologies and General Electric.[21]",
