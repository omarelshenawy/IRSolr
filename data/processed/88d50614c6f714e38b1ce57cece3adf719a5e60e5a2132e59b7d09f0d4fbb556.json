				"previous": "In 1962, Aeroflot began operating the Tupolev Tu-124, the smaller version of the Tu-104, on regional routes. These were later replaced by the Tupolev Tu-134, which entered service in 1967. Upgraded versions of the Tu-134 still make up much of the Russian regional fleet today.[needs update] The Tupolev Tu-114, originally used to transport Soviet leaders and once the worldâââ'ââs largest commercial aircraft, came into service on 24Â AprilÂ 1961Â (1961-04-24) on the MoscowâKhabarovsk route.[67][68] It also served international routes, such as MoscowâTokyo in conjunction with Japan Airlines,[69] as well as the MoscowâHavana route, which started on 7Â JanuaryÂ 1963Â (1963-01-07)âthe airline's longest non-stop service at that time.[68][70] The first Ilyushin Il-62 long-range four-engined airliner entered service with Aeroflot in 1967, with an inaugural flight from Moscow to Montreal on 15 September.[71] It was complemented, in 1972, by medium-range Tupolev Tu-154. This jet is the most popular Russian airliner, with more than 1,000 made. The Tu-154M variant was delivered to Aeroflot in 1984.[72]",
				"after": "The carrier started flying the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144 on freighter services in 1975.[73] On 1Â NovemberÂ 1977Â (1977-11-01), the aircraft was deployed on the 1,750-nautical-mile (3,240Â km; 2,010Â mi) long Moscow-DomodedovoâAlma-Ata route on a regular basis,[74] yet these services were discontinued in MayÂ 1978Â (1978-05).[75] That month, an aircraft of the type resulted written off on an emergency landing following an electrical failure, withdrawing political support to the project and putting an end to the production.[76] Despite official versions indicating the indefinite suspension of supersonic flights within the Soviet Union, a re-engined version of the aircraft was put on a test flight between Moscow and Khabarovsk in JuneÂ 1979Â (1979-06),[77] and the 3,750-mile (6,040Â km) long route was later covered with scheduled services;[78] it was not a nonstop flight, however, since the aircraft had to make a refuelling stop, as the engines consumed more fuel than expected.[76] First flown in MarchÂ 1975Â (1975-03), the 120-seater Yakovlev Yak-42 entered service with Aeroflot in 1980.[72] The 350-seater Ilyushin Il-86, the first Russian-made wide-body aircraft,[79] had its maiden flight in DecemberÂ 1976Â (1976-12),[72][80] and entered scheduled services with the carrier on the Moscow-VnukovoâTashkent run in 1981.[81][nb 1] The aircraft was phased out by the end of 2006.[83]",
