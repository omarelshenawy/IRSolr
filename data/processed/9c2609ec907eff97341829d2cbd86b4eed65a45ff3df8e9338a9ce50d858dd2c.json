The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red.[6] The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black.[13][6][2] The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.[12]",
