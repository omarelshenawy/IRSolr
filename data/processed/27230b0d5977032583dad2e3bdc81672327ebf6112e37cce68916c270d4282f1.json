				"after": "While the 747-100 powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough payload and range for US domestic operations, it was marginal for long international route sectors. The demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved â200, which featured more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the â100. A few early â200s retained the three-window configuration of the â100 on the upper deck, but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side.[128] The 747-200 was produced in passenger (â200B), freighter (â200F), convertible (â200C), and combi (â200M) versions.[129]",
