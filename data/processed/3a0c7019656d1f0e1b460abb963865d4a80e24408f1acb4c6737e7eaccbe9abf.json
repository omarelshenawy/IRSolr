In 2003 SR22s were first delivered with the Avidyne Entegra primary flight display which later that year became standard equipment, making the aircraft the first of its kind to come standard with an all glass cockpit.[15] Retrofits are available for the older aircraft that replace the instrument panels with a new one that will include the PFD, a new multifunction display and the installation of back-up mechanical instruments.[16]",
