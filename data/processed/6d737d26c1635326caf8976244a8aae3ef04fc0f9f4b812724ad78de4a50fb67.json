				"previous": "Despite the harsh economic conditions, a number of companies continued to build larger and faster ships. In 1929, the German ships SSÂ Bremen and SSÂ Europa bested the speed record set by Mauretania 20 years earlier with an average speed of almost 28 knots (52Â km/h; 32Â mph). The ships used bulbous bows and steam turbines to reach these high speeds while maintaining economical operating costs. In 1933, the Italian Line's 51,100-ton ocean liner SSÂ Rex, with a time of four days and thirteen hours,[19] captured the westbound Blue Riband, which she held for two years. In 1935, French liner SSÂ Normandie used a revolutionary new hull design and powerful turbo-electric transmission to take the Blue Riband from the Rex. Due to poor economic conditions, the British government amalgamated the Cunard Line and White Star Lines. The newly merged company countered with liners RMSÂ Queen Mary and RMSÂ Queen Elizabeth. Queen Mary held the Blue Riband in 1936-37 and from 1938-52.[20]",
				"after": "In World War II many liners were used as troop ships. Notable ocean liners, such as Queen Mary, Aquitania, Cap Arcona, Laconia, Queen Elizabeth, and Orontes all helped transport troops. While some ocean liners survived the war, many others were lost.",
