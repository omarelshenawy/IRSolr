Baker, to closely examine the program and the overall condition of the Air Corps. Known as the Baker Board,[n 6] it included all five military members of an earlier board chaired by General Hugh A. Drum, four of them senior Army ground force officers, who tightly controlled the agenda and scope of the board's investigation to prevent it from becoming a platform for advocating an independent air arm. Of the 11 members, only three were Air Corps advocates.[15][n 7]",
