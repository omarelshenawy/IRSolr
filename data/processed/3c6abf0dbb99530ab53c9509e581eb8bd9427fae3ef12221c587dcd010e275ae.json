				"after": "Arkia was founded in 1949 as Israel Inland Airlines when it became clear that there was demand for a local airline to connect Tel Aviv with different regions of the then-new state of Israel, especially with Eilat, Israel's important seaport situated on the Gulf of Aqaba.[4] Flights commenced in 1950 with De Havilland DH.89 aircraft, followed by Douglas DC-3s, to inter-connect major towns in Israel from Rosh Pina in the North to the port of Eilat in the South.[4] El Al held a 50% stake in the airline at this time with the Histadrut, Israel's labour federation, being the other shareholder[citation needed]. The airline later adopted the name Eilata Airlines - Aviron, and Arkia Israel Airlines[citation needed]. In its first year of service, Israel Inland Airlines carried 13,485 passengers, using a Curtis Commando.[4]",
