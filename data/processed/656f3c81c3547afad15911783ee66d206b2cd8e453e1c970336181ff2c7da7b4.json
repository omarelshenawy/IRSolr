				"after": "Yttria (Y 2O 3) can serve as host lattice for doping with Eu3+ cations as well as reactant to gain doped yttrium orthovanadate YVO4:Eu3+ or yttrium oxide sulfide Y 2O 2S:Eu3+ phosphors that give the red color in color television picture tubes,[4][5][note 8] though the red color itself is actually emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects energy from the electron gun and passes it to the phosphor.[48] Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations. Besides Eu3+ also Tb3+ can be used as a doping agent leading to green luminescence. Yttria is also used as a sintering additive in the production of porous silicon nitride[49] and as a common starting material for both material science and for producing other compounds of yttrium.",
