				"previous": "LaGuardia opened with four runways at 45-degree angles to each other,[16] the longest (13/31) being 6,000Â ft (1,800Â m). Runway 18/36 was closed soon after a United DC-4 ran off the south end in 1947; runway 9/27 (4500Â ft) was closed around 1958, allowing LaGuardia's terminal to expand northward after 1960. Circa 1961 runway 13/31 was shifted northeastward to allow construction of a parallel taxiway (such amenities being unknown when LGA was built) and in 1965â66 both remaining runways were extended to their present 7,000Â ft (2,100Â m).",
				"after": "The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 283 weekday fixed-wing departures from LaGuardia: 126 American, 49 Eastern, 33 Northeast, 31 TWA, 29 Capital and 15 United. American's flights included 26 nonstops to Boston and 27 to Washington National (mostly Convair 240s).[17] Jet flights (United 727s to Cleveland and Chicago) started on June 1, 1964.",
