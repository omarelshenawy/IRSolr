				"previous": "Although the rock formations exposed in Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge are at least 300Â million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000Â years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, reversing the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded to the south and quickly carved a deep channel on its way to the West Branch Susquehanna River.[40][47]",
				"after": "The park is at an elevation of 1,637 feet (499Â m) on the Allegheny Plateau,[1] which formed in the Alleghenian orogeny some 300Â million years ago, when Gondwana (specifically what became Africa) and what became North America collided, forming Pangaea.[48][49] Although the gorge and its surroundings seem to be mountainous, the area is a dissected plateau. Years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks, forming the valleys, and left the hardest of the ancient rocks relatively untouched on the top of sharp ridges, giving them the appearance of \"mountains\".[47]",
