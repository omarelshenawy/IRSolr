				"previous": "Aliso Creek is known to have historically contained water for most of the year, averaging 6.7 cubic feet per second (0.19Â m3/s) in the wet season;[2] urban runoff has raised the creek's year-round base flow to close to 9.2 cubic feet per second (0.26Â m3/s) at the mouth, with routine surges of more than 700 cubic feet per second (20Â m3/s) in the winter. The United States Geological Survey had two stream gauges on the creekâone at the mouth in Laguna Beach, and one at the El Toro Road bridge near Mission Viejo. The Laguna Beach gauge was in operation from 1983 to 1986, and the El Toro gauge was operational from 1931 to 1980. The former received runoff from about 95Â percent of the watershed, while the latter received runoff from 7.91 square miles (20.49Â km2), or 26Â percent of the watershed area.[17][18]",
				"after": "The largest flow recorded at the Laguna Beach streamflow gauge was 5,400 cubic feet per second (150Â m3/s) with a water depth of 11.3 feet (3.4Â m) on March 1, 1983.[17] The 1983 flood was caused by an El NiÃ±o event causing heavy runoff from the overdeveloped watershed. Damage was worst at the mouth of Aliso Canyon, which contains the Aliso Creek Inn and several other structures.[19] On February 16, 1986, 2,880 cubic feet per second (82Â m3/s) was recorded, and 2,870 cubic feet per second (81Â m3/s) was recorded on October 1, 1983.[17]",
