It then fades to a paler pink, and the tip of the bill becomes blackish.[13] It is difficult to determine the sex of an adult American white ibis from its external appearance, since the sexes have similar plumage.[14] However, there is sexual dimorphism in size and proportion as males are significantly larger and heavier than females and have longer and stouter bills.[15] A study of the American white ibis in southern Florida yielded weight ranges of 872.9 to 1,261Â g (1.924 to 2.780Â lb) for males and 592.7 to 861.3Â g (1.307 to 1.899Â lb) for females, with average weights of 1,036.4Â g (2.285Â lb) for males and 764.5Â g (1.685Â lb) for females.[15][16] The length of adult female and male birds ranges from 53 to 70Â cm (21 to 28Â in) with a 90 to 105Â cm (35 to 41Â in) wingspan.[17][18] Among standard measurements, American white ibis measure 20.5â31Â cm (8.1â12.2Â in) along each wing, have a tail measurement of 9.3â12.2Â cm (3.7â4.8Â in), a tarsus of 6.75â11.3Â cm (2.66â4.45Â in) and a culmen of 11â16.9Â cm (4.3â6.7Â in).[8]",
