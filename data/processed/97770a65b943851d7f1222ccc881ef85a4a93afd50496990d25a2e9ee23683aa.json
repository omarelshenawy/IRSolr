				"after": "Like most other penguin species, the macaroni penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; its breeding colonies are among the largest and most densely populated. Scientist Charles Andre Bost found that macaroni penguins nesting at Kerguelen dispersed eastwards over an area exceeding 3Ã106Â km2. Fitted with geolocation sensors, the 12 penguins studied travelled over 10,000Â km (6,200Â mi) in this period and spent their time largely within a zone 47â49Â°S and 70â110Â°E in the central Indian Ocean, not coming ashore once. This area, known as the Polar Frontal Zone, was notable for the absence of krill.[25]",
