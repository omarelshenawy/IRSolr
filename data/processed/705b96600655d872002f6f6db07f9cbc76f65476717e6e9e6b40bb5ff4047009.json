				"after": "Ãthelwold was a son of King Alfred the Great's older brother, Ãthelred, who was King of Wessex from 865 to 871. While the West Saxons were fighting a Danish Viking invasion, Ãthelred died; his sons were infants, so Alfred became king. He defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in 878, but when he died in 899 the Vikings still controlled Northumbria and East Anglia. In his will (pictured) Alfred favoured his own children over his brother's. Ãthelwold, as senior Ã¦theling (prince of the royal dynasty eligible for kingship), had a strong claim to the throne, and he disputed the crown with Alfred's son, Edward the Elder. Ãthelwold attempted to raise an army to support his claim, but was unable to get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Northumbria, where he was accepted by the Danes as king. In 902 he persuaded the East Anglian Vikings to launch an attack on Edward's territory in Wessex and Mercia. Edward retaliated with a raid on East Anglia, and when he withdrew, his men from Kent lingered and met the East Anglian Danes at the Battle of the Holme. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses, including the death of Ãthelwold, ending the challenge to Edward's rule. (FullÂ article...)",
