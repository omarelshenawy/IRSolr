				"after": "After retirement, Miller remained in the public eye, augmented by persistent \"unsubstantiated rumours of an affair with Princess Margaret\".[4] He made a living as a journalist and columnist, employed by the Daily Express as a \"special cricket writer\" for twenty years.[553][555] As during his career, Miller was a proponent of attacking and bright play. He praised the aggressive leadership of his protege Richie Benaud but criticised the style of play pursued by Australia under Benaud's successors Bob Simpson and Bill Lawry.[556] In the mid-1980s, when Australia was struggling, Miller called for the removal of Allan Border, an obdurate and defensive batsman, from the captaincy.[557]",
