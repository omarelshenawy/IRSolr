				"previous": "In the last six years, Harvard's student population ranged between 19,000 and 21,000, across all programs.[115] Harvard enrolled 6,655 students in undergraduate programs, 3,738 students in graduate programs, and 10,722 students in professional programs.[112] The undergraduate population is 51% female, the graduate population is 48% female, and the professional population is 49% female.[112]",
				"after": "The Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League. Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game, although the HarvardâYale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[116]",
