				"previous": "Despite the unification of the parishes, they continued to operate separate burial grounds. That of Christ Church Greyfriars was a short distance north-east of the church, on the eastern side of King Edward Street, while St Leonard, Foster Lane's, was about 50 feet (15Â m) further east.[7]",
				"after": "Immediately outside the London Wall at Aldersgate, a short distance north of St Leonard, Foster Lane on Little Britain, is the church of St Botolph's Aldersgate (sometimes referred to as \"St Botolph Without Aldersgate\", a reference to its position immediately outside the historic city gate).[8] Although the original church, first mentioned in 1493,[9] had survived the Great Fire, it was demolished between 1754 and 1757 and replaced in 1790 by the current building.[6][9]",
