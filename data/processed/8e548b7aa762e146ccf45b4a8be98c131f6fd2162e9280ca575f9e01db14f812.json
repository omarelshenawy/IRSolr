				"previous": "In 1919, to escape Philadelphia's blue laws,[6] Brecker and Yuengling moved the venue to 1658 Broadway at 51st Street in Manhattan,[citation needed] on the second floor of that five-story building, opening on December 31, 1919.[6] It was a \"whites only\" dance club[citation needed] called the \"home of refined dancing\",[citation needed] famed for the \"society orchestra\" groups that played there, starting with Sam Lanin and his Ipana Troubadours.[citation needed]",
				"after": "The all-white, ballroom-dancing atmosphere of the club gradually changed with the ascendance in popularity of hot jazz, as played by African American bands on the New York nightclub scene. Piron's New Orleans Jazz Orchestra played the ballroom in 1924. The Fletcher Henderson band played at Roseland in the 1920s and 1930s. Louis Armstrong, Count Basie (with his \"Roseland Shuffle\"), and Chick Webb followed with their orchestras. Other major-name bandleaders who played the venue included Vincent Lopez, Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, and Glenn Miller. Many big-band performances were broadcast live from Roseland by radio networks; recordings survive of several NBC broadcasts of 1940, featuring the young Ella Fitzgerald fronting the Chick Webb band.",
