				"previous": "In January 1993, Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of an aircraft known as the Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT), aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market.[10][11] This joint study was abandoned two years later, Boeing's interest having declined because analysts thought that such a product was unlikely to cover the projected $15 billion development cost. Despite the fact that only two airlines had expressed public interest in purchasing such a plane, Airbus was already pursuing its own large plane project. Analysts suggested that Boeing would instead pursue stretching its 747 design, and that air travel was already moving away from the hub and spoke system that consolidated traffic into large planes, and toward more non-stop routes that could be served by smaller planes.[12]",
				"after": "In June 1994, Airbus announced its plan to develop its own very large airliner, designated the A3XX.[13][14] Airbus considered several designs, including an unusual side-by-side combination of two fuselages from the A340, which was Airbus's largest jet at the time.[15] The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeing's own New Large Aircraft successor to the 747.[16][17] From 1997 to 2000, as the East Asian financial crisis darkened the market outlook, Airbus refined its design, targeting a 15â20% reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747-400. The A3XX design converged on a double-decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single-deck design,[18][19] in line with traditional hub-and-spoke theory as opposed to the point-to-point theory of the Boeing 777,[20] after conducting an extensive market analysis with over 200 focus groups.[21][22] Although early marketing of the huge cross-section touted the possibility of duty-free shops, restaurant-like dining, gyms, casinos & beauty parlours on board, the realities of airline economics have kept such dreams grounded.",
