It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death.[42] In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers.[43] In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, they were able to adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.[44]",
