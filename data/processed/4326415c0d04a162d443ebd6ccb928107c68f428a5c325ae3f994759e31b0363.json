				"previous": "Off-flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup; causes include contaminants in the boiling apparatus, such as paint or cleanser; changes in the sap, such as fermentation when it has been left sitting too long; and changes in the tree, such as \"buddy sap\" late in the season when budding has begun.[35] In some circumstances it is possible to remove off-flavours through processing.[36]",
