				"previous": "Maersk Air stated in 1988 that regional airlines in Europe needed to tighter linked. Based on this they bought a forty-percent stake in Brymon Airways' holding company, Plimsoll Line, in November 1988. The other major shareholder was British Airways. Brymon was based at London City Airport, but had failed to make a profit since operations commenced.[2] BEA was bought by the Plimsoll Line in 1988s.[1]",
				"after": "By 1991 BEA's revenue had tripled to Â£56.7 million, although its deficits plummeted eightfold to Â£11.8 million.[3] The two companies were merged in October 1992 and renamed Brymon European Airways.[4] However, the two parts of the airline has vastly different scopes, fleets and strategies and few synergies could be taken advantage of. Maersk and British Airways therefore decided to split up the company. The company was demerged in May 1993, with British Airways taking over the former Brymon operations and Maersk taking over the former Birmingham operations. The latter was renamed Maersk Air UK.[5] BA also took over Plymouth Airport in a move in which both airlines bought new shares worth Â£6 million.[4]",
