				"previous": "Banksia menziesii grows either as a gnarled tree to 10Â m (35Â ft), or a lower spreading 1â3Â metre (4â10Â ft) shrub, generally encountered at its northern limits in the vicinity of Eneabba-Mount Adams; thus, it declines steadily in size as the climate becomes warmer and dryer further north.[2] In the shrub form, several stems arise from the woody base known as the lignotuber. The trunk is greyish, sometimes with shades of brown or pink, and the 2â3Â cm (1Â in) thick rough bark breaks away easily. The new growth is covered in fine brownish hair, which wears away after two or three years, leaving smooth stems and leaves.[3] Stems which will bear flower spikes the following year are generally thicker and longer.[4] Oblong in shape and somewhat truncate at the tips, the leaves are grey-green in colour, 8â25Â cm (3â10Â in) long and up to 4Â cm (1.6Â in) wide. The new leaves are paler and finely downy. The leaf margins are serrated with many small 1â2Â mm long triangular teeth. The lower surface of the leaf has a midrib covered in fine pale brown hair.[3]",
				"after": "Flowering occurs in autumn and winter, peaking from May to July. Overall the inflorescences, or flower spikes, take around eight months to development from the first microscopic changes in late spring.[5] Ovoid to cylindrical in shape, the flower spikes can be up to 7â8Â cm (2.6â3.4Â in) wide and 4â12Â cm (1.6â4.8Â in) high.[3] They are composed of numerous individual flowers; one field study south of Perth recorded an average of 1043 per flower spike,[6] while another on plants in cultivation in South Australia recorded an average of 720.[7] B.Â menziesii has more flower colour variants than any other Banksia species, with flower spikes occurring in a wide range of pinks, as well as chocolate, bronze, yellow and white, and greenish variants. They are particularly striking closeup but can look indistinct from a distance. They are most attractive in late bud, the styles contrasting well to the body of the inflorescence, the whole looking like a red- or pink-and white vertical candy striped bloom. The inflorescences are generally a deeper red after colder weather and further into the winter.[8] Anthocyanin pigments are responsible for the red and pink shades in the flowers.[9]",
