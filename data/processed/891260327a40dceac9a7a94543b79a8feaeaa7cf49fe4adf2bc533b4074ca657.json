				"after": "Alsatian is closely related to other nearby Alemannic dialects, such as Swiss German, Swabian, and MarkgrÃ¤flerisch as well as KaiserstÃ¼hlerisch. It is often confused with Lorraine Franconian, a more distantly related Franconian dialect spoken in the northeast corner of Alsace and in neighbouring Lorraine. Like other dialects and languages, Alsatian has also been influenced by outside sources. Words of Yiddish origin can be found in Alsatian, and modern conversational Alsatian includes adaptations of French words and English words, especially concerning new technologies.",
