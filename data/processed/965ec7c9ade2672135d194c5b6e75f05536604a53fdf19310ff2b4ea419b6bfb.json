				"after": "This equation does not satisfy the no-slip condition at the wall. Like Prandtl did for his boundary layer equations, a new, smaller length scale must be used to allow the viscous term to become leading order in the momentum equation. By choosing as the y-scale, the leading order momentum equation for this \"inner boundary layer\" is given by:",
