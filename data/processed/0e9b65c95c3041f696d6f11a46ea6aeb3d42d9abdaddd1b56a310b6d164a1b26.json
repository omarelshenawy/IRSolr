				"The term is based on a rendition of the indigenous (Arandic) word alcheringa, used by the Aranda (Arunta, Arrernte) people of Central Australia, although it appears that it is based on a misunderstanding or mistranslation, and the word has a meaning closer to \"eternal, uncreated\".[2] However, \"Dreamtime\" and \"the Dreaming\" has acquired its own currency in 1980s popular culture based on idealized or fictionalized conceptions of Australian mythology. Since the 1970s, \"Dreaming\" and \"Dream time\" has also returned from academic usage via popular culture and tourism, and is now ubiquitous in the English vocabulary of indigenous Australians in a kind of \"self-fulfilling academic prophecy\".[3]"
