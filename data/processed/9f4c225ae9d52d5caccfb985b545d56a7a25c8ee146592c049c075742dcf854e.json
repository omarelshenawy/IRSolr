The tail rotor is canted and features a rigid crossbeam.[25] The helicopter has a long, low profile shape to meet the Army's requirement for transporting aboard a C-130 Hercules, with some disassembly.[24] It can carry 11 troops with equipment, lift 2,600 pounds (1,200Â kg) of cargo internally or 9,000 pounds (4,100Â kg) of cargo (for UH-60L/M) externally by sling.[15]",
