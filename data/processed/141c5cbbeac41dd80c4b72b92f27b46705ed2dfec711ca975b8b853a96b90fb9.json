				"after": "The A319 is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320. Also known as the A320M-7, it is 3.73 metres (12Â ft 3Â in) shorter than the A320;[53][60][61] four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing were removed. The reduced seating reduces the emergency exits to six. With virtually the same fuel capacity as the A320-200, and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650Â km (3,590Â nmi), or 6,850Â km (3,700Â nmi) with the \"Sharklets\".[61] Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the 23,040-pound-force (102.5Â kN) V2522-A5 and 24,800-pound-force (110Â kN) V2527M-A5 from IAE, or the 22,000-pound-force (98Â kN) CFM56-5B/A and 27,000-pound-force (120Â kN) CFM56-5B7.[64] Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319's lower MTOW.",
