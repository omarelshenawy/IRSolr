There, she trained new armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war.[4] On 25 November 1917, she sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Once in Scapa Flow, the division joined the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. The 6th Battle Squadron was tasked with serving as the \"fast wing\" of the Grand Fleet.[6] On 14 December, Delaware participated in joint Anglo-American maneuvers to practice coordination of the Allied fleet.[4]",
