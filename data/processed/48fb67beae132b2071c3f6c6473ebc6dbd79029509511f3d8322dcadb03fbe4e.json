				"after": "The Cuban iguana is a large lizard, with an average body length of 40 centimeters (16Â in) from snout to vent (the base of the tail).[3] On rare occasions, individual males with lengths of 1.6 meters (5.2Â ft) when measured from the snout to the tip of the tail have been recorded at the wildlife sanctuary within the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (GTMO), Cuba with females being two thirds that size.[15][16] The species is sexually dimorphic: males are much larger than females, and males have enlarged femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones to attract mates and mark territory.[17][18][19] The skin of male Cuban iguanas ranges in color from dark gray to brick red, whereas that of females is olive green with dark stripes or bands.[17] In both sexes, limbs are black with pale brown oval spots and solid black feet.[17] Young animals tend to be dark brown or green with faint darker striping or mottling in five to ten diagonal transverse bands on the body.[17] These bands blend in with the body color as the iguana ages.[17] Both sexes possess a dewlap (skin hanging below the neck) and a row of spines running down their back to their thick tail.[17] Their heads and necks are short and stout, their teeth are solid and broad, and they have powerful jaw muscles.[20] Their jowls, which grow larger as the animal ages, are covered in spiky protuberances called tubercles.[20]",
