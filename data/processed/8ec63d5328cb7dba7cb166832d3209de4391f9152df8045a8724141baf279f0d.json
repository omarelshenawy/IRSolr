The passage, attributed to Numbers 13:33, reads, \"And there were the Nephilin [sic], the sons of ANAK, who came of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\"[8] Anak was a biblical figure said to be the forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants.[9] For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 Blue Print, the first edition of Georgia Tech's yearbook,[10] to ANAK in recent editions of The Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.[11]",
