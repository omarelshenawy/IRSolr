				"previous": "British mycologist Donald Dring, in his 1980 monograph on the Clathraceae family, wrote that C.Â ruber was not regarded highly in southern European folklore. He mentions a case of poisoning following its ingestion, reported by Barla in 1858, and notes that Ciro Pollini reported finding it growing on a human skull in a tomb in a deserted church.[20] According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom a cause of cancer;[35] they will usually bury specimens they find.[6] In other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.[35]",
				"after": "Like most of the species of the Phallales order, Clathrus ruber is saprobicâa decomposer of wood and plant organic matterâand is commonly found fruiting in mulch beds.[36] The fungus grows alone or clustered together near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil.[33]",
