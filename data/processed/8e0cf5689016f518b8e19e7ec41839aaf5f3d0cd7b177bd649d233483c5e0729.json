Lawrence, British Army officer known better as Lawrence of Arabia[103] to the explorer, courtier, and man of letters, Sir Walter Raleigh, (who attended Oriel College but left without taking a degree);[104] and the Australian media mogul, Rupert Murdoch.[105] Moreover, 58 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[14] More information on famous senior and junior members of the University can be found in the individual college articles.
