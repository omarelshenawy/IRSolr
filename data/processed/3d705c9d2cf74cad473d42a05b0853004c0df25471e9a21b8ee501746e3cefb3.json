				"previous": "The devils have a complete set of facial vibrissae and ulnar carpels, although it is devoid of anconeal vibrissae. During the third week, the mystacials and ulnarcarpals are the first to form. Subsequently, the infraorbital, interramal, supraorbital and submental vibrissae form. The last four typically occur between the 26th and 39th day.[93]",
				"after": "Their eyes open shortly after their fur coat developsâbetween 87 and 93 daysâand their mouths can relax their hold of the nipple at 100 days.[93] They leave the pouch 105 days after birth, appearing as small copies of the parent and weighing around 200 grams (7.1Â oz).[93] Zoologist Eric Guiler recorded its size at this time as follows: a crown-snout length of 5.87Â cm (2.31Â in), tail length of 5.78Â cm (2.28Â in), pes length 2.94Â cm (1.16Â in), manus 2.30Â cm (0.91Â in), shank 4.16Â cm (1.64Â in), forearm 4.34Â cm (1.71Â in) and crown-rump length is 11.9Â cm (4.7Â in).[93] During this period, the devils lengthen at a roughly linear rate.[93]",
