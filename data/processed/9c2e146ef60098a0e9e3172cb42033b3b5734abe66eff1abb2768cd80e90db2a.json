				"after": "The archipelago is spread out in the area between 37Â° N and the parallels of latitude that pass through the Lisbon area (38Â° 43'Â / 38Â° 55' N), giving it generally a tepid, oceanic, subtropical climate, with mild annual oscillations. Daily maximum temperatures usually range between 15 and 25Â Â°C (59 and 77Â Â°F). The average annual rainfall increases from east to west, and it ranges from 700 to 1600 annual millimetres (27.6â63Â in) on average, reaching 6,300 millimetres (250Â in) on Mount Pico,[31] the highest Portuguese mountain at 2,351Â m (7,713Â ft). The Azores high, an area of high atmospheric pressure, is named after the islands. Under the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, the local climate is \"dry-summer subtropical\", often referred to as \"Mediterranean\". The KÃ¶ppen subtype for this climate is \"Csb\".[32]",
