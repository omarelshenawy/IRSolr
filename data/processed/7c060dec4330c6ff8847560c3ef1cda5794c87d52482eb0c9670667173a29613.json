				"previous": "After the US Army stopped alcohol trading with the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whiskey trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's nickname became Fort Whoop-Up.[8] The whiskey trade led to the Cypress Hills Massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873. The North-West Mounted Police, sent to stop the trade and establish order,[8] arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October 1874. They managed the post for the next 12 years.[8]",
				"after": "Lethbridge's economy developed from drift mines opened by Nicholas Sheran in 1874 and the North Western Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. North Western's president was William Lethbridge, from whom the city derives its name.[10] By the turn of the century, the mines employed about 150 men and producing 300 tonnes of coal each day.[8] In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the Northwest Territories,[11] with production peaking during World War I. An internment camp was set up at the Exhibition Building in Lethbridge from September 1914 to November 1916. [12] After the war, increasing oil and natural gas production gradually replaced coal production,[8] and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957.",
