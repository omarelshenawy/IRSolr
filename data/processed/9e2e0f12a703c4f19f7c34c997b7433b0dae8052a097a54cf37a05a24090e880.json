He worked herding cattle at a feedlot,[11] participated in rodeos, and worked at some ranching jobs.[19] He now works as a press operator for a company that makes magnetic strips.[20]Carolyn Coburn retired in March 2014 from a career working in payroll in the health care industry.[3] Carolyn introduced Steve to horse racing, and when he was looking for a tax write-off, she encouraged him to buy into a racing syndicate instead of purchasing a small airplane.[21][10]",
