They were the last part of the first quadrangle to be built.[31] Sir Eubule Thelwall, principal from 1621 to 1630, built the lodgings at his own expense, to include (in the words of the antiquarian Anthony Wood) \"a very fair dining-room adorned with wainscot curiously engraven\".[93] Tyack said that \"the carved wooden panelling of the main rooms [set] a new standard of luxury for the heads of colleges\".[94] Pevsner commented that the panelling, set in three tiers with ovals placed vertically rather than horizontally, \"looks both dignified and splendid\".[74][91] In 1637, the lodgings were considerably changed with the installation of five \"studyes\".[29] The shell-hood over the doorway (which Pevsner and Casson both called \"beautiful\")[3][53] was added at some point between 1670 and 1740; Pevsner dates it to about 1700.[3][68] It is elaborately carved on the inside with a decorated cartouche and a cherub-head.[66] Casson called it the college's \"most engaging\" feature.[53] The original gables over the front of the lodgings were removed and replaced with battlements between 1733 and 1740.[1]",
