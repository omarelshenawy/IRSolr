				"after": "The emus of King Island were first recorded by Europeans when a party from the ship Lady Nelson, led by John Murray, visited the island in January 1802. The bird was sporadically mentioned by travellers henceforward, but not in detail.[4] Captain Nicolas Baudin visited King Island later in 1802, during an 1800â04 French expedition to map the coast of Australia. Two ships, Le Naturaliste and Le GÃ©ographe, were part of the expedition, which also brought along naturalists who described the local wildlife.[10] FranÃ§ois PÃ©ron, a naturalist who was part of Baudin's expedition, visited King Island and was the last person to record descriptions of the King Island emu from the wild.[15] At one point, PÃ©ron and some of his companions became stranded due to storms and took refuge with some seal hunters. They were served emu meat, which PÃ©ron described in favourable terms as tasting halfway \"between that of the turkey-cock and that of the young pig\".[4]",
