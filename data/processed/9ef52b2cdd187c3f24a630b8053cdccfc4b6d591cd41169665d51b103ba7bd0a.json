				"This aircraft shouldn't be mistaken with Ilyushin Il-4 (cn 17404) exhibited in Victory Park collection of the Central museum of Great Patriotic War, Moscow.[citation needed]",
				"The only known surviving DB-3 is currently displayed at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino, near Moscow, Russia.[9] The aircraft was found in taiga forests, 120Â km from Komsomolsk-on-Amur. It was recovered in September 1988 and brought to the Irkutsk Aircraft Industrial Association (IAIA) factory on board an Ilyushin Il-76 transport. After over a year of restoration, the aircraft was delivered to Monino on board an Antonov An-22. On 22 December 1989, representatives of IAIA, headed by V.P. Zelenkov, handed over the DB-3 to museum officials."
