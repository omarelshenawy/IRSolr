				"after": "Queluz is famed for the glory of its gardens,[10] which include a large topiary parterre laid out in the manner of Le NÃ´tre at the rear of the palace (see key 14). The Flemish influences, including the canals, in the garden are the work of the Dutch gardener Gerald van der Kolk, who assisted Robillon from 1760.[27] Formal terraces and walkways are given extra interest by statuary and fountains. The dominant feature of the principal parterre is the \"Portico dos Cavalinhos\", a garden temple flanked by two allegorical equestrian statues depicting Fames, and two sphinxes (see final illustration) surreally dressed in 18th-century costume, combining the formal and the fantastic.[28] This surreal theme continues elsewhere in the gardens where such motifs as the rape of the Sabines and the death of Abel alternate with statuary of donkeys dressed in human clothing. Deeper in the gardens is a grotto complete with a cascade. Later to be a popular feature in Portuguese gardens, the Queluz cascade was the first artificial waterfall to be constructed near Lisbon.[28]",
