				"after": "The Peru national football team has represented Peru in international football since 1927. Organised by the Peruvian Football Federation, it is one of ten members of FIFA's South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), playing most home matches at the Estadio Nacional in Lima. Peru took part in the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and the 1936 Olympic football competition. Goalkeeper Juan Valdivieso and forwards Teodoro FernÃ¡ndez and Alejandro Villanueva led the squad to wins in the 1938 Bolivarian Games and the 1939 Copa AmÃ©rica. The team won the Copa AmÃ©rica in 1975 and qualified for three World Cups in the 1970s with Hugo Sotil, defender HÃ©ctor Chumpitaz, and TeÃ³filo Cubillas, the player often regarded as Peru's greatest. Peru last qualified for the World Cup in 1982 (team pictured). Players wear white shirts adorned with a red diagonal stripe, Peru's national colours. This basic design has been used continuously since 1936, and gives rise to the team's common Spanish nickname, la Blanquirroja (\"the white-and-red\"). The team has longstanding rivalries with Chile and Ecuador. (FullÂ article...)",
