				"after": "Public transport in Shaw and Crompton is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester.[106] Shaw and Crompton had a railway line and station between 1863 and 2009, opened initially for haulage, but later used for passenger and commuter journeys.[31] Shaw and Crompton railway station was used by passenger trains running between Rochdale and Manchester on the Oldham Loop Line. After initially being rejected in the early 2000s, plans to turn the line into part of the light-rail Metrolink system were accepted by the government on 6 July 2006.[107] Shaw and Crompton railway station closed on 3 October 2009, so that it can be converted from use with heavy rail to Metrolink.[108][109][110] Shaw and Crompton Metrolink station opened on 16 December 2012.[51][52]",
