				"after": "Hong Kong is frequently described as a place where \"East meets West\", reflecting the culture's mix of the territory's Chinese roots with influences from its time as a British colony.[215] Concepts like feng shui are taken very seriously, with expensive construction projects often hiring expert consultants, and are often believed to make or break a business.[216] Other objects like Ba gua mirrors are still regularly used to deflect evil spirits,[217] and buildings often lack any floor number that has a 4 in it,[218] due to its similarity to the word for \"die\" in Cantonese.[219] The fusion of east and west also characterises Hong Kong's cuisine, where dim sum, hot pot, and fast food restaurants coexist with haute cuisine.[220]",
