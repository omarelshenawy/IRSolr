				"after": "Jet Airways announced its first takeover attempt on 19 January 2006, offering US$500 million (â¹20Â billion) in cash for the airline.[7] Market reaction to the deal was mixed, with many analysts suggesting that Jet Airways was paying too much for Air Sahara. The Indian Civil Aviation Ministry gave approval in principle, but the deal was eventually called off over disagreements over price and the appointment of Jet chairman Naresh Goyal to the Air Sahara board. Following the failure of the deal, the companies filed lawsuits seeking damages from each other[8]",
