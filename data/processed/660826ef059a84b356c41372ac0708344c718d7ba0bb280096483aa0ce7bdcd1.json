				"previous": "Off-flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup; causes include contaminants in the boiling apparatus, such as paint or cleanser; changes in the sap, such as fermentation when it has been left sitting too long; and changes in the tree, such as \"buddy sap\" late in the season when budding has begun.[35] In some circumstances it is possible to remove off-flavours through processing.[36]",
			"after": [
				"Maple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow.",
				"A maple syrup production farm is called a \"sugarbush\" or \"sugarwood\". Sap is often boiled in a \"sugar house\" (also known as a \"sugar shack,\" \"sugar shanty,\" or cabane Ã  sucre), a building louvered at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.[37]"
