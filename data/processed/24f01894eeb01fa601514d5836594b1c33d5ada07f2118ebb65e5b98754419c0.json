				"previous": "Based on Antonov's earlier An-124, the An-225 has fuselage barrel extensions added fore and aft of the wings. The wings also received root extensions to increase span. Two more Progress D-18T turbofan engines were added to the new wing roots, bringing the total to six. An increased-capacity landing gear system with 32 wheels was designed, some of which are steerable, enabling the aircraft to turn within a 60Â m (200Â ft) wide runway. Like its An-124 predecessor, the An-225 has nosegear designed to kneel so cargo can be more easily loaded and unloaded.[5] The An-124âs rear cargo door and ramp were removed to save weight and the empennage was changed from a single vertical stabilizer to a twin tail with an oversized horizontal stabilizer. The twin tail was essential to enable the plane to carry large, heavy external loads that would disturb the airflow around a conventional tail. Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for tactical airlifting and is not designed for short-field operation.[7]",
				"after": "Initially the An-225 had a maximum gross weight of 600Â t (1,300,000Â lb), but from 2000 to 2001 the aircraft underwent modifications such as the addition of a reinforced floor, which increased the maximum gross weight to 640Â t (1,410,000Â lb) at a cost of US$20M.[19][20][21]",
