				"after": "In the 1930s, Brazil decided to modernize both SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Geraes. SÃ£o Pauloââ'âs dilapidated state made this uneconomical; at the time she could sail at a maximum of 10 knots (19Â km/h; 12Â mph), less than half her design speed.[42] As a result, while Minas Geraes was thoroughly refitted from 1931 to 1938 in the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard,[29] SÃ£o Paulo was employed as a coast-defense ship, a role in which she remained for the rest of her service life.[3] During the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution, she acted as the flagship of a naval blockade of Santos.[29] After repairs in 1934 and 1935, she returned to lead three naval training exercises. In the same year, accompanied by the Brazilian cruisers Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul, the Argentine battleships Rivadavia and Moreno, six Argentine cruisers, and a group of destroyers, SÃ£o Paulo carried the Brazilian President GetÃºlio Dornelles Vargas up the River Plate to Buenos Aires to meet with the presidents of Argentina and Uruguay.[1][52]",
