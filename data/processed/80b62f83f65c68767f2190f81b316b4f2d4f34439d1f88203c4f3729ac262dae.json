				"previous": "In 1939, with Germanyâs invasion of France looming, MirÃ³ relocated to Varengeville in Normandy, and on 20 May of the following year, as Germans invaded Paris, he narrowly fled to Spain (now controlled by Francisco Franco) for the duration of the Vichy Regimeâs rule.[15] In Varengeville, Palma, and Mont-roig, between 1940 and 1941, MirÃ³ created the twenty-three gouache series Constellations. Revolving around celestial symbolism, Constellations earned the artist praise from AndrÃ© Breton, who seventeen years later wrote a series of poems, named after and inspired by MirÃ³'s series.[16] Features of this work revealed a shifting focus to the subjects of women, birds, and the moon, which would dominate his iconography for much of the rest of his career.",
				"after": "Shuzo Takiguchi published the first monograph on MirÃ³ in 1940. In 1948â49 MirÃ³ lived in Barcelona and made frequent visits to Paris to work on printing techniques at the Mourlot Studios and the Atelier LacouriÃ¨re. He developed a close relationship with Fernand Mourlot and that resulted in the production of over one thousand different lithographic editions.",
