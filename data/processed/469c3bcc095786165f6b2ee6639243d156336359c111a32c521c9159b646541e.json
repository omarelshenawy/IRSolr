				"previous": "The corolla flares open into five lobes, two upper lobes and three lower lobes. The upper lobes are 7â16Â millimeters (Â¼ââÂ in.) long by 4â9Â millimeters (5â32ââÂ in.) wide and generally oblong, obovate, or cuneate. The lower lobes are similarly shaped and are 7â20Â millimeters (Â¼âÂ¾Â in.) long by 4â18Â millimeters (5â32âÂ¾Â in.) wide. The central lower lobe is usually slightly longer than its neighbors. All of the petal lobes have rounded ends. The floral tube that houses the reproductive organs and is visible at the base of corolla lobes is white or lilac in color and 4â6Â millimeters (5â32âÂ¼Â in.) long. The white color of the floral tube can extend to a variable distance onto the corolla lobes, particularly in a stripe on the lower middle lobe.[12] The color of the corolla lobes generally varies from pink to purple, but has been described by collectors as being \"purple, scarlet, rosy-lavender to bluish-purple, dark pink to lavender, pinkish-purple, deep violet-purple, dark purple, bright mauve-pink, bright purple-pink, magenta with [white eye], [and] reddish pale with white eye.\"[19] A rare white-flowered form is also known.[19]",
