Tobacco smoking, for example, causes 90% of lung cancer.[28] It also causes cancer in the larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.[29] Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[30] Tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world,[31] and about one in five worldwide.[30] Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[32][33]",
