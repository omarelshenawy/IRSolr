				"previous": "Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37Â percent approval ratings for Bush,[360] the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28Â percent),[353][361] which contributed to what Bush called the \"thumping\" of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections.[362] Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;[363] the average for his entire second term was 37Â percent, according to Gallup.[364]",
				"after": "By the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19Â percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans.[348] Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being \"the worst president,\"[365][366] Bush would say, \"I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls.\"[367]",
