An example of this tendency is La RevoluciÃ³n de Mayo y Mariano Moreno by Ricardo Levene.[124] Biographers would describe him as a serene statesman, a notable economist, a decided democrat, and a great leader.[124] For those historians, Moreno would have been an anglophile, and \"The Representation of the Hacendados\", the government platform of the May Revolution.[125]",
