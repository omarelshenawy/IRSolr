				"previous": "Adkins discussed the situation with Manning's therapists, but did not pass the email to anybody above him in his chain of command; he told Manning's court-martial that he was concerned the photograph would be disseminated among other staff.[63] Captain Steven Lim, Manning's company commander, said he first saw the email after Manning's arrest, when information about hormone replacement therapy was found in Manning's room on base; at that point Lim learned that Manning had been calling herself Breanna.[64]",
				"after": "Manning told Adrian Lamo that she had set up Twitter and YouTube accounts as Breanna to give her female identity a digital presence, writing to Lamo: \"I wouldn't mind going to prison for the rest of my life [for leaking information], or being executed so much, if it wasn't for the possibility of having pictures of me... plastered all over the world press... as [a] boy... [...] the CPU is not made for this motherboard...\"[65] On April 30 she posted on Facebook that she was utterly lost, and over the next few days wrote that she was \"not a piece of equipment,\" and was \"beyond frustrated\" and \"livid\" after being \"lectured by ex-boyfriend despite months of relationship ambiguity ...\"[66]",
