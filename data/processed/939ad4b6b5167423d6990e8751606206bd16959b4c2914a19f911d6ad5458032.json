				"after": "The model of diplomatic spheres of influence resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814â15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe. However, the negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia's growing strength within and among the German states, failing to foresee that Prussia would challenge Austria for leadership within the German states. This German dualism presented two solutions to the problem of unification: Kleindeutsche LÃ¶sung, the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or GroÃdeutsche LÃ¶sung, greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria). Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successesâespecially Prussian onesâin three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813â14. By establishing a Germany without Austria, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism.",
