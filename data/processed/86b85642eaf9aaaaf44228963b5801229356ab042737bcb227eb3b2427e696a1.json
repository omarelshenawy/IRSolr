				"after": "The king vulture inhabits an estimated 14Â millionÂ km2 (5.4Â millionÂ mi2) between southern Mexico and northern Argentina.[35] In South America, it does not live west of the Andes,[29] except in western Ecuador,[36] north-western Colombia and far north-western Venezuela.[37] It primarily inhabits undisturbed tropical lowland forests as well as savannas and grasslands with these forests nearby.[38] It is often seen near swamps or marshy places in the forests.[10] This bird is often the most numerous or only vulture present in primary lowland forests in its range, but in the Amazon rainforest it is typically outnumbered by the greater yellow-headed vulture, while typically outnumbered by the lesser yellow-headed, turkey and American black vulture in more open habitats.[39] King vultures generally do not live above 1500Â m (5000Â ft), although are found in places at 2500Â m (8000Â ft) altitude east of the Andes, and have been rarely recorded up to 3300Â m (10000Â ft)[26] They inhabit the emergent forest level, or above the canopy.[3] Pleistocene remains have been recovered from Buenos Aires Province in central Argentina, over 700Â km (450Â mi) south of its current range, giving rise to speculation on the habitat there at the time which had not been thought to be suitable.[40]",
