				"previous": "The cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generation of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of 1,520Â m (5,000Â ft) up to 12,000Â m (39,000Â ft).[171][172] It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and 60Â cm (2.0Â ft) extra headroom versus the 747-400.[173][174] Seating options range from 4-abreast in first class to 11-across in economy.[175][176] On other aircraft, economy seats range from 41.5Â cm (16.3Â in) to 52.3Â cm (20.6Â in) in width,[177] A380 economy seats are up to 48Â cm (19Â in) wide in a 10-abreast configuration;[178] compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 which typically has seats 44.5Â cm (17.5Â in) wide.[179]",
				"after": "The A380's upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, fore and aft, wide enough to accommodate two passengers side-by-side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations. The maximum certified carrying capacity is 853 passengers in an all-economy-class layout,[43] Airbus lists the \"typical\" three-class layout as accommodating 525 passengers, with 10 first, 76 business, and 439 economy class seats.[113] Airline configurations range from Korean Air's 407 passengers to Air Austral's proposed 840 passengers.[180][181] and average around 480â490 seats. The A380's interior illumination system uses bulbless LEDs in the cabin, cockpit, and cargo decks. The LEDs in the cabin can be altered to create an ambience simulating daylight, night, or intermediate levels.[182] On the outside of the aircraft, HID lighting is used for brighter illumination.",
