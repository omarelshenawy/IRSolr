Occasionally, municipalities dissolve or disincorporate, which may happen if they become fiscally insolvent, and services become the responsibility of a higher administration (for example, Cabazon, California, disincorporated in 1972). In some countries, such as in France, Brazil or the United Kingdom, there are no unincorporated areas as all parts of the country are incorporated.",
