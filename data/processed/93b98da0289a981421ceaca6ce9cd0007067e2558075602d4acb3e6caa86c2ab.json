				"after": "The Washington Post described the \"lively literary disputes\" conducted in the 'letters to the editor' column of the Review as \"the closest thing the intellectual world has to bare-knuckle boxing\".[3] In addition to reviews, interviews and articles, the paper features extensive advertising from publishers promoting newly published books. It includes a popular \"personals\" section that \"share[s] a cultivated writing style\" with its articles.[33][57] One lonely heart, author Jane Juska, documented the 63 replies to her personal ad in the Review with a 2003 memoir, A Round-Heeled Woman, that became a West-End play.[58][59]",
