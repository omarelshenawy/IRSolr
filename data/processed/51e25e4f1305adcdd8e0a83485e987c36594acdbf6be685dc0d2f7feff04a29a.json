				"previous": "Five Airbus A330-200s were ordered in late 2003, along with nine ATR72-500sâsix of them taken over from and order previously placed by Khalifa Airways. The former type would act as a replacement for the two Airbus A310s, a Boeing 747-200 and three Boeing 767-300s, while the latter would replace the seven-strong Fokker F27 fleet.[71][72] Four more ATR72-500s were ordered in 2009 at a cost of approximately US$82Â million,[73][74] with the first of these 66-seater four turboprop machines being phased-in in FebruaryÂ 2010Â (2010-02).[75] Also in 2009, during the Dubai Airshow, Air AlgÃ©rie announced the purchase of seven additional Boeing 737-800s.[76][77] In AprilÂ 2011Â (2011-04), the fourth aircraft from this order became the 50th Boeing jetliner delivered to the company.[78]",
