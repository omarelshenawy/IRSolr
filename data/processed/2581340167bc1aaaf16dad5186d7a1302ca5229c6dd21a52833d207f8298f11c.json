				"The Civil Aviation Authority of Dubai manages the overall safety and security of the airport. Pre-screening takes place in all terminals at the entrance of the airport.[156]",
				"Retinal scanning has been implemented in all UAE airports. This type of scanning prevents those deported from the UAE for serious criminal charges from returning again using fradulent documents (UAE nationals are exempt from retinal scans). Carry-on luggage and personal screening are conducted at the individual departure gates, while check-in luggage is screened in the backrooms and secured before loading. Dubai Airport Police plans to introduce a biometric identification system for access into restricted areas.[157]"
