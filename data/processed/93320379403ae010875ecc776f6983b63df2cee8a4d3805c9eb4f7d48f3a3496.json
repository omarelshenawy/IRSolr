				"previous": "New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade,[206] particularly in agricultural products.[207] Exports account for a high 24 percent of its output,[137] making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns. Food products made up 55% of the value of all the country's exports in 2014; wood was the second largest earner (7%).[208] Its major export partners are Australia, United States, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom.[137] On 7 April 2008, New Zealand and China signed the New ZealandâChina Free Trade Agreement, the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country.[209][210] The service sector is the largest sector in the economy, followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction.[137] Tourism plays a significant role in New Zealand's economy, contributing $15.0 billion to New Zealandâs total GDP and supporting 9.6 percent of the total workforce in 2010.[211] International visitors to New Zealand increased by 3.1 percent in the year to October 2010[212] and are expected to increase at a rate of 2.5 percent annually up to 2015.[211]",
				"after": "Wool was New Zealandâs major agricultural export during the late 19th century.[186] Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues,[186] but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities[213] and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers.[214] In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007,[215] to become New Zealand's largest export earner.[216] In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21 percent ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports,[217] and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade.[218] Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2 percent, wool 6.3 percent, fruit 3.5 percent and fishing 3.3 percent. New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period,[219] overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007.[220][221]",
