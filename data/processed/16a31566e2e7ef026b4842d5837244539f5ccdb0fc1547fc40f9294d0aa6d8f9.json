However, given a \"Keyhole Markup Language\" file, as displayed by Google Earth and other systems, the best that can be done is to give a link to a web page that offers it for download - or has done so at some time. Such a link is tenuous. If the W. article could offer the ability to download the file, its presence would be guaranteed and also its version would match any discussion in the article - unless removed from the article via the usual editing. But W. does not itself display the content of such files, and, not recognising the format, does not enable their upload for delivery on request. One could take a screen shot of the results of the .kml file (along with the other material displayed by Google Earth) but such an image is fixed.",
