				"previous": "GoodHome.com encountered difficulties in running its business in 2000, when several other companies that offered similar services launched. The increasing demand for online catalog services, considered a phenomenon, was dubbed the \"hottest thing since sliced bread\" by an analyst from technology research firm Forrester Research, which estimated that roughly $500Â million was invested in home furnishing websites from 1999 to 2000.[21] It became difficult for consumers to decide which service provided better quality; a business owner commented, \"You can't tell the difference in quality between something that's $3,000 and something that's $10,000.\"[21] GoodHome.com, which had offered free shipping, phased out the feature on July 15, 2000, in favor of \"heavily subsidized rates\".[21] To compete with new companies, GoodHome.com also introduced new features such as a \"floor planning\" feature to allow website visitors build an electronic version of their rooms, then drag in furnishings to see how they fit.[21]",
