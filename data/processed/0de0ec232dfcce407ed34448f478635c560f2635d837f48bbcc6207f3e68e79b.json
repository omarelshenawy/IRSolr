Slabaugh noted Barber's account that the busts were based on the sculpture by Houdon and the medal by Caunois, but, \"possibly these did have some effect on the design but it has always been my belief that the immediate source or idea for the design was the Yorktown Centennial medal of 1881.\"[21] Swiatek and Breen contended that although the ultimate ancestor of Barber's depiction of Washington was the Houdon bust, the source of the Lafayette bust and the format of the obverse \"was beyond doubt Peter L. Krider's Yorktown Centennial Medal (1881)\".[22] Krider, a Philadelphia engraver not employed by the Mint, issued a number of tokens and medals in the 1870s and 1880s.[23] \"United States of America\" and \"Lafayette Dollar\" appear at the top and bottom of the obverse of the coin.[24]",
