				"after": "Another method of geometric construction uses right triangles and induction: â1 can, of course, be constructed, and once âx has been constructed, the right triangle with 1 and âx for its legs has a hypotenuse of âx + 1. The Spiral of Theodorus is constructed using successive square roots in this manner.",
