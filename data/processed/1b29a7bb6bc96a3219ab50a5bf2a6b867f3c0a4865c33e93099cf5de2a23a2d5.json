				"previous": "The flesh of the ocean sunfish is considered a delicacy in some regions, the largest markets being Taiwan and Japan. All parts of the sunfish are used in cuisine, from the fins to the internal organs.[16] Some parts of the fish are used in some areas of traditional medicine.[12] If the body does contain toxins, then the marketing and sale of ocean sunfish is forbidden in the European Union according to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council.[3]",
				"after": "Sunfish are accidentally but frequently caught in drift gillnet fisheries, making up nearly 30% of the total catch of the swordfish fishery employing drift gillnets in California.[19] The bycatch rate is even higher for the Mediterranean swordfish industry, with 71% to 90% of the total catch being sunfish.[16][30]",
