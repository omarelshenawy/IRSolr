				"after": "The location of the Soak Zone was originally an island known as Flower Island, until part of the surrounding lake was filled in. Under previous names it was called the H20hhh Zone and later Dr. Hydro's Soak Zone. The area originally consisted of just the pool and bathhouse, until slides were first added in 1985. A raft ride, Rafter's Run, was added the next year.[27] The water park has since been expanded to include body slides, inner-tube slides, a slide with foam mats, and many features for children, including a miniature pool and Captain Kidd's Adventure Galley, a play area added in 2006.[23] The swimming pool was replaced by a wave pool in 2011. The addition was the park's single-largest capital improvement.[28] For the 2013 season the park added a lazy river and an expanded beach area.[29]",
