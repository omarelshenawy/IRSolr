				"previous": "As of 26 March 2012 104 Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft (all variants) remained in airline service.[21][22] As of 20 February 2011 in Iran, all the remaining numbers of this aircraft were grounded after two recent incidents.[23][24] As of December 2013 to May 2014, major operators included:",
				"after": "As of January 2011, since 1970 there have been 110 serious incidents involving the Tu-154,[27] and 69 hull losses, 30 of which did not involve fatalities.[28] Of the fatal incidents, five resulted from terrorist or military action (two other war-time losses were non fatal), several from poor runway conditions in winter (including one in which the airplane struck snow plows on the runway), cargo overloading in the lapse of post-Soviet federal safety standards, and mid-air collisions due to faulty air traffic control. Other incidents resulted from mechanical problems (two cases prior to 2001), running out of fuel on unscheduled routes, pilot errors (including inadequate flight training for new crews), and cargo fires; several accidents remain unexplained.",
