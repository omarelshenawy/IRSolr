				"after": "Like most other Proteaceae, B.Â integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.Â integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.[27]",
