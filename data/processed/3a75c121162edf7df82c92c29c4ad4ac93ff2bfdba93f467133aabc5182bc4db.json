				"Physically, standing waves are formed by the interference (superposition) of waves and their reflections (although one may also say the opposite; that a moving wave is a superposition of standing waves). The geometric shape of the medium determines what would be the interference pattern, thus determines the Æ(x, y,Â z) form of the standing wave. This space-dependence is called a normal mode."
