				"previous": "Raccoons usually mate in a period triggered by increasing daylight between late January and mid-March.[131] However, there are large regional differences which are not completely explicable by solar conditions. For example, while raccoons in southern states typically mate later than average, the mating season in Manitoba also peaks later than usual in March and extends until June.[132] During the mating season, males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them during the three- to four-day period when conception is possible. These encounters will often occur at central meeting places.[133] Copulation, including foreplay, can last over an hour and is repeated over several nights.[134] The weaker members of a male social group also are assumed to get the opportunity to mate, since the stronger ones cannot mate with all available females.[135] In a study in southern Texas during the mating seasons from 1990 to 1992, about one third of all females mated with more than one male.[136] If a female does not become pregnant or if she loses her kits early, she will sometimes become fertile again 80 to 140Â days later.[137]",
				"after": "After usually 63 to 65Â days of gestation (although anywhere from 54 to 70Â days is possible), a litter of typically two to five young is born.[138] The average litter size varies widely with habitat, ranging from 2.5 in Alabama to 4.8 in North Dakota.[139] Larger litters are more common in areas with a high mortality rate, due, for example, to hunting or severe winters.[140] While male yearlings usually reach their sexual maturity only after the main mating season, female yearlings can compensate for high mortality rates and may be responsible for about 50% of all young born in a year.[141] Males have no part in raising young.[142] The kits (also called \"cubs\") are blind and deaf at birth, but their mask is already visible against their light fur.[143] The birth weight of the about 10Â cm (4Â in)-long kits is between 60 and 75Â g (2.1 and 2.6Â oz).[144] Their ear canals open after around 18 to 23Â days, a few days before their eyes open for the first time.[145] Once the kits weigh about 1Â kg (2Â lb), they begin to explore outside the den, consuming solid food for the first time after six to nineÂ weeks.[146] After this point, their mother suckles them with decreasing frequency; they are usually weaned by 16Â weeks.[147] In the fall, after their mother has shown them dens and feeding grounds, the juvenile group splits up.[148] While many females will stay close to the home range of their mother, males can sometimes move more than 20Â km (12Â mi) away.[149] This is considered an instinctive behavior, preventing inbreeding.[150] However, mother and offspring may share a den during the first winter in cold areas.[151]",
