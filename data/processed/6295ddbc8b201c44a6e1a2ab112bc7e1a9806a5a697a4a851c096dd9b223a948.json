It is located at an elevation of 7,100Â ft (2,200Â m)[1] in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region on the Darjeeling-Jalapahar range that originates in the south from Ghum. The range is Y-shaped with the base resting at Katapahar and Jalapahar and two arms diverging north of the Observatory Hill. The north-eastern arm dips suddenly and ends in the Lebong spur, while the north-western arm passes through North Point and ends in the valley near Tukver Tea Estate.[25] The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town in the distance. Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest peak, 8,598Â m (28,209Â ft) high, is the most prominent mountain visible. In days clear of clouds, Nepal's Mount Everest, 29,035Â ft (8,850Â m) high, can be seen.[26]",
