				"previous": "The U.S. government had two purposes when making land agreements with Native Americans: to open it up more land for white settlement,[192] and to ease tensions between whites and Native Americans by forcing Natives to use the land in the same way as did the whitesâfor subsistence farms.[192] The government used a variety of strategies to achieve these goals; many treaties required Native Americans to become farmers in order to keep their land.[192] Government officials often did not translate the documents which Native Americans were forced to sign, and native chiefs often had little or no idea what they were signing.[192]",
				"after": "For a Native American man to marry a white woman, he had to get consent of her parents, as long as \"he can prove to support her as a white woman in a good home\".[195] In the early 19th century, the Shawnee Tecumseh and blonde hair, blue-eyed Rebbecca Galloway had an interracial affair. In the late 19th century, three European-American middle-class women teachers at Hampton Institute married Native American men whom they had met as students.[196]",
