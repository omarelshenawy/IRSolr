				"after": "\"Bedtime Story\" has received positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic, in a review for the album as a whole, wrote that, along with other tracks, it was among the \"best songs on the album\" and that they \"slowly work their melodies into the subconscious as the bass pulses\".[13] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, claiming that the song had unfulfilled potential and that it \"could have been the next 'Vogue'\".[14] In a review for her GHV2 album, he also described the song as a \"trippy follow-up to the mainstream hit 'Take a Bow'\" and gave it an \"A\" rating.[8] Larry Flick from Billboard noted that \"It is easily among her boldest and most experimental pop singles to date\", also noting its \"trippy and cutting-edge trance dance rhythms\". He finished his review praising its \"ingratiating\" hook and \"it is an affecting plea for unconscious bliss and escape, voiced with underplayed angst and resolve\".[15] Peter Galvin from The Advocate noted that the song \"calls to mind the Ecstasy anthem 'Rescue Me'\".[16]",
