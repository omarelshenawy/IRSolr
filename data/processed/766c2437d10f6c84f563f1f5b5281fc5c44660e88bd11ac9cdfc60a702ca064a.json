				"previous": "For surfaces at rest relative to each other , where is the coefficient of static friction. This is usually larger than its kinetic counterpart.",
				"after": "Arthur Morin introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the coefficient of friction.[7] The coefficient of friction is an empirical measurement â it has to be measured experimentally, and cannot be found through calculations.[citation needed] Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction is usually larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.",
