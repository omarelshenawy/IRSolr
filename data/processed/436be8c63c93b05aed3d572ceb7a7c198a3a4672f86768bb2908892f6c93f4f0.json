				"previous": "In November 2001, Polar was acquired by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW), whose Atlas Air subsidiary is a leading provider of ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance) freighter leasing. Polar became the scheduled service provider for AAWW, while Atlas continued to supply Boeing 747 freighters on a wet-lease basis to major airlines. In October 2006, it was announced that DHL Express would be acquiring a 49% stake in Polar, with that deal now finalised.[3] Polar is still majority-owned by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (51%), and has 736 employees (as of March 2007).[2]",
				"after": "[4] Polar provides scheduled freight service covering the transpacific, transatlantic, trans-Asia, and Middle East markets. Polar offers frequent flights to China, connecting Shanghai to Anchorage, Chicago, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and multiple points in Asia and Europe, e.g., Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany.",
