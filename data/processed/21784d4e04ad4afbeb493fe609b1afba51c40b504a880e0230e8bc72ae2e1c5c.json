				"previous": "Similarly, suppose a measuring rod is at rest and aligned along the x-axis in the unprimed system S. In this system, the length of this rod is written as Îx. To measure the length of this rod in the system Sâ², in which the clock is moving, the distances xâ² to the end points of the rod must be measured simultaneously in that system Sâ². In other words, the measurement is characterized by Îtâ² = 0, which can be combined with the fourth equation to find the relation between the lengths Îx and Îxâ²:",
				"after": "This shows that the length (Îxâ²) of the rod as measured in the frame in which it is moving (Sâ²), is shorter than its length (Îx) in its own rest frame (S).",
