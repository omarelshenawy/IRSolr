				"after": "The black vulture is a fairly large bird of prey, measuring 56â74Â cm (22â29Â in) in length, with a 1.33â1.67Â m (52â66Â in) wingspan.[23] Weight for Black Vultures from North America and the Andes ranges from 1.6â2.75Â kg (3.5â6.1Â lb) but in the smaller vultures of the tropical lowlands it is 1.18â1.94Â kg (2.6â4.3Â lb).[24][25] 50 vultures in Texas were found to average 2.15Â kg (4.7Â lb) while 119 birds in Venezuela were found to average 1.64Â kg (3.6Â lb).[26] The extended wing bone measures 38.6â45Â cm (15.2â17.7Â in), the shortish tail measures 16â21Â cm (6.3â8.3Â in) and the relatively long tarsus measures 7â8.5Â cm (2.8â3.3Â in).[27] Its plumage is mainly glossy black. The head and neck are featherless and the skin is dark gray and wrinkled.[28] The iris of the eye is brown and has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid.[29] The legs are grayish white,[30] while the two front toes of the foot are long and have small webs at their bases.[3] The feet are flat, relatively weak, and are poorly adapted to grasping; the talons are also not designed for grasping, as they are relatively blunt.",
