				"previous": "The book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis,[190] but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.[191][192]",
				"after": "Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful.[190] In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \"just as noble a conception of Deity\".[194][195] In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as \"a celebrated cleric\", and added the phrase \"by the Creator\" to the closing sentence, which from then on read \"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\".[148] While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted,[65] Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature,[196][197] and even in the first edition there are several references to \"creation\".[198]",
