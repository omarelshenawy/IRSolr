				"after": "Although now the more common term, \"carnelian\" is a 16th-century corruption of the 14th-century word \"cornelian\" (and its associated orthographies corneline and cornalyn).[7] Cornelian, cognate with similar words in several Romance languages, comes from the Mediaeval Latin corneolus, itself derived from the Latin word cornum, the cornel cherry,[8] whose translucent red fruits resemble the stone. The Oxford English Dictionary calls \"carnelian\" a perversion of \"cornelian\", by subsequent analogy with the Latin word caro, carnis, flesh. According to Pliny the Elder, sard derives its name from the city of Sardis in Lydia, but it more likely comes from the Persian word Ø³Ø±Ø¯ sered, meaning yellowish-red.[5]",
