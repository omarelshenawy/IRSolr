				"previous": "Boletus luridus was described by German botanist Jacob Christian SchÃ¤ffer in 1774, in his series on fungi of Bavaria and the Palatinate, Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones.[3] The specific epithet is the Latin adjective luridus, 'sallow'.[4] French botanist Pierre Bulliard's 1791 Boletus rubeolarius[5] is a heterotypic synonym (based on a different type).[1] The following year, Johann Friedrich Gmelin called it Boletus subvescus,[6] from the Latin words sub \"nearly\" or \"under\",[7] and vescus \"edible\".[8] However, this is a nomen nudum.[9] Several taxonomical synonyms arose when the species was transferred to different genera within the family Boletaceae by different authorities, including Leccinum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821,[10] Tubiporus by Petter Karsten in 1881,[11] Dictyopus by Lucien QuÃ©let in 1888,[12] and Suillellus by William Murrill in 1909.[1][13]",
				"after": "The variety Boletus luridus var. erythropus, published as \"beta\" by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum,[14] is synonymous with Boletus erythropus.[15] Boletus luridus var. rubriceps was originally described from Spain (as a species of Tubiporus) by RenÃ© Maire in 1937,[16] and later formally transferred to Boletus by Aurel Dermek in 1987.[17] Other varieties of B.Â luridus include Roman Schulz's var. obscurus and var. rubromaculatus published in 1924;[18] Josef VelenovskÃ½'s 1939 var. tenuipes, found in the Czech Republic;[19] and Jean Blum's 1969 var. lupiniformis and var. queletiformis, originally described from France and Spain, respectively.[20] Boletus erythrentheron, originally described as a distinct species by Jan BezdÄk, was later published as the variety B.Â luridus var. erythrentheron by Albert PilÃ¡t and Dermek in 1979,[21] and finally as a subspecies by Jiri HlavÃ¡cek in 1995.[22] Carmine Lavorato and Giampaolo Simonini defined the form primulicolor from Sardinia in 1997.[23] Rolf Singer's 1947 variety caucasicus is currently considered an independent species, Boletus caucasicus Singer ex. Alessio.[24] Similarly, B.Â luridus f. sinensis, found in Hainan Province, China, was later elevated to distinct species status as B.Â sinensis.[25]",
