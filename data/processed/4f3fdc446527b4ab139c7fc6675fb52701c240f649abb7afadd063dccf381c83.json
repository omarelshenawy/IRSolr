				"previous": "Attempts to design or construct a true flying machine began, typically comprising a gondola with a supporting canopy and spring- or man-powered flappers for propulsion. Among the first were Hautsch and Burattini (1648). Others included de Gusmao's \"Passarola\" (1709 on), Swedenborg (1716), Desforges (1772), Bauer (1764), Meerwein (1781), and Blanchard (1781) who would later have more success with balloons. Rotary-winged helicopters likewise appeared, notably from Lomonosov (1754) and Paucton. A few model gliders flew successfully although some claims are contested, but in any event no full-size craft succeeded.[34]",
				"after": "Italian inventor, Tito Livio Burattini, invited by the Polish King WÅadysÅaw IV to his court in Warsaw, built a model aircraft with four fixed glider wings in 1647.[35] Described as \"four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'\", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself.[36] He promised that \"only the most minor injuries\" would result from landing the craft.[37] His \"Dragon Volant\" is considered \"the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century\".[38]",
