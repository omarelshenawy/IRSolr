				"previous": "The Su-27 had the Soviet Union's first operational fly-by-wire control system, based on the Sukhoi OKB's experience with the T-4 bomber project. Combined with relatively low wing loading and powerful basic flight controls, it makes for an exceptionally agile aircraft, controllable even at very low speeds and high angle of attack. In airshows the aircraft has demonstrated its maneuverability with a Cobra (Pugachevâs Cobra) or dynamic decelerationÂ â briefly sustained level flight at a 120Â° angle of attack.",
				"after": "The naval version of the 'Flanker', the Su-27K (or Su-33), incorporates canard (aeronautics) for additional lift (force), reducing takeoff distances. These canards have also been incorporated in some Su-30s, the Su-35, and the Su-37.",
