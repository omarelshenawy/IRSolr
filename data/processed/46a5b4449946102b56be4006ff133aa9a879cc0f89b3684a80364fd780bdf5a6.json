				"previous": "The U.S. Post Office also adopted the DH-4 to carry air mail.[35] In 1919, the DH-4B was standardised by the US Post Office, being modified to be flown from the rear cockpit with a 400Â lb (180Â kg) watertight mail compartment replacing the forward cockpit. The airmail DH-4B were later modified with revised landing gear and an enlarged rudder.[36] DH-4s were used to establish a coast-to-coast, transcontinental airmail service, between San Francisco and New York, a distance of 2,680Â mi (4,310Â km), involving night flight, the first services starting on 21 August 1924.[35] The DH-4 continued in Post Office service until 1927, when the last airmail routes were passed to private contractors.",
