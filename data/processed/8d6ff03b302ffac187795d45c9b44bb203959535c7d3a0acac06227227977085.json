				"after": "Warwick castle is situated in the town of Warwick, on a sandstone bluff at a bend of the River Avon. The river, which runs below the castle on the east side, has eroded the rock the castle stands on, forming a cliff. The river and cliff form natural defences. When construction began in 1068, four houses belonging to the Abbot of Coventry were demolished to provide room. The castle's position made it strategically important in safeguarding the Midlands against rebellion.[1] During the 12th century, King Henry I was suspicious of Roger de Beaumont, 2ndÂ Earl of Warwick. To counter the earl's influence, Henry bestowed Geoffrey de Clinton with a position of power rivalling that of the earl.[2] The lands he was given included KenilworthÂ â a castle of comparable size, cost, and importance,[3] founded by Clinton[4]Â â which is about 8 kilometres (5Â mi) to the north. Warwick Castle is about 1.6 kilometres (1Â mi) from Warwick railway station and less than 3.2 kilometres (2.0Â mi) from junction 15 of the M40 motorway; it is also close to Birmingham International Airport.[5]",
