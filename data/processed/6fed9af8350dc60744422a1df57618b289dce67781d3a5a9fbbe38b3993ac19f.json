				"after": "Because of its concerns about having its name attached to a popular sex toy, Hitachi decided to cease production of the Magic Wand in 2013.[11] Vibratex director of operations Eddie Romero told Engadget that Hitachi is an extremely staid company and was uncomfortable being associated with the best-selling masturbation aid.[11] Vibratex persuaded Hitachi to continue manufacturing the device, to rename it the \"Original Magic Wand\", to use lighter, more durable materials, and to omit any reference to Hitachi.[11] The newly named device returned to the market in 25 June 2013, with improved engineering and modified graphic design on its accompanying box.[19][72] It was sold as the \"Original Magic Wand Vibrator\" by Good Vibrations.[72]",
