				"previous": "After Islam arrived in the 7th century, Egypt emerged as a center of politics and culture in the Muslim world. Under Anwar Sadat, Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law.[197] It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders,[198][199][200] with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order.[199] There is also a minority of Shi'a. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs estimates the Shia population at 1 to 2.2 million[201] and could measure as much as 3 million.[202] The Ahmadiyya population is estimated at less than 50 thousand,[203] whereas the Salafi (ultra-conservative) population is estimated at five to six million.[204] Cairo is famous for its numerous mosque minarets and has been dubbed \"The City of 1,000 Minarets\".[205]",
				"after": "Of the Christian minority in Egypt over 90% belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church.[206] Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church, the Evangelical Church of Egypt and various other Protestant denominations. Non-native Christian communities are largely found in the urban regions of Cairo and Alexandria, such as the Syro-Lebanese, who belong to Greek Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Maronite Catholic denominations.[207] Ethnic Greeks also made up a large Greek Orthodox population in the past. Likewise, Armenians made up the then larger Armenian Orthodox and Catholic communities. Egypt also used to have a large Roman Catholic community, largely made up of Italians and Maltese. These non-native communities were much larger in Egypt before the Nasser regime and the nationalization that took place.",
