				"after": "A refinement now popular is the replacement of the analog dial with an electronic digital display on which the reading is displayed as a single value. Rather than a rack and pinion, they have a linear encoder. Some digital calipers can be switched between centimeters or millimeters, and inches. All provide for zeroing the display at any point along the slide, allowing the same sort of differential measurements as with the dial caliper. Digital calipers may contain some sort of \"reading hold\" feature, allowing the reading of dimensions even in awkward locations where the display cannot be seen. Ordinary 6-in/150-mm digital calipers are made of stainless steel, have a rated accuracy of 0.001Â in (0.02mm) and resolution of 0.0005Â in (0.01Â mm). [9] The same technology is used to make longer 8-in and 12-in calipers; the accuracy for bigger measurements declines to 0.001Â in (0.03Â mm) for 100â200Â mm and 0.0015Â in (0.04Â mm) for 200â300Â mm.
