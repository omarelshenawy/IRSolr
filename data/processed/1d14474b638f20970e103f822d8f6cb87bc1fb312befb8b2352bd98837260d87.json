				"previous": "In March 2014, the OECD halted membership talks with Russia in response to its role in the 2014 Crimean crisis.[27][28]",
				"after": "The OECD defines itself as a forum of countries committed to democracy and the market economy, providing a setting to compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practices, and co-ordinate domestic and international policies.[29] Its mandate covers economic, environmental, and social issues. It acts by peer pressure to improve policy and implement \"soft law\"ânon-binding instruments that can occasionally lead to binding treaties. In this work, the OECD cooperates with businesses, with trade unions and with other representatives of civil society. Collaboration at the OECD regarding taxation, for example, has fostered the growth of a global web of bilateral tax treaties.",
