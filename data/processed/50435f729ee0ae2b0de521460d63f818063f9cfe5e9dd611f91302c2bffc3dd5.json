About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over a total of five years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BC.[82] Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various deities and the spirits of the emperor's ancestors.[83] Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation.[84] Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and Zhengguo Canal, built by the previous State of Qin and Qin dynasty (221â206 BC), respectively.[84]",
