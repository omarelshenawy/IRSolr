				"after": "The Bridgewater is often considered to be the first true canal in Britain, as it relied upon existing watercourses as sources of water rather than as navigable routes.[112][113] It now terminates in Runcorn basin, just before the disused flight of 10 locks[114] which (before the approach road to the Silver Jubilee Bridge was built) used to lower the canal to the Runcorn Docks on the River Mersey and later, to the Manchester Ship Canal. The old line of locks in Runcorn fell into disuse in the late 1930s, and they were closed under the Ship Canal Act of 1949 and filled in. The Ship Canal Act of 1966 allowed the closure and filling in of the newer line of locks.[115] The gates from this flight of locks were removed and installed at Devizes on the Kennet and Avon Canal.[citation needed] The Duke's warehouse in Manchester was demolished in 1960.[1]",
