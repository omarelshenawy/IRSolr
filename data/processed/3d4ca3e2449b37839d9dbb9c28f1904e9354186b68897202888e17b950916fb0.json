				"after": "The WaldenâWallkill Rail Trail is a 3.22-mile (5.18Â km) rail trail in the United States between the village of Walden in the town of Montgomery and the hamlet of Wallkill in the town of Shawangunk. Montgomery is in Orange County and Shawangunk is in Ulster County in upstate New York. The trail, like the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail to the north, is part of the former Wallkill Valley Railroad's rail corridor. The land was purchased by the towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk in 1985 and converted to a public trail. The portion in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former town supervisor Jesse McHugh. Plans to pave the trail between Walden and Wallkill had been discussed since 2001 until it was finally paved in 2008 and 2009. The trail includes an unofficial, unimproved section to the north of Wallkill, and is bounded by the routes NY 52 and NY 208. (FullÂ article...)",
