				"after": "The character who is implied to be the nerd says that editing Wikipedia is one of his nerdy activities.[9] In the video, Al is shown editing the article Atlantic Records by typing in large letters \"YOU SUCK!\". Thus Al takes revenge on the record company for refusing to let him include \"You're Pitiful,\" a parody of James Blunt's song \"You're Beautiful\", on his new album. This has prompted copycat vandalism of the Atlantic Records page, which resulted in the page's being semi-protected. Yankovic has said \"I don't officially approve of [the vandalism], but on a certain level it does amuse me.\"[10]",
