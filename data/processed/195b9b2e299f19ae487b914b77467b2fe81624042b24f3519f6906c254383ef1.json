				"after": "Mark Alan Webber (born August 27, 1976 in Queanbeyan, New South Wales) is an Australian Formula One driver. After some racing success in Australia, Webber moved to the UK in 1995 to further his motorsports career. He began a partnership with fellow Australian Paul Stoddart, at that time owner of the European Racing Formula 3000 team, which eventually took them both into Formula One when Stoddart bought the Minardi team. Webber made his debut in Formula One in 2002, scoring Minardi's first points in three years at his and Stoddart's home race. After an impressive first season, Jaguar Racing took him on as lead driver. During two years with the generally uncompetitive team Webber several times qualified on the front two rows of the grid and outperformed his team mates. He joined the former championship winning Williams team in 2005, for whom he achieved his best finish in Formula One to that point; a third place at the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix. In the 2009 season he won two races, in Germany and Brazil. He added ten more podiums in 2010, including victories in Spain, Monaco, Britain and Hungary. Webber finished the 2010 season in third place having led for a long period, losing out to teammate Sebastian Vettel.",
