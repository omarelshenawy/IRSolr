				"previous": "Barnum's partner Hutchinson did not want to buy Jumbo. \"What difference does it make if an elephant is seven feet high or eleven or twelve feet high? An elephant is an elephant!\" he growled. But Barnum wanted Jumbo more than he wanted any other elephant in the world because Jumbo was the biggest elephant in the world.[30] Bartlett and the London Zoological Society took only two days to decide that Jumbo would be sold to Barnum.[31]",
				"after": "When the British learned that Jumbo was going to be sold, they were outraged. Bartlett received many angry letters. Children begged Bartlett to keep Jumbo in London. Art critic John Ruskin wrote that the English were not \"in the habit of selling their pets.\" An effort was made to stop the sale by going to court, but Barnum won. The British courts ruled that he was the legal owner of Jumbo.[31]",
