				"after": "During the Late Preclassic (300Â BCÂ â ADÂ 200) various sites in the Pacific coastal region developed into true cities; Takalik Abaj was one of these, with an area greater than 4 square kilometres (1.5Â sqÂ mi).[40] The cessation of Olmec influence upon the Pacific coastal zone occurred at the beginning of the Late Preclassic.[21] At this time Takalik Abaj emerged as an important centre with an apparently local style of art and architecture;[41] the inhabitants began to make boulder sculptures and to erect stelae and associated altars.[42] At this time, between 200 BC and 150 AD, Structure 7 reached its maximum dimensions.[37] Monuments were erected with both political and religious significance, some of which bore Maya-style dates and depictions of rulers.[43] These early Maya monuments are carved with what may be among the earliest Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions and use of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.[44] The early dates on Stelae 2 and 5 allow this style of sculpture to be more securely fixed in time within the late 1st century to the early 2nd century AD.[37] The so-called potbelly style of sculpture also appeared at this time.[44] The appearance of Maya sculpture and the cessation of Olmec-style sculpture may represent a Maya intrusion into the area previously occupied by MixeâZoquean inhabitants.[15][44] One possibility holds that Maya elites entered the area in order to take control of the cacao trade.[44] However, given the evident continuity in local ceramic styles from the Middle to Late Preclassic, the change in attributes from Olmec to Maya may have been more an ideological than a physical transition.[44] If they had arrived from elsewhere, the finds of Maya stelae and a Maya royal tomb suggest that the Maya were in a dominant position, whether they arrived as traders or conquerors.[45]",
