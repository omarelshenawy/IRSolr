Its first eighteen-hole course, completed in 1898 on land procured by Boston soda fountain magnate James Walker Tufts, featured square-shaped putting greens composed of oiled sand (pictured) and was home for a time to the North and South Open, during the former half of the twentieth century CE one of the most prestigious golf tournaments in the United States, and to the United North and South Amateur Championship, organized by the United States Golf Association, which was won in 1904 (pictured) by American Walter Travis, who became the first The Amateur Championship winner to capture the North and South title.",
