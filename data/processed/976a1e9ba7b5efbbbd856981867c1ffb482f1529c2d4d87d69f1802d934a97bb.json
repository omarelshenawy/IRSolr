				"previous": "In 1732, John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins. It now forms one of the buildings making up Redland High School for Girls.[41] In 1760, the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth.[42] That led to the demolition of St Nicholas's Gate, along with the original St Nicholas church, part of the Old Shambles, and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge.[25] The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure, lined with houses on both sides.[8] A 17th-century illustration shows that these were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street.[43] At the time of the Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths, who may have been attracted by the unusually secure premises.[43] The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762â9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt.[44]",
				"after": "The 1766 Theatre Royal, which claims to be the oldest continually-operating theatre in England, joined with the Coopers' Hall, from 1744 and designed by architect William Halfpenny, to form the Bristol Old Vic.[45][46][47]",
