				"after": "There has been extensive research into metallopharmaceuticals,[53][54] including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine.[18] A substantial body of research has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium[55] and iron[56] as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes in place of the fluorophenyl group in haloperidol,[19] which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenylâhaloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)âC(=O)â(CH2)3âN(CH2CH2)2C(OH)âC6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenylâhaloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats.[19] Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenylâhaloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodoceniumâhaloperidol species.[19] The separation of the ruthenocenylâhaloperidol and the rhodoceniumâhaloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied.[20] 103mRh has a half-life of 56Â min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8Â keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.[18]",
