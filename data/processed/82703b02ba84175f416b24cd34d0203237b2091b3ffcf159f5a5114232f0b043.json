Eckfeldt and William DuBois.[49][50] The first private collector to obtain an example was Matthew A. Stickney, who acquired the coin from the Mint on May 9, 1843, by trading certain rare coins from his collection, including a unique early United States Immune Columbia coin struck in gold.[51] Interest in coin collecting and the 1804 dollars began increasing, and by 1860, the dollars saw extensive coverage by numismatists.[52] In 1885, auctioneer W.E. Woodward described the 1804 dollar as \"the king of coins,\" a moniker which it maintains today.[53] Numismatic historian Q. David Bowers asserts that the 1804 dollar has attracted more attention than any other coin.[54] All fifteen extant specimens are acknowledged and studied by numismatists. They are identified by nicknames based on prominent owners, or the first individuals known to have possessed the coins.[55]",
