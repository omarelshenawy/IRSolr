				"previous": "In early 2015 it was announced that the airline would lease 24 Airbus A320neo aircraft from AerCap for delivery between 2016 and 2019.[36]",
			"after": [
				"China Southern is headquartered in Baiyun District, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.[37][38][39]",
				"China Southern plans to open a new headquarters facility on a 988-acre (400Â ha) site on the outskirts of Guangzhou, about 4 miles (6.4Â km) from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Woods Bagot won a competition for the architect firm which would design the facility. The proposed site consists of two parcels of land on opposite sides of a highway leading to Baiyun Airport; both sites are shaped like wings. The site will have a bridge and light rail system that operates above the highway to connect the two parcels, which will each have distinct functions. For instance, the east parcel will house internal functions such as the data center facilities, staff dormitories, and the training center. The airline wants it to be aesthetically pleasing from the air since it sits below a runway approach. The site will have a lot of outdoor space, which Woods Bagot designed along with Hargreaves Associates and Sherwood Design Engineers. Jean Weng, a Woods Bagot Beijing-based principal, said \"Most Chinese cities are very dense and very urban, but China Southern wants to create a human-scale campus, thatâs close to nature.\"[40]"
