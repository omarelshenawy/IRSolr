				"previous": "After the start of the war with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for internment of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700Â of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.[56]",
				"after": "In 1942, Kaiser Shipbuilding Company began making ships for the war at three huge installations near the lower slough, one in St. Johns, one on Swan Island in Portland's Overlook neighborhood, and one in Vancouver, Washington.[57] St. Johns and Vancouver made Liberty ships, while Swan Island made tankers.[57] The St. Johns shipyard became the nation's leading producer of Liberty ships.[57] To house shipyard workers and their families, Henry J. Kaiser bought 650 acres (260Â ha) of former marsh, pasture, and farmland in the lower slough watershed surrounded on all sides by dikes between 15 and 25 feet (5 and 8Â m) high.[55] Here he built a new city, at first called Kaiserville and later Vanport. By 1943, Vanport's population of 39,000 made it the second largest city in Oregon and the largest wartime housing project in the U.S.[55] After the war, the population fell to about 18,500.[55] This was roughly the number of people living there on May 30, 1948, when a flood broke through Vanport's western levee.[55] The break occurred during the afternoon of a day with mild weather.[58] The first rush of water soon became a \"creeping inundation\",[58] slowed in its advance for 35 to 40Â minutes by water-absorbing sloughs.[58] The water's gradual rise within the city allowed most of the residents to escape drowning. The county coroner's official list of bodies recovered was set at fifteen, and seven people on a list of missing people were never found.[59] The flood destroyed the city, which was never rebuilt.[55]",
