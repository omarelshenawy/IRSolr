				"after": "The Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan, is a medieval church in Anglesey, Wales. The first church on the site was established in the 7th century by St Nidan, the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, Anglesey; the oldest parts of the present structure date from the 14th century. In about 1500 a second nave was added, and an arcade (pictured) was built between the two naves. Between 1839 and 1843 a new church was built nearby, partly due to the cost of repairing St Nidan's. A sandstone chest containing bone fragments (which local tradition holds to be those of St Nidan) and a 13th-century font were relocated to the new church. Much of the old church was demolished, leaving part of the western end and the central arcade. It has been restored and is occasionally open to the public. The remaining parts of the church are a Grade II* listed building. In the 12th century, Gerald of Wales said that the church possessed a curious stone shaped like a thigh that would always return by the next day no matter how far away it was taken. A Norman earl, he said, had chained it to a large rock and thrown it into the sea, only for the stone to return to the church by the following morning. (FullÂ article...)",
