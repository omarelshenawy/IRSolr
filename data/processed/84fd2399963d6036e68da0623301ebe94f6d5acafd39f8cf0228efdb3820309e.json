				"after": "Extensive timber cutting in the Sandy River basin began in the mid-19thÂ century in response to a demand for wood from the Portland metropolitan area. Logging intensified in the lower basin through the 20thÂ century as sawmills became established in Sandy, Boring, Brightwood and other settlements in the region, and railroad spurs extended into the forests.[39] In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Bull Run Trespass Act to forbid activities such as camping and livestock grazing in the Bull Run Reserve.[40] Except for activity related to the waterworks, the protected area changed little until the 1950s, when the United States Forest Service began to advocate logging in the Reserve.[41] After the U.S. Congress passed the Multiple Use â Sustained Yield Act of 1960 stressing timber production in the national forests,[42] the Forest Service in the 1960s and 1970s built about 170 miles (270Â km) of forest roads in the watershed.[39] Before the road-building and heavy logging, \"The watershed [had] remained almost inviolable for nearly 60Â years, its runoff protected by a largely unbroken expanse of centuries-old trees,\" according to a member of the Bull Run Advisory Committee, a scientific panel commissioned by the City of Portland in 1977 to review issues related to Bull Run.[41]",
