				"previous": "In mathematics, an eigenvector of a transformation is a vector, different from the zero vector, which that transformation simply multiplies by a constant factor, called the eigenvalue of that vector. Often, a transformation is completely described by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenspace for a factor is the set of eigenvectors with that factor as eigenvalue, together with the zero vector.",
				"after": "The scalar multiple is denoted by the Greek letter Î» and is called an eigenvalue of the matrix A, while x is called the eigenvector of A corresponding to Î». These concepts play a major role in several branches of both pure and applied mathematics â appearing prominently in linear algebra, functional analysis, and to a lesser extent in nonlinear situations.",
