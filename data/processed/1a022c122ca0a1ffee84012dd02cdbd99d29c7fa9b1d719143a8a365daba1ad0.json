				"previous": "Trappers and explorers arrived in southern Idaho in the early 19thÂ century.[16]:I-16 They established immigrant trails in the region by 1849, including the Oregon and California trails.[100][101] The forest was used by early settlers primarily for extractive industries.[10] Fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin in the northern part of the forest in the 1820s, but mostly avoided it due to the scarcity of beaver.[102]:188â189 For early settlers, the welfare of their community was dependent upon timber supply, regulation of stream flow for irrigation, and use of the land for cattle range.[3] Mining began in the 1860s, peaked in the 1880s, and fluctuated over the following century with the extraction of gold, silver, lead, and zinc.[103][104] The Black Pine Division of the forest was explored in the late 1800s, and the Tallman Mine began producing gold in the 1920s with production peaking from 1949 to 1954.[105][106][107] The Black Pine Mine again produced gold from 1992 through November 1997, when the mine's parent company, Pegasus Gold, declared bankruptcy. The location of the mine has since been reclaimed.[107]",
				"after": "Towns around the forest, including Stanley, Ketchum, and Sawtooth City, were founded as mining towns in the latter part of the 19thÂ century by prospectors and trappers, including Civil War veteran Captain John Stanley, after whom the town of Stanley is named. Ketchum is named after the trapper and guide David Ketchum, while the Sublett Mountains are named after trapper William Sublette, who lived in the area in the 1830s.[108][109] Most of the logging in the region was for firewood and timber for miners and homesteaders. For much of the 20thÂ century, sheep and cattle grazing were the primary large-scale land uses of the forest.[2] Sheep drives were common in the Wood River Valley after the mining boom and shepherds from southern Idaho drove their flocks north to graze the upper elevation areas in Sawtooth National Forest.[102]:348â349 The original sheepherders were Basque Americans, while today many of the sheepherders are Peruvians contracted through the Department of Labor.[110][111][112]",
