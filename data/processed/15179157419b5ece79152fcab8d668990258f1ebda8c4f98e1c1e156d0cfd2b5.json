				"previous": "Ringsend in the south of the city records the least amount of rainfall in Ireland, with an average annual precipitation of 683Â mm (27Â in),[33] with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being 714Â mm (28Â in). The main precipitation in winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location it is least affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the city colder and more prone to snow showers.",
