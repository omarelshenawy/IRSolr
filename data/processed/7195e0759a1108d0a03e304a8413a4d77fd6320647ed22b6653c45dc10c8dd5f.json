				"previous": "In 1877, Marsh received a letter from Arthur Lakes, a schoolteacher in Golden, Colorado. Lakes reported that he had been hiking in the mountains near the town of Morrison when he and his friend, H. C. Beckwith, discovered massive bones embedded in the rock. Lakes further advised that the bones were \"apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some gigantic saurian.\"[29] While awaiting Marsh's reply, Lakes dug up more \"colossal\" bones and sent them to New Haven. As Marsh was slow to respond, Lakes also sent a shipment of bones to Cope.",
				"after": "When Marsh responded to Lakes, he paid the prospector $100, urging him to keep the finds a secret. Learning that Lakes had corresponded with Cope, Marsh sent his field collector Benjamin Mudge to Morrison to secure Lakes' services. Marsh published a description of Lakes' discoveries in the American Journal of Science on July 1, and before Cope could publish his own interpretation of the finds, Lakes wrote to him that the bones should be shipped to Marsh, a severe insult to Cope.[30]",
