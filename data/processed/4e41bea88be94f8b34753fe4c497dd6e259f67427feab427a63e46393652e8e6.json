				"Eglin is also one of the few military air bases in the U.S. to have scheduled passenger airline service as the Northwest Florida Regional Airport (VPS) is co-located on the base property.",
				"The residential portion of the base is a census-designated place; its population was 8,082 at the 2000 census. Eglin Air Force Base has 2,359 military family housing units. Unmarried junior enlisted members generally live in one of Eglinâs seven dormitories located near the dining hall, chapel, base gym, Enlisted Club and bus lines on base. Each individual unit generally handles dormitory assignments. Bachelor Officer Quarters are not available. Several units and one dormitory are currently being renovated in 2011. The base covers 463,128 acres (1,874.2Â kmÂ² / 723.6 sqm).[3]"
