				"previous": "Miller's statistics are an inexact measure of his worth to the side. Many of the Australia teams he played in featured very strong batting line-ups, restricting his opportunities as a middle-order player.[574] His verve and enthusiasm were also important contributors to Australian success, as was his ability to produce the unexpected (particularly with the ball) and help break partnerships.[144] It is for this reason that he is remembered for his personality and his one-off feats, more than statistical accomplishment; in Ian Chappell's words \"People who saw it still talk of Keith Miller's monster shot that hit the Members Stand clock at the SCG in the 1950s\".[575]",
