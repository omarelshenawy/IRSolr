				"previous": "The moor contains about 500 holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies.[5] Most of the moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Bodmin Moor, North,[6] and has been officially designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as part of Cornwall AONB.[7] Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The moor has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports about 260 breeding pairs of European stonechats as well as a wintering population of 10,000 Eurasian golden plovers.[8] The moor has also been recognized as a separate natural region and designated as national character area 153 by Natural England.[9]",
				"after": "Bodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south.",
