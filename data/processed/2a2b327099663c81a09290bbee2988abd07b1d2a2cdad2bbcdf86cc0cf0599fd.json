				"previous": "The 737-700 was the first of Next Generation series when launch customer Southwest Airlines ordered the variant in November 1993. The variant was based on the 737-300 and entered service in 1998.[122] It replaced the 737-300 in Boeing's lineup, and its direct competitor is the A319. It seats 126 passengers in a typical two-class layout or up to 149 in all economy configuration.[123] Boeing launched the 737-700ER on January 30, 2006.[124] All Nippon Airways was the launch customer, with the first one delivered on February 16, 2007. The 737-700ER is a mainline passenger version of the BBJ1 and 737-700IGW. It combines the 737-700 fuselage with the wings and landing gear of a 737-800. It offers a range of 5,510 nautical miles (10,205 kilometers), with seating for 126 passengers in a traditional 2-class configuration.[125] A competitor to this model would be the A319LR. The 700ER has the longest range for a 737.",
				"after": "The 737-700C is a convertible version in which the seats can be removed from the aircraft to carry cargo. There is a large door on the left side of the aircraft. The US Navy was the launch customer for the 737-700C, designated C-40A Clipper by the U.S. military.[126] The C-40B and C-40C are used by the US Air Force for transport of Generals and other senior leaders. The Boeing 737 AEW&C is a 737-700IGW roughly similar to the 737-700ER. This is an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) version of the 737NG. Australia is the first customer (as Project Wedgetail), followed by Turkey and South Korea.",
