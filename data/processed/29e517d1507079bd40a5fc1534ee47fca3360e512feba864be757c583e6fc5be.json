				"previous": "McCay left Hearst upon the expiration of his contract in May 1924, bitter over not having received a promised $5,000 bonus.[99] He returned to the Herald Tribune, and brought back Little Nemo beginning that August.[100] The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid. Nemo took a more passive role in the stories,[97] and there was no continuity.[101] The strip came to an end in December 1926,[100] as it was not popular with readers. Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the American, and succeeded in 1927. While McCay was gone, his place had been filled by Mel Cummin, who was let go after McCay's return.[101] Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo's success, the Herald Tribune signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.[102]",
				"after": "In 1927, McCay attended a dinner in his honor in New York. After a considerable amount of drinking, McCay was introduced by animator Max Fleischer. McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated his audience, saying, \"Animation is an art. That is how I conceived it. But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. Not an art, but a trade. Bad Luck!\"[103] That September he appeared on the radio at WNAC, and on November 2 he was interviewed by Frank Craven for The Evening Journalââ'âs Woman's Hour. During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation.[104]",
