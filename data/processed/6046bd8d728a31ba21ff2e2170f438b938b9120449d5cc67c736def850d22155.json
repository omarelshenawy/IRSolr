				"after": "Initially, international relations as a distinct field of study was almost entirely British-centered. IR only emerged as a formal academic \"discipline\" in 1919 with the founding of the first \"chair\" (professorship) in IRÂ â the Woodrow Wilson Chair at Aberystwyth, University of Wales (now Aberystwyth University),[7] from an endowment given by David Davies, became the first academic position dedicated to IR. This was rapidly followed by establishment of IR at U.S. universities and Geneva, Switzerland. In the early 1920s, the London School of Economics' department of international relations was founded at the behest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Philip Noel-Baker, and was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. Furthermore, the International History department at LSE, developed as primarily focused on the history of IR in the early modern, colonial and Cold War periods.[8]",
