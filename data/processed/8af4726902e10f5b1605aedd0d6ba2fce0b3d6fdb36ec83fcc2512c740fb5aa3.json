He has been head coach at Michigan and Seton Hall. He played point guard and was an assistant coach for Duke under Mike Krzyzewski. An All-American player, Amaker earned the first NABC Defensive Player of the Year award. Amaker was a Duke assistant for nine seasons (including the 1990â91 and 1991â92 National Champion teams). Amaker coached Seton Hall to postseason tournaments in each of his four seasons. He overcame the Michigan basketball scandal and won the 2004 National Invitation Tournament with the 2003â04 Michigan Wolverines. As Harvard men's basketball coach, Amaker was the first coach to lead the Crimson to victory over a ranked opponent. The 2010â11 team became the first Harvard team to earn a share of the Ivy League championship. The 2011â12 team became the first Harvard team to appear in the Associated Press and Coaches Polls. Amaker's 2011â12, 2012â13, 2013â14 and 2014â15 teams repeated as Ivy League champions. The 2012â13 team gave Harvard its first NCAA tournament victory. The 2013â14 team posted a record 27 wins. (FullÂ article...)",
