				"previous": "Darjeeling has seen a significant growth in its population, its decadal growth rate being 47% between 1991 and 2001.[39] The colonial town had been designed for a population of only 10,000, and subsequent growth has created extensive infrastructural and environmental problems. The district's forests and other natural wealth have been adversely affected by an ever-growing population. Environmental degradation, including denudation of the surrounding hills has adversely affected Darjeeling's appeal as a tourist destination.[30]",
