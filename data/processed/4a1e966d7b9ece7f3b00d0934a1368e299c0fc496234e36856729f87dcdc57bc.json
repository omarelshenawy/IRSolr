				"after": "During Omar Torrijos's control, the military regime transformed the political and economic structure of the country by initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education. The constitution was changed in 1972. For the reform to the constitution, the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (\"Power of the People\"), was composed of 505 members selected by the military without the participation of political parties, which had been eliminated by the military. The new constitution proclaimed Omar Torrijos the \"Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution\", and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a faÃ§ade of constitutionality, Demetrio B. Lakas was appointed president for the same period (Pizzurno GelÃ³s and AraÃºz, Estudios sobre el PanamÃ¡ republicano 541).[17]",
