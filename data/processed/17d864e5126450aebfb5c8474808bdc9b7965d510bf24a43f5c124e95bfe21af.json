				"previous": "This clickable imagemap, using the article \"Atom\" as an example, demonstrates the typical profile for an article's development through the levels. Hold the mouse over a number to see key events, and click on a number to see that version of the article. Please note that until 2008, a C-class rating did not exist on the project, and as such this grading is retroactive. Also, in 2006 references were much less used, and inline references were quite rare; a barely-B-Class article today would typically have many more references than this article did in late 2006.",
				"after": "However, not all articles do end up always at Featured Article. The Isaac Newton article (as of October 2nd 2014) is an example. On July 2014, the article was at B-class, but because of better development, this article reached Good-article-class.",
