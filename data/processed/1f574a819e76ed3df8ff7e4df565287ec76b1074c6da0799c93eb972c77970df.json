				"previous": "As news of the siege spread throughout Texas, potential reinforcements gathered in Gonzales. They hoped to rendezvous with Colonel James Fannin, who was expected to arrive from Goliad with his garrison.[73] On February 26, after days of indecision, Fannin ordered 320Â men, fourÂ cannons, and several supply wagons to march towards the Alamo, 90 miles (140Â km) away. This group traveled less than 1.0 mile (1.6Â km) before turning back.[74][75] Fannin blamed the retreat on his officers; the officers and enlisted men accused Fannin of aborting the mission.[76]",
				"after": "Texians gathered in Gonzales were unaware of Fannin's return to Goliad, and most continued to wait. Impatient with the delay, on February 27 Travis ordered Samuel G. Bastian to go to Gonzales \"to hurry up reinforcements\".[77] According to historian Thomas Ricks Lindley, Bastian encountered the Gonzales Ranging Company led by Lieutenant George C. Kimble and Travis' courier to Gonzales, Albert Martin, who had tired of waiting for Fannin. A Mexican patrol attacked, driving off four of the men, including Bastian.[Note 10][78] In the darkness, the Texians fired on the remaining 32Â men, whom they assumed were Mexican soldiers. One man was wounded, and his English curses convinced the defenders to open the gates.[Note 11][79]",
