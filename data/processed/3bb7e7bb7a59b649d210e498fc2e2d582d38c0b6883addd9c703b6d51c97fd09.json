				"previous": "Due to the rapid rise in popularity of passenger flight, many early terminals were built in the 1930sâ1940s and reflected the popular art deco style architecture of the time. One such surviving example from 1940 is the Houston Municipal Airport Terminal. Early airport terminals opened directly onto the tarmac: passengers would walk or take a bus to their aircraft. This design is still common among smaller airports, and even many larger airports have \"bus gates\" to accommodate aircraft beyond the main terminal.",
