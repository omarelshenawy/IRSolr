				"after": "A classic no-frills zapiekanka is made from one half of a baguette or any other long roll of white bread, as for a submarine sandwich, cut lengthwise. It may be up to 50 centimetres (20Â in) long.[3] The bread is topped with sliced, sautÃ©ed white mushrooms and yellow cheese, typically of the Dutch type, such as Gouda, to form an open-face sandwich, which is then toasted until the bread becomes crisp and the cheese melts. A zapiekanka is best served hot. The typical garnish is tomato ketchup, usually splattered on the cheese in a generous amount.",
