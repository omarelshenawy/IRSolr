				"previous": "On April 23, 2010, Boeing delivered the newest 787, ZA003, to the McKinley Climatic Laboratory hangar at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, for extreme weather testing in temperatures ranging from 115 to â45Â Â°F (46 to â43Â Â°C), and prepare it for takeoff at both temperature extremes.[112] ZA005, the fifth 787 and the first with GEnx engines, began ground engine tests in May 2010,[113] and made its first flight on June 16, 2010.[114] In June 2010, gaps were discovered in the horizontal stabilizers of test aircraft, due to improperly installed shims; all aircraft produced were inspected and repaired.[115] That same month, a 787 experienced its first in-flight lightning strike; inspections found no damage to the aircraft.[116] As composites can have as little as 1/1,000th the electrical conductivity of aluminum, conductive material is added to ameliorate potential risks and to meet FAA requirements.[78][117][118] FAA management also planned to adjust requirements to help the 787 show compliance.[119]",
				"after": "The 787 made its first appearance at an international air show at the Farnborough Airshow, United Kingdom, on July 18, 2010.[120]",
