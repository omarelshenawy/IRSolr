				"after": "Aristotle however suggested that swallows and other birds hibernated. This belief persisted as late as 1878, when Elliott Coues listed the titles of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. Even the \"highly observant\"[2] Gilbert White, in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne, quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse \"while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone\", though the man denied being an eyewitness.[3] However, he also writes that \"as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to\",[3] and that if early swallows \"happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a timeâa circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration\", since he doubts they would \"return for a week or two to warmer latitudes\".[4]",
