				"after": "Dreadnought mounted the 45-calibre BL 12-inch Mark X gun in five twin gun turrets. Three turrets were located conventionally along the centreline of the ship, with the forward turret ('A') and two aft turrets ('X' and 'Y'), the latter pair separated by the torpedo control tower located on a short tripod mast. Two wing turrets ('P' and 'Q') were located port and starboard of the forward superstructure respectively. Dreadnought could deliver a broadside of eight guns between 60Â° before the beam and 50Â° abaft the beam. Beyond these limits she could fire six guns aft, and four forward. On bearings 1Â° ahead or astern she could fire six guns, although she would have inflicted blast damage on the superstructure.[20]",
