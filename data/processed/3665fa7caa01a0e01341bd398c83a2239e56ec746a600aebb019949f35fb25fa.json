Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, although he remained convinced that he had reached the Orient. The colonisation of the Americas started, with conquistadores like HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s and Francisco Pizarro. Miscegenation was the rule between the native and the European cultures and people.",
