				"previous": "Cameroon has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the Ntem, Nyong, Sanaga, and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward directly into the Gulf of Guinea. The Dja and KadÃ©Ã¯ drain southeastward into the Congo River. In northern Cameroon, the BÃ©nouÃ© River runs north and west and empties into the Niger. The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.[80]",
