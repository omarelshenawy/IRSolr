				"after": "In 2010 Airbus announced a new A380 build standard, incorporating a strengthened air frame structure and a 1.5Â° increase in wing twist. Airbus will also offer, as an option, an improved maximum take-off weight, thus providing a better payload/range performance. Maximum take-off weight is increased by 4Â t (8,800Â lb), to 573Â t (1,263,000Â lb) and the range is extended by 100 nautical miles (190Â km); this is achieved by reducing flight loads, partly from optimising the fly-by-wire control laws.[229] British Airways and Emirates are the first two customers to have received this new option in 2013.[230] Emirates has asked for an update with new engines for the A380 to be competitive with the 777X around 2020, and Airbus is studying 11-abreast seating.[118]",
