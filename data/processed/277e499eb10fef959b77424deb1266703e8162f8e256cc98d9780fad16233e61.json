				"previous": "During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became symbols of the slightly risquÃ© glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.",
