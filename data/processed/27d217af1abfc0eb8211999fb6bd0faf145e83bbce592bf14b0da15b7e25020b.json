				"after": "The historian George Bott regards John Dalton (1709â63) and John Brown (1715â66) as the pioneers of tourism in the Lake District. Both wrote works praising the majesty of the scenery, and their enthusiasm prompted others to visit the area. The poet Thomas Gray published an account of a five-day stay in Keswick in 1769, in which he described the view of the town as \"the vale of Elysium in all its verdure\", and was lyrical about the beauties of the fells and the lake.[28] His journal was widely read, and was, in Bott's phrase, \"an effective public relations job for Keswick.\"[29] Painters such as Thomas Smith of Derby and William Bellers also contributed to the influx of visitors; engravings of their paintings of Cumberland scenery sold in large numbers, further enhancing the fame of the area.[29] In 1800 the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, \"It is no small advantage that for two thirds of the year we are in complete retirement â the other third is alive & swarms with Tourists of all shapes & sizes.\"[30] Coleridge had moved to Keswick in that year, and together with his fellow Lake Poets (see below) was possibly the strongest influence on the public esteem of Keswick and the Lake District.[31]",
