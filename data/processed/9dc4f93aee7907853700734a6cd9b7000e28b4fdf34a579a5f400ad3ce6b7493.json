There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing up in front of the sea, according to his last wishes.[128] Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste LÃ©opold Protet,[129] the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.[130]",
