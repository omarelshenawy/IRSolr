				"after": "While the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three opponent processes, or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a redâgreen channel, a blueâyellow channel, and a blackâwhite \"luminance\" channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why we cannot perceive a \"reddish green\" or \"yellowish blue\", and it predicts the color wheel: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.",
