He pioneered satyagrahaâresistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience, a philosophy firmly founded upon ahimsa or total nonviolenceâwhich helped India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi is commonly known around the world as Mahatma Gandhi ([mÉÉ¦aËtÌªmaË]; Sanskrit: à¤®à¤¹à¤¾à¤¤à¥à¤®à¤¾ mahÄtmÄ or \"Great Soul\", an honorific first applied to him by Rabindranath Tagore), and in India also as Bapu (Gujarati: àª¬àª¾àªªà«, bÄpu or \"Father\"). He is officially honoured in India as the Father of the Nation; his birthday, 2 October, is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Non-Violence.",
