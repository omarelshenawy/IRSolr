				"previous": "In 2007, the carcass of a female calf nicknamed \"Lyuba\" was discovered near the Yuribey River, where it had been buried for 41,800 years.[54][114] By cutting a section through a molar and analysing its growth lines, they found that the animal had died at the age of one month.[61] The mummified calf weighed 50Â kg (110Â lb), was 85Â cm (33Â in) high and 130Â cm (51Â in) in length.[115][116] At the time of discovery, its eyes and trunk were intact and some fur remained on its body. Its organs and skin are very well preserved.[117] \"Lyuba\" is believed to have been suffocated by mud in a river that its herd was crossing.[54][118] After death, its body may have been colonised by bacteria that produce lactic acid, which \"pickled\" it, preserving the mammoth in a nearly pristine state.[54]",
				"after": "In 2012, a juvenile was found in Siberia, which had man-made cut marks. Scientists estimated its age at death to be 2.5 years, and nicknamed it \"Yuka\". Its skull and pelvis had been removed prior to discovery, but were found nearby.[79][119] After being discovered, the skin of \"Yuka\" was prepared to produce a taxidermy mount.[34] Another mammoth discovery was reported in October 2012, when it was excavated on the Taymyr Peninsula. It was dated to 30,000 years old. It was named \"Zhenya\" after the boy who found it.[120]",
