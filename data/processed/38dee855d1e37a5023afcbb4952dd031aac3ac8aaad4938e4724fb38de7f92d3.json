				"after": "Specimens of B.Â sessilis were first collected by Scottish surgeon Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791. No firm location or collection date can be ascribed to Menzies' specimens, as their labels simply read \"New Holland, King Georges Sound, Mr. Arch. Menzies\",[4] and Menzies' journal indicates that he collected over a wide area, visiting a different location every day from 29 September to 8 October.[5] In addition to B.Â sessilis, Menzies collected plant material of B.Â pellaeifolia, and seeds of at least four more Banksia species.[6] This was therefore an important early collection for the genus, only seven species of which had previously been collected.[7][8]",
