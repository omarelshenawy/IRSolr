Weapons development was conducted at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and a China Lake F8U-1 set a U.S. National speed record in August 1956. Commander \"Duke\" Windsor set, broke, and set a new Level Flight Speed Record of 1,015.428Â mph (1,634.173Â km/h) on 21 August 1956 beating the previous record of 822Â mph (1,323Â km/h) set by a USAF F-100, however, the world speed record of 1,132Â mph (1,822Â km/h), set by the British Fairey Delta 2, on 10 March 1956, was not broken.[5]",
