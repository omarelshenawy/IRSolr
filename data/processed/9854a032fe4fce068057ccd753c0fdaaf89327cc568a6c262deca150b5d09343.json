				"previous": "The Wright brothers' flights in 1903 are recognized by the FÃ©dÃ©ration AÃ©ronautique Internationale (FAI), the standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics, as \"the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight\".[15] By 1905, the Wright Flyer III was capable of fully controllable, stable flight for substantial periods.",
				"after": "In 1906, Brazilian inventor Alberto Santos Dumont designed, built and piloted an aircraft that set the first world record recognized by the AÃ©ro-Club de France by flying the 14 bis 220 metres (720Â ft) in less than 22 seconds.[16] The flight was certified by the FAI.[17] This was the first controlled flight, to be officially recognised, by a plane able to take off under its own power alone without any auxiliary machine such as a catapult.",
