				"previous": "Joseph Hoare (principal from 1768 to 1802) gave Â£200[n 7] in total in 1791 and 1792 for repairs in the first quadrangle, part of a general pattern of expenditure upon repair of the older college buildings in the 18th century. In 1815, the original gables in the first quadrangle were removed and replaced with a third storey and battlements, matching the lodgings where battlements had been erected between 1733 and 1740.[1][41] The height of the chapel wall was increased, and many of the windows were altered. The college received advice from the architect John Nash about this work; he requested that, instead of paying him, the college should commission a portrait of him from Sir Thomas Lawrence to hang in the hall.[37] Lawrence depicted Nash in his house in Regent Street, London; the portrait has been described by Lawrence's biographer, the art historian Sir Michael Levey, as \"pungently vivid\".[42]",
				"after": "In 1853, under the direction of John Chessell Buckler (architect to the college from 1852 to 1882), the south front of the buildings was restored; the exterior of the buildings on Turl Street was re-faced in Bath stone in 1856, with the tower over the gateway being built at the same time.[10][41][43] The total cost of this work was Â£3,349.[n 8] Pardo's changes from the 18th century were removed.[38] The Gentleman's Magazine in 1856 complimented Buckler on \"resisting the stream\" and following the style of the 15th century.[45] Peter Howell, a writer on Victorian architecture, referred to Buckler's work as \"[providing] Jesus with an attractive new front which represents the beau idÃ©al of an Oxford college\".[39] The poet John Betjeman said that the front of the college opposite Exeter College was \"a good specimen\" of Gothic Revival work.[46] In contrast, the architectural historian Geoffrey Tyack noted that the refacing came not long after the two other colleges in Turl Street (Exeter and Lincoln) had been refaced, and commented that Buckler's work, in \"Collegiate Gothic\" style, \"completed a process whereby the faÃ§ades of the colleges in Turl Street acquired a somewhat lifeless homogeneity which they had never possessed in the past\".[47] W. J. Arkell wrote that \"some of the worst horrors of the Gothic revival\" cluster on either side of Turl Street.[48] When writing a history of the college in 1891, the vice-principal Llewellyn Thomas said that the work was \"admitted to be very well done\", but that there were those who thought that \"the old Jacobean gateway was more in harmony with the domestic architecture of the College, and more suitable to its position in a narrow street\".[49] The stonework on the front of the college was last cleaned in 2000, when the porters' lodge by the Turl Street entrance was also rebuilt, to provide better office accommodation for the porters, individual post boxes for students, and greater security.[50] Four grass plots were added to the centre of the quadrangle in 1896, crossed by Yorkstone paths; before that, it had been gravelled since 1662.[51]",
