				"after": "The Bohemian waxwing is a starling-sized bird 19â23Â cm (7.5â9Â in) in length with a 32â35.5Â cm (12.6â14Â in) wingspan, and an average weight of 55Â g (1.9Â oz).[14] It is short-tailed, mainly brownish-grey, and has a conspicuous crest on its head. The male of the nominate subspecies has a black mask through the eye and a black throat. There is a white streak behind the bill and a white curve below the eye. The lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon-coloured areas around the mask. The rump is grey and the tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it. The wings are very distinctive; the flight feathers are black and the primaries have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white \"fishhooks\" on the closed wing. The adult's secondaries end in long red appendages with the sealing wax appearance that gives the bird its English name. The eyes are dark brown, the bill is mainly black, and the legs are dark grey or black.[14] In flight, the waxwing's large flocks, long wings and short tail give some resemblance to the common starling, and its flight is similarly fast and direct.[2] It clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on the ground.[19]",
