				"previous": "Later, during a Mass, Pope John Paul II criticised the regime for impoverishing the peasants and the unemployed, claiming that the government must give people greater access to the land. Although Stroessner tried to prevent him from doing so, Pope John Paul II met opposition leaders in the one-party state.[145]",
				"after": "John PaulÂ II has been credited with being instrumental in bringing down Communism in Central and Eastern Europe,[65][73][78][94][95][146] by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for \"a peaceful revolution\" in Poland. Lech WaÅÄsa, the founder of 'Solidarity', credited John PaulÂ II with giving Poles the courage to demand change.[65] According to WaÅÄsa, \"Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs. Nobody knew how to get rid of Communism. In Warsaw, in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land ... this land'.\"[146] It has also been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank covertly funded Solidarity.[147][148]",
