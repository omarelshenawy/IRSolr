Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery is best known for its works by the Pre-Raphaelites, a collection \"of outstanding importance\".[188] It also holds a significant selection of old masters â including major works by Bellini, Rubens, Canaletto and Claude â and particularly strong collections of 17th-century Italian Baroque painting and English watercolours.[188] Its design holdings include Europe's pre-eminent collections of ceramics and fine metalwork.[188] The Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Edgbaston is one of the finest small art galleries in the world,[189] with a collection of exceptional quality representing Western art from the 13th century to the present day.[190]",
