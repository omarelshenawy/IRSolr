				"previous": "Ganoga Lake is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675Â they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).[10]",
				"after": "On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ganoga Lake.[11] After the American Revolutionary War (1775â1783), Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.[12] The lake was originally in Northumberland County, then became part of Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795.[13] Sullivan County was formed from Lycoming County in 1847, and two years later Colley Township was formed from Cherry Township.[14] The lake drains into Kitchen Creek, where a Native American pot, decorated in the style of \"the peoples of the Susquehanna region\", was found under a rock ledge around 1890.[15]",
