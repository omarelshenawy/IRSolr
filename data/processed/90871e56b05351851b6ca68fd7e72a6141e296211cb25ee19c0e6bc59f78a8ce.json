				"previous": "The most crucial moment of truth for the ARVN came with General VÃµ NguyÃªn GiÃ¡p's 1972 Easter Offensive, the first all-out invasion of South Vietnam by the communists. It was code-named Nguyá»n Huá» after the Vietnamese emperor who defeated the Chinese in 1789. The assault combined infantry wave assaults, artillery and the first massive use of tanks by the North Vietnamese. ARVN took heavy losses, but to the surprise of many, managed to hold their ground.",
				"after": "U.S. President Nixon dispatched more bombers to provide air support for ARVN when it seemed that South Vietnam was about to be overrun. In desperation, President Nguyá»n VÄn Thiá»u fired the incompetent General HoÃ ng XuÃ¢n LÃ£m and replaced him with ARVN's best commander, General NgÃ´ Quang TrÆ°á»ng. He gave the order that all deserters would be executed and pulled enough forces together so that the North Vietnamese army failed to take Huáº¿. Finally, largely as a result of U.S. air and naval support, as well as determination by ARVN soldiers, the Easter Offensive was halted.",
