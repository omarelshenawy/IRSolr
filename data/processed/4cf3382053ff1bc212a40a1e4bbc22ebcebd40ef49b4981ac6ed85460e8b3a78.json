The continent is delimited on the southeast by most geographers at the DariÃ©n watershed along the Colombia-Panama border, placing all of Panama within North America.[47][48][49] Alternatively, some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, with Central America extending southeastward to South America from this point.[50] The Caribbean islands, or West Indies, are considered part of North America.[1] The continental coastline is long and irregular. The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by the Hudson Bay. Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California.",
