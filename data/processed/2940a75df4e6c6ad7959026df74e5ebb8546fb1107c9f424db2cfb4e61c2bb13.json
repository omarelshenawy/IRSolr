				"A delivery or ball in cricket is a single action of bowling a cricket ball towards the batsman.",
				"During play of the game, a member of the fielding team is designated as the bowler, and bowls deliveries towards the batsman. Six balls in a row constitutes an over, after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over. The bowler delivers the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards the batsman standing at the opposite wicket at the other end of the pitch. Bowlers can be either left handed or right handed. This approach to their delivery, in addition to their decision of bowling around the wicket (from the sides of the wicket on the bowlerâs end) or over the wicket is knowledge of which the umpire and the batsman are to be made aware."
