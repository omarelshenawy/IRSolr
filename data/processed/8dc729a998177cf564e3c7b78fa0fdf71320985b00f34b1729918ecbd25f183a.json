				"previous": "EasyJet's acquisition of BA franchise carrier GB Airways in March 2008 increased its share of airport slots to 24Â percent (from 17Â percent in late 2007); the airline became the largest short-haul operator at the airport, accounting for 29Â percent of short-haul passengers.[50] By 2009, BA's share of Gatwick slots had fallen to 20Â percent from its peak of 40Â percent in 2001.[51] By 2010, this had declined to 16Â percent.[52][53] By mid-2012, EasyJet had 45 percent of Gatwick's early-morning peak time slots (6 am to 8:55Â am).[nb 5][54]",
				"after": "By 2008, Flybe was Gatwick's third-largest airline (accounting for nineÂ percent of its slots) and its fastest-growing airline.[51][55] It became the airport's largest domestic operator, carrying 1.2Â million passengers in its 2011â12 financial year on eight routes to destinations in the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.[nb 3][56] In March 2013, the airline announced that it would end operations at Gatwick, citing unsustainably high airport charges and increases in UK Air Passenger Duty. Flybe sold its 25 pairs of daily slots[nb 6] at the airport to EasyJet for Â£20Â million.[57][58] The latter's share of Gatwick slots increased to 44Â percent in summer 2014; second-placed BA has held about 16Â percent of the airport's slots since 2010.[52][53][59] Following the sale of its Gatwick slots to EasyJet, Flybe continues to provide the scheduled service between Gatwick and Newquay, as a result of being awarded the contract to fly this route under a four-year Public Service Obligation (PSO).[60]",
