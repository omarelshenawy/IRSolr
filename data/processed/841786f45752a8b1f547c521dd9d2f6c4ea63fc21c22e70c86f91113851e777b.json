				"previous": "Because of this, two vectors satisfying are called orthogonal. An important variant of the standard dot product is used in Minkowski space: R4 endowed with the Lorentz product",
				"after": "Convergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces V carrying a compatible topology, a structure that allows one to talk about elements being close to each other.[49][50] Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be continuous maps. Roughly, if x and y in V, and a in F vary by a bounded amount, then so do x + y and ax.[nb 8] To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field F also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice are the reals or the complex numbers.",
