				"previous": "Archaea usually have a single circular chromosome,[114] the size of which may be as great as 5,751,492Â base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans,[115] the largest known archaeal genome. One-tenth of this size is the tiny 490,885Â base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans, the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes.[116] Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.[117][118]",
				"after": "Archaea can be infected by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated to any other form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops.[120] These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales.[121] Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 (\"Pleolipoviridae\") infecting halophilic archaea[122] and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus (\"Spiraviridae\") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90â95Â Â°C) host.[123] Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.[124][125]",
