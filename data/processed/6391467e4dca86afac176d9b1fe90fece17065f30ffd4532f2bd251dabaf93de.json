This increased demand for officers led Congress to increase the size of the Corps of Cadets to 481Â cadets in 1900.[42] The period between 1900 and 1915 saw a construction boom as much of West Point's old infrastructure was rebuilt.[42] Many of the academy's most famous graduates graduated during the 15-year period between 1900 and 1915: Douglas MacArthur (1903), Joseph Stilwell (1904), Henry \"Hap\" Arnold (1907), George S. Patton (1909), Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Omar Bradley (both 1915). The class of 1915 is known as \"the class the stars fell on\" for the exceptionally high percentage of general officers that rose from that class (59 of 164).[43][44]",
