				"after": "Donald Douglas proposed to build and test the DC-8 at Santa Monica Airport, which had been the birthplace of the DC-3 and the site of a Douglas plant that employed 44,000 workers during World War II. In order to accommodate the new jet, however, Douglas asked the city of Santa Monica, California to lengthen the airport's 5,000-foot runway. Bowing to the complaints of residents living near the airport, the city refused, so Douglas moved the company's airliner production line to Long Beach Airport.[2] The first DC-8 N8008D was rolled out of the new factory at Long Beach on 9 April 1958 and flew for the first time, in Series 10 form, on 30 May for two hours seven minutes with the crew being led by A.G.Heimerdinger.[3] Later that year an enlarged version of the Comet finally returned to service, but too late to take a substantial portion of the market: de Havilland had just 25 orders. In August Boeing had begun delivering 707s to Pan Am. Douglas made a massive effort to close the gap with Boeing, using no less than ten aircraft for flight testing to achieve FAA certification for the first of the many DC-8 variants in August 1959. Much was needed to be done: the original air brakes on the lower rear fuselage were found ineffective and were deleted as engine thrust reversers had become available; unique leading-edge slots were added to improve low-speed lift; the prototype was 25Â kn (46Â km/h) short of its promised cruising speed and a new, slightly larger wingtip had to be developed to reduce drag. In addition, a recontoured wing leading edge was later developed that extended the chord 4% and reduced drag at high Mach numbers.[4]",
