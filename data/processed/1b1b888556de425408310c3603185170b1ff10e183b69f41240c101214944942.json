				"after": "In the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, pure quantum states correspond to vectors in a Hilbert space, while each observable quantity (such as the energy or momentum of a particle) is associated with a mathematical operator. The operator serves as a linear function which acts on the states of the system. The eigenvalues of the operator correspond to the possible values of the observable, i.e. it is possible to observe a particle with a momentum of 1Â kgâm/s if and only if one of the eigenvalues of the momentum operator is 1Â kgâm/s. The corresponding eigenvector (which physicists call an \"eigenstate\") with eigenvalue 1Â kgâm/s would be a quantum state with a definite, well-defined value of momentum of 1Â kgâm/s, with no quantum uncertainty. If its momentum were measured, the result is guaranteed to be 1Â kgâm/s.",
