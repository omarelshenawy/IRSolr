Their base components, i.e. the Linux kernel (more precisely its System Call Interface (SCI)), the GNU C Library or the uClibc, the GNU Core Utilities and a couple of more packages, make many Linux operating systems behave \"unix-like\" though none of the Linux distributions has bothered so far to actually become UNIXÂ®-certified, mostly because of financial reasons.",
