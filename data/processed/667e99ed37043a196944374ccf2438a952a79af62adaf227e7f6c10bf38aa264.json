				"previous": "The monument was restored twice during the Soviet era (1962 and 1980â1981). In keeping with tradition the restorations and maintenance after the renewal of Latvia's independence are financed partly by private donations. The monument underwent major restoration in 1998â2001.[1] During this restoration the statue of Liberty and its stars were cleaned, restored and gilded anew.[13] The monument was formally re-opened on July 24, 2001.[14] The staircase, column, base and inside of the monument were restored, and the stone materials were cleaned and re-sealed. The supports of the monument were fixed to prevent subsidence. Although the restorers said at the time that the monument would withstand a hundred years without another major restoration, it was discovered a few years later that the gilding of the stars was damaged, due to the restoration technique used. The stars were restored again during maintenance and restoration in 2006; however, this restoration was rushed and there is no warranty of its quality.[15]",
				"after": "The guard of honor was present from the unveiling of the monument until 1940, when it was removed shortly after the occupation of Latvia.[1] It was renewed on November 11, 1992.[1] The guards are soldiers of The Company of Guard of Honor of the Headquarters Battalion of the National Armed Forces (Latvian: NacionÄlo BruÅoto spÄku Å tÄba bataljona Goda sardzes rota).[16] The guard is not required to be on duty in bad weather conditions and if the temperatures are below â10Â Â°C (14Â Â°F) or above 25Â Â°C (77Â Â°F).[17][18] The guards work in two weekly shifts, with three or four pairs of guards taking over from each other hourly in a ceremony commanded by the chief of the guard.[17][18] Besides them there also are two watchmen in each shift, who look out for the safety of the guards of honor.[18]",
