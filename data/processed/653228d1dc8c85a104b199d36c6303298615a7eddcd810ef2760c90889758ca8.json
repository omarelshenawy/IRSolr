				"after": "Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmosphere of some planets, including Earth.[1] The main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause. The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape; jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets, at around 7â12Â km (23,000â39,000Â ft) above sea level, and the higher and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at around 10â16Â km (33,000â52,000Â ft). The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.",
