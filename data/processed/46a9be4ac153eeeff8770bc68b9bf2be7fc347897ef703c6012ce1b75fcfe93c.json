				"after": "The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, set strict regulations on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons due to their ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant that they were not decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules.[273] Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery.[274][275] With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements,[276] and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030â2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP.[277] In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries;[278] the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003.[277] Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000.[279] An outlier is HFO-1234yf which has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.[193]",
