				"after": "Procellariids have been a seasonally abundant source of food for people wherever people have been able to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with albatrosses and cormorants) come from the remains of hunter-gatherer middens in southern Chile, where sooty shearwaters were taken 5000 years ago.[41] More recently procellariids have been hunted for food by Europeans, particularly the northern fulmar in Europe, and various species by Inuit,[11] and sailors around the world. The hunting pressure on the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, was so intense that the species nearly went extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island, where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers;[42] within ten years the providence petrel was extinct on Norfolk.[43] Several species of procellariid have gone extinct in the Pacific since the arrival of man, and their remains have been found in middens dated to that time. More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in Tasmania and New Zealand, where the practice of harvesting what are known as muttonbirds continues today.",
