				"previous": "Brand launched his YouTube series The Trews: True News with Russell Brand on 27 February 2014, in which he \"analyses the news, truthfully, spontaneously and with great risk to his personal freedom.\" In addition to news analysis, he regularly has guests on the show, including economists, journalists and activists. By the end of the year, more than 200 episodes had been released on the channel.[103]",
				"after": "In June 2014, he took part in the People's Assembly Against Austerity, that attracted an estimated 50,000 people marching from the BBC office to Westminster. Brand addressed the crowd, saying, \"The people of this building [the House of Commons] generally speaking do not represent us, they represent their friends in big business. It's time for us to take back our power. Power isn't there, it is here, within us. The revolution that's required isn't a revolution of radical ideas, but the implementation of ideas we already have.\"[104]",
