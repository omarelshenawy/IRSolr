				"previous": "The major parties SPÃ and ÃVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military non-alignment: While the SPÃ in public supports a neutral role, the ÃVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÃVP politicians (ex. Dr Werner Fasslabend (OVP) in 1997 ). In reality, Austria is taking part in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, participates in peacekeeping and peace creating tasks, and has become a member of NATO's \"Partnership for Peace\"; the constitution has been amended accordingly. Since Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area in 2011, none of Austria's neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore.",
				"after": "The Parliament of Austria is located in Vienna, the country's largest city and capital. Austria became a federal, parliamentary, democratic republic through the Federal Constitution of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its nine states is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.[65]",
