Other terms with equivalent meaning are \"minor hub\", \"mini-hub\", \"hublet\", \"key city\", or \"base\". The term \"focus city\" was originally used by various US airlines as a marketing term to promote operations at secondary destinations in the 1990s; however, widespread usage has greatly expanded the definition.[citation needed]",
