				"previous": "The Antonov An-225 was designed to airlift the Energia rocket's boosters and the Buran space shuttle for the Soviet space program. It was developed as a replacement for the Myasishchev VM-T. The An-225's original mission and objectives are almost identical to that of the United States' Shuttle Carrier Aircraft.[7][8]",
				"after": "The An-225 first flew on 21 December 1988 with a 74-minute flight from Kiev. The aircraft was on static display at the Paris Air Show in 1989 and it flew during the public days at the Farnborough air show in 1990. Two aircraft were ordered, but only one An-225 (registration CCCP-82060 later UR-82060[9]) was finished. It can carry ultra-heavy and oversize freight, up to 250,000Â kg (550,000Â lb) internally,[7] or 200,000Â kg (440,000Â lb) on the upper fuselage. Cargo on the upper fuselage can be 70 metres (230Â ft) long.[10]",
