				"previous": "Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write his songs on paper. Instead he would dictate into a sound recorder, and when recording he would sing the lyrics from memory.[353] In most of his songs, such as \"Billie Jean\", \"Who Is It\", and \"Tabloid Junkie\", he would beatbox and imitate the instruments using his voice instead of playing the actual instruments, along with other sounds. Jackson noted that it is easier to sing a drum line, or sing a bass, instead of playing a drum line or a bass with an instrument. Several critics have said that Jackson's distinct voice was able to replace any instrument convincingly. Steve Huey of Allmusic said that, throughout his solo career, Jackson's versatility allowed him to experiment with various themes and genres.[3] As a musician, he ranged from Motown's dance fare and ballads to techno and house-edged new jack swing to work that incorporates both funk rhythms and hard rock guitar.[133][354][355]",
				"after": "According to Huey, Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful.[3] Notable tracks included the ballads \"The Lady in My Life\", \"Human Nature\" and \"The Girl Is Mine\"; the funk pieces \"Billie Jean\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\"; and the post-disco set \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\".[3][354][355][356][357] With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.[357] Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this is evident on the songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\".[355] In \"Billie Jean\", Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers.[3] In \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" he argues against gossip and the media.[357] \"Beat It\" decried gang violence in an homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.[3][133] He also observed that the title track \"Thriller\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.[3] In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \"We Are the World\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.[3]",
