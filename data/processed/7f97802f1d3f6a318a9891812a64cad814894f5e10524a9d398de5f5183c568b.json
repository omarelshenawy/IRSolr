Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5â5.0Â micrometres in length. However, a few speciesÂ â for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis and Epulopiscium fishelsoniÂ â are up to half a millimetre long and are visible to the unaided eye;[27] E. fishelsoni reaches 0.7Â mm.[28] Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3Â micrometres, as small as the largest viruses.[29] Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.[30]",
