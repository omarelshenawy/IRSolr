				"after": "India is the world's most populous democracy.[143] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[144] it has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.[145] The Congress is considered centre-left or \"liberal\" in Indian political culture, and the BJP centre-right or \"conservative\". For most of the period between 1950âwhen India first became a republicâand the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[146] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.[147]",
