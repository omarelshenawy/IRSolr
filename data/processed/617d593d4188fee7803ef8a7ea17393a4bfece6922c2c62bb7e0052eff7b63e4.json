				"previous": "Of the recognized 110 mangrove species, only about 54 species in 20 genera from 16 families constitute the \"true mangroves\", species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats.[3] Demonstrating convergent evolution, many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity, tidal range (inundation), anaerobic soils and intense sunlight. Plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangal.[5] The greatest biodiversity occurs in the mangal of New Guinea, Indonesia and Malaysia.[17]",
				"after": "Red mangroves, which can survive in the most inundated areas, prop themselves above the water level with stilt roots and can then absorb air through pores in their bark (lenticels). Black mangroves live on higher ground and make many pneumatophores (specialised root-like structures which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing) which are also covered in lenticels.",
