				"after": "Delichon martins are 13â15Â cm (5â6Â in) long, blackish blue above with a contrasting white rump, and with white or grey underparts. They are chunky, bull-headed and short-tailed birds, and have feathering on the toes and tarsi.[18] The common house martin is the largest bird of the three, with an average weight of 18.3Â g (0.65Â oz), and has the most deeply forked tail; the Nepalese species is the smallest (15Â g, 0.53Â oz) and has the squarest tail. Distinctive species plumage features are the black chin and black undertail coverts of the Nepal house martin, and the greyish wash to the underparts of the Asian house martin.[10] As with other swallows and martins, the moult is slow and protracted because of the need to maintain efficient flight at all times to enable feeding. Moult normally starts on arrival at the wintering grounds, but overlaps with the breeding season for the non-migratory Nepal house martin.[19]",
