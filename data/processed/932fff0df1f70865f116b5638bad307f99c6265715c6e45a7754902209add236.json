				"previous": "where n is a fixed natural number called modulus. Calculating sums, differences and products is done as usual, but whenever a negative number or a number greater than nÂ âÂ 1 occurs, it gets replaced by the remainder after division by n. For instance, for nÂ =Â 7, the sum 3Â +Â 5 is 1 instead of 8, since 8 divided by 7 has remainderÂ 1. This is referred to by saying \"3Â +Â 5 is congruent toÂ 1 moduloÂ 7\" and is denoted",
				"after": "Similarly, 6Â +Â 1Â â¡Â 0Â (modÂ 7), 2Â âÂ 5Â â¡Â 4Â (modÂ 7), since â3Â +Â 7Â =Â 4, and 3Â Â·Â 4Â â¡Â 5Â (modÂ 7) as 12 has remainder 5. Standard properties of addition and multiplication familiar from the integers remain valid in modular arithmetic. In the parlance of abstract algebra, the above set of integers, which is also denoted Z/nZ, is therefore a commutative ring for any n. Division, however, is not in general possible in this setting. For example, for n = 6, the equation",
