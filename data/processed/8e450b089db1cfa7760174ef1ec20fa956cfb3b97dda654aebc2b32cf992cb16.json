				"after": "The A330-200 is a shortened, longer-range variant, which entered service in 1998. Typical range with 253 passengers in a three-class configuration is 13,400Â km (7,200Â nmi).[100] The A330-200 is ten fuselage frames shorter than the original â300, with a length of 58.82Â m (193Â ft 0Â in).[100][116] To compensate for the smaller moment arm of the shorter fuselage, the vertical stabiliser height of the â200 was increased by 104Â cm (41Â in).[117] The â200's wing was also modified; structural strengthening of the wing allowed the maximum takeoff weight of the â200 to be increased to 229.8 tonnes (507,000Â lb).[117] The â200 is offered with three engine types similar to those found on the â300, namely the General Electric CF6-80E, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 700.[100] Airbus also boosted fuel capacity to 139,100Â L (36,700Â USÂ gal) by adding the centre section fuel tank, standard in the A340.[57]",
