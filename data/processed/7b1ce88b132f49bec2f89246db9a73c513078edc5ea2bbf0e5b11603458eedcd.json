				"previous": "As late as the seventeenth century in Europe the practice was commonly employed by nannies to put their young male charges to sleep.[94] That tolerance was soon to change. The first use of the word \"onanism\" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation appears to be Onania, an anonymous pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716. It drew on familiar themes of sin and vice, this time in particular against the \"heinous sin\" of \"self-pollution\". After dire warnings that those who so indulged would suffer impotence, gonorrhea, epilepsy and a wasting of the faculties (included were letters and testimonials supposedly from young men ill and dying from the effects of compulsive masturbation), the pamphlet then goes on to recommend as an effective remedy a \"Strengthening Tincture\" at 10 shillings a bottle and a \"Prolific Powder\" at 12 shillings a bag, available from a local shop.",
				"after": "One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in Onania was the notable Swiss physician Samuel-Auguste Tissot. In 1760, he published L'Onanisme, his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation. Citing case studies of young male masturbators amongst his patients in Lausanne, Switzerland as basis for his reasoning, Tissot argued that semen was an \"essential oil\" and \"stimulus\" that, when lost from the body in great amounts, would cause \"a perceptible reduction of strength, of memory and even of reason; blurred vision, all the nervous disorders, all types of gout and rheumatism, weakening of the organs of generation, blood in the urine, disturbance of the appetite, headaches and a great number of other disorders.\"",
