				"previous": "BuÃ±uel submitted a cutting copy to the censors and then arranged for his son, Juan-Luis, to smuggle the negatives to Paris for the final editing and mixing,[182] ensuring that the authorities would not have an opportunity to view the finished product before its planned submission as Spain's official entry to the 1961 Cannes Festival.[183] Spain's director general of cinematography JosÃ© Munoz-Fontan presented the film on the last day of the festival and then, on the urging of Portabella and Bardem, appeared in person to accept the top prize, the Palme d'Or, which the film shared with the French entry Une aussi longue absence, directed by Henri Colpi.[184] Within days, l'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official organ, denounced the film as an insult not only to Catholicism but to Christianity in general.[185] Consequences to nearly all concerned were swift: Munoz-Fontan was cashiered from his government post,[184] the film was banned in Spain for the next 17 years, all mention of it in the press was prohibited, and the two Spanish production companies UNINCI and Film 59 were disbanded.[179]",
				"after": "BuÃ±uel went on to make two more films in Mexico with Pinal and Alatriste, El angel exterminador (1962) and SimÃ³n del desierto (1965)â along with Viridiana, they form the so-called \"BuÃ±uelian trilogy\" â and was later to say that Alatriste had been the one producer who gave him the most freedom in creative expression.[187] Pinal was keenly interested in continuing to work with BuÃ±uel, trusting him completely and frequently stating that he brought out the best in her.[188] In 1963, actor Fernando Rey, one of the stars of Viridiana, introduced BuÃ±uel to producer Serge Silberman, a Polish entrepreneur who had fled to Paris when his family died in the Holocaust[189] and had worked with several renowned French directors, including Jean-Pierre Melville, Jacques Becker, Marcel Camus and Christian-Jaque.[190] Silberman proposed that the two make an adaptation of Octave Mirbeau's Journal d'une femme de chambre, which BuÃ±uel had read several times.[191] BuÃ±uel wanted to do the filming in Mexico with Pinal, but Silberman insisted it be done in France.[191]",
