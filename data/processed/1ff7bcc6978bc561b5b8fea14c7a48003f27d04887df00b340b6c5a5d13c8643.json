				"previous": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its terms when the polynomial is expressed in its canonical form consisting of a linear combination of monomials. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of the variables that appear in it. The term order has been used as a synonym of degree but, nowadays, refers to different, but related, concepts.",
				"after": "To determine the degree of a polynomial that is not in standard form (for example ), one has to put it first in standard form by expanding the products (by distributivity) and combining the like terms; for example , and its degree is 1, although each summand has degree 2. However, this is not needed when the polynomial is expressed as a product of polynomials in standard form, because the degree of a product is the sum of the degrees of the factors.",
