				"after": "The last US Navy Spruance-class destroyer in service, USSÂ Cushing, was decommissioned on September 21, 2005. The ZumwaltÂ class is planned to replace them; on November 1, 2001, the US Navy announced the issuance of a revised Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Future Surface Combatant Program. Formerly known as DD 21, the program was renamed DD(X) (and later renamed to DDG-1000) to more accurately reflect the program purpose, which is to produce a family of advanced technology surface combatants, not a single ship class. DD(X), also called Zumwalt class, is much larger than traditional destroyers, nearly three thousand tons heavier than a Ticonderoga-class cruiser (15,610Â long tons,[32] larger than most heavy cruisers from the World War II era). It will potentially employ advanced weaponry and an all-electric Integrated Power System; however, the construction program was subsequently reduced to just two vessels, and there is currently only funding for three in total. With the retirement of the Spruance class, the US Navy began commissioning an advanced variant of the Arleigh Burke-class with expanded ASW capabilities, the Arleigh Burke Flight IIA, beginning with USSÂ Oscar Austin. As of 2012[update], 34 of these vessels are in service, with more under construction.",
