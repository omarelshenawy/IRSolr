				"previous": "Rescue efforts began immediately after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within half an hour of the impact.[63] Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards.[63] The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10Â minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies.[64] It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational.[65] Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived within minutes.[66][67] Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.[68]",
				"after": "As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires, they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse. One firefighter remarked that they \"pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking\".[68] Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation. Minutes later, at 10:10, the upper floors of the damaged area of the Pentagon collapsed.[68] The collapsed area was about 95 feet (29Â m) at its widest point and 50 feet (15Â m) at its deepest.[68] The amount of time between impact and collapse allowed everyone on the fourth and fifth levels to evacuate safely before the structure collapsed.[69] After the collapse, the interior fires intensified, spreading through all five floors.[70] After 11:00, firefighters mounted a two-pronged attack against the fires. Officials estimated temperatures of up to 2,000Â Â°F (1,090Â Â°C).[70] While progress was made against the interior fires by late afternoon, firefighters realized a flammable layer of wood under the Pentagon's slate roof had caught fire and begun to spread.[71] Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it.[71] Firefighters instead made firebreaks in the roof on September 12 to prevent further spreading. At 18:00 on the 12th, Arlington County issued a press release stating the fire was \"controlled\" but not fully \"extinguished\". Firefighters continued to put out smaller fires that ignited in the succeeding days.[71]",
