However, their teeth and jaws are very different from those of other herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians, Stegosaurus (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact[52] and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements.[20] Their teeth were \"not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding\",[53] and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of gastrolithsâthe stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingestedâto aid the grinding process, so how exactly Stegosaurus obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains \"poorly understood\".[53]",
