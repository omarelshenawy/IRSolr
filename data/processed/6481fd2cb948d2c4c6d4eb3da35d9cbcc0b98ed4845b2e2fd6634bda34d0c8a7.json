				"previous": "During the 1950s Douglas Aircraft studied a short- to medium-range airliner to complement their higher capacity, long range DC-8. (DC stands for Douglas Commercial.)[1] A medium-range four-engine Model 2067 was studied but it did not receive enough interest from airlines and it was abandoned. In 1960, Douglas signed a two-year contract with Sud Aviation for technical cooperation. Douglas would market and support the Sud Aviation Caravelle and produce a licensed version if airlines ordered large numbers. None were ordered and Douglas returned to its design studies after the cooperation deal expired.[2]",
				"after": "In 1962, design studies were underway. The first version seated 63 passengers and had a gross weight of 69,000Â lb (31,300Â kg). This design was changed into what would be initial DC-9 variant.[2] Douglas gave approval to produce the DC-9 on April 8, 1963.[2] Unlike the competing but larger Boeing 727 trijet, which used as many 707 components as possible, the DC-9 was an all-new design. The DC-9 has two rear-mounted Pratt & Whitney JT8D turbofan engines, relatively small, efficient wings, and a T-tail.[3] The DC-9's takeoff weight was limited to 80,000Â lb (36,300Â kg) for a two-person flight crew by Federal Aviation Agency regulations at the time.[2] DC-9 aircraft have five seats across for economy seating. The airplane seats 80 to 135 passengers depending on version and seating arrangement.",
