				"previous": "The circulation is the contour integral of the tangential velocity of the air on a closed loop (also called a 'circuit') around the boundary of an airfoil. It can be understood as the total amount of \"spinning\" (or vorticity) of air around the airfoil. The section lift/span can be calculated using the KuttaâJoukowski theorem:[18]",
