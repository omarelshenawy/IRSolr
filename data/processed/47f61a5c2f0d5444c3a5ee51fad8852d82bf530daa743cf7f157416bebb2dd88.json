The path-lines between the airports form an open angle, rather than a closed loop, and the angle resembles an open jawline. This is sometimes called an ARNK (arrival unknown). The traveler will use some other transport to travel between the airports. It is sometimes also called multi-city, but that might also be a ticket with three flight legs forming a closed loop.",
