Based on the successful Combi versions of the Classic 747s, the â400M has a large cargo door fitted to the rear of the fuselage for freight loading to the aft main deck cargo hold. A locked partition separates the cargo area from the forward passenger cabin, and the â400M also features additional fire protection, a strengthened main deck floor, a roller-conveyor system, and passenger-to-cargo conversion equipment.[32] The last 747-400M was delivered to KLM on April 10, 2002.[17]",
