				"previous": "The first authenticated eyewitness report of a volcanic eruption was made in March 1835 by Meredith Gairdner, while working for the Hudson's Bay Company stationed at Fort Vancouver.[46] He sent an account to the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, which published his letter in January 1836. James Dwight Dana of Yale University, while sailing with the United States Exploring Expedition, saw the quiescent peak from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841. Another member of the expedition later described \"cellular basaltic lavas\" at the mountain's base.[47]",
				"after": "In late fall or early winter of 1842, nearby settlers and missionaries witnessed the so-called \"Great Eruption\". This small-volume outburst created large ash clouds, and mild explosions followed for 15 years.[48] The eruptions of this period were likely phreatic (steam explosions). Josiah Parrish in Champoeg, Oregon witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption on November 22, 1842. Ash from this eruption may have reached The Dalles, Oregon, 48 miles (80Â km) southeast of the volcano.[5]",
