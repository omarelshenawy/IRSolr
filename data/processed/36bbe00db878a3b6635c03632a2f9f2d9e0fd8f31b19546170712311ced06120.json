				"previous": "The Catlins may have offered one of the last places where the giant flightless bird, the moa, could be hunted,[26] and the timber of the forest proved ideal for canoe construction (the name of the settlement Owaka means \"Place of the canoe\"). No formal MÄori pa (villages) were located in the Catlins, but there were many hunting camps, notably at Papatowai, near the mouth of the Tahakopa River.[27]",
				"after": "Europeans first sighted the area in 1770 when the crew of James Cook's Endeavour sailed along the coast. Cook named a bay in the Catlins area Molineux's Harbour after his ship's master Robert Molineux. Although this was almost certainly the mouth of the Waikawa River, later visitors applied the name to a bay to the northeast, close to the mouth of the Clutha River, which itself was for many years known as the Molyneux River.[28]",
