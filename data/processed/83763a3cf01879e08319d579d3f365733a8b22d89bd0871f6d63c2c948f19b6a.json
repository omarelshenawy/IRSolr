Public or official artâincluding sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coinsâis often analysed for its historical significance or as an expression of imperial ideology.[407] At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality.[408] In the private sphere, objects made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce can show varying degrees of aesthetic quality and artistic skill.[409] A wealthy person might advertise his appreciation of culture through painting, sculpture, and decorative arts at his homeâthough some efforts strike modern viewers and some ancient connoisseurs as strenuous rather than tasteful.[410] Greek art had a profound influence on the Roman tradition, and some of the most famous examples of Greek statues are known only from Roman Imperial versions and the occasional description in a Greek or Latin literary source.[411]",
