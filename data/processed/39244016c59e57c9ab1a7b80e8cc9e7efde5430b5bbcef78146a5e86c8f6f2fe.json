				"previous": "Russell had Bedford House and garden built on part of the land, with an entrance on the Strand, the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden.[15][16] Apart from this, and allowing several poor-quality tenements to be erected, the Russells did little with the land until the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, an active and ambitious businessman,[17] commissioned Inigo Jones in 1630 to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza.[18] The commission had been prompted by Charles I taking offence at the condition of the road and houses along Long Acre, which were the responsibility of Russell and Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth. Russell and Carey complained that under the 1625 Proclamation concerning Buildings, which restricted building in and around London, they could not build new houses; the King then granted Russell, for a fee of Â£2,000, a licence to build as many new houses on his land as he \"shall thinke fitt and convenient\".[19] The church of St Paul's was the first building, begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637.[20]",
				"after": "The houses initially attracted the wealthy, though when a market developed on the south side of the square around 1654, the aristocracy moved out and coffee houses, taverns, and prostitutes moved in.[5] The Bedford Estate was expanded in 1669 to include Bloomsbury, when Lord Russell married Lady Rachel Vaughan, one of the daughters of the 4th Earl of Southampton.[21]",
