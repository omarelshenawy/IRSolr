Scots may be covered superficially in English lessons, which usually entails reading some Scots literature and observing the local dialect. Much of the material used is often Standard English disguised as Scots, which has upset proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots alike.[52] One example of the educational establishment's approach to Scots is \"Write a poem in Scots. (It is important not to be worried about spelling in this â write as you hear the sounds in your head.)\",[53] whereas guidelines for English require teaching pupils to be \"writing fluently and legibly with accurate spelling and punctuation.\"[54] Scots can also be studied at university level.[where?]",
