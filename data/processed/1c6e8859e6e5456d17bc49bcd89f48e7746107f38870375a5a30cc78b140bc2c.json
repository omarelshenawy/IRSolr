				"Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aerospace vehicle goes from the ground to flying in the air.",
				"For aircraft that take off horizontally, this usually involves starting with a transition from moving along the ground on a runway. For balloons, helicopters and some specialized fixed-wing aircraft (VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier), no runway is needed. Takeoff is the opposite of landing."
