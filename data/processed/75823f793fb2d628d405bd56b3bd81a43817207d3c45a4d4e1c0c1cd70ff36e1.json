				"previous": "The Navy was offered the similar Model 205. It first flew in February 1930. It was ordered by the US Navy, but by the time flight testing was complete in 1932, other aircraft were ordered instead. It was however, the first US designed monoplane to receive a US Navy designation, XF5B-1,[1] following the German designed Wright WP-1 of 1923.",
