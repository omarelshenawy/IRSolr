				"previous": "The eastern terminus of the early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch is in Ashton Moss (grid reference SJ909980); it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9thÂ century. Legend claims it was built in a single night in 869 or 870 as a defence against Viking invaders.[11][12] Further evidence of Dark Age activity in the area comes from the town's name. The \"Ashton\" part probably derives from the Anglo-Saxon meaning \"settlement by ash trees\",[13][14] the origin of the \"under-Lyne\" element is less clear: it could derive from the British lemo meaning elm, or may refer to Ashton being \"under the line\" of the Pennines.[3][4] This means that Ashton probably became a settlement some time after the Romans left Britain in the 5thÂ century.[15] An early form of the town's name, which included a burh element, indicates that in the 11thÂ century Ashton-under-Lyne and Bury were two of the most important towns in Lancashire.[16] The \"under-Lyne\" suffix was not widely used until the mid-19th century when it became useful for distinguishing the town from other places called Ashton.[17]",
				"after": "The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken.[18][19] However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the entry for the ancient parish of Manchester in the Domesday Survey, was in Ashton. The town itself was first mentioned in the 12thÂ century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester.[18] By the late 12thÂ century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Barons of Manchester.[20] Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the Assheton family.[21] With three wings, the hall was \"one of the finest great houses in the North West\" of the 14thÂ century.[21] It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country.[21] The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday,[22][23] making the settlement a market town.[24]",
