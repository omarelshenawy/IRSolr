				"previous": "Aside from the development of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources[58][59] and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,[60] which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.[61][62]",
				"after": "The Great Famine of the 1840s caused the deaths of one million Irish people and over a million more emigrated to escape it.[63] By the end of the decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the Land War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census.[64] The population has never returned to this level since.[65] The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland (County Leitrim) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so.",
