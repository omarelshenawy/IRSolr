The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it does not account for informal sales or consumption by collectors.[50] They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and LeÃ³n in Spain produces 7,700Â tonnes (8,500Â tons) annually.[74] In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80Â dollars per kilogram, although in New York in 1997, the scarcity of fruit bodies elevated the wholesale price to over $200 per kilogram.[50]",
