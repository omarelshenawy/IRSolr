Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or an island in a lake may be called an eyot /ËaÉª.Ét/ (also ait /ËeÉªt/), or holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago. There are two main types of islands: continental islands and oceanic islands. There are also artificial islands.",
