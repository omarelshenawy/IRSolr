Like an iPod, but unlike most other mobile phones at the time of its launch, the battery is not user-replaceable.[116][124] The iPhone can be charged when connected to a computer for syncing across the included USB to dock connector cable, similar to charging an iPod. Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or \"wall charger,\" also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an AC outlet.",
