				"The modern Flag of Galicia was created in the 19th century as a copy of the naval flag of the Galician city of A CoruÃ±a.",
				"During the 19th century many thousands of Galicians were emigrating to the Americas. A CoruÃ±a was the main Galician port where most of them departed from. Tradition has it that the Galician emigrants thought that the A CoruÃ±a naval flag flying on the emigrant ships was actually the flag of Galicia. Therefore, when they arrived to the new world they started flying the A CoruÃ±a naval flag, believing that it was the flag of Galicia. Years later, the flag crossed the Atlantic back to the homeland, where it was officially adopted as the new national flag of Galicia."
