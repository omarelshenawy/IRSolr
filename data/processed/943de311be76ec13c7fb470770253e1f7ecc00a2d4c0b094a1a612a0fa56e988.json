				"after": "After fairly favourable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters,[11] which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era in the summer of 1930.[12] During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest,[13] and the entire region south to West Texas[14] lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941.[15] When severe drought struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices of the time. The drought dried the topsoil and over time it became friable, reduced to a powdery consistency in some places. Without the indigenous grasses in place, the high winds that occur on the plains picked up the topsoil and created the massive dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period.[16] The persistent dry weather caused crops to fail, leaving the plowed fields exposed to wind erosion. The fine soil of the Great Plains was easily eroded and carried east by strong continental winds.",
