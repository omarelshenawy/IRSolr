				"previous": "In early pieces, imitated Mendelssohn (for example in his incidental music for The Tempest), Auber in his Henry VIII music and Gounod in The Light of the World.[182] In his comic operas, Sullivan followed Offenbach's lead in parodying the idioms of French and Italian opera, such as those of Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi.[244] His music also shows the influence of Handel, Schubert and, conspicuously in the fairy music in Iolanthe, Mendelssohn.[245] The then-popular composer Michael Balfe is parodied in The Sorcerer and The Pirates of Penzance, and \"Twenty Love Sick Maidens\" imitates William Vincent Wallace's \"Alas Those Chimes\" from Maritana.[246] The sextet \"A Nice Dilemma\" in Trial by Jury parodies \"D'un pensiero\" in Bellini's La sonnambula.[247]",
				"after": "Other examples of opera parody include Mabel's aria \"Poor Wand'ring One\" in The Pirates of Penzance and the duet \"Who are you, sir?\" from Cox and Box.[248] In H.M.S. Pinafore, the whispered plans for elopement in \"This very night\" parody the conspirators' choruses in Verdi's Il trovatore and Rigoletto,[247] and the octet, \"Farewell, my own,\" evokes the ensemble \"Mag der Himmel euch vergeben\" in Flotow's Martha and such concerted numbers as the sextet in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.[247] The mock-jingoistic \"He is an Englishman\" in H.M.S. Pinafore and choral passages in The Zoo satirise patriotic British tunes such as Arne's \"Rule, Britannia!\".[247] The chorus \"With catlike tread\" from Pirates is an imitation of Verdi's \"Anvil Chorus\" from Il trovatore.[249]",
