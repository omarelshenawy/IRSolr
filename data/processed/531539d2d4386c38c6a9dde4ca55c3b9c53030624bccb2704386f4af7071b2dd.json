The village plan of Hanover was laid out the following year and included as its central feature an open square of 7.5 acres (3Â ha) (three hectares). Even though the land had been cleared, many tree stumps remained until 1831; for a long period, it was a Dartmouth tradition for the graduating class to remove one stump.[2]",
