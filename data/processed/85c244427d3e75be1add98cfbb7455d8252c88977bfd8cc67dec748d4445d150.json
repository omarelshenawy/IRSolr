				"after": "One of the specimens, AMZ 6698, is an adult female that lived in ZÃ¼rich Zoo. It is represented by a virtually complete skeleton, but the skin was not preserved. According to Schwartz, the skeleton shows signs of osteoporosis and periodontitis (common in zoo animals), but not of other pathologies or abnormalities. The right teeth were removed before Schwartz studied the specimen.[4] Schwartz selected this specimen as the holotype.[2] The other specimen, AMZ-AS 1730, is a subadult male collected in the wild, of which only the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), was preserved. The dentition includes both permanent and deciduous teeth.[4] Specimens of Pseudopotto are at least superficially similar to pottos,[17] but according to Schwartz, they differ in a number of traits. Among lorisids, Schwartz saw similarities between the false potto and true pottos as well as angwantibos and slow lorises (Nycticebus).[5] The false potto is comparable in size to the smallest pottos, but falls within their range of metrical variation;[18] small size is also seen in western pottos.[12]",
