				"previous": "The election of Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.[99] Efforts at compromise, including the \"Corwin Amendment\" and the \"Crittenden Compromise\", failed. Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.",
