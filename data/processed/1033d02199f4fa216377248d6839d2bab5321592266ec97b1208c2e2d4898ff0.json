Diophantus's main work, the Arithmetica, was translated into Arabic by Qusta ibn Luqa (820â912). Part of the treatise al-Fakhri (by al-KarajÄ«, 953 â ca. 1029) builds on it to some extent. According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-KarajÄ«'s contemporary Ibn al-Haytham knew[31] what would later be called Wilson's theorem.",
