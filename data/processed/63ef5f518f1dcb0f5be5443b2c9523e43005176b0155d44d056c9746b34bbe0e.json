				"after": "With the establishment of a main rail line (the Southern Pacific) in 1926, the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport by the end of the decade, the city became more easily accessible.[111] The construction of the Westward Ho was part of a concerted effort on the part of both civic and business organizations in the city to develop it as a tourist destination. Phoenix already had two highly rated resorts, the Ingleside Inn and the Jokake Inn, and after the Westward Ho, the Arizona Biltmore, designed by one of Frank Lloyd Wright's students, was constructed in 1929.[112] Other major hotels were built during this era, such as the San Carlos (also in 1928), which led older hotels, like the Hotel Adams, to refurbish themselves in order to remain competitive.[112] By the end of the decade, the tourism industry topped $10 million for the first time in the city's history.[113] Tourism remains one of the top ten economic drivers of the city to this day.[114]",
