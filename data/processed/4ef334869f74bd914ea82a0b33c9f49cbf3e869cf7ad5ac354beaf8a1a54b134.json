				"after": "During his pontificate, Pope John Paul II made trips to 129 countries,[78] travelling more than 1,100,000 kilometres (680,000Â mi) while doing so. He consistently attracted large crowds, some among the largest ever assembled in human history, such as the Manila World Youth Day, which gathered up to four million people, the largest Papal gathering ever, according to the Vatican.[79][80] John Paul II's earliest official visits were to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in January 1979.[81] While some of his trips (such as to the United States and the Holy Land) were to places previously visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the White House in October 1979, where he was greeted warmly by then-President Jimmy Carter. He was the first pope ever to visit several countries in one year, starting in 1979 with Mexico[82] and Ireland.[83] He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen ElizabethÂ II, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in England, he also visited Canterbury Cathedral and knelt in prayer with Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the spot where Thomas Ã  Becket had been killed.[84]",
