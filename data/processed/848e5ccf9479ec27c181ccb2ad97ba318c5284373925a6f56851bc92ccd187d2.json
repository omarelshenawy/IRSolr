				"A jet airliner (or jetliner, or jet) is an airliner that uses jet engine propulsion.",
				"Most airliners today are jet airliners because jet aircraft are capable of efficiently functioning at high altitudes and high speeds. Historically, airliners used the simplest turbojet engine. As time passed, turbofans became the most popular propulsion system due to lower noise and greater fuel efficiency at moderate speeds."
