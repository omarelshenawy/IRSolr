				"previous": "The Mouraria, or Moorish quarter, is one of the most traditional neighborhoods of Lisbon,[40] although most of its old buildings were demolished by the Estado Novo between the 1930s and the 1970s.[41] It takes its name from the fact that after the reconquest of Lisbon, the Muslims who remained were confined to this part of the city.[42] In turn, the Jews were confined to three neighbourhoods called JuderÃ­as\".[43]",
				"after": "Bairro Alto (literally the upper quarter in Portuguese) is an area of central Lisbon that functions as a residential, shopping and entertainment district; it is the centre of the Portuguese capital's nightlife, attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures. Lisbon's Punk, Gay, Metal, Goth, Hip Hop and Reggae scenes all find a home in the Bairro with its many clubs and bars that cater to them. The crowds in the Bairro Alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross-section of modern Portuguese society, many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream, yet Fado, Portugal's national music, still survives in the midst of the new nightlife.",
