				"after": "In January 1996, there was major flooding throughout Pennsylvania. The 1995â1996 early winter was unusually cold, and considerable ice buildup formed in local streams. A major blizzard on January 6â8Â produced up to 40 inches (100Â cm) of snow, which was followed on January 19â21Â by more than 3 inches (76Â mm) of rain with temperatures as high as 62Â Â°F (17Â Â°C) and winds up to 38 miles per hour (61Â km/h). The rain and snowmelt caused flooding throughout Pennsylvania and ice jams made this worse on many streams. Elsewhere in Lycoming County, flooding on Lycoming Creek in and near Williamsport killed six people and caused millions of dollars in damage.[18]",
