				"While most of the obscenity cases in the United States in the past century have revolved around images and films, there have been many cases that dealt with textual works as well.",
				"The classification of \"obscene\" and thus illegal for production and distribution has been judged on printed text-only stories starting with \"Dunlop v. U.S., 165 U.S. 486 (1897)\", which upheld a conviction for mailing and delivery of a newspaper called the 'Chicago Dispatch,' containing \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, and indecent materials\", which was later upheld in several cases. One of these was \"A Book Named John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, \"383 U.S. 413 (1966)\" wherein the book \"Fanny Hill\", written by John Cleland c. 1760, was judged to be obscene in a proceeding that put the book itself on trial rather than its publisher. Another was \"Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115 (1973)\" whereby the court most famously determined that \"Obscene material in book form is not entitled to any First Amendment protection merely because it has no pictorial content.\""
