				"after": "The team behind The Pirate Bay has worked on several websites and software projects of varying degrees of permanence. In 2007, BayImg, an image hosting website similar to TinyPic went online in June.[80][81] Pre-publication images posted to BayImg became part of a legal battle when Conde Nast's network was later allegedly hacked.[82][83] In July, \"within hours after Ingmar Bergman's death\", BergmanBits.com was launched, listing torrents for the director's films,[80][84][85] online until mid-2008.[86] In August, The Pirate Bay relaunched the BitTorrent website Suprnova.org to perform the same functions as The Pirate Bay, with different torrent trackers, but the site languished; the domain was returned to its original owner in August 2010, and it now redirects to Torrentfreak.tv.[87][88] Suprbay.org was introduced in August as the official forum for ThePirateBay.org and the various sites connected to it. Users can request reseeding of torrents, or report malware within torrent files or illegal material on ThePirateBay.org.[89][90] BOiNK was announced in October in response to the raid on Oink's Pink Palace, a music-oriented BitTorrent website.[91] A month later Sunde canceled BOiNK, citing the many new music websites created since the downfall of OiNK.[92] A Mac dashboard widget was released in December, listing \"top 10 stuff currently on TPB, either per category or the full list.\"[93][94] SlopsBox, a disposable e-mail address anti-spam service, also appeared in December,[95][96] and was reviewed in 2009.[97][98]",
