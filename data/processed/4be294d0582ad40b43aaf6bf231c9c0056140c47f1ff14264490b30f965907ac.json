				"previous": "Northwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountain and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000Â m (9,800Â ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364Â m, 17,598Â ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164Â m, 16,942Â ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a Giant Panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountain and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.",
				"after": "Chengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30Â° 05' to 31Â° 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102Â° 54' to 104Â° 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119Â mi) from east to west and 166Â km (103Â mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780Â sqÂ mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500Â m (1,600Â ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Range (é¾æ³å±±è) and the Penzhong Hills (çä¸­ä¸éµ); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364Â m (17,598Â ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378Â m (1,240Â ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.",
