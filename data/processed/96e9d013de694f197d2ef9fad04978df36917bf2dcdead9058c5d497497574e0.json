				"after": "Alfred Oerter, Jr. (September 19, 1936Â â October 1, 2007) was an American athlete, and a four-time Olympic Champion in the discus throw.Oerter was the first track and field athlete to win a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympics. In 2005, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. Born in Astoria, Queens, New York City, Al Oerter grew up in New Hyde Park and attended Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park. He began his career at the age of 15 when a discus landed at his feet and he threw it back past the crowd of throwers. Oerter continued throwing and eventually earned a scholarship to the University of Kansas in 1954 where he became a member of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. A large man at 6'4\" (193Â cm) and 280 pounds (127Â kg), Oerter was a natural thrower. Oerter began his Olympic career at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. He was not considered the favorite but he felt a rush during the competition and he unleashed a throw of 184'11\" (56.36 m) - which, at the time, was a career best. The throw was good enough to win the competition by more than 5'. It appeared Oerter's career would be over at the age of 20, when in 1957, an automobile accident nearly killed him. He did recover in time to compete at the 1960 Summer Olympics at Rome, where Oerter was the slight favorite over teammate and world record holder Rink Babka.",
