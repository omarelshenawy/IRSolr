Spanish explorer Ruy LÃ³pez de Villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then Prince of Asturias. Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other names such as Islas del Poniente (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands San LÃ¡zaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.[19][20][21][22][23]",
