				"after": "Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Radcliffe formed part of the Bury Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security.[1] Radcliffe's first local authority was an early form of local government in England. In July 1866 the Radcliffe Local Board of Health was established.[1] With reference to the Local Government Act 1858, it was a regulatory body consisting of 12Â members,[49] responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. Richard Bealey J.P. was chairman of the local board until April 1876[49] In the same year, the parish was extended to include parts of the former township of Pilkington, formerly in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham.[16]",
