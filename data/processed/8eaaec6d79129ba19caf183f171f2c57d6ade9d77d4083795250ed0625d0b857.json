				"previous": "While speakers without an Anabaptist background in general do not pass the language to their children today, the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites do so in the current generation and there are no signs that this practice will end in the future. Even though Amish and Old Order Mennonites were originally a minority groups within the Pennsylvania German-speaking population, today they form the vast majority. According to sociologist John A. Hostetler, less than 10 percent of the original Pennsylvania German population was Amish or Mennonite.[citation needed]",
				"after": "There have been efforts to advance the use of the language. Kutztown University offers a complete minor program in Pennsylvania German Studies. The program includes two full semesters of the Pennsylvania German language. In the 2007â2008 school year, the classes were being taught by Professor Edward Quinter. In 2008â2009, Professor Robert Lusch served as the instructor.",
