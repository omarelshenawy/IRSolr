				"previous": "The Alexander horned sphere is a well-known pathological embedding of the two-sphere into the three-sphere.",
				"after": "The chosen embedding (if any) of a surface into another space is regarded as extrinsic information; it is not essential to the surface itself. For example, a torus can be embedded into EÂ³ in the \"standard\" manner (which looks like a bagel) or in a knotted manner (see figure). The two embedded tori are homeomorphic, but not isotopic: They are topologically equivalent, but their embeddings are not.",
