				"previous": "Boletus edulis fruit bodies contain about 500Â mg of ergosterol per 100Â g of dried mushroom.[128] Ergosterol is a sterol compound common in fungi. Additionally, the fruit bodies have about 30Â mg of ergosterol peroxide per 100Â g of dried mushroom. Ergosterol peroxide is a steroid derivative with a wide spectrum of biological activity, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, and cytotoxicity to various tumor cell lines grown in laboratory culture.[129]",
				"after": "The mushroom also contains a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenicâthat is, it can stimulate cells to begin the process of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase.[130] Other studies suggest that B.Â edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus[131] and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture.[132] Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.[133]",
