				"previous": "A typical problem for Laplace's equation is to find a solution that satisfies arbitrary values on the boundary of a domain. For example, we may seek a harmonic function that takes on the values u(Î¸) on a circle of radius one. The solution was given by Poisson:",
				"after": "Petrovsky (1967, p.Â 248) shows how this formula can be obtained by summing a Fourier series for Ï. If r < 1, the derivatives of Ï may be computed by differentiating under the integral sign, and one can verify that Ï is analytic, even if u is continuous but not necessarily differentiable. This behavior is typical for solutions of elliptic partial differential equations: the solutions may be much more smooth than the boundary data. This is in contrast to solutions of the wave equation, and more general hyperbolic partial differential equations, which typically have no more derivatives than the data.",
