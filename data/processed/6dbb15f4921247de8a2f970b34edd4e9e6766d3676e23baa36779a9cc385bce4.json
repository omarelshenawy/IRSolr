				"after": "Several remixes of \"Hollywood\", done by DJs such as Jacques Lu Cont, The Micronauts, Paul Oakenfold, Deepsky and Victor Calderone, were included on physical releases of the single around the world.[20] In August 2003, the song was remixed with \"Into the Groove\" and performed with Missy Elliott under the title \"Into the Hollywood Groove\" as part of a promotional campaign for clothing retailer, GAP.[21] Copies of the promotional CD were given to customers and were not available for individual purchase.[22][23] An extended version, \"The Passengerz Mix\", was also included on the remix album Remixed & Revisited (2003).[24] A promotional video for the remix was also shot. Rob Walker of Slate considered the video \"interesting because Madonna has always been praised as much for her ability to market herself as for her actual talent as a singer and performer\". However, he noted that \"[the singer] can't even get an actual commercial right. Maybe Madonna really is over.\"[25] A parody of the commercial which satirized at Madonna's age was featured on the ninth season of MADtv.[26]",
