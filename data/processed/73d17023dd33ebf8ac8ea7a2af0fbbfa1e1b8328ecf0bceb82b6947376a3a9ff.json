				"after": "Charcoal drawings can be found on limestone rock shelters in the centre of the South Island, with over 500 sites[3] stretching from Kaikoura to North Otago. The drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old, and portray animals, people and fantastic creatures, possibly stylised reptiles.[4] Some of the birds pictured are long extinct, including moa and Haast's eagles. They were drawn by early MÄori, but by the time Europeans arrived, local MÄori did not know the origins of the drawings.[5]",
