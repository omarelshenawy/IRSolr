				"after": "Although it is not widely cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum has proven to be by far the most hardy and adaptable (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon,[6] and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria.[4] It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young.[6] Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial.[4] Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used.[18] Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate.[18] Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney.[6] It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.[5]",
