Its length is estimated at 3 to 6Â meters (10 to 20Â ft),[4] and its hip height at more than 1.1Â meters (3.3Â ft).[8] It may have weighed around 210â350Â kilograms (463â772Â lb).[8] In a large specimen, at first thought to belong to a separate genus, Frenguellisaurus, the skull measured 56Â centimeters (1.8Â ft) in length.[8] Smaller specimens had skulls about 30Â centimeters (1Â ft) long.[9]",
