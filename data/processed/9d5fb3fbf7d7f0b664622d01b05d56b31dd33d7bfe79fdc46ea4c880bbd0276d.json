The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-MÄui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by the Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14Â mi) wide at its narrowest point.[132] Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island, the Chatham Islands, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf),[133] d'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds)[134] and Waiheke Island (about 22Â km (14Â mi) from central Auckland).[135] The country's islands lie between latitudes 29Â° and 53Â°S, and longitudes 165Â° and 176Â°E.",
