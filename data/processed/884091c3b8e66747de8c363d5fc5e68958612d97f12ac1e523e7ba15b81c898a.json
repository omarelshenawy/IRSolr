It was increasingly used as a rest house for sick members of the college needing a change of air.[34] In 1649 the college rebuilt the main hospital range north of the chapel, destroyed in the Civil War, as a row of four almshouses, called Bartlemas House.[35] Bartlemas Chapel and two farm cottages are the other extant buildings.",
