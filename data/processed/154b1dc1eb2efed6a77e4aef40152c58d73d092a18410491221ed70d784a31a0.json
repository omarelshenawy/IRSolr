				"after": "Africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, per the Out of Africa Theory with the human species originating from the continent.[14][15] During the middle of the 20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago. Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9â3.0Â million years BC),[16] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3â1.4Â million years BC)[17] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9Â millionâ600,000 years BC) have been discovered.[2]",
