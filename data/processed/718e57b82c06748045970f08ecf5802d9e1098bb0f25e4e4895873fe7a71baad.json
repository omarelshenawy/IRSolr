				"previous": "APUs providing electricity at 400Â Hz are smaller and lighter than their 50/60Â Hz counterparts, but are costlier; the drawback being that such high frequency systems suffer from voltage drops.[1]",
				"after": "During World War I, the British Coastal class blimps, one of several types of airship operated by the Royal Navy, carried a 1.75 horsepower (1.30Â kW) ABC auxiliary engine. These powered a generator for the craft's radio transmitter and, in an emergency, could power an auxiliary air blower.[Note 1][5] One of the first military fixed-wing aircraft to use an APU was the British, World War 1, Supermarine Nighthawk, an anti-Zeppelin Night fighter.[6] This also used a small ABC engine, which powered a generator for an on-board searchlight.[citation needed]",
