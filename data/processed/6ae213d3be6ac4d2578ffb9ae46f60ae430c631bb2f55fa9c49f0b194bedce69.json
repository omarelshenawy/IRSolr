Between the Spanish defeat in the Seven Years' War in 1763 and the end of the American War of Independence in 1783, the United Kingdom ruled Florida. The first known use of the term \"Seminolie\" is from a British Indian agent in a document dated 1771.[40] The beginnings of the tribe are vague, but records show that Creeks invaded the Florida peninsula, conquering and assimilating what was left of pre-Columbian societies into the Creek Confederacy. The mixing of cultures is evident in the language influences present among the Seminoles: various Muskogean languages, notably Hitchiti, and Creek, as well as Timucuan. In the early 19th century, a US Indian agent explained the Seminoles this way: \"The word Seminole means runaway or broken off. HenceÂ ... applicable to all the Indians in the Territory of Florida as all of them ran awayÂ ... from the CreekÂ ... Nation\".[41] Linguistically, the term \"Seminole\" comes from the Creek words Sua (Sun God), ma (mother, although in this connotation it is pejorative), and ol (people) to mean \"people whom the Sun God does not love\", or \"accursed\".[42]",
