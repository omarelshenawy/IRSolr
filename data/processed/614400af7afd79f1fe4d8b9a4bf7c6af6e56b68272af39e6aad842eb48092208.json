Jean-FranÃ§ois Gerbillon and Thomas Pereira served as translators for the negotiations of the Treaty of Nerchinsk. Kangxi was grateful to the Jesuits for their contributions, the many languages they could interpret, and the innovations they offered his military in gun manufacturing[13] and artillery, the latter of which enabled the Qing Empire to conquer the Kingdom of Tungning.[14]",
