				"previous": "The 75S-1 receiver and 32S-1 transmitter, comprising the heart of the S/Line, operated separately or together to transceive. The units included crystal bandpass filters and a new compact PTO design that provided stable, highly linear tuning across 200Â kHz band segments. The S/Line tuning dial mechanism was unique when introduced. It used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution, better than 1Â kHz.",
				"after": "Within a few years Collins had introduced additional S/Line components, including the 30S-1 kilowatt power amplifier, the 30L-1 desktop power amplifier, and the 62S-1 transverter, which provided coverage of the 6 meter (50Â MHz) and 2 meter (144Â MHz) amateur bands. The KWM-2 transceiver replaced the KWM-1 using many of the S/Lineâs design features and matching its styling. Other accessories included speakers, microphones and control consoles.",
