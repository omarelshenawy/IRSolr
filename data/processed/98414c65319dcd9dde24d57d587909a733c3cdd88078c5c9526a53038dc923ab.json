The passengers included priests, farmers, and soldiers, who would be the new colonists. This reflected the new policy of creating not just \"colonies of exploitation\", but also \"colonies of settlement\" from which to launch missions dedicated to converting the natives to Christianity.[54] Modern studies suggest that, as reported by the Washington Post, \"crew members may have included free black Africans who arrived in the New World about a decade before the slave trade began.\"[55]",
