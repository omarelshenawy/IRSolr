				"previous": "The craft of making reborn dolls began in the United States in the late 1990s.[5] Reborning follows a long tradition of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism.[2] The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls.[5] In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay.[2] This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries.[14] The niche market for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional response, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes.[2] Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries.[5][7] 121-Primarily reborning has grown in the Britain and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America.[5][7] Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers.[2] This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time.[7] Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have also appeared since these events.",
				"after": "The appearance of the doll depends on the creator; however, certain reborn artists allow customers to customize their doll, usually using a photograph to replicate a particular infant.[3]",
