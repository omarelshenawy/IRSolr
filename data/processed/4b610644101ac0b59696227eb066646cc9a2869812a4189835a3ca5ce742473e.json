In any case, anyone with first class lounge access almost automatically has access to the business class loungeâsuch as if a traveling companion is not in first class and cannot be brought into the first class lounge as a guestâthough lounge agents may get confused when passengers choose to use a lesser amenity than they are entitled.[importance?] In most cases, airlines will offer first class passengers a free pass to their standard airport club. Some airlines offer \"arrival lounges\" for passengers to shower, rest, and eat, after a long-haul international flight.[5]",
