				"previous": "Cheadle Hulme is served by a fire station on Turves Road which opened in October 1960. Before this the area made use of a service in Cheadle.[59] An ambulance station is near the fire station, and the closest public hospital is Stepping Hill Hospital in Hazel Grove. Until the early 2000s the area had a police station which served as the headquarters for the west Stockport area.[60] The building, which opened in 1912, was sold in 2006 and converted into flats.[61]",
				"after": "Cheadle Hulme has a large variety of businesses serving the area. Station Road is home to the shopping precinct (built in 1962)[62] and contains among other businesses an Oxfam shop, an Asda supermarket, a hairdressing salon, an optician, a pharmacy, some clothing retailers and several restaurants. There are more restaurants and cafÃ©s along Station Road as well as solicitors and building societies, and long-running family businesses such as Pimlott's butchers are also prominent.[63] In 2002, a Tesco Express opened on the site of an old petrol station, and in July 2007 Cheadle Hulme became the home of Waitrose's first purpose-built retail outlet in northern England.[64]",
