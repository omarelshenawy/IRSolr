				"previous": "In the early 19th century, the reforming zeal of Provosts John Eveleigh and Edward Copleston gained Oriel a reputation as the most brilliant college of the day. It was the centre of the \"Oriel Noetics\" â clerical liberals such as Richard Whately and Thomas Arnold were Fellows,[15] and during the 1830s, two intellectually eminent Fellows of Oriel, John Keble and John Henry Newman, supported by Canon Pusey (also an Oriel fellow initially, later at Christ Church) and others, formed a group known as the Oxford Movement, alternatively as the Tractarians, or familiarly as the Puseyites. The group was disgusted by the Church of England of the day and sought to revive the spirit of early Christianity.[16][17] Tension arose in College since Provost Edward Hawkins was a determined opponent of the Movement.[15]",
				"after": "During the First World War, a wall was built dividing Third quad from Second quad to accommodate members of Somerville College in St Mary's Hall while their college buildings were being used as a military hospital. At this time Oxford separated male and female students as far as possible; Vera Brittain, one of the Somerville students, recalled an amusing occurrence during her time there in her autobiography, Testament of Youth;",
