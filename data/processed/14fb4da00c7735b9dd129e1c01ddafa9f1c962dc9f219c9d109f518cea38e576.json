				"previous": "The Pillars of Islam (arkan al-Islam; also arkan ad-din, \"pillars of religion\") are five basic acts in Islam, considered obligatory for all believers. The Quran presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the creed (shahadah), (2) daily prayers (salat), (3) almsgiving (zakah), (4) fasting during Ramadan and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) at least once in a lifetime. Both Shia and Sunni sects agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts.[60]",
				"after": "The Shahadah,[61] which is the basic creed of Islam that must be recited under oath with the specific statement: \"'aÅ¡hadu 'al-lÄ ilÄha illÄ-llÄhu wa 'aÅ¡hadu 'anna muÄ§ammadan rasÅ«lu-llÄh\", or \"I testify that there is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God.\"[62] This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam. Muslims must repeat the shahadah in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.[63]",
