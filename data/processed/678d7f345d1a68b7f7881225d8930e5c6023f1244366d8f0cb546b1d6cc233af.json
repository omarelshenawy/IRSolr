				"previous": "No further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937, when it was found in Quebec, Canada.[5] The next year, Paul Shope considered the genus Polyozellus to be superfluous, pointed out that the compound fruit bodies and the wrinkled hymenium were instead consistent with the genus Craterellus.[6] In 1939, American mycologist Lee Oras Overholts, in a letter to the journal Mycologia, opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by Calvin Kauffman, who made notes and photos of the species collected in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado, and in the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon.[7] Kauffman believed the species to be merely \"a very extreme growth condition\" of Cantharellus clavatus (now known as Gomphus clavatus) and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus Craterellus.[8] Mycologists Alexander H.Â Smith and Elizabeth Morse, in their 1947 publication on Cantharellus species in the United States, placed the species in a new section Polyozellus, but did not separate it from the genus Cantharellus; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of Polyozellus as the small, roughened, hyaline spores and the color change of the flesh in potassium hydroxide solution, adding that \"the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant excluding the species.\"[9]",
				"after": "In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki took into consideration differences in spore characteristics: species in the genus Cantharellus were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like Polyozellus; however, these spore characteristics were common in species in the Thelephoraceae family (Cantharellus belongs in a different family, the Cantharellaceae). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), and the presence of thelephoric acid, a mushroom pigment common in the family. Taken together, these factors led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae.[10] The suggested family-level taxonomical change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it Thelephora multiplex.[11] As of 2009, both Index Fungorum[12] and MycoBank[13] list Polyozellus as being within the Thelephoraceae family, a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the leathery earthfans.[14] The genus name is derived from the Greek poly meaning many, and oz, meaning branch.[15] The specific epithet multiplex means \"in many pieces\", referring to the compound nature of the fruit body.[16] Common names for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle.[17] In Alaska, where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black chanterelle,[18] although this name is shared with some Craterellus species.[19]",
