				"previous": "In addition to tributary relations with the Kushans, the Han Empire received gifts from the Parthian Empire, from a king in modern Burma, from a ruler in Japan, and initiated an unsuccessful mission to Daqin (Rome) in AD 97 with Gan Ying as emissary.[62] A Roman embassy of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.Â 161â180 AD) is recorded in the Hou Hanshu to have reached the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r.Â AD 146â168) in AD 166,[63][64] yet Rafe de Crespigny asserts that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants.[65] Other travelers to Eastern-Han China included Buddhist monks who translated works into Chinese, such as An Shigao of Parthia, and Lokaksema from Kushan-era Gandhara, India.[66]",
