				"after": "The CFM56 is designed to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the BoeingÂ 737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing the thrust of the engine and slowing the aircraft down.[49][50]",
