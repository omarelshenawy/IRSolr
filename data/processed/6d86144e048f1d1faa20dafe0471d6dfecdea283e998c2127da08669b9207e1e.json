				"previous": "Sexual size dimorphism in this species is perhaps the greatest in any neognath bird.[25] Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90Â cm (35Â in) in length and weighing up to 28Â kg (62Â lb), whereas females were 70Â cm (28Â in) and weighed 17Â kg (37Â lb).[26] This is only 60% of the weight of a mature male.[25] Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21Â kg in males and 13Â kg in females.[27] Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.[25]",
				"after": "The Rodrigues solitaire shared traits with the dodo, its closest relative, such as size and features in the skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.[27]",
