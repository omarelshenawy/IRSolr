				"previous": "The last location Chataan affected was Japan. The typhoon forced the cancellation of 316Â flights[22] and 150Â train trips. The expressway between Shizuoka and Tokyo was closed.[23] At least 396Â schools were closed in the country,[22] and a baseball game between the Yokohama DeNA BayStars and the Yakult Swallows was canceled due to the inclement weather.[24] Toyota temporarily closed most of its factories in the country.[25] Heavy rainfall, peaking at 509Â mm (20.0Â in) in Gifu Prefecture, fell across Japan. The rains flooded 10,270Â houses in the country,[26] resulting in evacuation orders for about 145,000Â people.[27] The floods damaged roads in 338Â locations, and at least 10Â bridges were destroyed.[28] About 15,000Â evacuees were in Ogaki after a river exceeded its banks.[5] High rainfall caused hundreds of landslides,[15] two of which resulted in a death.[29] Floods killed at least three people.[15] Winds from the typhoon peaked at 97Â km/h (60Â mph) at HachijÅ-jima.[26] High winds in Sakai, Osaka damaged 20Â houses.[22] In Tokyo, the storm produced light winds and rains, despite passing within 102Â km (63Â mi).[5] Chataan destroyed 21Â homes and damaged 239Â others to some degree. During its passage, the typhoon destroyed 258.6Â km2 (99.8Â sqÂ mi) of crops. The typhoon killed six people, left one person missing, and injured 30Â others. Overall damage in Japan totaled about $500Â million (Â¥59Â billion 2002Â JPY).[nb 4][26] During the storm, Yahoo! Japan received a record 359Â million views, mostly due to people checking the website's weather section.[31]",
				"after": "After Chataan affected Chuuk state, the island's residents were in need of food, clothes and medicine. Only a few crops were not destroyed by the storm; much of the breadfruit was stripped from the trees, and fruit not destroyed by the storm were damaged by parasites.[9] In the days after the storm, the local Red Cross deployed about 100Â volunteers to search for victims buried by landslides.[8] However, rescue operations were hampered by persistent flooding after the storm.[12] Initially the death toll was unknown, and it was feared that hundreds of people had been killed.[8] Six people who were seriously injured on Chuuk were flown to The Queen's Medical Center in Hawaii for treatment; they were initially scheduled to fly to Guam Memorial Hospital, but the facility was full.[32] About 2,000Â residents affected by the storm evacuated to government-run shelters.[11] The Red Cross shipped various relief supplies, including raincoats and water, to the affected areas.[8] By JulyÂ 4, power systems were restored and the airport reopened. Although there was enough food in the immediate aftermath, the destruction of crops and cattle posed a long-term food shortage.[12]",
