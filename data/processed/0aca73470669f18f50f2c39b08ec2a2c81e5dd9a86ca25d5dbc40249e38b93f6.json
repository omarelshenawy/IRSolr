				"after": "Paxillus involutus was widely eaten in Central and Eastern Europe until World War II, although English guidebooks did not recommend it.[22][29] In Poland, the mushroom was often eaten after pickling or salting.[15] It was known to be a gastrointestinal irritant when ingested raw but had been presumed edible after cooking.[27] Questions were first raised about its toxicity after German mycologist Julius SchÃ¤ffer died after eating it in October 1944. About an hour after he and his wife ate a meal prepared with the mushrooms, SchÃ¤ffer developed vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. His condition worsened to the point where he was admitted to hospital the following day and developed renal failure, perishing after 17Â days.[29][59]",
