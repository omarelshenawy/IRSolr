				"previous": "SATA introduced a new logo with the new fleet revitalization; referred to as Blue Island AÃ§or,[5] it was inaugurated with the appearance of the first Bombardier aircraft, the Q200. Base on a year-long effort, and over 100 drafts, the re-imagined modern AÃ§or brand was designed by Ivity-Corp.[6] It is basically a geometric composite of nine-shapes, representing the nine islands of the archipelago, joined to form the ubiquitous AÃ§or identified in legend. When exploded, each shape can be placed alone in geographical context to form a modernist map of the Azores.[7]",
