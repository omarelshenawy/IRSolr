				"after": "Frustrated with politics, Weber resumed teaching during this time, first at the University of Vienna, then, after 1919, at the University of Munich.[4][24][36] His lectures from that period were collected into major works, such as the General Economic History, Science as a Vocation and Politics as a Vocation.[4] In Munich, he headed the first German university institute of sociology, but never held a professorial position in sociology. Many colleagues and students in Munich attacked his response to the German Revolution and some right-wing students held protests in front of his home.[40] Max Weber contracted the Spanish flu and died of pneumonia in Munich on 14 June 1920.[4] At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing his magnum opus on sociological theory: Economy and Society. His widow Marianne helped prepare it for its publication in 1921â22.",
