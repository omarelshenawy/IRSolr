				"after": "It is not known exactly where or when Jumbo was born. It was likely East Africa near the Setit River around Christmas 1860. After his mother was killed by Arabian hunters, the infant Jumbo was captured by a Sudanese elephant hunter named Taher Sheriff. In February 1862, British explorer Samuel White Baker saw Jumbo in the desert camp of the Arabian hunters.[2] This camp was on the border of eastern Sudan and Abyssinia (now, Eritrea). These hunters were under contract to Johan Schmidt, a Bavarian, to capture wild animals for sale and export to European zoos.[3] Baker estimated that Jumbo was 4 feet (120Â cm) tall and weighed about 500 pounds (230Â kg). Based on his height and weight, Jumbo was about one year old.[4]",
