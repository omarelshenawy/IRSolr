				"previous": "In 2000, Jackson County had a population of about 181,300, most of them living in the Bear Creek Valley cities of Ashland (19,500), Talent (5,600), Phoenix (4,100), Medford (63,200), Central Point (12,500), and Jacksonville (2,200).[19] Others in Jackson County lived in the cities of Shady Cove (2,300), Eagle Point (4,800), Butte Falls (400) and Rogue River (1,800). Josephine County had a population of 75,700, including the cities of Grants Pass (23,000) and Cave Junction (1,400).[19] Gold Beach (1,900) is the only city in Curry County (21,100) in the Rogue River basin. Only small, sparsely inhabited parts of the watershed are in Klamath and Douglas counties in Oregon[19] and Siskiyou and Del Norte counties in California.[20] The watershed's average population density is about 32 people per square mile (12.4/km2).[21]",
				"after": "Many overlapping entities including city, county, state, and federal governments share jurisdiction for parts of the watershed. About 60Â percent of the basin is publicly owned and is managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), assisted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and other agencies in both states are charged with controlling water pollution in the basin.[17] United States National Forests and other forests cover about 83Â percent of the basin; another 6Â percent is grassland, 3Â percent shrub, and only 0.2Â percent wetland.[22] Urban areas account for slightly less than 1Â percent and farms for about 6Â percent.[22]",
