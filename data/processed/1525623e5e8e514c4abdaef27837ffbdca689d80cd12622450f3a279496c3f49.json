				"after": "The concept of the workstation mutated around mid-1990s by the emergence of groove machine-concept birthed in mid-1980s - a keyless version of a workstation, still with a self-contained sound source and sequencer, mostly aimed at dance. Again, nowadays they also feature a sampler. The groove machines were realized in 1980s (ex. Linn 9000 (1984), SCI Studio 440 (1986), Simmons SDX (1987), well known E-mu SP-12/SP-1200 (1985/1987) and Akai MPC60 (1988)), and finally the concept have been widely accepted. Then in mid 1990s, Roland entered to the hype, with the MC-303, and also Korg and Yamaha followed suit. Korg created the much-used Electribe series.",
