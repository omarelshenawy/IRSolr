				"previous": "The tree prefers moist and loamy soils, but is adaptable to a very wide range of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade.[4] In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas.[15] The tree of heaven is found within a wide range of climatic conditions.[4] In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan[17] as well as lower ones in mainland China.[5] In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains and throughout much of the California Central Valley. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.[4]",
