				"previous": "Generally, undergraduate students are required to live in dorms on campus.[99][citation needed] Exceptions are made for students living with relatives in Davidson County, students with health exemptions, married students, and some students with senior standing.[99][citation needed] The first step in the College Halls system is The Commons, a collection of ten residential halls in a living, learning community on the Peabody campus that houses all first-year students.[citation needed] Two of the new residence halls have received LEED silver certification and the new Commons Dining Center has received gold certification, making Vanderbilt the only university in the state to be recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council.[100][101] The university expects all five of the new residence halls and one renovated residence hall to eventually receive LEED recognition.[102] The total cost of The Commons construction project is expected to be over $150 million.[103] In the summer of 2012, the university demolished the pre-existing dormitories known as the Kissam Quadrangle and broke ground on the Warren and Moore residential colleges, a new living and learning community following the system of the Commons. The project cost $115 million and opened its doors in August 2014.[104]",
