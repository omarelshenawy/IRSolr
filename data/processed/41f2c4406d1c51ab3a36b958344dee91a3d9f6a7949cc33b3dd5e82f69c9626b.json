				"previous": "Newark was the fourth poorest of U.S. cities with over 250,000 residents in 2008,[71] but New Jersey as a whole has the second highest median household income.[19] This is largely because so much of New Jersey consists of suburbs, most of them affluent, of New York City and Philadelphia. New Jersey is also the most densely populated state, and the only state that has had every one of its counties deemed \"urban\" as defined by the Census Bureau's Combined Statistical Area.[72]",
				"after": "In 2010, 6.2% of its population was reported as under age 5, 23.5% under 18, and 13.5% were 65 or older; and females made up approximately 51.3% of the population.[77]",
