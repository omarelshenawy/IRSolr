				"previous": "The 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at 16.5 feet (5.03Â m).[5] While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag.[9][18] However, the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body unit load devices side-by-side.[22][23] As a result, a smaller container, the LD2,[24] was created specifically for the 767.[25] The adoption of a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section,[18] providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.[6][18]",
				"after": "The 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit.[17] Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly.[17] Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft.[26] The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a U.S. presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets.[26][27] A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models.[28] Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured.[28][29] The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course,[19] and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types.[30]",
