				"previous": "In February 1934 several members of the Schutzbund were executed,[49] the Social Democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated.[48] On 1 May 1934, the Austrofascists imposed a new constitution (\"Maiverfassung\") which cemented Dollfuss's power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a Nazi coup attempt.[50][51]",
				"after": "His successor Kurt Schuschnigg struggled to keep Austria independent as \"the better German state\", but on 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over government, while German troops occupied the country.[52] On 13 March 1938, the Anschluss of Austria was officially declared. Two days later Hitler (an Austrian by birth), announced what he called the \"re-unification\" of his home country with the \"rest of Germany\" on Vienna's Heldenplatz. He established a plebiscite confirming the union with Germany in April 1938.",
