				"previous": "Aurigny Air Services was founded by Sir Derrick Bailey and started operations on 1 March 1968 after British United Airways withdrew from the Alderney to Guernsey route. It initially operated Britten-Norman Islander aircraft, developing a highly efficient network linking the Channel Islands with each other and with France and the United Kingdom.[5] During the first year of operations the airline carried 45,000 passengers between Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney.",
				"after": "Aurigny became the first commercial operator of the Britten-Norman Trislander in July 1971 and the airline remains the worldâs largest operator of the type. Use of this larger aircraft enabled the route structure to be developed to include the south coast of England and northern France.[5] In 1977, Aurigny was the first airline in the world to ban smoking on all services. In 1993, Aurigny won a contract to carry mail between the Channel Islands and the UK and in 1999 it began daily services from Guernsey to London Stansted Airport and Amsterdam Airport operated by Saab 340 aircraft. The latter route was later dropped due to poor demand.",
