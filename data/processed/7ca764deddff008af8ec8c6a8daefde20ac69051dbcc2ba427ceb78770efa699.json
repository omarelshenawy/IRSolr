				"previous": "For over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada.[74] The variety of buildings included factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries which today provide a legacy of historic and architectural interest, especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area. There are 50 National Historic Sites of Canada, more than any other city.[75]",
				"after": "There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal still in their original form: Notre-Dame de MontrÃ©al Basilica, Bonsecours Market, and the impressive 19thâcentury headquarters of all major Canadian banks on St. James Street (French: Rue Saint Jacques). Saint Joseph's Oratory, completed in 1967, Ernest Cormier's Art Deco UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al main building, the landmark Place Ville Marie office tower, the controversial Olympic Stadium and surrounding structures, are but a few notable examples of 20th-century architecture.",
