				"after": "US air traffic controllers provided transatlantic flight control operations as a part of the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (referred to in radio conversations simply as \"Center\" and abbreviated in the reports as \"ZNY\"). The airspace is divided into \"areas,\" and \"Area F\" was the section that oversaw the airspace through which Flight 990 was flying. Transatlantic commercial air traffic travels via a system of routes called North Atlantic Tracks, and Flight 990 was the only aircraft at the time assigned to fly North Atlantic Track Zulu. There are also a number of military operations areas over the Atlantic, called \"Warning Areas,\" which are also monitored by New York Center, but records show that these were inactive the night of the accident.[1]",
