				"previous": "Edward's new palace consisted of three courts along the north side of the Upper Ward, called Little Cloister, King's Cloister and the Kitchen Court.[94] At the front of the palace lay the St George's Hall range, which combined a new hall and a new chapel. This range had two symmetrical gatehouses, the Spicerie Gatehouse and the Kitchen Gatehouse. The Spicerie Gatehouse was the main entrance into the palace, whilst the Kitchen Gatehouse simply led into the kitchen courtyard.[95] The great hall had numerous large windows looking out across the ward.[96] The range had an unusual, unified roof-line and, with a taller roof than the rest of the palace, would have been highly distinctive.[97] The Rose Tower, designed for the king's private use, set off the west corner of the range.[94] The result was a \"great and apparently architecturally unified palaceÂ ... uniform in all sorts of ways, as to roof line, window heights, cornice line, floor and ceiling heights\".[98] With the exception of the Hall, Chapel and the Great Chamber, the new interiors all shared a similar height and width.[99][nb 7] The defensive features, however, were primarily for show, possibly to provide a backdrop for jousting between the two-halves of the Order of the Garter.[91]",
				"after": "Edward built further luxurious, self-contained lodgings for his court around the east and south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle.[7] The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward.[88] In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside.[88] The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354.[100] William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen.[88]",
