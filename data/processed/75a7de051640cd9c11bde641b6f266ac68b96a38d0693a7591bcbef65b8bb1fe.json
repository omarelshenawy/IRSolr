				"previous": "In 1958, as part of the commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the Wood Green Local Board, the railway goods depot was used for a three-day exhibition of locomotives and other railway rolling stock. The exhibition was a great success, and was visited by around 14,000Â spectators.[27] Among locomotives on exhibit were the land speed record holder Mallard and a Class 9F steam locomotive.[57]",
				"after": "However, by this point the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since the opening of the Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped throughout the 1950s as a result of improved road haulage and declining demand for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963.[7] With freight usage dwindling to a trickle following the ending of passenger services, the goods yard was closed on 7 December 1964.[27] The site of the goods yard was used for the construction of a large apartment block known as The Sandlings,[2] and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.[17]",
