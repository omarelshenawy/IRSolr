				"after": "By classicizing the condottieri, the portrait may have represented an opportunity toâas Leonardo Bruni had advocatedâ\"revive the ancient form of tribute\" by choosing a \"long-dead and uncontroversial subject\".[88] Mallett has interpreted the fresco as a Medicean attempt to exalt \"the praiseworthiness of condottieri to a populace with mixed feelings\".[89] In fact, Cosimo may have allowed the former Albizzi project to go through merely to pave the way for a similar honor for NiccolÃ² da Tolentino (died 1435), a condottiero whom the Medici would have favored over Hawkwood.[15] The Tolentino fresco was commissioned 20Â years after the soldier of fortune's death, and was specified in its contract to be painted in \"the same manner and form as the Hawkwood\".[90] Thus, the recommissioning of the portrait may be read as part of an ongoing debate over the appropriateness of condottieri for a Republic. Bruni raises this subject in De militia (1420),[91] arguing for a standing Florentine militia, especially given the close ties between Tolentino and the Medici.[44] Intending to depict Hawkwood as an \"obedient captain conducting an inspection of troops\",[3] the conceit of Hawkwood patiently reviewing troops is \"suggestive of a loyal communal servant\".[92]",
