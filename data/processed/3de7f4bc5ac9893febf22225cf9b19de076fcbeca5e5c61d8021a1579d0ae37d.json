				"after": "In September 1853 a Committee of Enquiry into the mismanagement of the company recommended the expulsion of the four remaining trustees and the reform of the company under a new board of directors.[49] This was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and work finally began on the scheme.[43] A 2,200-acre (3.4Â sqÂ mi; 8.9Â km2) tract of land stretching from Woking to Brookwood was purchased from Lord Onslow.[29][46] The westernmost 400 acres (0.62Â sqÂ mi; 1.6Â km2), at the Brookwood end, were designated the initial cemetery site,[46] and a branch railway line was built from the LSWR main line into this section.[43][note 6] A plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street (now Leake Street) was chosen as the site for the London railway terminus.[50] Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station, which was approved in June 1854,[51] and completed in October 1854.[29] In July 1854 work began on the drainage of the marshlands designated as the initial cemetery site, and on the construction of the embankment carrying the railway branch into the cemetery.[52][note 7]",
