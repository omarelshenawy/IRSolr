In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse.[100] The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history.[101] The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.[102]",
