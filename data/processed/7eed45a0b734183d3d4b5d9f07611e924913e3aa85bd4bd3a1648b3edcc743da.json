				"previous": "Although psilocybin may be prepared synthetically, outside of the research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste.[27] In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.[46] The effects of the drug begin 10â40Â minutes after ingestion, and last 2â6Â hours depending on dose, species, and individual metabolism.[99] The half life of psilocybin is 163Â Â±Â 64Â minutes when taken orally, or 74.1Â Â±Â 19.6Â minutes when injected intravenously.[1] A dosage of 4â10Â mg, corresponding roughly to 50â300Â micrograms per kilogram (Âµg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10â50Â mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10â50Â grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1â5Â grams of dried mushrooms.[46] A small number of people are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2Â mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.[99]",
