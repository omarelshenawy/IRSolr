				"after": "Mahler's friend Guido Adler calculated that at the time of the composer's death in 1911 there had been more than 260Â performances of the symphonies in Europe, Russia and America, the Fourth Symphony with 61Â performances given most frequently (Adler did not enumerate performances of the songs).[150] In his lifetime, Mahler's works and their performances attracted wide interest, but rarely unqualified approval; for years after its 1889 premiere critics and public struggled to understand the First Symphony, described by one critic after an 1898 Dresden performance as \"the dullest [symphonic] work the new epoch has produced.\"[151] The Second Symphony was received more positively, one critic calling it \"the most masterly work of its kind since Mendelssohn\".[152] Such generous praise was rare, particularly after Mahler's accession to the Vienna Hofoper directorship. His many enemies in the city used the anti-Semitic and conservative press to denigrate almost every performance of a Mahler work;[153] thus the Third Symphony, a success in Krefeld in 1902, was treated in Vienna with critical scorn: \"Anyone who has committed such a deed deserves a couple of years in prison.\"[154]",
