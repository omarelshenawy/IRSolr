Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed ostraca unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland.[21] One of the recovered ostracon bears the theophoric Phoenician name \"grtnt\" which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess Tanit occurred in Sidon.[nb 8][43]",
