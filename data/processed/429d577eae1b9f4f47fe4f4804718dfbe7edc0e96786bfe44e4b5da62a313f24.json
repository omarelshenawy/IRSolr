				"previous": "The Ottomans expanded southwestwards into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent Persian Shi'ia Safavid Empire to the east. In the Saracen sphere of power, the Ottoman Empire, which had conquered Constantinople in 1453 and had seized Egypt in 1517, established the regencies of Algeria, Tunisia, and Tripoli (between 1519 and 1551), Morocco remaining an independent Arabized Berber state under the Sharifan dynasty, which had its beginnings at the end of the 13th century.",
				"after": "In the Ethiopian Highlands the Solomonic dynasty established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old Axumite royal house, the Solomonics ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, Shewa and the rest of Abyssinia was conquered by the forces of Ahmed Gurey of the Adal Sultanate to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the Oromo ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.",
