				"previous": "Since 1998, an American botanist, Austin Mast, has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and somewhat different from Thiele and Ladiges'. With respect to B.Â violacea, Mast's results agree with its placement near B.Â laricina and B.Â incana, placing it in a clade with these two species and B.Â sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (treated at species rank as B.Â dolichostyla).[10] However, Thiele's B. subseries Longistyles appears to be polyphyletic, as do both definitions of B.Â ser. Abietinaeâthat is, none form a natural grouping.[10][11][12]",
