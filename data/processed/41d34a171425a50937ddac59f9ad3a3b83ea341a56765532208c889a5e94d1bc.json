				"after": "The protagonist of Anachronox is Sylvester \"Sly Boots\" Bucelli, a human and former private detective on Anachronox. Twenty-nine years old and described as \"bold, brash, and overconfident\", Boots has gotten himself into trouble and now runs his agency out of rented storage space above a seedy bar.[11] His only friends are PAL-18, his spirited, sarcastic robot assistant since childhood, and Fatima Doohan, his secretary. Fatima was fatally injured and digitized by Boots onto a PDA-analogue \"LifeCursor\", where she bitterly lives to render assistance.[11][12] Several allies join Boots over the course of the game; first is 71-year-old Grumpos Matavastros, a \"scholar, outdoorsman, eccentric recluse, and renaissance man\"âand a very grumpy person.[13] A former curator of the MysTech museum on Anachronox, Grumpos devotes his life to studying the artifacts. Dr. Rho Bowman joins the party on Sunder; she is a brilliant scientist who's been branded a heretic after publication of her book, MysTech Awake![14] The team then gains support from Democratus, an eccentric planet boasting a planetary ring and brilliant technology. Said technology includes having the planet shrink to human height to be part of the team. Two further allies are the femme fatale Stiletto Anywayâa 25-year-old former companion of Boots known for being stealthy and aloof[15]âand Paco \"El PuÃ±o\" Estrella, a washed up superhero who's turned to alcoholism after his comic book series was canceled.[16] Their foes include Detta, a heavyset crime boss/kingpin on planet Anachronox,[17] and several other monsters and shady characters.",
