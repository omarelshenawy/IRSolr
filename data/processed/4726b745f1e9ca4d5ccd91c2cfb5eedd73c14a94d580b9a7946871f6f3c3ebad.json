				"previous": "Buddhism was first introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD. Tibetan king SongtsÃ¤n Gampo[24] (reigned 627â649), a convert to Buddhism, who actually had extended the Tibetan Empire into Sikkim and Bhutan,[25] ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, at Bumthang in central Bhutan and at Kyichu (near Paro) in the Paro Valley.[26] Buddhism was propagated in earnest[24] in 746[27] under King Sindhu RÄja (also KÃ¼njom;[28] Sendha Gyab; Chakhar Gyalpo), an exiled Indian king who had established a government in Bumthang at Chakhar Gutho Palace.[29]:35 [30]:13",
				"after": "Much of early Bhutanese history is unclear because most of the records were destroyed when fire ravaged the ancient capital, Punakha, in 1827. By the 10th century, Bhutan's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Various subsects of Buddhism emerged that were patronized by the various Mongol warlords. After the decline of the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, these subsects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the Drukpa Lineage by the 16th century.[26][31]",
