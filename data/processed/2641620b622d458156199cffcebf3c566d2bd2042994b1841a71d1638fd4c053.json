Another Wikipedia user, David Friedland, subsequently improved the logo by changing the styling of the jigsaw pieces so that their boundaries seemed indented and simplified their contents to be a single glyph per piece, rather than a jumble of nonsensical multilingual text.[5] In the process, some errors were introduced.[5] In particular, one piece of Devanagari script and one piece of Japanese katakana were incorrectly rendered.[6]",
