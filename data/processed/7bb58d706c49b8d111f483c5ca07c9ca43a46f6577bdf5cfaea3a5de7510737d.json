				"It can be shown (see Gelfand and Fomin 1963) that the minimizing u has two derivatives and satisfies the EulerâLagrange equation. The associated Î» will be denoted by ; it is the lowest eigenvalue for this equation and boundary conditions. The associated minimizing function will be denoted by . This variational characterization of eigenvalues leads to the RayleighâRitz method: choose an approximating u as a linear combination of basis functions (for example trigonometric functions) and carry out a finite-dimensional minimization among such linear combinations. This method is often surprisingly accurate."
