The first canals built in the Everglades did little harm to the ecosystem, as they were unable to drain much of it.[58] However, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward based the majority of his 1904 campaign for governor on how drainage would create \"The Empire of the Everglades\".[59] Broward ordered the drainage that took place between 1905 and 1910, and it was successful enough that land developers sold tracts for $30 an acre, settling the town of Davie, and developing regions in Lee and Dade counties. The canals also cleared water that made way for agricultural fields growing sugarcane.[60][61]",
