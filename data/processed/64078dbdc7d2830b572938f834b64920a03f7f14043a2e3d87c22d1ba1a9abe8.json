				"after": "Here, two directional microphones are at the same place, typically pointing at an angle between 90Â° and 135Â° to each other.[58] The stereo effect is achieved through differences in sound pressure level between two microphones. A difference in levels of 18 dB (16 to 20 dB) is needed for hearing the direction of a loudspeaker. Due to the lack of differences in time-of-arrival/phase ambiguities, the sonic characteristic of X-Y recordings has less sense of space and depth when compared to recordings employing an A-B setup. When two figure-eight microphones are used, facing Â±45Â° with respect to the sound source, the X-Y setup is called a Blumlein Pair. The sonic image produced is realistic.",
