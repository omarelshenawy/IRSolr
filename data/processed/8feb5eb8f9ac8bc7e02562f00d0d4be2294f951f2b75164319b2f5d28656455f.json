				"after": "The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped the sea and its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays.[48] Historically, mantas were feared for their size and power. Sailors believed that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California found them to be placid and that they could interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.[49]",
