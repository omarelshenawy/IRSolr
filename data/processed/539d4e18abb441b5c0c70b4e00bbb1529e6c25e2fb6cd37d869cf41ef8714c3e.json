				"after": "The history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries; sandalwood,[122] whaling,[123] sugarcane, pineapple, military, tourism and education. Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the gross state product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify. The state's gross output for 2003 was US$47Â billion; per capita income for Hawaii residents was US$30,441.[citation needed] Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the continental U.S. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey.[124]",
