				"previous": "As a simple example, if f converts a temperature in degrees Celsius C to degrees Fahrenheit F, the function converting degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius would be a suitable fâ1.",
				"after": "Such an inverse function exists if and only if f is bijective. In this case, f is called invertible. The notation (or, in some texts, just ) and fâ1 are akin to multiplication and reciprocal notation. With this analogy, identity functions are like the multiplicative identity, 1, and inverse functions are like reciprocals (hence the notation).",
