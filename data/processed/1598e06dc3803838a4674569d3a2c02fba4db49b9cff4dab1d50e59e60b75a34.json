				"previous": "Tyranids are a race in the fictional Warhammer 40,000 setting, the Tyranids are a nomadic alien race comprising many genetically engineered forms. They are the \"Great Devourer\" and are the \"most alien race\" in the Imperium of Mankind. They are an \"elemental force\" that seeks to consume all in their path, draining all planets of any possible resource with horrific speed.",
				"after": "Tyranids were first described in Rick Priestley's Rogue Trader, the first edition of the Warhammer 40,000. At that time, they were not an emphasized race in the game, instead representing a limited number of occasionally-encountered alien antagonists. In later editions the Tyranids became a playable race in their own right, popularized by a number of successful board games.",
