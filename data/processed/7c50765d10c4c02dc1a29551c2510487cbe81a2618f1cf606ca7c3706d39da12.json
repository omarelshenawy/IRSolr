				"previous": "The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown fur that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm.[6][11] The fur is waterproof, and the texture is akin to that of a mole.[15] The platypus uses its tail for storage of fat reserves (an adaptation also found in animals such as the Tasmanian devil[16] and fat-tailed sheep). It has webbed feet and a large, rubbery snout; these features appear closer to those of a duck than to those of any known mammal. The webbing is more significant on the front feet and is folded back when walking on land.[11] Unlike a bird's beak (in which the upper and lower parts separate to reveal the mouth), the snout of the platypus is a sensory organ with the mouth on the underside. The nostrils are located on the dorsal surface of the snout, while the eyes and ears are located in a groove set just back from it; this groove is closed when swimming.[11] Platypuses have been heard to emit a low growl when disturbed and a range of other vocalizations have been reported in captive specimens.[6]",
				"after": "Weight varies considerably from 0.7 to 2.4Â kg (1.5 to 5.3Â lb), with males being larger than females; males average 50Â cm (20Â in) in total length, while females average 43Â cm (17Â in),[11] with substantial variation in average size from one region to another, and this pattern does not seem to follow any particular climatic rule and may be due to other environmental factors, such as predation and human encroachment.[17]",
