				"previous": "With the exception of the 1894-S dime, there are no great rarities in the series, as mintages were generally high. Key dates for the dime include the 1895-O, 1896-S, 1897-O, 1901-S and 1903-S. For the quarter, key dates are the 1896-S, 1901-S, and 1913-S. The rarest half dollar is the 1892-O \"Micro O\", in which the mint mark \"O\" for New Orleans was impressed on the half dollar die with a puncheon intended for the quarter; other key dates are the 1892-S, 1893-S, 1897-O, 1914, and 1915. \"Condition rarities\", relatively inexpensive in circulated condition but costly in high grades, include the 1901-S, 1904-S, and 1907-S half dollars.[47][48] Although most dates are obtainable, many are scarce in uncirculated grades as the coins saw heavy wear. Large quantities of Barber coins were melted for bullion when silver prices rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[49]",
