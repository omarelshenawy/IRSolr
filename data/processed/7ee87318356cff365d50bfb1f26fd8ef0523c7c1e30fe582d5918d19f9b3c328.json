				"The Tomcat logo design came when Grumman's Director of Presentation Services, Dick Milligan, and one of his artists, Grumman employee Jim Rodriguez, were asked for a logo by Grumman's Director of Business Development and former Blue Angels #5 pilot, Norm Gandia.[160] Per Rodriguez, \"He asked me to draw a lifelike Tomcat wearing boxing gloves and trunks sporting a six-shooter on his left side; where the guns are located on the F-14, along with two tails.\" The Cat was drawn up after a tabby cat was sourced and used for photographs, and named \"Tom\". The logo has gone through many variations, including one for the thenâImperial Iranian Air Force F-14, called \"Ali-cat\". The accompanying slogan \"Anytime Baby!\" was developed by Norm Gandia as a challenge to the U.S. Air Force's McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.[160][161]"
