The policy identifies challenges to the development of sport in the country, including limited infrastructure and financial capacity. It sets the \"inspirational target\" that, by 2020, Rwanda should have \"a higher percentage of population playing sport than in any other African nation\" and be ranked amongst the top three African countries in basketball, volleyball, cycling, athletics and Paralympic sports, and the top ten in football. It also aims to \"foster increased participation of people in traditional sports\".[221]",
