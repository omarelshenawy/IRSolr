				"after": "At the age of 14, upperclass males made their rite of passage into adulthood, and began to learn leadership roles in political, religious, and military life through mentoring from a senior member of their family or a family friend.[502] Higher education was provided by grammatici or rhetores.[503] The grammaticus or \"grammarian\" taught mainly Greek and Latin literature, with history, geography, philosophy or mathematics treated as explications of the text.[504] With the rise of Augustus, contemporary Latin authors such as Vergil and Livy also became part of the curriculum.[505] The rhetor was a teacher of oratory or public speaking. The art of speaking (ars dicendi) was highly prized as a marker of social and intellectual superiority, and eloquentia (\"speaking ability, eloquence\") was considered the \"glue\" of a civilized society.[506] Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge (though it required a command of references to the literary canon[507]) as it was a mode of expression and decorum that distinguished those who held social power.[508] The ancient model of rhetorical trainingâ\"restraint, coolness under pressure, modesty, and good humour\"[509]âendured into the 18th century as a Western educational ideal.[510]",
