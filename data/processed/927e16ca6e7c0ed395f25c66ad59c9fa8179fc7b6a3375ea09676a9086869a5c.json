LÃ¤ffler (1907) suggested that the location is to be read ÎÏá½¡Î¼Î· which was the name of a town in Thessaly and a stronghold in Messenia, also called Îá½¡Î¼Î·.[126] BÃ¡ulfr is described as being Ã¾rÃ³ttar Ã¾egn or a thegn of strength. The term thegn describes a class of retainer. The phrase Ã¾rÃ³ttar Ã¾egn is used on six other runestones,[127] SÃ¶ 90 in LÃ¶vhulta, SÃ¶ 112 in Kolunda, SÃ¶ 151 in LÃ¶vsund, and SÃ¶ 158 in Ãsterberga, and, in its plural form at SÃ¶ 367 in SlÃ¤bro and SÃ¶ Fv1948;295 in PrÃ¤stgÃ¥rden.",
