In Test cricket, George Lohmann is listed as having the superior average by each of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, ESPNcricinfo and CricketArchive. Though all three use different restrictions, Lohmann's average of 10.75 is considered the best.[1][7][8] If no qualification criteria were applied at all, three playersâWilf Barber, A. N. Hornby and Bruce Murrayâwould tie for the best average, all having claimed just one wicket in Test matches, without conceding any runs, thus averaging zero.[15]",
