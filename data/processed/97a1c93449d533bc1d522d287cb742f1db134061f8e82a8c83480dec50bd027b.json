				"after": "After the birth of his only daughter, Jim Hogg wrote to his brother, \"Our cup of joy is now overflowing! We have a daughter of as fine proportions and of as angelic mien as ever gracious nature favor a man with, and her name is Ima!\"[3] Ima Hogg had no middle name, which was unusual for the time.[4] Her first name was taken from her uncle Thomas Hogg's epic Civil War poem The Fate of Marvin, which featured two young women named Ima and Leila.[4][5][6] According to Virginia Bernhard's biography of Ima Hogg, \"there are some who believe that James Stephen Hogg ... named his only daughter Ima Hogg to attract the attention of Texas voters\" in a year when he was running in a close race for district attorney of the Seventh District in Texas,[3] which he won.[7][8] Alternatively, correspondence from Jim Hogg indicates he may not have been conscious of the combined effect of his daughter's first and last names.[9]",
