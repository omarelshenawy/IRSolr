				"The English name Nile and the Arabic names en-NÃ®l and an-NÃ®l both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek ÎÎµá¿Î»Î¿Ï.[9][10] Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed.[10][11] One possible etymology derives it from a Semitic Nahal, meaning \"river\".[12] The standard English names \"White Nile\" and \"Blue Nile\" to refer to the river's headwaters derive from Arabic names formerly applied only to the Sudanese stretches which meet at Khartoum.[10]"

				"after": "Above Khartoum the Nile is also known as the White Nile, a term also used in a limited sense to describe the section between Lake No and Khartoum. At Khartoum the river is joined by the Blue Nile. The White Nile starts in equatorial East Africa, and the Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia. Both branches are on the western flanks of the East African Rift.",
