Flights of aircraft belonging to the Pacific Fleet were suspended pending an investigation into the crash.[41] There was no indication that the crew made use of emergency equipment, although a lifeboat on board the plane was fitted with a device that transmits a signal in the event of an accident.[42] Chief of the General Staff Nikolay Makarov believed an engine failure could have caused the crash.[43] A memorial service was held for the crew on 16 December 2009.[44] A search for the bodies of the eleven crew members was suspended several times due to ice floes and bad weather, and was planned to be resumed on 28 May 2010.[45]",
