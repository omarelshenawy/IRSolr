				"Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 â August 16, 1977), was an American singer, musician and actor. He is a cultural icon, often known as \"The King of Rock 'n' Roll\", or simply \"The King\".",
				"Presley began his career as one of the first performers of rockabilly, an uptempo fusion of country and rhythm and blues with a strong back beat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing \"black\" and \"white\" sounds, made him popularâand controversialâas did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like \"Hound Dog\" and \"Jailhouse Rock\" later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop. To date, he is the only performer to have been inducted into four music halls of fame."
