				"after": "The ASM-135 missile was designed to be a standoff anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, with the F-15 acting as a first stage. The Soviet Union could correlate a U.S. rocket launch with a spy satellite loss, but an F-15 carrying an ASAT would blend in among hundreds of F-15 flights. From January 1984 to September 1986, two F-15As were used as launch platforms for the ASAT missile. The F-15As were modified to carry one ASM-135 on the centerline station with extra equipment within a special centerline pylon.[59][60] The launch aircraft executed a Mach 1.22, 3.8 g climb at 65Â° to release the ASAT missile at an altitude of 38,100Â ft (11,600Â m).[61][62] The flight computer was updated to control the zoom-climb and missile release.",
