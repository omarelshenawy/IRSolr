Though she is hurt when he rejects her, Mercedes is supportive when he confides his sexuality, and they become close friends.[2] Mercedes has a rivalry with glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), which comes to a head in the episode \"Sectionals\", when she impresses the club with a rendition of \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\". Rachel agrees that Mercedes should perform the solo competitively, but she loses the chance when a rival school steals the song.[3]",
