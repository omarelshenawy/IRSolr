The stress pattern is usually counted as one-two-three-one-two-one-two-three. This kind of time signature is commonly used to notate folk and non-Western types of music. In classical music, BÃ©la BartÃ³k and Olivier Messiaen have used such time signatures in their works. The first movement of Maurice Ravel's Piano Trio in A Minor is written in 8 8, in which the beats are likewise subdivided into 3 + 2 + 3 to reflect Basque dance rhythms.",
