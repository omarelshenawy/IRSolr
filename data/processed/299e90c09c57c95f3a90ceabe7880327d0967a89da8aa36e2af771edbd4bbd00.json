				"after": "In Han Dynasty (202 BCâ220 AD) China, the Yuejue Shu (è¶çµæ¸) written in 52 AD is considered by modern sinologists and historians to be the prototype of the gazetteer (Chinese: difangzhi), as it contained essays on a wide variety of subjects including changes in territorial division, the founding of cities, local products, and customs.[25] However, the first gazetteer proper is considered to be the Chronicles of Huayang by Chang Qu å¸¸ç©. There are over 8,000 gazetteers of pre-modern China that have survived.[26][27][28] Gazetteers became more common in the Song Dynasty (960â1279), yet the bulk of surviving gazetteers were written during the Ming Dynasty (1368â1644) and Qing Dynasty (1644â1912).[26] Modern scholar Liu Weiyi notes that just under 400 gazetteers were compiled in the era between the fall of the Han Dynasty in 220 and the Tang Dynasty (618â907).[29] Gazetteers from this era focused on boundaries and territory, place names, mountains and rivers, ancient sites, local products, local myths and legends, customs, botany, topography, and locations of palaces, streets, temples, etc.[30] By the Tang Dynasty the gazetteer became much more geographically specific, with a broad amount of content arranged topically; for example, there would be individual sections devoted to local astronomy, schools, dikes, canals, post stations, altars, local deities, temples, tombs, etc.[31] By the Song Dynasty it became more common for gazetteers to provide biographies of local celebrities, accounts of elite local families, bibliographies, and literary anthologies of poems and essays dedicated to famous local spots.[29][32] Song gazetteers also made lists and descriptions of city walls, gate names, wards and markets, districts, population size, and residences of former prefects.[33]",
