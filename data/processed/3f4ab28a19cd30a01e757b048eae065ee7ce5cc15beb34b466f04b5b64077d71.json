				"previous": "On 10 June, Vietnam Airlines became a full member following a joining ceremony held in Hanoi.[56][57] The airline became the first SkyTeam carrier from Southeast Asia, where Star Alliance has a strong presence through Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways International. With an extra 20 unique destinations added to SkyTeam's route map, Vietnam Airlines helped to strengthen the alliance's foothold in the region.[56]",
				"after": "On 22 June, the CEOs and chairmen of the 13 member airlines gathered in New York to celebrate the alliance's 10th anniversary.[58] During its first decade of operation, the world's second largest airline alliance more than tripled its membership, doubled its flights and nearly doubled its destinations.[59] On the same day, SkyTeam announced that it had renewed its membership program, thereby upgrading Air Europa, Kenya Airways and TAROM statuses from associate to full members.[60] During the ceremony, the Board outlined its plans to recruit members from Latin America, South America and India.[59] Three days later, TAROM officially became the 13th SkyTeam member.[61] As a part of the celebration, SkyTeam offered reductions of round-the-world fares[62] and other promotions. Following the 10th anniversary, SkyTeam intended to enhance customers' travel experience and deepen cooperation among its members to supplement the expansion into regions that are yet to have SkyTeam members.[63]",
