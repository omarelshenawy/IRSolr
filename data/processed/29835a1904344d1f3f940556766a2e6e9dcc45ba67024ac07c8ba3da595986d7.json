				"previous": "The UK service sector makes up around 73% of GDP.[205] London is one of the three \"command centres\" of the global economy (alongside New York City and Tokyo),[206] it is the world's largest financial centre alongside New York,[207][208][209] and it has the largest city GDP in Europe.[210] Edinburgh is also one of the largest financial centres in Europe.[211] Tourism is very important to the British economy and, with over 27Â million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world and London has the most international visitors of any city in the world.[212][213] The creative industries accounted for 7% GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6% per annum between 1997 and 2005.[214]",
				"after": "The Industrial Revolution started in the UK with an initial concentration on the textile industry,[215] followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding, coal mining and steelmaking.[216][217] British merchants, shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century.[218][219] As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7% of national output in 2003.[220]",
