				"after": "The USGS and the water bureau operate a stream gauge at RMÂ 4.7 (RKÂ 7.6), which is 1.8 miles (2.9Â km) downstream from Bull Run Reservoir 2 and the water system intake. Measurements are for the river only and do not include water diverted upstream of the gauge to the city water supply or to a former power plant. The maximum flow at this station was 24,800 cubic feet per second (700Â m3/s) on December 22, 1964, and the minimum flow was 1.1 cubic feet per second (0.031Â m3/s) on October 4, 1974. The drainage area above this gauge is 107 square miles (280Â km2), about 77Â percent of the whole watershed.[11] The maximum flow occurred during the floods of December 1964 and January 1965, rated by the National Weather Service as one of Oregon's top 10 weather events of the 20thÂ century.[12]",
