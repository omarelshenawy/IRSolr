McCullough and built in 1931, it is \"one of the most notable bridges in the Pacific Northwest\".[102] Named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1982 by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the 1,898-foot (579Â m) structure was the first in the U.S. to use the Freyssinet method of stress control in concrete bridges. It features 7 open-spandrel 230-foot (70Â m) arch spans, 18 deck-girder approach spans, and many ornate decorative features such as Art Deco entrance pylons.[102]",
