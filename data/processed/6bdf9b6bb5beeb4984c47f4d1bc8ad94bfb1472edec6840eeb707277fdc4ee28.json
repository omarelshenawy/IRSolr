				"previous": "The English word wheel comes from the Old English word hweol, hweogol, from Proto-Germanic *hwehwlan, *hwegwlan, from Proto-Indo-European *kwekwlo-,[1] an extended form of the root *kwel- \"to revolve, move around\". Cognates within Indo-European include Icelandic hjÃ³l \"wheel, tyre\", Greek ÎºÏÎºÎ»Î¿Ï kÃºklos, and Sanskrit chakra, the latter both meaning \"circle\" or \"wheel\".[2]",
				"after": "Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears from the second half of the 4th millennium BC, near-simultaneously in Mesopotamia (Sumerian civilization), the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe, so that the question of which culture originally invented the wheeled vehicle is still unsolved.",
