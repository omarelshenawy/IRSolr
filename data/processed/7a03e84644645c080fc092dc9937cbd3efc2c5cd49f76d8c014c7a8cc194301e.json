				"previous": "Scottish Gaelic should not be confused with Scots, the English-derived language varieties which had come to be spoken in most of the Lowlands of Scotland by the early modern era. Prior to the 15th century, these dialects were known as Inglis (\"English\") by its own speakers, with Gaelic being called Scottis (\"Scottish\"). From the late 15th century, however, it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as Erse (\"Irish\") and the Lowland vernacular as Scottis.[11] Today, Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish, so the word Erse in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used[citation needed].",
				"after": "The traditional view was that Gaelic language was brought to Scotland, probably in the 4th century, by settlers from Ireland, who founded the Gaelic kingdom of DÃ¡l Riata on Scotland's west coast.[12][13] This is based mostly on medieval writings from the 9th and 10th centuries. However, this view is no longer universally accepted. Archeologists say there is no archeological or placename evidence for a migration or invasion.[14] In his academic paper Were the Scots Irish?, archeologist Ewan Campbell suggests that in the \"maritime province\" of northern Ireland and western Scotland, \"sea communications dominated, and allowed a shared archaic language to be maintained, isolated from linguistic developments which were taking place [...] east of the Highland massif\".[14]",
