On 4 May 2009, EADS and Lockheed Martin announced a teaming agreement for the 645.[21][22] Three demonstrator AAS-72X aircraft were built and began flight testing in late 2010.[23] In September 2012, EADS began voluntary flight demonstrations of both an AAS-72X and an EC145 T2 at high altitudes, reportedly meeting with performance requirements.[24][25] Two versions were offered: the AAS-72X, an armed version of the UH-72; and the AAS-72X+, an armed militarized version of the EC-145T2.[26] In late 2013, the U.S. Army announced the termination of the AAS program.[27]",
