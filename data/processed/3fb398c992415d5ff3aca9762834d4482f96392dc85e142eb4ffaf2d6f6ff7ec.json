				"after": "A bijection f with domain X (\"functionally\" indicated by f: X â Y) also defines a relation starting in Y and going to X (by turning the arrows around). The process of \"turning the arrows around\" for an arbitrary function does not usually yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain Y. Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse function is a surjection and an injection, that is, the inverse function exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be invertible. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.",
