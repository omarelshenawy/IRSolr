				"previous": "The presence of the isotope plutonium-240 in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential, as plutonium-240 has a relatively high spontaneous fission rate (~440 fissions per second per gramâover 1,000 neutrons per second per gram),[16] raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of predetonation.[17] Plutonium is identified as either weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade based on the percentage of plutonium-240 that it contains. Weapons-grade plutonium contains less than 7% plutonium-240. Fuel-grade plutonium contains from 7% to less than 19%, and power reactor-grade contains 19% or more plutonium-240. Supergrade plutonium, with less than 4% of plutonium-240, is used in U.S. Navy weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews, due to its lower radioactivity.[18] The isotope plutonium-238 is not fissile but can undergo nuclear fission easily with fast neutrons as well as alpha decay.[5]",
				"after": "Twenty radioactive isotopes of plutonium have been characterized. The longest-lived are plutonium-244, with a half-life of 80.8Â million years, plutonium-242, with a half-life of 373,300Â years, and plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,110Â years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 7,000Â years. This element also has eight metastable states, though all have half-lives less than one second.[4]",
