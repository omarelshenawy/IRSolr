				"after": "An example of how theories are models can be seen from Ptolemy's theory on the planetary system. In this model, the Earth was at the center, the planets and the sun made circular orbits around the earth, and the stars were fixed on a sphere centered on Earth but beyond the planetary orbits. The retrograde motion of the planets was explained by smaller circular orbits of individual planets. Based on this model, mathematical calculations could be made that predicted planetary positions to a great degree of accuracy. His model of the planetary system survived for over 1500 years, until the time of Copernicus.",
