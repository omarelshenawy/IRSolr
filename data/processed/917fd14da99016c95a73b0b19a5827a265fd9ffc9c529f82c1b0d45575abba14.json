				"after": "Although Italian Renaissance had a modest impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was influential in broadening the European worldview,[93] stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology including Pedro Nunes, JoÃ£o de Castro, Abraham Zacuto and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, EstÃªvÃ£o Gomes and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances to help mapping the world. Apothecary TomÃ© Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and CristÃ³vÃ£o da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.",
