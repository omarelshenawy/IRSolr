The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 12th century BC, and its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era.[27] In the 2nd century BC, Wiman Joseon which fell to the Han China near the end of the century. Later the Han Dynasty defeated the Wiman Joseon and set up Four Commanderies of Han in 108 BC. There was a significant Chinese presence in northern parts of the Korean peninsula during the next century, and the Lelang Commandery persisted for about 400 years until it was conquered by Goguryeo.[28] After many conflicts with the Chinese Han Dynasty, Gojoseon disintegrated, leading to the ProtoâThree Kingdoms of Korea period.",
