				"previous": "Today, the rebounding of bog turtle colonies depends on private intervention.[56] Population monitoring involves meticulous land surveys over vast countrysides.[57] In addition to surveying land visually, remote sensing has been used to biologically classify a wetland as either suitable or unsuitable for a bog turtle colony. This allows for comparisons to be made between known areas of bog turtle success and potential areas of future habitation.[58]",
				"after": "To help the existing colonies rebound, several private projects have been initiated in an attempt to limit the encroachment of overshadowing trees and bushes, the construction of new highways and neighborhoods, and other natural and man-made threats.[7]",
