				"previous": "In 2012 an agreement was reached with Air France to wet lease (ACMI or Aircraft Crew Maintenance and Insurance) 2 surplus Airbus A340-300 for a long term period. The first aircraft (F-GLZL) was delivered in April 2012 and is operated with an Air France crew, the second aircraft (5R-EAA) arrived in July 2012 and is operated with a domestic crew. Despite being 14 and 12 years old respectively and with a questionable fuel efficiency these aircraft will permit Air Madagascar to resume flights to Europe under its own colors and with a better service.[28]",
