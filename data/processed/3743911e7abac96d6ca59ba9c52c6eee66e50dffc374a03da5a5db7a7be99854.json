It was paid for \"by voluntary contributions from employees, retirees and Delta's community partners.\" The effort, called Project 767, was spearheaded by three Delta flight attendants to show the employees' appreciation to Delta for \"solid management and strong leadership during the first years following airline deregulation.\"[citation needed] The aircraft was repainted in a commemorative paint scheme and toured the country to celebrate the airline's 75th anniversary in 2004.[4] The airplane remained the flagship of the Delta fleet until March 2006, when it was replaced with a 777-200 Delta Spirit as the flagship and donated by Delta on March 3, 2006 after a farewell tour around the United States.",
