				"previous": "Davenport's marriage had failed by 1909, and he suffered a breakdown that year, related to his ongoing divorce case. As he recovered, he announced a forthcoming series to be available for license to newspapers, \"Men I have sketched\". This project was aborted when, in 1911, Davenport was invited by Hearst to return to the American.[64] He was on assignment for the American on April 19, 1912, when he met the RMS Carpathia at the docks in New York to draw the survivors of the RMS Titanic. He drew three cartoons, but upon leaving his office was in a \"highly nervous state\".[65] That evening he fell ill at the apartment of a friend, Mrs. William Cochran, a medium and spiritualist. Diagnosed with pneumonia, he died in her home two weeks later, on May 2, 1912.[65] Hearst paid for eight doctors to treat Davenport, and later for an elaborate funeralâthe publisher had Davenport's body returned to his beloved Silverton for burial. Addison Bennett of The Oregonian wrote, \"Yes, Homer has come home for the last time, home to wander again never\".[66]",
