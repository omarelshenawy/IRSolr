				"previous": "For the Earth, MÂ =Â 5.9742Â ÃÂ 1024Â kg, meaning that mÂ =Â 4.4354Â ÃÂ 10â3Â m. When standing on the north pole, we can assume (meaning that we are neither moving up or down or along the surface of the Earth). In this case, the Schwarzschild solution proper time equation becomes . Then using the polar radius of the Earth as the radial coordinate (or meters), we find that",
				"after": "This should have been the same as the previous result, but as noted above the Earth is not spherical as assumed by the Schwarzschild solution. Even so this demonstrates how the proper time equation is used.",
