				"previous": "Shortly before his death, Henry V named his brother John, Duke of Bedford, regent of France in the name of his son Henry VI, then only a few months old. Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the Treaty of Troyes, because ironically, the sickly Charles VI, to whom he had been named heir, survived him by two months. Henry's comrade-in-arms and Lord Steward John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley brought the body of King Henry home to England and bore the royal standard at his funeral.[23] Henry V was buried in Westminster Abbey on 7 November 1422.",
				"after": "As Prince of Wales, Henry's arms were those of the kingdom, differenced by a label argent of three points.[24] Upon his accession, he inherited use of the arms of the kingdom undifferenced.",
