				"after": "Foot binding is the process in which the arch of a woman's feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch.[18] These \"fists of flesh\" were seen as attractive and arousing for men and the practice was passed down as a prerequisite to marriage from mother to daughter across generations.[18] Special shoes were made to accentuate the small size of the women's feet.[18] This process was painful and often confined women to their rooms.[18] Few lower class women were able to have their feet bound because they needed to be able to walk normally to accomplish house work.[18] Bound feet came to be an indication of high class and wealth for women.[18] Chinese male reformers during the imperialism period recognized the liberation of the Chinese women as something necessary for their own sake.[19] The humiliation that China had gone through on an international level was turned on the Chinese âwomenâ.[19] Naturally, the foot binding was recognized as ânational shame,â and people found it as a serious problem to be disappeared, thus raging anti-footbinding campaigns in the 1890s to the 1900s.[19] Moreover, the new government that came in after the 1911 revolution banned foot binding practice.[19] Thus, it started to disappear in the coastal areas in 1900 to 1920.[19] However, the practice was still popular within the interior areas of China till the 1930s and even in the 1950s.[19] The practice has been outlawed multiple times since its inception in the 13th century.[18] It was finally banned as the Communists came to power around 1949.[18]",
