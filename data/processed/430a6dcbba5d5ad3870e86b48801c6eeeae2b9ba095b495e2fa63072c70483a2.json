				"previous": "In the United States, the foot was defined as 12Â inches, with the inch being defined by the Mendenhall Order of 1893 by 39.37Â inchesÂ = 1Â m. In Imperial units, the foot was defined as 1â3Â yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter). The yard standards of the different Commonwealth countries were periodically compared with one another.[12] The value of the United Kingdom primary standard of the yard was determined in terms of the meter by the National Physical Laboratory in 1964 as 6999914396900000000â 0.9143969Â m,[13] implying a pre-1959 foot in the UK of 6999304799000000000â 0.3047990Â m.",
				"after": "In 1799 the meter became the official unit of length in France. This was not fully enforced, and in 1812 Napoleon introduced the system of mesures usuelles which restored the traditional French measurements in the retail trade, but redefined them in terms of metric units. The foot, or pied metrique, was defined as one third of a meter. This unit continued in use until 1837.[15]",
