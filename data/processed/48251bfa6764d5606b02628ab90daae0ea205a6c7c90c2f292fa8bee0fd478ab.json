				"after": "Incoybe saliceticola produces mushrooms with caps of between 7 and 40 millimetres (0.28 and 1.57Â in) in diameter. The shape of the cap varies, depending on the age of the mushroom. In younger specimens, they are conical or nearly so, but as the mushroom matures, the caps flatten into a more convex or flat shape. As such, the height of the cap varies from 4 to 11 millimetres (0.16 to 0.43Â in). The cap features an umbo that is usually very prominent. Around the umbo, the cap surface is smooth, but towards the cap margin, the surface is defined by fibrils running from the margin towards the umbo. The cap sometimes splits along these. The cap's colour varies from yellow-brown to pale brown, and is palest at the margins. The umbo contrasts to this somewhat, being a grey-brown or red-brown. The slender stem measures from 0.7 to 6.2 centimetres (0.3 to 2.4 in) long by 1.5 to 6.5 millimetres (0.059 to 0.256Â in) thick. It thickens slightly towards the base, where it joins a large, well-defined \"bulb\" that can be up to 11 millimetres (0.43Â in) across. Shallow grooves run up the surface of the stem, which is covered in a fine white powder.[4] In one case, however, an atypical specimen was recovered with an almost completely smooth stem, free of striations or powder.[5] The stem varies in colour, with whitish, pale yellow-brown, pale red-brown, pale brown and grey-brown all observed, while the base is white. No veil or ring is visible.[4]",
