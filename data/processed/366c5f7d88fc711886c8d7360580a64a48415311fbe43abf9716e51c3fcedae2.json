				"previous": "ULA released contract values to the public and CEO Tory Bruno testified before Congress in March of 2015, to \"correct these misconceptions\".[citation needed] The $11B frequently referred to by SpaceX as covering the cost of 36 cores (28 missions) is incomplete and includes launch costs for another 50 missions. The actual contract structure is for a manufacturing contract of $6.4B to build 50 rockets, a second manufacturing contract to build another 28 rockets, and a third launch contract of $6.9B to fly all 78. The actual average cost of flying ULA's fleet of 15 different rocket types across this window is $225M ($17.6B/78), with the least expensive at $164M, an Atlas V 401 rocket roughly equivalent to a Falcon F9.1, and the most expensive at $400M for the Delta IV Heavy.",
