				"after": "Ficus obliqua is an elegant shade tree for parks or fields, and is adaptable to differing soils.[10] A notable specimen in Mick Ryan Park, Milton on the New South Wales south coast stands 14Â m (46Â ft) tall and 38Â m (124Â ft) across,[28] and is a local landmark.[29] Like other fig species that grow into large trees, Ficus obliqua is not suitable for any but the largest gardens as its aggressive root system invades drains and garden beds. Fig trees also drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.[10] Although it is much less used in bonsai than F. rubiginosa,[30] F. obliqua is well-suited for use in the medium; its small leaves and trunk's propensity to thicken give it attributes optimal for a tree 10â80Â cm (4â32Â in) in height. It is seen in bonsai nurseries mainly in the Brisbane area, where it is a locally common species, and is very highly regarded by at least one proponent, Bradley Barlow.[31][32] Barlow entered a specimen from Brisbane to the Bonsai Clubs International competition in 2006, winning a prize.[33] It is also suited for use as an indoor plant in low-, medium- or brightly lit indoor spaces.[34] The timber is too soft for use in woodworking.[10]",
