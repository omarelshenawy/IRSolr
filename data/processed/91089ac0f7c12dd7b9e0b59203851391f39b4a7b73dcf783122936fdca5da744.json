				"previous": "Whereas the staircases on the first three quadrangles are marked with Arabic numerals, the Island site is marked with Roman numerals. Both sites have the numbering running anticlockwise around each quadrangle and there are two staircase eighteens â Mary Quad's staircase numbering finishes at 18 and O'Brien Quad's staircase numbering begins with XVIII.",
				"after": "Bordered by the Cowley Road, this site was formerly Nazareth House, a residential care home convent â Goldie Wing (shown left) and Larmenier House are its surviving buildings. Nazareth House itself was demolished to make room for two purpose-built halls of residence, James Mellon Hall (shown right) and David Paterson House. The two new halls were opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 November 2000.[31]",
