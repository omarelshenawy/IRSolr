				"In late 2014, JP Morgan estimated \"iPhone percentage of the worldwide smartphone install base has been around 15% since late 2012\"[23] being far behind the dominant Android-based smartphones. In a few mature markets countries such as; Japan, the iPhone has a majority, an exception to Android's dominance,[24] and Australia where Android is rapidly approaching parity. In March 2014, sales of the iPhone brand had reached 500 million devices.[25] In the last quarter of 2014, there were 74.5 million iPhones sold, a record, compared to 51.0 million in the last quarter of 2013.[26] Tim Cook revealed at the Apple Watch conference on March 9, 2015 that Apple had sold a total of 700 million iPhones to date.[1]"
