				"after": "The quagga was the first extinct animal to have its DNA analysed,[18] and this 1984 study launched the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was more closely related to zebras than to horses,[19] with the quagga and mountain zebra (Equus zebra) sharing an ancestor 3â4 million years ago.[18] An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra.[20] A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.[21]",
