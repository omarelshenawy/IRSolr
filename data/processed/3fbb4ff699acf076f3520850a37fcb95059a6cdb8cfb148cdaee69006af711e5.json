				"previous": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists more than a third of primates as critically endangered or vulnerable. Trade is regulated, as all species are listed by CITES in Appendix II, except 50 species and subspecies listed in Appendix I, which gain full protection from trade.[166][167] Common threats to primate species include deforestation, forest fragmentation, monkey drives (resulting from primate crop raiding),[168] and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropical forest clearing is widely regarded as the process that most threatens primates.[169][170][171] More than 90% of primate species occur in tropical forests.[170][172] The main cause of forest loss is clearing for agriculture, although commercial logging, subsistence harvesting of timber, mining, and dam construction also contribute to tropical forest destruction.[172] In Indonesia large areas of lowland forest have been cleared to increase palm oil production, and one analysis of satellite imagery concluded that during 1998 and 1999 there was a loss of 1,000 Sumatran orangutans per year in the Leuser Ecosystem alone.[173]",
				"after": "Primates with a large body size (over 5Â kg) are at increased extinction risk due to their greater profitability to poachers compared to smaller primates.[172] They reach sexual maturity later and have a longer period between births. Populations therefore recover more slowly after being depleted by poaching or the pet trade.[174] Data for some African cities show that half of all protein consumed in urban areas comes from the bushmeat trade.[175] Endangered primates such as guenons and the drill are hunted at levels that far exceed sustainable levels.[175] This is due to their large body size, ease of transport and profitability per animal.[175] As farming encroaches on forest habitats, primates feed on the crops, causing the farmers large economic losses.[176] Primate crop raiding gives locals a negative impression of primates, hindering conservation efforts.[177]",
