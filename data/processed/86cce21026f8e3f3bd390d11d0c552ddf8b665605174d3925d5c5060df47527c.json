				"previous": "Nearly all biplane aircraft have their upper and lower planes connected by interplane struts, which divide the wings into bays braced by diagonal wires. The wires that run outward from the upper to the lower planes resist the distortion on the bay under gravity and are termed landing wires; those from the lower plane outwards to the upper (lift or flying wires) resist bay distortion under the aerodynamic lifting force. The resulting combination of struts and wires is a quite rigid, box girder-like structure independent of its fuselage mountings.",
