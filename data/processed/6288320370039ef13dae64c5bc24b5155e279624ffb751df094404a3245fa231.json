The center image depicts the expansive \"garden\" landscape which gives the triptych its name. The panel shares a common horizon with the left wing, suggesting a spatial connection between the two scenes.[32] The garden is teeming with male and female nudes, together with a variety of animals, plants and fruit.[33] The setting is not the paradise shown in the left panel, but neither is it based in the terrestrial realm.[34] Fantastic creatures mingle with the real; otherwise ordinary fruits appear engorged to a gigantic size. The figures are engaged in diverse amorous sports and activities, both in couples and in groups. Gibson describes them as behaving \"overtly and without shame\",[35] while art historian Laurinda Dixon writes that the human figures exhibit \"a certain adolescent sexual curiosity\".[23]",
