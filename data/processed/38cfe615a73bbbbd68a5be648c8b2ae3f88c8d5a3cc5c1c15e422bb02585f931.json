				"after": "December to Dismember (2006) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment and starring their ECW brand. It took place on December 3 2006 at the James Brown Arena in Augusta, Georgia. Its name is derived from the December to Dismember event held by the original Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1995. The main event was an Extreme Elimination Chamber match for the ECW World Championship. The six participants were defending Champion The Big Show (pictured), Bobby Lashley, Rob Van Dam, Hardcore Holly, CM Punk and Test, and the match was eventually won by Lashley who last eliminated the Big Show after spearing him. The main match on the undercard was a tag team bout between The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) and MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro), which was won by The Hardys. The pay-per-view had the lowest buyrate in WWE history, with only 90,000 people ordering the event. Although it was scheduled to be held again in 2007, the show was canceled after all pay-per-view events became tri-branded, which would have meant there would be pay-per-view events with the entire roster on two consecutive weeks.",
