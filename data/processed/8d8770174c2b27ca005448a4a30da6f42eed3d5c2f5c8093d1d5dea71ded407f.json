Fenrir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, Fenrir is the father of the wolves SkÃ¶ll and Hati HrÃ³Ã°vitnisson, is a son of Loki, and is foretold to kill the god Odin during the events of RagnarÃ¶k, but will in turn be killed by Odin's son VÃ­Ã°arr.",
