				"after": "The Western dialect is not clearly distinct from general Canadian, General American, or Midland American English. Like most Canadian dialects and innovative General American, /É/ allophones remain back and may be either rounded or unrounded due to a merger between /É/ and /ÉË/ (commonly represented in conservative General American, respectively, as [É]Â ( listen) and [É]Â ( listen)), so that words like cot and caught are perfect homophones (except in San Francisco). In the West, there is less Canadian raising of the /aÊ/ diphthong than in Canada, but, like Canadian, northern General American, and New England English, widespread raising of the /aÉª/ diphthong. A minority of Western speakers have the pinâpen merger, commonly recognized in the U.S. as a Southern characteristic.",
