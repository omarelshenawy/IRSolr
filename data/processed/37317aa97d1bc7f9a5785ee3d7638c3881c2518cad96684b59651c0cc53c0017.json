				"previous": "By June 1948 the SSEM had been built and was working.[20] It was 17 feet (5.2Â m) in length, 7Â feet 4Â inches (2.24Â m) tall, and weighed almost 1 long ton (1.0Â t). The machine contained 550Â valvesÂ â 300Â diodes and 250Â pentodesÂ â and had a power consumption of 3500Â watts.[24] The arithmetic unit was built using EF50 pentode valves, which had been widely used during wartime.[21] The SSEM used one Williams tube to provide 32 by 32-bit words of random-access memory (RAM), a second to hold a 32-bit accumulator in which the intermediate results of a calculation could be stored temporarily, and a third to hold the current program instruction along with its address in memory. A fourth CRT, without the storage electronics of the other three, was used as the output device, able to display the bit pattern of any selected storage tube.[25]",
				"after": "Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain either a program instruction or data. In a program instruction, bits 0â12 represented the memory address of the operand to be used, and bits 13â15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16Â bits were unused.[25] The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only the address of the data in memory.",
