				"previous": "A total of 81 747-300 series aircraft were delivered, 56 for passenger use, 21 â300M and 4 â300SR versions.[145] In 1985, just two years after the â300 entered service, the type was superseded by the announcement of the more advanced 747-400.[146] The last 747-300 was delivered in September 1990 to Sabena.[74][147] While some â300 customers continued operating the type, several large carriers replaced their 747-300s with 747-400s. Air France, Air India, Pakistan International Airlines, and Qantas were some of the last major carriers to operate the 747-300. On December 29, 2008, Qantas flew its last scheduled 747-300 service, operating from Melbourne to Los Angeles via Auckland.[148]",
				"after": "The 747-400 is an improved model with increased range. It has wingtip extensions of 6Â ft (1.8Â m) and winglets of 6Â ft (1.8Â m), which improve the type's fuel efficiency by four percent compared to previous 747 versions.[149] The 747-400 introduced a new glass cockpit designed for a flight crew of two instead of three, with a reduction in the number of dials, gauges and knobs from 971 to 365 through the use of electronics. The type also features tail fuel tanks, revised engines, and a new interior. The longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops, such as Anchorage.[150] Powerplants include the Pratt & Whitney PW4062, General Electric CF6-80C2, and Rolls-Royce RB211-524.[151]",
