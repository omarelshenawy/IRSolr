The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as Atlantic herring, Atlantic salmon, capelin, and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock, and haddock in the North Atlantic.[41][42][43] Krill and copepods have been recorded as prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters.[44] Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.",
