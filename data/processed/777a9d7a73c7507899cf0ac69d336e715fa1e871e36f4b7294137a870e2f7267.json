				"previous": "The only building completed on the former monastery grounds before World War II currently houses the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The construction of the second building (\"the capital center\"), planned to be built on the site where the Cathedral had once stood, was delayed in the spring of 1938 as the authorities were not satisfied with the submitted design. This building failed to materialize. Some time after demolition, the site where the former cathedral used to be located was transformed into a sport complex, including tennis and volleyball courts. The Refectory (Trapezna) of St. John the Divine was used for changing rooms.",
