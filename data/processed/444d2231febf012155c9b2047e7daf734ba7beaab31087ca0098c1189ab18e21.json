				"after": "Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants.[34] Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804Â ft (1,402 to 4,207Â m), which is more than 9,000Â ft (2,700Â m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems.[35][36] Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000Â ft (2,700Â m).[36] At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline.[36] The region above timberline makes up 25Â percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13Â percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice.[37] The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.[38]",
