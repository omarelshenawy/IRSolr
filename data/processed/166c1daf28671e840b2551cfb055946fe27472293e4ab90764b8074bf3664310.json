				"previous": "While the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes â and into the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS time salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of female-interest products.[24] Starting in 1930, astrologer Evangeline Adams would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays, a description of their problems â and a box-top from sponsor Forhan's toothpaste.[25] The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, backed by a tender violin, \"made him a soul mate to millions of women\"[26] on behalf of the R. J. Reynolds tobacco company, whose cellophane-wrapped Camel cigarettes were \"as fresh as the dew that dawn spills on a field of clover\".[27] The most popular radio-friend of all was M. Sayle Taylor, The Voice Of Experience, though his name was never uttered on air.[27] Women mailed descriptions of the most intimate of relationship problems to The Voice in the tens of thousands per week; sponsors Musterole ointment and Haley's MâO laxative enjoyed sales increases of several hundred percent in just the first month of The Voice Of Experienceââ'âs run.[28]",
				"after": "As the decade progressed, a new genre joined the daytime lineup: serial dramas â soap operas, so named for the products that sponsored them, by way of the ad agencies that actually produced them. Although the form, usually in quarter-hour episodes, proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s, they all had the same basic premise: that characters \"fell into two categories: 1) those in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble. The helping-hand figures were usually older.\"[29] At CBS, Just Plain Bill brought human insight and Anacin pain reliever into households; Your Family and Mine came courtesy of Sealtest Dairy products; Bachelor's Children first hawked Old Dutch Cleanser, then Wonder Bread; Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories was sponsored by Spry Vegetable Shortening. Our Gal Sunday (Anacin again), The Romance of Helen Trent (AngÃ©lus cosmetics), Big Sister (Rinso laundry soap) and many others filled the daytime ether.[30]",
