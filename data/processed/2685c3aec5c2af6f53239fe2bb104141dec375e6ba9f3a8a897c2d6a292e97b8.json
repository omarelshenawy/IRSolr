				"previous": "To replace its retired DC-8s and L-1011s Hawaiian Airlines leased six DC-10s from American Airlines, who continued to provide maintenance on the aircraft. An agreement with American also included participation in American's SABRE reservation system and participation in American Airlines' AAdvantage frequent flyer program.[23] The DC-10s were subsequently retired between 2002 and 2003.[5] The company replaced these leased DC-10s with 14 leased Boeing 767 aircraft during a the fleet modernization program that also replaced its DC-9s with new Boeing 717 aircraft. The Boeing aircraft featured an updated rendition of the company's \"Pualani\" tail art, which had appeared on its Douglas aircraft since the 1970s.",
