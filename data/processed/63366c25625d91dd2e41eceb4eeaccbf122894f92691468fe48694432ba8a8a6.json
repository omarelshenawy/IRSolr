The five-story building, as pictured in the monochrome postcard above, could not cater adequately to the several thousand students, leading the New York City Board of Education to secure an agreement with the Battery Park City Authority for a new building, and construction began in 1989. The new ten-floor building, located near lower Manhattan's Financial District was designed by Cooper, Robertson & Partners and has been in use since the 1992-1993 school year.",
