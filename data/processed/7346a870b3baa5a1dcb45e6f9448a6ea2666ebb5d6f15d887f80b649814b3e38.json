The Willow Creek and Hillsboro transit centers (TC) are the main hubs of the public transit system, although seven other MAX stations provide varying degrees of bus interconnection. MAX Stations (west to east) are the Hatfield Government Center, Hillsboro Central TC, Tuality Hospital, Washington/Southeast 12th Avenue, Fair Complex / Hillsboro Airport, Hawthorn Farm, Orenco, Quatama, and Willow Creek TC. Located next to the Tuality Hospital station is the Hillsboro Intermodal Transit Facility, which opened in 2010 and was jointly paid for by the hospital, Pacific University, and the city.[140] The facility is primarily a parking garage, but includes lockers and showers for bicyclists along with electric vehicle charging stations.[141]",
