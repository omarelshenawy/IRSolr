				"after": "Dublin is situated at the mouth of the River Liffey and encompasses a land area of approximately 44 sq mi, or 115Â km2, in east-central Ireland. It is bordered by a low mountain range to the south and surrounded by flat farmland to the north and west.[30] The Liffey divides the city in two between the Northside and the Southside. Each of these is further divided by two lesser riversÂ â the River Tolka running southeast into Dubin Bay, and the River Dodder running northeast to the mouth of the Liffey. Two further water bodiesÂ â the Grand Canal on the southside and the Royal Canal on the northsideÂ â ring the inner city on their way from the west and the River Shannon.",
