Its range spans from Irian Jaya to Port Moresby, and is most abundant on Daru Island. The International Conservation Union (IUCN) suggests \"scattered locations\" in both New Guinea and Indonesia.[1] In Australia its range extends from the Kimberley region of Western Australia through the Northern Territory and Queensland to north and central New South Wales and the extreme northeasterly part of South Australia. Its total extent of land occupancy is approximately 4,078,600 square kilometres (1,574,800Â sqÂ mi).[13]",
