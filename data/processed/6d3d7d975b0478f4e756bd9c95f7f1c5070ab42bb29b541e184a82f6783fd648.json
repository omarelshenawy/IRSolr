				"after": "Critical response for \"Oh Father\" was generally positive. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, commented that with \"Oh Father\", Madonna exposed herself by transforming her personal experience into art, making it clear to anyone how she felt about her relationship with Tony.[11] Rooksby believed that the \"psychobabble\" phrases of feeling good about oneself in the song, would have made it extremely popular in the early Eighties. He added that \"Oh Father\" was the most compassionate and generous moment in Madonna's musical career and the track might have inspired the exploration of childhood in the music of contemporary artists like Kate Bush and Tori Amos, in particular Bush's song \"The Fog\" from her 1989 studio album, The Sensual World, and Amos' \"Winter\" from the 1992 effort, Little Earthquakes.[16] Author Leslie C. Dunn wrote in her book Embodied Voices, that the autobiographical nature of the song brought forth a new side of Madonna.[19] Sharing the same view, Freya Jarman-Ivens, one of the authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, declared \"Oh Father\" as a powerful statement regarding father-daughter relationships.[20] Allen Metz, author of The Madonna Companion, described the song as a \"stark ballad with a serious string arrangement\".[21] O'Brien felt that the strings were dramatic and pretentious. She described Madonna's singing as consisting of \"Courtney Love-style rasp\" and adding that Madonna \"attacks the song with personal passion\".[13]",
