				"after": "According to Sebastian Conrad, proto-globalization is marked with a ârise of national chauvinism, racism, Social Darwinism, and genocidal thinkingâ which came to be with relations to the âestablishment of a world economyâ.[50] Beginning in the 1870s, the global trade cycle started to cement itself so that more nations' economies depended on one another than in any previous era. Domino effects in this new world trade cycle lead to both world wide recessions and world economic booms.[50] Modelski describes the late period of proto-globalization as a \"thick range of global networks extending throughout the world at high speed and covering all components of society\".[51] By the 1750s, Europe, Africa, Asia, and America's contact had grown into a stable multilateral interdependency which was echoed in the modern globalization period.[52]",
