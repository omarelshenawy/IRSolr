				"previous": "In all, seven policemen and at least four workers were killed. Another policeman died two years after the incident from complications related to injuries received on that day.[43] About 60 policemen were wounded in the incident. They were carried, along with some other wounded people, into a nearby police station. Police captain Michael Schaack later wrote that the number of wounded workers was \"largely in excess of that on the side of the police\".[44] The Chicago Herald described a scene of \"wild carnage\" and estimated at least fifty dead or wounded civilians lay in the streets.[45] It is unclear how many civilians were wounded since many were afraid to seek medical attention, fearing arrest. They found aid where they could.[34][46][47]",
