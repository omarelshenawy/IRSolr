				"previous": "In 2008 Adria converted its CRJ1000 NextGen order into 5th CRJ900 and made a loss of â¬3 million again.[18]",
				"after": "In March 2009, Adria Airways has signed a letter of intent with Airbus to purchase a new Airbus A319 aircraft. The management board planned to replace Airbus A320 fleet with new Airbus A319 aircraft. The seating configuration of the aircraft allows for 135 seats, which is economically efficient for the type of service operated by Adria Airways. Two Airbus A320 were sold to Myanmar Airways International in 2009, S5-AAC in October and S5-AAB in December.[4] In November 2009 new headquarters at Ljubljana Airport were opened. A loss of â¬14 million was made in 2009.[19]",
