The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card.[36] Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second.[37] When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.",
