				"after": "The russet sparrow was first scientifically described, as Fringilla rutilans, by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1835, from a specimen collected in Japan.[3] Its specific name comes from the Latin rutilus, \"of a glowing or auburn red\".[18] It has usually been placed in the genus Passer, and within this genus it is seen as a part of the \"Palearctic black-bibbed sparrow\" group, which includes the Eurasian tree sparrow as well as the house sparrow. It has generally been seen as a close relation of the house sparrow, and Richard Meinertzhagen even considered it to be the same species as the Somali sparrow, one of the house sparrow's closest relatives.[3][19]",
