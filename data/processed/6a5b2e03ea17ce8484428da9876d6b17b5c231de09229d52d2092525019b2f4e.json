				"previous": "Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction,[53] evaluation of potential mates,[144] bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories,[53] the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season),[145] and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat.[146] Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers,[147] woodpeckers drum territorially,[67] and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.[148]",
