The campus of the Tuck School sits in a complex on the west side of Dartmouth's campus, near the Connecticut River.[10] Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building facing the Green at the center of the campus;[11] in 1930, the institution moved into Stell, Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall.[9][12][13][14] Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck's 11 academic and administrative buildings.[10]",
