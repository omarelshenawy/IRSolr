				"after": "State Route 22 (SRÂ 22) is a 35.84-mile (57.68Â km) long state highway spanning Yakima and Benton counties in the US state of Washington. Existing since at least 1937, the highway serves to connect several small communities that have been bypassed by Interstate 82 (I-82) / U.S. Route 12 (USÂ 12). Except for the section through Toppenish and the southeastern bypass of Prosser, the highway is lightly traveled passing mainly through rural farmland. The highway parallels a BNSF Railway line for a majority of its route, with the rail line predating the highway by at least 27Â years. Three digit highway numbers in Washington indicate auxiliary routes of their parent route, giving SRÂ 22 five auxiliary routes: SRÂ 220, SRÂ 221, SRÂ 223, SRÂ 224, and SRÂ 225. SRÂ 220 was decommissioned during the 1991 legislative session, and is no longer maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation.",
