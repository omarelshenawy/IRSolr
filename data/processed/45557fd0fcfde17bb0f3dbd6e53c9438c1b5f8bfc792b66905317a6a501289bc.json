				"previous": "A number of isopod groups have evolved a parasitic lifestyle, particularly as external parasites of fish.[9] They can damage or kill their hosts and can cause significant economic loss to commercial fisheries.[16] In reef aquariums, parasitic isopods can become a pest, endangering the fish and possibly injuring the aquarium keeper. Some members of the family Cirolanidae suck the blood of fish, and others, in the family Aegidae, consume the blood, fins, tail and flesh and can kill the fish in the process.[17]",
