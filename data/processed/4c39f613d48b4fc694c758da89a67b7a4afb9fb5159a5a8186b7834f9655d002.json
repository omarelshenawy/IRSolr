In the 1990s Brownhills Town F.C. competed in the Combination but folded during the 2003â04 season.[107] During the 1950s Ogley Hay F.C. were a strong local team, reaching the final of the Walsall Senior Cup on three occasions.[108] Currently, the main football club in the town is Brownhills Community Colts, a youth club which has existed since the 1970s and fields teams in various age groups, as well as teams for children with disabilities.[109][110]",
