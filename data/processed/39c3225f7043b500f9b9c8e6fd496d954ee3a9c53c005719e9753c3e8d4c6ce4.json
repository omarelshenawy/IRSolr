				"previous": "Standard questionnaires ask women whether they have undergone the following: (1) cut, no flesh removed (pricking or symbolic circumcision); (2) cut, some flesh removed; (3) sewn closed; and (4) type not determined/unsure/doesn't know.[35] The most common procedures fall within the \"cut, some flesh removed\" category, and involve complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans.[36]",
			"after": [
				"The WHO has created a more detailed typology, Types IâIII, based on how much tissue is removed; Type III is \"sewn closed.\" Type IV describes symbolic circumcision and miscellaneous procedures.[37]",
				"Type I is subdivided into Ia, removal of the clitoral hood (rarely, if ever, performed alone),[38] and the more common Ib (clitoridectomy), the complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans and clitoral hood.[39] (When discussing FGM, the WHO uses clitoris to refer to the clitoral glans, the visible tip of the clitoris.)[40] Susan Izett and Nahid Toubia write: \"[T]he clitoris is held between the thumb and index finger, pulled out and amputated with one stroke of a sharp object.\"[41]"
