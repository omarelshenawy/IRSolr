				"after": "Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno, an allegory, Handel's first oratorio[53] was composed in Italy in 1707, followed by La resurrezione in 1708 which uses material from the Bible. The circumstances of Esther and its first performance, possibly in 1718, are obscure.[54] Another 12 years had passed when an act of piracy caused him to take up Esther once again.[55] Three earlier performances aroused such interest that they naturally prompted the idea of introducing it to a larger public. Next came Deborah, strongly coloured by the Coronation Anthems[56] and Athaliah, his first English Oratorio.[57] In these three oratorios Handel laid the foundation for the traditional use of the chorus which marks his later oratorios.[58] Handel became sure of himself, broader in his presentation, and more diverse in his composition.[59]",
