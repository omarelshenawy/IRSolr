				"previous": "On Saturday 16 November, the Imperial Family were confined in the palace, surrounded by a cavalry regiment.[181][186] Pedro II continued reading scientific magazines and appeared calm throughout the day.[186] At 3 p.m, Major Frederico SolÃ³n Sampaio Ribeiro informed the Imperial Family that the Republic had been proclaimed and that they must leave the country for exile within 24Â hours.[168][187] The \"republicans had no courage to meet the Emperor, whom they secretly admired, face to face\"[188] and therefore sent low-ranking officers to communicate with him.[168] SolÃ³n, when complimenting the Emperor, called him first \"Your Excellency\", then \"Your Highness\" and lastly \"Your Majesty\".[168][189][190] Although clearly deposed, the Emperor was still much respected by those around him, as illustrated by the parley between him and SolÃ³n.[e][189][191] The notice of banishment caused the women to weep, while the men struggled to remain calmâwith the exception of Pedro II, who remained impassive.[173][181][189][191] The monarch resolved to travel the afternoon of the following day and sent a written message to the Provisional Government stating that he agreed to leave the country.[177][181][182][186][192]",
				"after": "The republican Government feared that demonstrations in favor of the Emperor might erupt on Monday 17 November.[193][194][195][196] The Lieutenant Colonel JoÃ£o Nepomuceno de Medeiros Mallet was sent at dawn to inform the Imperial Family that it must leave immediately.[197] A commotion arose among those present until Pedro II himself appeared in the room. Mallet respectfully told him that the Government had asked them to depart at once. The Emperor refused to leave immediately,[f][194][195][198][199][200] claiming that he was not a slave trying to escape in the middle of the night.[g][h] Mallet tried to persuade him, alleging that republican students would launch violent demonstrations against him. The Emperor seemed skeptical: \"Who gives credence to students?\"[201] At that moment, shots were heard outside. Mallet left the palace to find out what had happened. Fifteen Imperial sailors had attempted to land in support of the Emperor but were overpowered and imprisoned by republican troops. Mallet returned to the building and deceived Pedro II by saying that militant republicans had tried to attack him and his family.[201] Astonished, the Emperor agreed to leave.[201][202][203]",
