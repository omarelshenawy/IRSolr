				"MALÃV Ltd.[1] (Hungarian: MalÃ©v Zrt.), which did business as MALÃV Hungarian Airlines (Hungarian: Magyar LÃ©gikÃ¶zlekedÃ©si VÃ¡llalat, abbreviated MALÃV, pronouncedÂ [ËmÉleËv]), was the flag carrier and principal airline of Hungary between 1946 and 2012. It had its head office in Budapest, with its main operations at Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport. From there, the airline flew to 50 cities in 34 countries worldwide using a fleet of 22 aircraft.

The widespread devastation of World War II forced these airlines to suspend airline service in 1940-44, and they were ultimately replaced by Maszovlet as the national airline after the war. Maszovlet was founded on 29 March 1946, as the Hungarian-Soviet Civil Air Transport Joint Stock Company (Magyar-Szovjet PolgÃ¡ri LÃ©giforgalmi Rt. also known as MASZOVLET). A merge between Malert, Maefort and the Hungarian part of Aeroflot.",
