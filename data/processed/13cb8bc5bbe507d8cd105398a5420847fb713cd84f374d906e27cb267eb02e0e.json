As such, the arts are a physical manifestation of the internal creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature â including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts â among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and cinematography, and visual arts â including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).",
