				"previous": "In 1793, William Godwin, who has often[65] been cited as the first anarchist, wrote Political Justice, which some consider the first expression of anarchism.[66][68] Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present \"necessary evil\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.[66][179] Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.[180][181]",
				"after": "An influential form of individualist anarchism, called \"egoism,\"[182] or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German Max Stirner.[75] Stirner's The Ego and Its Own, published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.[75] According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,[183] without regard for God, state, or morality.[184] To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but \"the individuals are its reality\".[185] Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will,[186] which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state.[187] Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.[188] \"Egoism\" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay.",
