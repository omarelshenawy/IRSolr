Considered the most successful African national team and one of the very few African teams that reached the 9th ranking on the FIFA world ranks, Egypt has only qualified to the FIFA World Cup two times only though. The Egyptian Youth National team \"Young Pharaohs\" won the Bronze Medal of the 2001 FIFA youth world cup in Argentina.",
