				"previous": "Since the end of production, most 757s have remained in service, mainly in the U.S.[50][80] From 2004 to 2008, the average fuel cost for typical mid-range U.S. domestic 757 flights tripled, putting pressure on airlines to improve the fuel efficiency of their fleets.[81] In May 2005, the FAA granted regulatory approval for manufacturer-sanctioned blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated as a retrofit on the 757-200.[82] The winglets improve fuel efficiency by five percent and increase range by 200 nautical miles (370Â km) through the reduction of lift-induced drag.[83][84] Continental Airlines was the first carrier to order winglets for the 757-200, and in February 2009 became the first operator of 757-300s with winglets.[85]",
				"after": "In the 2010s, the 757 has remained the only narrow-body aircraft in use by the large fleets of all three U.S. legacy carriers: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.[4][68] During this period, the 757's capacity and range capabilities have remained largely unequaled among narrow-body airliners;[86] when selecting replacement aircraft, airlines have had to either downsize to smaller single-aisle aircraft in production with fewer seats and less range such as the 737-900ER and A321, or upsize to the larger, longer-range 787 Dreamliner and A330-200 wide-body jets.[68][87] The Tupolev Tu-204, a narrow-body twinjet introduced in 1989 with a design similar to the 757's,[88] is offered in a 200-seat version, which has seen limited production for mainly Russian customers.[89][90] Within Boeing, the 215-seat, 3,200-nautical-mile (5,930Â km) range 737-900ER has been regarded as the closest aircraft in production to the 757-200.[91]",
