				"after": "Christopher Columbus encountered the island of Trinidad on 31 July 1498. Antonio de SedeÃ±o, a Spanish soldier intent on conquering the island of Trinidad, landed on its southwest coast with a small army of men in the 1530s as a means of controlling the Orinoco and subduing the Warao. Sedeno and his men fought the native Carib Indians on many occasions, and subsequently built a fort. Cacique Wannawanare (Guanaguanare) granted the St Joseph area to Domingo de Vera e IbargÃ¼en in 1592, and then withdrew to another part of the island.[13] San JosÃ© de OruÃ±a (St Joseph) was established by Antonio de BerrÃ­o on this land. Sir Walter Raleigh, searching for the long-rumored \"City of Gold\" in South America, arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 and soon attacked San JosÃ© and captured and interrogated de BerrÃ­o, obtaining much information from him and from the cacique Topiawari.",
