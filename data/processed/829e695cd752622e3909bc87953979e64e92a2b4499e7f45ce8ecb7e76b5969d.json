				"previous": "Sexual dimorphism is most pronounced in saddleback populations in which males have more angled and higher front openings, giving a more extreme saddled appearance.[80] Males of all varieties generally have a longer tail and a shorter, concave undershell with thickened knobs at the back edge to facilitate mating. Males are larger than femalesÂ â adult males weigh around 272â317 kilograms (600â699Â lb) while females are 136â181 kilograms (300â399Â lb).[50]",
				"after": "The tortoises are ectothermic (cold-blooded) and therefore bask for 1â2 hours after dawn to absorb the sun's heat through their dark shells before actively foraging for 8â9 hours a day.[46] They travel mostly in the early morning or late afternoon between resting and grazing areas. They have been observed to walk at a speed of 0.3 kilometres per hour (0.2Â mph).[73]",
