				"after": "The airport currently has two terminals, the Main Terminal and the Satellite Terminal accessible by a foot-tunnel from the Main Terminal. It is designed to be extended in a modular approach over the ensuing years in order to accommodate the increase in air travel. These extensions are planned in a six-phase framework. The first (and current) phase allowed the airport to accommodate 16 million passengers per year. However, the airport has been upgraded to handle annual traffic of 21 million passengers without progressing to the next phase thanks to advanced logistics.[4] The sixth phase will allow the airport to accommodate as many as 50 million passengers per year. As such, the current parallel runways have been designed to accommodate flights with equivalent annual traffic of 50 million passengers following the completion of the sixth phase of expansion.[4]",
