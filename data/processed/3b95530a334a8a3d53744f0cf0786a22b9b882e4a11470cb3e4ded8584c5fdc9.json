				"previous": "Galileo Galilei had already postulated that there is no absolute and well-defined state of rest (no privileged reference frames), a principle now called Galileo's principle of relativity. Einstein extended this principle so that it accounted for the constant speed of light,[5] a phenomenon that had been recently observed in the MichelsonâMorley experiment. He also postulated that it holds for all the laws of physics, including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics.[6]",
