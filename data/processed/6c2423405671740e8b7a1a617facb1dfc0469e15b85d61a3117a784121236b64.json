				"previous": "Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domÅ«s) and at least one luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum),[293] but it was not a place to retreat from public life.[294] Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity.[295] It was also a center of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors.[296] The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae).[297] In addition to a kitchen gardenâ windowboxes might substitute in the insulaeâtownhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.[298]",
				"after": "The villa by contrast was an escape from the bustle of the city, and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances the civilized pursuit of intellectual and artistic interests (otium) with an appreciation of nature and the agricultural cycle.[300] Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista, carefully framed by the architectural design.[301] It might be located on a working estate, or in a \"resort town\" situated on the seacoast, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum.",
