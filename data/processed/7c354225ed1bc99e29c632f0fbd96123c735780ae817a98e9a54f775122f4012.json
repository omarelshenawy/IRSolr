				"previous": "Birmingham has a long cinematic history; the Electric Cinema on Station Street is the oldest working cinema in the UK,[298] and Oscar Deutsch opened his first Odeon cinema in Perry Barr during the 1920s. The largest cinema screen in the West Midlands is located at Millennium Point in the Eastside. Birmingham has also been the location for films including Felicia's Journey of 1999, which used locations in Birmingham that were used in Take Me High of 1973 to contrast the changes in the city.[299]",
				"after": "The BBC has two facilities in the city. The Mailbox, in the city centre, is the national headquarters of BBC English Regions[300] and the headquarters of BBC West Midlands and the BBC Birmingham network production centre. These were previously located at the Pebble Mill Studios in Edgbaston. The BBC Drama Village, based in Selly Oak, is a production facility specialising in television drama.[301]",
