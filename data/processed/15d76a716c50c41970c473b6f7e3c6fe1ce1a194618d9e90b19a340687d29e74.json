Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and avoided, and tried to eliminate, social determinations.[30] An early influence in this vein was Henry David Thoreau and his famous book Walden[106] Important promoters of this were Henri Zisly and Emile Gravelle who collaborated in La Nouvelle HumanitÃ© followed by Le Naturien, Le Sauvage, L'Ordre Naturel, & La Vie Naturelle.[107][108]",
