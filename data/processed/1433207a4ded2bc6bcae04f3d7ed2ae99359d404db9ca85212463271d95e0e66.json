They no longer exist, but detailed descriptions of their design and construction survive,[23][24] and modern reproductions have been made.[24] They illustrate how quickly the theory of the mechanical clock had been translated into practical constructions, and also that one of the many impulses to their development had been the desire of astronomers to investigate celestial phenomena.",
