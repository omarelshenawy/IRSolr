				"after": "This alcid typically fed in shoaling waters which were shallower than those frequented by other alcids,[45] although after the breeding season they had been sighted up to 500 kilometres (310Â mi) from land.[45] They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks.[45] Their main food was fish, usually 12 to 20 centimetres (4.7 to 7.9Â in) in length and weighing 40 to 50 grams (1.4 to 1.8Â oz), but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. The bird could on average dive up to 75 metres (246Â ft) for its prey with the maximum dive depth being estimated at 130 metres (430Â ft); however, to conserve energy, most dives were shallower.[45] Its ability to dive this deeply reduced competition with other alcid species. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favored prey.[46] Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, crustaceans, and sand lance.[44][45] The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adult auks.[36][42]",
