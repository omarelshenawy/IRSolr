While defeating the forces of the Sassanid Empire there, the Muslim commander Utbah ibn Ghazwan erected his camp on the site of an old Persian settlement called VaheÅ¡tÄbÄd ArdaÅ¡Ä«r, which was destroyed by the Arabs.[4] The name Al-Basrah, which in Arabic means \"the over watching\" or \"the seeing everything\", was given to it because of its role as a military base against the Sassanid Empire.[citation needed] However, other sources claim the name originates from the Persian word Bas-rÄh or BassorÄh meaning \"where many ways come together\".[5]",
