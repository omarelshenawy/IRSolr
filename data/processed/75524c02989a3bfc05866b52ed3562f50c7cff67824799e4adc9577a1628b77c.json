				"after": "The Bengal slow loris is the largest species of slow loris, weighing 1 to 2.1Â kg (2.2 to 4.6Â lb),[9] and measuring between 26 and 38Â cm (10 and 15Â in) from head to tail. It has a skull length of more than 62Â mm (2.4Â in).[5] It has dense, woolly, brown-gray fur on its back and white fur on its underside.[6] It also has a clear dark stripe that runs up to the top of its head, but does not extend laterally towards the ears. Its forearm and hand are almost white. The limbs of the pelvis vary in color from brown to nearly white, and the feet are always pale. Moulting may cause seasonal variations in the color of the dorsal surface.[10] Like other slow lorises, its tail is vestigial and it has a round head and short ears.[6][11] It has a rhinarium (the moist, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose) and a broad, flat face with large eyes.[12] Its eyes reflect a bright orange eye shine.[13] On its front feet, the second digit is smaller than the rest; the big toe on its hind foot opposes the other toes, which enhances its gripping power. Its second toe on the hind foot has a curved \"toilet-claw\" that the animal uses for scratching and grooming, while the other nails are straight.[12]",
