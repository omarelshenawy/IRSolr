Under the plan, the new piece would be legal tender, up to ten cents. It would be issued in exchange for the old Spanish silver still circulating in the United States. In the exchange, the Spanish silver would be given full value (12Â½ cents per real, or bit) when normally such pieces traded at about a 20% discount due to wear. The loss the government would take on the trade would be paid for by the seignorage on the base-metal pieces. The new cents would also be issued for the old cents, and in exchange for the same value in half centsâthat denomination was to be discontinued.[8] The bill was introduced in the Senate on March 25, 1856. The old cent weighed 168 grains (10.9Â g); on April 16, the bill was amended to provide for a cent of at least 95% copper weighing at least 96 grains (6.2Â g) and passed the Senate in that form.[10][11]",
