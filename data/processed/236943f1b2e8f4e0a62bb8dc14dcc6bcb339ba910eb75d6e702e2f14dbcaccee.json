				"previous": "On a formal mathematical level the time signatures of, e.g., 3 4 and 3 8 are interchangeable. In a sense, all simple triple time signatures, such as 3 8, 3 4, 3 2, etc.âand all compound duple times, such as 6 8, 6 16 and so on, are equivalent. A piece in 3 4 can be easily rewritten in 3 8, simply by halving the length of the notes. Other time signature rewritings are possible: most commonly a simple time signature with triplets translates into a compound meter.",
				"after": "Though formally interchangeable, for a composer or performing musician, different time signatures often have different connotations. First, a smaller note value in the beat unit implies a more complex notation, which can affect ease of performance. Second, beaming affects the choice of actual beat divisions. It is, for example, more natural to use the quarter note/crotchet as a beat unit in 6 4 or 2 2 than the eight/quaver in 6 8 or 2 4. Third, time signatures are traditionally associated with different music stylesâit might seem strange to notate a rock tune in 4 8 or 4 2.",
