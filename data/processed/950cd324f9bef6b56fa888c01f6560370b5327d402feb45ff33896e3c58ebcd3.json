They are also among the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.[27] The species reduced population in New England in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade.[13] Exploitation continues today in western Greenland, where the population of the species has been reduced greatly since 1950.[28]",
