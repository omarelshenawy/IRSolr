Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming Dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus the importance of the horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r.Â 1260â1294) and his spiritual superior DrogÃ¶n ChÃ¶gyal Phagpa (1235â1280) of the Tibetan Sakya sect, the Ming Chinese Yongle Emperor (r.Â 1402â1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384â1415), the Karmapa of the Tibetan Karma Kagyu. However, Yongle's attempts were unsuccessful.",
