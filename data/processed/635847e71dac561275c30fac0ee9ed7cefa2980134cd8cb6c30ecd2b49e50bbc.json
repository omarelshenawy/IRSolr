				"after": "Kent's climate is classified as a humid continental climate in the Dfa KÃ¶ppen climate classification meaning it typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons. The record high temperature is 103Â Â°F (39Â Â°C), set on July 7, 1988, with the record low of â22Â Â°F (â30Â Â°C) recorded January 17, 1982.[44][45] During the spring and summer months, thunderstorms are fairly common and the area is susceptible to tornadoes, though the last recorded tornado in Kent occurred in 1973.[46][47] Effects from tropical systems can also be felt, usually taking the form of increased humidity, rain, and wind, such as with the remnants of Hurricane Ike in September 2008.[48] During the winter months, snowfall is common and can occur in large quantities with considerable cloud cover. Kent is not considered part of the Lake Erie snowbelt, though lake-effect snow does occur at times. The city is in what is referred to as the \"secondary snowbelt\", meaning it will receive heavier snowfall totals from lake-effect snow when certain wind directions are more prevalent, but typically sees far less snowfall than areas to the north closer to Lake Erie.[49] While temperatures below the freezing point are typical in the winter months, thaw periods where temperatures exceed 50Â Â°F (10Â Â°C) and even 60Â Â°F (16Â Â°C) are not uncommon in January and February.[45]",
