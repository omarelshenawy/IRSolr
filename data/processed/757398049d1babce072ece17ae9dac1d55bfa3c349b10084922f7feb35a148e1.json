				"previous": "Airbus's publicity has stressed the comfort and space of the A380 cabin,[183] and advertised onboard relaxation areas such as bars, beauty salons, duty-free shops, and restaurants.[184][185] Proposed amenities resembled those installed on earlier airliners, particularly 1970s wide-body jets,[186] which largely gave way to regular seats for more passenger capacity.[186] Airbus has acknowledged that some cabin proposals were unlikely to be installed,[185] and that it was ultimately the airlines' decision how to configure the interior.[186] Industry analysts suggested that implementing customisation has slowed the production speeds, and raised costs.[187] Due to delivery delays, Singapore Airlines and Air France debuted their seat designs on different aircraft prior to the A380.[188][189]",
				"after": "Initial operators typically configured their A380s for three-class service, while adding extra features for passengers in premium cabins. Launch customer Singapore Airlines introduced partly enclosed first class suites on its A380s in 2007, each featuring a leather seat with a separate bed; center suites could be joined to create a double bed.[190][191][192] A year later, Qantas debuted a new first class seat-bed and a sofa lounge at the front of the upper deck on its A380s,[193][194] and in 2009 Air France unveiled an upper deck electronic art gallery.[175] In late 2008, Emirates introduced \"shower spas\" in first class on its A380s allowing each first class passenger five minutes of hot water,[195][196] drawing on 2.5 tonnes of water although only 60% of it was used.[99] Emirates,[197][198] Etihad and Qatar Airways also have a bar lounge and seating area on the upper deck, while Etihad has enclosed areas for two people each.[199] In addition to lounge areas, some A380 operators have installed amenities consistent with other aircraft in their respective fleets, including self-serve snack bars,[200] premium economy sections,[189] and redesigned business class seating.[188]",
