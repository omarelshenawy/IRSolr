The sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaâoceanographyâdates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s.[2] The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsâincluding the IHO's four named oceans[3] (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean;[4] smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.",
