				"after": "Because of the young geological age of the islands and atolls and high level of soil salination the flora of Kiribati is relatively poor. It contains about 83 indigenous and 306 introduced plants on Gilbert Islands, whereas the corresponding numbers for Line and Phoenix Islands are 67 and 283. None of these species are endemic, and about half of the indigenous ones have a limited distribution and became endangered or nearly extinct due to human activities such as phosphate mining.[68] Coconut and pandanus palms and breadfruit trees are most common wild plants,[21] whereas the five most cultivated crops are Chinese cabbage, pumpkin, tomato, watermelon and cucumber.[69]",
