				"after": "Although found in many types of woodland, the pied currawong prefers to breed in mature forests.[24] It builds a nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees in spring; generally eucalypts are chosen and never isolated ones. It produces a clutch of three eggs; they are a light pinkish-brown colour (likened by one author to that of silly putty) with splotches of darker pink-brown and lavender. Tapered oval in shape, they measure about 30Â ÃÂ 42Â mm (1Â ÃÂ 1.5Â in).[48] The female broods alone.[49] The incubation period is not well known, due to the difficulty of observing nests, but observations indicate around 30Â days from laying to hatching. Like all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous) They quickly grow a layer of ashy-grey down. Both parents feed the young, although the male does not begin to feed them directly until a few days after birth.[49]",
