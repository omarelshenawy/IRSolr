				"after": "Before the launch of Bing, the marketshare of Microsoft web search pages (MSN and Live search) had been small. By January 2011, Experian Hitwise show that Bing's market share had increased to 12.8% at the expense of Yahoo! and Google. Bing powered searches also continued to have a higher \"success rate\" compared to Google, with more users clicking on the resulting links.[19] In the same period, comScoreâs \"2010 U.S. Digital Year in Review\" report showed that \"Bing was the big gainer in year-over-year search activity, picking up 29% more searches in 2010 than it did in 2009\".[20] The Wall Street Journal notes the 1% jump in share \"appeared to come at the expense of rival Google Inc\".[21] In February 2011, Bing beat Yahoo! for the first time with 4.37% search share while Yahoo! received 3.93%.[22]",
