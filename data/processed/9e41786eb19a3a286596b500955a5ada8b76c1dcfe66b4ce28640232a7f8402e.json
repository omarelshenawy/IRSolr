				"previous": "Many double eagles were struck at San Francisco between 1877 and 1883.[62] Beginning in 1881, mintage of double eagles at Philadelphia was sharply curtailed. For the seven years 1881â1887, only 4,521 were made at that mint for circulation, none being struck in 1882, 1883, and 1887.[63] They were struck yearly in proof at Philadelphia: the 1883 (mintage 92), 1884 (71) and 1887 (121) are great rarities.[64] The mintage of 2,325 at New Orleans in 1879, the only postwar strikings there, is unexplainedâBreen suggested that the local mint superintendent might have anticipated a demand for the denomination. Double eagles were unpopular in commerce in the South, as were eagles.[62] Millions of double eagles were sent to Europe as payment in international transactions beginning in the 1880s, often in cloth bags containing 250 coins, for a total of $5,000 per bag.[65]",
				"after": "In 1900, William Barber's successor as chief engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins about that time suggest that he most likely did it as part of a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck.[66] In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Franciscoâhighs for the series for those mints.[67] The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.[68]",
