Holmes, who kept the Agriculture School from being a part of the University of Michigan and is widely credited with being the prime mover for the school's founding;[11] Joseph R. Williams, the first president;[13] and Theophilus C. Abbot, the third president who stabilized the College after the Civil War.[190] Also of importance was botany professor William J. Beal, an early plant (hybrid corn) geneticist who championed the laboratory teaching method.[191] Another distinguished faculty member of the era was the alumnus/professor Liberty Hyde Bailey.[192] Bailey was the first to raise the study of horticulture to a science, paralleling botany, which earned him the title of \"Father of American Horticulture\".[193] William L. Carpenter, a jurist who was elected to the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan in 1894, and member of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1902 until 1904.
