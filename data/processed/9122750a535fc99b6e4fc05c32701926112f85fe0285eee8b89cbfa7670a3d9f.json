At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a testbed aircraft to examine the low speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115.[11] This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69Â mph, about ârd that of the Starfighter.[13]",
