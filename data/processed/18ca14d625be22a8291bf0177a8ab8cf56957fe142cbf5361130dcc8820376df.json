				"previous": "William Shakespeare refers to crocodile tears in Othello (Act IV, Scene i), Henry VI, Part 2 (Act III, Scene i), and Antony and Cleopatra (Act II, Scene vii).",
				"after": "Crocodilians, especially the crocodile, have been recurring characters in stories for children throughout the modern era. Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) contains the poem How Doth the Little Crocodile,[146] a parody of a moralising poem by Isaac Watts, Against Idleness and Mischief.[147] In J. M. Barrie's novel Peter and Wendy (1911), the character Captain Hook has lost his arm to the crocodile. Hook fears the crocodile, but is warned of its approach by the ticking of a clock which it has swallowed.[148] In Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories (1902), the Elephant's Child acquires his trunk by having his (short) nose pulled very hard by the Crocodile \"on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo river\". The newly elongated nose allows him to pick fruit instead of waiting for it to fall, and to do many other useful things.[149] Roald Dahl's The Enormous Crocodile (1978), illustrated by Quentin Blake, tells how a crocodile wanders the jungle looking for children to eat, trying one trick after another.[150]",
