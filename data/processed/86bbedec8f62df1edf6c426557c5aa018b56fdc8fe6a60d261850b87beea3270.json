				"previous": "Birds of the nominate subspecies were introduced to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons.[13] In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands.[14] Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne.[15] In New Zealand, there appears to be a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species,[16] and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country.[17] As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.[18]",
				"after": "The song thrush typically nests in forest with good undergrowth and nearby more open areas, and in western Europe also uses gardens and parks. It breeds up to the tree-line, reaching 2,200Â metres (7,250Â ft) in Switzerland. The island subspecies T. p. hebridensis breeds in more open country, including heathland, and in the east of the song thrush's Eurasian range, the nominate subspecies is restricted to the edge of the dense conifer forests.[9]",
