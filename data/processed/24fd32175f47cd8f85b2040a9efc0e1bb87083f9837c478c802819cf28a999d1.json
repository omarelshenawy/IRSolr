				"previous": "At the Prix Ars Electronica PiratbyrÃ¥n received an \"award of distinction\" (including a prize money of 5000 euro) in the category \"Digital Communities\".[8][9] The motivation of the jury underlined the PiratbyrÃ¥n \"never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers.\" [10]",
				"after": "PiratbyrÃ¥n proposed, and published most of its work under, a copyright alternative called kopimi (pronounced, and sometimes also spelled \"copyme\").[17] Designed to be the opposite of copyright, a kopimi notice specifically encourages that the work be copiedâfor any purpose, commercial or non-commercial.[18] Kopimi is similar to the CC0 license created by Creative Commons,[citation needed] although Kopimi adds a positive imperative for others to copy.",
