				"previous": "By this time, Moreno thought that the only way to secure the Revolution would be if it was successful throughout the continent.[64] However, he considered that Latin American integration should be achieved peacefully among equals, and not as the result of a conquest campaign. He wrote at the Gazeta that \"even as pure as our intentions may be, it would be dangerous if the freedom of America was just our own work. Such a circumstance could lead to a real despotism and the Peruvian peoples would not improve having porteÃ±o oppressors instead of European ones.\"[65] He made positive comments about the rebellions at Cochabamba and Chile.[65]",
				"after": "Following a proposal of Manuel Belgrano, the Junta wrote a political platform setting broad goals and procedures to follow to achieve its objectives. The creation of this document, whose name is often summarized simply as the \"Operations plan\", was trusted to Mariano Moreno. There have been disputes about the authenticity of this document. Some historians like Paul Groussac suspect that the document was a literary forgery, prepared by a Spaniard at the Court of Portugal to discredit the Junta.[66] Supporters of the truthfulness of the document like Norberto PiÃ±eiro, allege that the content would be consistent with government actions taken by the Primera Junta.[67]",
