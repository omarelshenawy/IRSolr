It was also used as a training ground for hwarang warriors and hunting spot for Silla kings, and was reported to be King Jinpyeong's favorite location.[131][132] Since 1975, Hwangseong Park has been designated as \"city neighborhood park\" and currently consists of multi-purposed Gyeongju Public Stadium, Football Park with 7 football fields and one futsal field, and one gymnasium, as well as Horimjang field for gukgung or Korean traditional archery and a ssireum wrestling ring.[133] In addition, it contains a gateball field, an inline skating rink, jogging courses, and cycling roads.[134] The Gyeongju Public Stadium was completed in 1982[127] and can accommodate 20,000 people at capacity.[129]",
