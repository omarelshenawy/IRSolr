				"previous": "Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807.[10] Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas.[8] In 1808, a popular uprisingâincited by Ferdinand's supportersâsaw Godoy captured and left Charles with no choice but to abdicate; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as FerdinandÂ VII. Ferdinand had been seeking French patronage,[11] but Napoleon and his principal commander, Marshal Joachim Murat, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers who were more progressive and competent than the Bourbons. They decided that Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte, should be king.[12] Under a pretext of mediation, Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to Bayonne, France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph.",
				"after": "Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronouncedâand the differences far more entrenchedâfollowing the eventual withdrawal of the French.[14]",
