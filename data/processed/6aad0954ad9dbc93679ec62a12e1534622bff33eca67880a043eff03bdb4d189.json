				"previous": "Small firms dominate employment in the private sector. The Talisker Distillery, which produces a single malt whisky, is beside Loch Harport on the west coast of the island. Three other whiskiesâMac na Mara (\"son of the sea\"), TÃ¨ Bheag nan Eilean (\"wee dram of the isles\") and Poit Dhubh (\"black pot\")âare produced by blender PrÃ ban na Linne (\"smugglers den by the Sound of Sleat\"), based at Eilean Iarmain.[94][95] These are marketed using predominantly Gaelic-language labels. There is also an established software presence on Skye, with Portree-based Sitekit having expanded in recent years.[96]",
				"after": "Crofting is still important, but although there are about 2,000 crofts on Skye only 100 or so are large enough to enable a crofter to earn a livelihood entirely from the land.[97] Cod and herring stocks have declined but commercial fishing remains important, especially fish farming of salmon and shellfish such as scampi.[98] The west coast of Scotland has a considerable renewable energy potential and the Isle of Skye Renewables Co-op has recently bought a stake in the Ben Aketil wind farm near Dunvegan.[99][100] There is a thriving arts and crafts sector.[101]",
