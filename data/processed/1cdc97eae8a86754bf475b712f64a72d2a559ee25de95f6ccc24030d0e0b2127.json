				"after": "An earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's top 700 km that creates seismic waves. These waves are detected with seismometers and amplified electronically so they can be displayed as a function of time by a seismograph as a seismogram. The size of an earthquake is given by its open ended logarithmic scale of magnitude, often referred to as the Richter scale. Shocks smaller than magnitude 2.5 are usually not felt and those with magnitude 7 cause serious damage over large areas. Intensity of shaking is measured on the modified Mercalli scale, ranging from 1 far from the epicenter to a maximum near it, which can reach 12 in the strongest earthquakes..",
