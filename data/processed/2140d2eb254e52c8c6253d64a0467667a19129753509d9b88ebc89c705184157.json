				"after": "The pallid sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America. They are generally between 30 and 60 inches (76 and 152Â cm) in length and weigh as much as 85 pounds (39Â kg).[2][3] The species is ancient and has remained virtually unchanged for 70Â million years, since the Cretaceous period. The pallid sturgeon has a distinctive appearance that has been referred to as \"primitive\", \"dinosaur-like\" and even \"ugly\".[4] Although visually similar, the shovelnose sturgeon is much smaller and usually weighs no more than 5 pounds (2.3Â kg). Pallid sturgeon are much paler in coloration with grayish white backs and sides, while shovelnose sturgeon are brown.[6] Pallid sturgeon turn whiter as they age and younger specimens are easily confused with adult shovelnoses sturgeon since they are similar in color.[16] Like the shovelnose sturgeon, their tails are heterocercal, with the top tail fin being longer than the bottom fin, though this is more pronounced in pallid sturgeon.[17]",
