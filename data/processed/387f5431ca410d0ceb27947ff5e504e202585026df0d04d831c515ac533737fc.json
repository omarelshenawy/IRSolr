It is usually reported to three decimal places and pronounced as if it were multiplied by 1,000: a player with a batting average of .300 is \"batting three-hundred.\" A point (or percentage point) is understood to be .001 . If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken to more than three decimal places.",
