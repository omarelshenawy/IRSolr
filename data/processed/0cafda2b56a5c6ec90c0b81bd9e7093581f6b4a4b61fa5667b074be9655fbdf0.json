				"after": "The Super Hornet was first ordered by the U.S. Navy in 1992, in part to replace the F-14 Tomcat; all naval combat jets were on Hornet variants until the introduction of the F-35C Lightning II.[9] The Navy retained the F/A-18 designation to help sell the program to Congress as a low-risk \"derivative\", though the Super Hornet is largely a new aircraft. The Hornet and Super Hornet share many characteristics, including avionics, ejection seats, radar, armament, mission computer software, and maintenance/operating procedures. The initial F/A-18E/F retained most of the avionics systems from the F/A-18C/D's configuration at the time.[6]",
