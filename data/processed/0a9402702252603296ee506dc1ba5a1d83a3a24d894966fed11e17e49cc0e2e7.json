				"after": "The right panel (220 Ã 97.5Â cm, 87 Ã 38.4Â in) illustrates Hell, the setting of a number of Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityârendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysâand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution.[48] In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground.[49] The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands.",
