				"after": "In 1989 the airline acquired Norsk Air, an airline based at Sandefjord Airport, Torp, for free from the shipping company Kosmos. The airline operated four Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft, and flew from Sandefjord to Copenhagen, Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim as well as from Skien Airport, Geiteryggen to Bergen and Stavanger. In 1991 the airline changed its name to WiderÃ¸e Norsk Air, before it was amalgamated into WiderÃ¸e in 1996, the same year the Brasilias were replaced with 50 seat Dash-8-300s. WiderÃ¸e Norsk Air also operated the Brasilias between 1991 and 1993 on a route between Sandefjord / Torp - Kristiansand / Kjevik and London Gatwick Airport, but it was closed partially due to an over establishment of flights from Norway. Today the airline operations from Sandefjord are its most profitable.",
