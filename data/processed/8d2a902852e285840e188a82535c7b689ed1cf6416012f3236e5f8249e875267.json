				"previous": "The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age five (EducaciÃ³n preescolar). Basic education (EducaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica) is compulsory by law.[252] It has two stages: Primary basic education (EducaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica primaria) which goes from first to fifth grade â children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (EducaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica secundaria), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (EducaciÃ³n media vocacional) that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.",
				"after": "After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a bachiller, because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called bachillerato (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the ICFES test (now renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (EducaciÃ³n superior). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies. Technical professional institutions of Higher Education are also opened to students holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This qualification is usually awarded by the SENA after a two years curriculum.[253]",
