Already remarkable success has been achieved with unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator drone, which is capable of taking surveillance photographs, and even accurately launching missiles at ground targets, without a pilot. A subclass of these are Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles, which are designed to carry out strike missions in combat.",
