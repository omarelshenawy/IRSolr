				"previous": "Fire ants, Solenopsis spp., are unique in having a poison sac containing piperidine alkaloids.[76] Their stings are painful and can be dangerous to hypersensitive people.[77]",
				"after": "Trap-jaw ants of the genus Odontomachus are equipped with mandibles called trap-jaws, which snap shut faster than any other predatory appendages within the animal kingdom.[78] One study of Odontomachus bauri recorded peak speeds of between 126 and 230Â km/h (78Â â 143Â mph), with the jaws closing within 130 microseconds on average. The ants were also observed to use their jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat.[78] Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. Energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks. Trap-jaws also are seen in the following genera: Anochetus, Orectognathus, and Strumigenys,[78] plus some members of the Dacetini tribe,[79] which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution.",
