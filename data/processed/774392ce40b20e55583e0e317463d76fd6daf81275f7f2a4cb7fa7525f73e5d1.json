				"previous": "Most deserts undergo drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, but not Phoenix due to the urban heat island effect. As the city has expanded, average summer low temps have been rising steadily. The daily heat of the sun is stored in pavement, sidewalks and buildings, and is radiated back out at night.[65] During the summer, overnight lows greater than 80Â Â°F (27Â Â°C) are commonplace, as the daily normal low remains at or above 80Â Â°F from June 22 to September 8. On average, 67 days throughout the year will see the nighttime low at or above 80Â Â°F (27Â Â°C). July 15, 2003 officially saw the record high daily minimum temperature, at 96Â Â°F (36Â Â°C).[60][61]",
				"after": "The city averages over 330 days of sunshine, or over 90%, per year, and receives scant rainfall, the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport being 7 inches (180Â mm).[66] Precipitation is sparse during most of the year, but the monsoon brings an influx of moisture. Historically, the monsoon officially started when the average Dew point was 55 degrees for three days in a row; on average this event occurred around July 7; however, in 2008 the National Weather Service decreed that from that point forward, June 15 would be the official first day of the monsoon, and it would end on September 30.[67] The monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, occasional flooding, large hail, strong winds, the rare tornado, and dust storms,[68] which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.[69]",
