				"after": "The redback spider is probably native to Australia; however, it has been suggested that it may have been spread to Australia by human activities, because it was first found at seaports.[5] Queensland researchers Robert Raven and Julie-Ann Gallon also argued its preference for habitats altered by humans to be further evidence of this. Spider expert Barbara York Main queried that were it indeed introduced, it would be odd that Australia was missing from the worldwide distribution of Latrodectus species. The redback's close relationship with the New Zealand katipo also supports the native status of both in their respective countries.[29]",
