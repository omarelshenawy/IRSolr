				"previous": "The second step of Remez' algorithm consists of moving the test points to the approximate locations where the error function had its actual local maxima or minima. For example, one can tell from looking at the graph that the point at â0.1 should have been at about â0.28. The way to do this in the algorithm is to use a single round of Newton's method. Since one knows the first and second derivatives of P(x)âf(x), one can calculate approximately how far a test point has to be moved so that the derivative will be zero.",
				"after": "After moving the test points, the linear equation part is repeated, getting a new polynomial, and Newton's method is used again to move the test points again. This sequence is continued until the result converges to the desired accuracy. The algorithm converges very rapidly. Convergence is quadratic for well-behaved functionsâif the test points are within of the correct result, they will be approximately within of the correct result after the next round.",
