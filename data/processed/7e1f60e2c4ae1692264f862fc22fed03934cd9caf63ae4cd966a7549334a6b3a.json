				"Maria Ursula, her parents, and both children died in September 1833 from cholera.[59]",
				"On April 25, 1831, Bowie married nineteen-year-old Maria Ursula de Veramendi, the daughter of his business partner, who had become the vice governor of the province. Several days before the ceremony, he signed a dowry contract promising to pay his new bride 15,000Â pesos (approximately $15,000 then, or $332,000 today[55]) in cash or property within two years of the marriage. At the time, Bowie claimed to have a net worth of $223,000 ($4,940,000 today), mostly in land of questionable title. Bowie also lied about his age, claiming to be 30 rather than 35.[56] The couple built a house in San Antonio on land Veramendi had given them near the San JosÃ© Mission. After a short time, however, they moved into the Veramendi Palace, living with Ursula's parents, who supplied them with spending money.[57] The couple had two children, Marie Elve (b. MarchÂ 20, 1832) and James Veramendi (b. JulyÂ 18, 1833).[58]"
