				"Frank L. Packard (1866 - 26 October 1923)[1] was a prominent architect in Ohio.",
				"He designed the porch for the home of President Warren G. Harding in Marion, Ohio (Harding Home).[2] Known as stick style architecture the house was designed by Harding and his wife and constructed in a neoclassical architecture style. The porch, known as the home of the Front Porch Campaign of 1920, was influenced by the Queen Anne era in that it wraps around the house. Highly stylized and decorative versions of the Stick style are often referred to as Eastlake architecture."
