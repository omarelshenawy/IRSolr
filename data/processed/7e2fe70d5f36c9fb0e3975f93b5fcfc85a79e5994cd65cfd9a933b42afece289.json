				"previous": "Hawker Siddeley Aviation which absorbed de Havilland, needed additional customers for the Trident, so entered into discussions with American Airlines (AA) in 1960. They demanded an aircraft with a longer range, which meant that the original DH121 design would have fulfilled American's requirements almost perfectly. To fill AA's needs, design began on a new Trident 1A, powered with uprated Rolls-Royce Spey 510s of 10,700Â lbf (47.6Â kN) thrust, and a larger wing with more fuel, raising gross weight to 120,000Â lb (54,000Â kg) and range to 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometres). American Airlines eventually declined the aircraft in favour of the Boeing 727, an aircraft which filled the original DH121 specifications almost exactly.",
				"after": "Some of these changes were nevertheless added into the original prototype, and it was renamed the Trident 1C. The main difference was a larger fuel tank in the centre section of the wing, raising weights to 115,000Â lb (52,000Â kg) and range to 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometres). The first Trident 1, G-ARPA, made its maiden flight on 9 January 1962 from Hatfield Aerodrome,[27] and entered service on 1 April 1964.[27] By 1965, there were 15 Tridents in BEA's fleet and by March 1966, the fleet had increased to 21.",
