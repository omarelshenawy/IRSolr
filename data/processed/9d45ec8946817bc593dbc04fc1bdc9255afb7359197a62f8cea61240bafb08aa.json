				"after": "Airbus suggested Boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB will feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs,[45] Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite fuselage frames for the aircraft structure.[46][47] The composite frames will feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning strikes).[48] Airbus will use a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers.[49]",
