				"previous": "(where we define an to mean 1, which is reasonable since 1 is indeed the n-th coefficient of our polynomial). The case of a generic polynomial of degree n, , is of course reduced to the case of a monic, dividing all coefficients by an â  0. Also, in case that 0 is not a root, i.e. a0 â  0., bounds from below on the roots Î¶ follow immediately as bounds from above on , that is, the roots of . Finally, the distance from the roots Î¶ to any point can be estimated from below and above, seeing as zeros of the polynomial , whose coefficients are the Taylor expansion of P(z) at",
