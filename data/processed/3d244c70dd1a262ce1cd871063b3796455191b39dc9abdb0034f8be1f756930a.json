				"after": "Beato's photographs of the Second Opium War are the first to document a military campaign as it unfolded,[21] doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His photographs of the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers.[21] The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken firstâbefore the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.[22]",
