				"previous": "A set T of sentences is called a (first-order) theory. A theory is satisfiable if it has a model , i.e. a structure (of the appropriate signature) which satisfies all the sentences in the set T. Consistency of a theory is usually defined in a syntactical way, but in first-order logic by the completeness theorem there is no need to distinguish between satisfiability and consistency. Therefore model theorists often use \"consistent\" as a synonym for \"satisfiable\".",
				"after": "Lack of expressivity (when compared to higher logics such as second-order logic) has its advantages, though. For model theorists, the LÃ¶wenheimâSkolem theorem is an important practical tool rather than the source of Skolem's paradox. In a certain sense made precise by LindstrÃ¶m's theorem, first-order logic is the most expressive logic for which both the LÃ¶wenheimâSkolem theorem and the compactness theorem hold.",
