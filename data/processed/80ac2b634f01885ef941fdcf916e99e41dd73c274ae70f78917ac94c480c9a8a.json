				"after": "Operation Jackpot was the codename assigned to several different operations during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The original \"Operation Jackpot\" was the logistical and training operation set up under the Indian Army Eastern Command to aid the Mukti Bahini-led insurgency. The commando operation that sabotaged Pakistan Navy and other ships in Chittagong, Chandpur, Mongla and Naryanganj on the 15th of August is known in Bangladesh as \"Operation Jackpot\". Finally, the operational plan of Lt Gen Sagat Singh, commanding the Indian Army IV corps and Mukti Bahini personnel against Pakistani forces defending the eastern sector (Syhlet, Comilla, Noakhali and Chittagong districts) during December 3-16 may also have been named \"Operation Jackpot\".",
