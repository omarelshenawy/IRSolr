The Philippines lie to the northwest, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Melanesia to the west and southwest, and Polynesia to the east. This region of Oceania consists of many hundreds of small islands spread over a large region of the western Pacific. The only empire known to have originated in Micronesia was based in Yap. The term \"Micronesia\" was first proposed to distinguish the region in 1831 by Jules Dumont d'Urville; before this the term \"Polynesia\" was in use to generally describe the islands of the Pacific.",
