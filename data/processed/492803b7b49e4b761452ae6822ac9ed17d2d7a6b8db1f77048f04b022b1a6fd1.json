Water levels rose from about 4000Â years ago and inundated the bay.[14] Archeologists believe that any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just to the west of the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000Â years before the present.[15] The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500Â years before the present, with piles of conch and whelk shells left by the Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community living on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity.[16] A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000Â AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans.[15] A total of fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.[17]",
