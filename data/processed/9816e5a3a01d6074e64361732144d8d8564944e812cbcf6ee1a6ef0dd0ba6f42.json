				"previous": "The most famous description of a Roman meal is probably Trimalchio's dinner party in the Satyricon, a fictional extravaganza that bears little resemblance to reality even among the most wealthy.[326] The poet Martial describes serving a more plausible dinner, beginning with the gustatio (\"tasting\" or \"appetizer\"), which was a composed salad of mallow leaves, lettuce, chopped leeks, mint, arugula, mackerel garnished with rue, sliced eggs, and marinated sow udder. The main course was succulent cuts of kid, beans, greens, a chicken, and leftover ham, followed by a dessert of fresh fruit and vintage wine.[327] The Latin expression for a full-course dinner was ab ovo usque mala, \"from the egg to the apples,\" equivalent to the English \"from soup to nuts.\"[328]",
				"after": "A book-length collection of Roman recipes is attributed to Apicius, a name for several figures in antiquity that became synonymous with \"gourmet.\"[329] Roman \"foodies\" indulged in wild game, fowl such as peacock and flamingo, large fish (mullet was especially prized), and shellfish. Luxury ingredients were brought by the fleet from the far reaches of empire, from the Parthian frontier to the Straits of Gibraltar.[330]",
