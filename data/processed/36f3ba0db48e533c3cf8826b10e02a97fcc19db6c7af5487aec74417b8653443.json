				"after": "This last clause, while seemingly redundant given the President's position as Commander-in-chief, is a codification of the expeditionary responsibilities of the Marine Corps. It derives from similar language in the Congressional acts \"For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps\" of 1834, and \"Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps\" of 1798. In 1951, the House of Representatives' Armed Services Committee called the clause \"one of the most important statutory â and traditional â functions of the Marine Corps.\" It noted that the corps has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its famous actions in Tripoli, the War of 1812, Chapultepec, and numerous counter-insurgency and occupational duties (such as those in Central America), World War I, and the Korean War. While these actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns nor as amphibious warfare, their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature, using the mobility of the Navy to provide timely intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests.[22]",
