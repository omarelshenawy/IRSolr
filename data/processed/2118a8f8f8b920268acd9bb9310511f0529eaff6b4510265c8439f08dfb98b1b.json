				"after": "Studies in the 1990s by the ethologists Stanley D. Gehrt and Ulf Hohmann indicated raccoons engage in gender-specific social behaviors and are not typically solitary, as was previously thought.[104][105] Related females often live in a so-called \"fission-fusion society\", that is, they share a common area and occasionally meet at feeding or resting grounds.[106] Unrelated males often form loose male social groups to maintain their position against foreign males during the mating seasonâor against other potential invaders.[107] Such a group does not usually consist of more than four individuals.[108] Since some males show aggressive behavior towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big enough to defend themselves.[109] With respect to these three different modes of life prevalent among raccoons, Hohmann called their social structure a \"three class society\".[110] Samuel I. Zeveloff, professor of zoology at Weber State University and author of the book Raccoons: A Natural History, is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes at least the females are solitary most of the time and, according to Erik K. Fritzell's study in North Dakota in 1978, males in areas with low population densities are solitary as well.[111]",
