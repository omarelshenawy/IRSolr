				"previous": "Note that the intermediate points that were constructed are in fact the control points for two new BÃ©zier curves, both exactly coincident with the old one. This algorithm not only evaluates the curve at , but splits the curve into two pieces at , and provides the equations of the two sub-curves in BÃ©zier form.",
				"after": "In general, operations on a rational curve (or surface) are equivalent to operations on a nonrational curve in a projective space. This representation as the \"weighted control points\" and weights is often convenient when evaluating rational curves.",
