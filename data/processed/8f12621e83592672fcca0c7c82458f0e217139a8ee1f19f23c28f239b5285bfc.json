				"after": "Freud was born to Jewish Galician parents in the Moravian town of PÅÃ­bor (German: Freiberg in MÃ¤hren), Austrian Empire, now part of the Czech Republic, the first of their eight children.[13] His father, Jakob Freud (1815â1896), a wool merchant, had two sons, Emanuel (1833â1914) and Philipp (1836â1911), from his first marriage. Jakob's family were Hasidic Jews, and though Jakob himself had moved away from the tradition, he came to be known for his Torah study. He and Freud's mother, Amalia (nÃ©e Nathansohn), 20 years her husband's junior and his third wife, were married by Rabbi Isaac Noah Mannheimer on 29 July 1855.[14] They were struggling financially and living in a rented room, in a locksmith's house at Schlossergasse 117 when their son Sigmund was born.[15] He was born with a caul, which his mother saw as a positive omen for the boy's future.[16]",
