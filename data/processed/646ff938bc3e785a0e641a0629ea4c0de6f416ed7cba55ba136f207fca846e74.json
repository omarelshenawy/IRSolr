				"after": "The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918, with the Battle of Amiens. The battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 British, Dominion, and French troops, and by the end of its first day a gap 15Â mi (24Â km) long had been created in the German lines. The defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing Ludendorff to refer to this day as the \"Black Day of the German army\".[155][156] After an advance as far as 14 miles (23Â km), German resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 August.",
