				"Georgia is divided into 9 regions, 1 city, and 2 autonomous republics.[2] These in turn are subdivided into 69 districts.",
				"Georgia contains two official autonomous regions, of which one has declared independence. In addition, another territory not officially autonomous has also declared independence. Officially autonomous within Georgia,[125] the de facto independent region of Abkhazia declared independence in 1999.[126] South Ossetia is officially known by Georgia as the Tskinvali region, as it views \"South Ossetia\" as implying political bonds with Russian North Ossetia.[127] It was called South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast when Georgia was part of Soviet Union. Its autonomous status was revoked in 1990. De facto separate since Georgian independence, offers were made to give South Ossetia autonomy again, but in 2006 an unrecognised referendum in the area resulted in a vote for independence.[127]"
