				"previous": "By 1946, Dunlop had 70,000 employees, and sales outlets in nearly every country in the world.[17] In 1948 Dunlop invented the self-sealing tyre, which reduced the risk from blowouts.[18] In the early 1950s, Dunlop developed Maxaret, the first anti-lock braking system.[19] By 1955 Dunlop had almost half of the UK tyre market.[20] A report by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission in that year found that Dunlop and the four other main sellers in the UK market (Goodyear, Avon, Firestone and Michelin) companies had arrangements which resulted in fixed prices.[20] These arrangements were forced to change, and Dunlop's market share decreased.[12]",
				"after": "A further factor in Dunlop's decline was the decision during the early 1960s to develop cheaper textile radial tyres rather than the more durable steel-belted radial tyres.[12] Dunlop lost market share to the Michelin company and other manufacturers marketing steel-belted tyres.[21]",
