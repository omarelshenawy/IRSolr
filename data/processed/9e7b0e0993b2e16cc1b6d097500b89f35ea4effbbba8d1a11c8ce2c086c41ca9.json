				"previous": "In the early 1990s, thrash achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream.[148] Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart,[149] as the band established international following.[150] Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction (1992) debuted at number two,[151] Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10,[152] and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.[153]",
				"after": "Thrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. \"Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,\" according to MTV News.[155] The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor. The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of blasphemy and diabolism employed by such acts. Florida's Death and the Bay Area's Possessed are recognized as seminal bands in the style. Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name, the latter via its 1984 demo Death Metal and the song \"Death Metal\", from its 1985 debut album Seven Churches (1985). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.[156]",
