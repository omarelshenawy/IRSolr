				"previous": "The Home Army's roots were in the Service for Poland's Victory (SÅuÅ¼ba ZwyciÄstwu Polski), which had been set up by General MichaÅ Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated German and Soviet invasions of Poland were nearing completion.[1] Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General WÅadysÅaw Sikorski, the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the Armed Resistance (ZwiÄzek Walki Zbrojnej), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the Home Army.[1][2] All the while, however, there were also many other resistance organizations active in Poland.[3] Most of them eventually merged with the Armed Resistance or with its successor, the Home Army, in the years 1939â44, substantially augmenting the Home Army's numbers.[2][3][4]",
