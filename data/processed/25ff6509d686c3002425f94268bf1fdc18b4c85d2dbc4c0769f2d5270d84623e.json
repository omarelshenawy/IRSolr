				"previous": "In 1893, Chicago hosted the World's Columbian Exposition on former marshland at the present location of Jackson Park. The Exposition drew 27.5Â million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history.[60][61] The University of Chicago was founded in 1892 on the same South Side location. The term \"midway\" for a fair or carnival referred originally to the Midway Plaisance, a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects Washington and Jackson Parks.[62][63]",
