				"after": "The Alpine chough has an extensive though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1â10Â millionÂ square kilometres (0.4â3.8Â million sq mi), and a large population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds.[47] Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.[1]",
