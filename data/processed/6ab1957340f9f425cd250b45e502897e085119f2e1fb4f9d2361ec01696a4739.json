				"previous": "Compared to other cities, there are few tall buildings in ZÃ¼rich. The municipal building regulations (Article 9)[56] limit the construction of high-rise buildings to areas in the west and north of the city. In the industrial district, in Altstetten and Oerlikon, buildings up to 80 meters (260Â ft) in height are allowed (high-rise area I). In the adjacent high-rise areas II and III the height is limited to 40 meters (130Â ft). Around the year 2000, regulations became more flexible and high-rise buildings were again planned and built. The people's initiative \"40 meters is enough,\" which would have reduced both the maximum height and the high-rise buildings area, was clearly rejected on 29 November 2009.[57] At this time in ZÃ¼rich about a dozen high-rise buildings were under construction or in planning, including the Prime Tower as the tallest skyscraper in Switzerland.",
