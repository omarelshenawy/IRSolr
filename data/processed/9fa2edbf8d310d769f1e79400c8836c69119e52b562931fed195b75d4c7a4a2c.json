				"previous": "The Australian government ordered 24 F-111C aircraft to replace the RAAF's English Electric Canberras in the bombing and tactical strike role.[69] While the first aircraft was officially handed over in September 1968, structural issues delayed the entry into service.[70] The first F-111C was accepted at Nellis Air Force Base on 15 March 1973.[71] The RAAF's first six F-111Cs arrived at Amberley on 1 July 1973, and three subsequent flights of six F-111s arrived on 27 July, 28 September and 4 December.[71] F-111Cs were allocated to No. 1 Squadron and No. 6 Squadron, under the control of No. 82 Wing.",
				"after": "In Australia, the F-111 was affectionately known as the \"Pig\", due to its long snout and terrain-following ability.[72][73][N 2]",
