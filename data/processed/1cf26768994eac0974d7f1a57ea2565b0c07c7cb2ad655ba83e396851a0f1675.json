				"after": "The Rwandan government prioritised funding of water supply development during the 2000s, significantly increasing its share of the national budget.[165] This funding, along with donor support, caused a rapid increase in access to safe water; in 2008, 73% of the population had access to safe water, up from about 55% in 2005.[165] The country's water infrastructure consists of urban and rural systems which deliver water to the public, mainly through standpipes in rural areas and private connections in urban areas. In areas not served by these systems, hand pumps and managed springs are used.[166] Despite rainfall exceeding 100 centimetres (39Â in) annually in many areas,[122] little use is made of rainwater harvesting.[166] Access to sanitation remains low; the United Nations estimates that in 2006, 34% of urban and 20% of rural dwellers had access to improved sanitation.[167] Government policy measures to improve sanitation are limited, focusing only on urban areas.[167] The majority of the population, both urban and rural, use public shared pit latrines for sanitation.[167]",
