				"previous": "The prime counting function Ï(n) is defined as the number of primes not greater than n. For example Ï(11) = 5, since there are five primes less than or equal to 11. There are known algorithms to compute exact values of Ï(n) faster than it would be possible to compute each prime up to n. The prime number theorem states that Ï(n) is approximately given by",
				"after": "in the sense that the ratio of Ï(n) and the right hand fraction approaches 1 when n grows to infinity. This implies that the likelihood that a number less than n is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in n. A more accurate estimate for Ï(n) is given by the offset logarithmic integral",
