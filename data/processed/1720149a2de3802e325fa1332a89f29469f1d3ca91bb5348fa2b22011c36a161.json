The drainage basin area is 23.6 square miles (61Â km2), accounting for 4.78% of the 494 square miles (1,280Â km2) Loyalsock Creek watershed.[5] Bear Creek, whose mouth is also within the village of Barbours but on the opposite (left) bank, is the nearest major creek at 0.52Â miles (0.84Â km) downstream, as measured along Loyalsock Creek. (It is also known as \"Big Bear Creek\" as it is the watershed upstream of \"Little Bear Creek\".) The neighboring major watersheds on the same bank are Wallis Run (9.56Â miles (15.39Â km) downstream) and Mill Creek (at the village of Hillsgrove, 9.16Â miles (14.74Â km) upstream).[5] Pleasant Stream, a tributary of Lycoming Creek, is the watershed to the north.[4]",
