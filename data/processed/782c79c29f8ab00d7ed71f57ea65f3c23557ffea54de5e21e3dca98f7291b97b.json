Interstate Highways are numbered in a grid â even-numbered routes for east-west routes (but the lowest numbers are along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico), and odd-numbered routes are north-south routes (with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean). U.S. Routes are also numbered in a grid â even numbered for east-west routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for north-south routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). There are seven Interstate highways in Washington, and one oft-proposed, ranging from Interstate 5 to Interstate 705. There are eight current U.S. Routes in the state including U.S. Route 101 and U.S. Route 730.",
