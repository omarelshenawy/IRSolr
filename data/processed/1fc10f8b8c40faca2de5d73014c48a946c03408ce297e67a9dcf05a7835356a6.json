				"There is a natural trade-off between the payload and the range of an aircraft. A payload range diagram (also known as the \"elbow chart\") illustrates the trade-off.",
				"The top horizontal line represents the maximum payload. It is limited structurally by maximum zero-fuel weight (MZFW) of the aircraft. Maximum payload is the difference between maximum zero-fuel weight and operational empty weight (OEW). Moving left-to-right along the line shows the constant maximum payload as the range increases. More fuel needs to be added for more range."
