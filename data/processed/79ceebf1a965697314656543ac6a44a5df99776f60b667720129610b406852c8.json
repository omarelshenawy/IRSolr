Hong Taiji, the Qing Taizong emperor, said, \"Riding and Archery is the most important martial art of our country\".[207][208] Every generation of the Qing dynasty treasured Riding and Archery the most.[209] Every spring and fall, from ordinary Manchus to aristocrats, all had to take a riding and archery test. Their test results could even affect their rank in the nobility.[210] The Manchus of the early Qing had excellent shooting skills and their arrows were reputed to be capable of penetrating two people.[211]",
