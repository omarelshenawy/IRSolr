				"after": "In physical terms the function is represented as a superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum.[79] A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used.[78] The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality.[80] Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.[81]",
