				"after": "The Nomura Research Institute (NRI) has made two major studies into otaku, the first in 2004 and a revised study with a more specific definition in 2005.[28][29] The 2005 study defines twelve major fields of otaku interests. Of these groups, manga (Japanese comics) was the largest, with 350,000 individuals and Â¥83 billion market scale. Idol otaku were the next largest group, with 280,000 individuals and Â¥61 billion. Travel otaku with 250,000 individuals and Â¥81 billion. PC otaku with 190,000 individuals and Â¥36 billion. Video game otaku with 160,000 individuals and Â¥21 billion. Automobile otaku with 140,000 individuals and Â¥54 billion. Animation (anime) otaku with 110,000 individuals and Â¥20 billion. The remaining five categories include Mobile IT equipment otaku, with 70,000 individuals and Â¥8 billion; Audio-visual equipment otaku, with 60,000 individuals and Â¥12 billion; camera otaku, with 50,000 individuals and Â¥18 billion; fashion otaku, with 40,000 individuals and Â¥13 billion; and railway otaku, with 20,000 individuals and Â¥4 billion.[29] These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on the consumerism and not the \"unique psychological characteristics\" of otaku used in the 2005 study.[28][29]",
