Since its creation, it remains as one of the most prominent elements of the popular culture.[citation needed] It was a major plot element in films such as One, Two, Three, The Coca-Cola Kid, and The Gods Must Be Crazy, among many others. It provides a setting for comical corporate shenanigans in the novel Syrup by Maxx Barry. In music, in the Beatles' song, \"Come Together\", the lyrics say, \"He shoot Coca-Cola, he say...\". The Beach Boys also referenced Coca-Cola in their 1964 song \"All Summer Long\" (i.e. \"'Member when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?\")[122]",
