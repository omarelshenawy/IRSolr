			"after": " In aircraft applications the operating speed of an unshrouded propeller is limited since tip speeds approach the sound barrier at lower speeds than an equivalent ducted fan The most common ducted fan arrangement used in full sized aircraft is a turbofan engine where the power to turn the fan is provided by a gas turbine Turbofan engines are used on nearly all airliners fighters and bombers However a ducted fan may be powered by any source of shaft power such as a reciprocating engine Wankel engine or electric motor A kind of ducted fan known as a fantail or by the trademark name Fenestron is also used to replace tail rotors on helicopters Ducted fans usually have an odd number of blades to prevent resonance in the duct ",
