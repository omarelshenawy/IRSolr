			"previous": " Sexual dimorphism in beak size may have affected behaviour Such dimorphism is common in other parrots for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka and in species where it occurs the sexes prefer food of different sizes the males use their beaks in rituals or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing Similarly the large difference between male and female head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex though it is impossible to determine how 5 22 ",
			"after": " Masauji Hachisuka suggested the broad billed parrot was nocturnal like the kakapo and the night parrot two extant ground dwelling parrots Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this and the orbits are of similar size to those of other large diurnal parrots 5 The broad billed parrot was recorded on the dry leeward side of Mauritius which was the most accessible for people and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks like the Cuban amazon The terms raven or crow may have been suggested by the bird s harsh call its behavioural traits or just its dark plumage 5 The following description by Jacob Granaet from 1666 mentions some of the broad billed parrot s co inhabitants of the forests and might indicate its demeanour ",
