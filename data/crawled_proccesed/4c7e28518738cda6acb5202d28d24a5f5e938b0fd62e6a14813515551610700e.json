			"previous": " Renaissance humanists such as Poggio Bracciolini sought out in Europe s monastic libraries the Latin literary historical and oratorical texts of Antiquity while the Fall of Constantinople 1453 generated a wave of migr Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West It is in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the 12th century who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences philosophy and mathematics rather than on such cultural texts ",
			"after": " In the revival of neo Platonism Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity quite the contrary many of the Renaissance s greatest works were devoted to it and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art However a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life 18 In addition many Greek Christian works including the Greek New Testament were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity This new engagement with Greek Christian works and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus would help pave the way for the Protestant Reformation ",
