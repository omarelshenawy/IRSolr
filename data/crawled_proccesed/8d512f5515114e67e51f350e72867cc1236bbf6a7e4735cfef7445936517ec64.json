			"previous": " Land reclamation schemes especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of Cley led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley s wharf 24 Further enclosure in the mid 1820s aggravated the problem and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley 25 In an attempt to halt the decline Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822 but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented and by 1840 almost all of Cley s trade had been lost 24 The population stagnated and the value of all property decreased sharply 25 Blakeney s shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840 but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour 22 ",
