			"previous": " For the traditional geocache a geocacher will place a waterproof container containing a log book with pen or pencil and trade items then record the cache s coordinates These coordinates along with other details of the location are posted on a listing site see list of some sites below Other geocachers obtain the coordinates from that listing site and seek out the cache using their GPS handheld receivers The finding geocachers record their exploits in the logbook and online but then must return the cache to the same coordinates so that other geocachers may find it Geocachers are free to take objects except the logbook pencil or stamp from the cache in exchange for leaving something of similar or higher value ",
			"after": " Typical cache treasures are not high in monetary value but may hold personal value to the finder Aside from the logbook common cache contents are unusual coins or currency small toys ornamental buttons CDs or books Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called hitchhikers such as Travel Bugs or Geocoins whose travels may be logged and followed online Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home or to travel to a certain country or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race Higher value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find called FTF or in locations which are harder to reach Dangerous or illegal items weapons food and drugs are generally not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites ",
