			"after": " A structural keel is a beam around which the hull of a ship is built The keel runs in the middle of the ship from the bow to the stern and serves as a basic foundation or spine of the structure providing the major source of structural strength of the hull The keel is generally the first part of a ship s hull to be constructed and laying the keel or placing the keel in the cradle in which the ship will be built is often a momentous event in a ship s construction so much so that the event is often marked with a ceremony and the term lay the keel has entered the language as a phrase meaning the beginning of any significant undertaking Modern ships are now largely built in a series of pre fabricated complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel so the start of the shipbuilding process is now considered to be when the first sheet of steel is cut ",
