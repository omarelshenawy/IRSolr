			"after": " Less than three days after the disaster a contract was signed for the ship to be raised However those efforts were unsuccessful 31 The earliest attempts at raising Vasa by English engineer Ian Bulmer resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery 31 Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise Vasa more than 300 years later Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck and ropes attached to several anchors were sent down and hooked to the ship The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe the ropes tightened and the water pumped out The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level Even if the underwater weight of Vasa was not great the mud in which it had settled made it sit more secure on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome 32 More than 30 years after the ship s sinking in 1663 1665 Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns With a simple diving bell the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them 33 ",
