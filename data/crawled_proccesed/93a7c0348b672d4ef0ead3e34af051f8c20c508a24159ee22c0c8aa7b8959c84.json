			"previous": " The first F 14B was to be an improved version of the F 14A with more powerful Advanced Technology Engine F401 turbofans The F 14C was a projected variant of this initial F 14B with advanced multi mission avionics 75 Grumman also offered an interceptor version of the F 14B in response to the U S Air Force s Improved Manned Interceptor Program to replace the Convair F 106 Delta Dart as an Aerospace Defense Command interceptor in the 1970s The F 14B program was terminated in April 1974 76 ",
			"after": " Grumman proposed a few improved Super Tomcat versions The first was the Quickstrike which was an F 14D with navigational and targeting pods additional attach points for weapons and added ground attack capabilities to its radar The Quickstrike was to fill the role of the A 6 Intruder after it was retired This was not considered enough of an improvement by Congress so the company shifted to the Super Tomcat 21 proposed design The Super Tomcat 21 was a proposed lower cost alternative to the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter NATF The Grumman design would have the same shape and body as the Tomcat and an upgraded AN APG 71 radar New GE F110 129 engines were to provide a supercruise speed of Mach 1 3 and featured thrust vectoring nozzles The version would have increased fuel capacity and modified control surfaces for improved takeoffs and lower landing approach speed The Attack Super Tomcat 21 version was the last Super Tomcat proposed design It added even more fuel capacity more improvements to control surfaces and possibly an active electronically scanned array AESA radar from the canceled A 12 attack aircraft 77 ",
