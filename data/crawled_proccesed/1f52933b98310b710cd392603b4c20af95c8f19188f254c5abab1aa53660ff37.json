			"previous": " Barnes was selected for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937 38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain affected match Against the touring New Zealanders Barnes fell just short of his maiden first class century scoring 97 16 He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127 not out against Western Australia but the New South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first class status angering Barnes 16 He finally scored his maiden first class century 110 against Victoria in the final game of the season completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick 17 As a result of his performances over the season scoring over 800 runs averaging 50 56 18 Barnes was selected as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938 19 ",
			"after": " Unfortunately for Barnes he broke his wrist while exercising on the sea voyage to England for the 1938 tour 20 keeping the injury secret until the tourists had departed Gibraltar for fear of being sent home 21 On arrival in England he therefore did not play an innings until the last day of June missing exactly half of the 30 first class matches scheduled for the tour including the first two Tests both of which were drawn His first innings was 42 against Derbyshire and he shared in a fourth wicket stand of 176 with Bill Brown who made an unbeaten 265 22 The third Test was a wash out and he was not picked for the fourth which the Australians won although in his autobiography he claimed that he was considered as a candidate to be wicketkeeper having deputised for Ben Barnett in that role in tour matches against Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire 23 In the event his Test d but came in the final Test played at The Oval 24 Barnes had to field for 16 hours as England amassed a total of 903 for seven declared then the highest Test score 25 Barnes bowled 38 overs in the innings and took the seventh wicket that of Arthur Wood for 84 runs With both Don Bradman and Jack Fingleton injured and unable to bat Australia struggled England won by an innings and 579 runs still the largest winning margin in Test cricket history 26 but Barnes played innings of 41 and 33 and according to Wisden well justified his choice 27 In all first class matches on the tour Barnes scored 720 runs and reached 90 three times though without going on to a first class century He scored 140 in a two day match against Durham which was not considered first class 28 ",
