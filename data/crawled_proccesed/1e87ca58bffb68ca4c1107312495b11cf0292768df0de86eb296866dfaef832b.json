			"previous": " About 4 8 million people lived in the Santa Ana River basin as of 2000 15 16 Most of the population is concentrated close to the river in urban centers such as San Bernardino Riverside and Santa Ana In the Inland Empire most people live in a thin ribbon of land along the river while the rest of the land is used for agriculture and ranching In Orange County however nearly all the land is urban As a result the Santa Ana River watershed can be thought of as having two distinct parts separated by the Santa Ana Mountains Some major bodies of water in the watershed include Lake Elsinore Lake Irvine Lake Mathews Lake Perris Diamond Valley Lake Lake Skinner and Big Bear Lake 16 Only one Lake Elsinore is naturally formed 16 The rest are all formed by dams constructed by county or state water agencies As an example Diamond Valley Lake is for the California State Water Project ",
			"after": " Several major Southern California drainage basins border on that of the Santa Ana River In the northwest is the San Gabriel River another major river with its mouth in Long Beach On the southwest the San Diego Creek watershed forms much of the boundary within Orange County Some of the rivers and streams that drain the area between the southwestern boundary of the watershed and the Pacific Ocean are Aliso Creek San Juan Creek 17 San Mateo Creek the Santa Margarita River and the San Luis Rey River On the east are the drainage basins of the Whitewater River and the Coachella Valley flowing into the Salton Sea 16 and on the north is the Mojave River which flows into the endorheic basin of the Mojave Desert ",
