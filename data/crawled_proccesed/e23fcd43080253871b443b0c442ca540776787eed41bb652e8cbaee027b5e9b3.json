			"previous": " From 1909 Adler s views on topics such as neurosis began to differ markedly from those held by Freud As Adler s position appeared increasingly incompatible with Freudianism a series of confrontations between their respective viewpoints took place at the meetings of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society in January and February 1911 In February 1911 Adler the then president of the society resigned his position At this time Stekel also resigned his position as vice president of the society Adler finally left the Freudian group altogether in June 1911 to found his own organization with nine other members who had also resigned from the group 65 This new formation was initially called Society for Free Psychoanalysis but it was soon renamed the Society for Individual Psychology In the period after World War I Adler became increasingly associated with a psychological position he devised called individual psychology 66 ",
			"after": " In 1912 Jung published Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido published in English in 1916 as Psychology of the Unconscious making it clear that his views were taking a direction quite different from those of Freud To distinguish his system from psychoanalysis Jung called it analytical psychology 67 Anticipating the final breakdown of the relationship between Freud and Jung Ernest Jones initiated the formation of a committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical coherence and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement Formed in the autumn of 1912 the committee comprised Freud Jones Abraham Ferenczi Rank and Hanns Sachs Max Eitingon joined the committee in 1919 Each member pledged themselves not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of psychoanalytic theory before they had discussed their views with the others After this development Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the Jarhbuch and then as president of the IPA in April 1914 The Z rich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July 68 ",
