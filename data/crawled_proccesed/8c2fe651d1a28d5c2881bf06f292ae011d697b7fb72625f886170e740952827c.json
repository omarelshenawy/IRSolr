			"previous": " The evolutionary development of the Komodo dragon started with the Varanus genus which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to Australia Around 15 million years ago a collision between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed the varanids to move into what is now the Indonesian archipelago extending their range as far east as the island of Timor The Komodo dragon was believed to have differentiated from its Australian ancestors 4 million years ago However recent fossil evidence from Queensland suggests the Komodo dragon evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia 1 13 Dramatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial period uncovered extensive stretches of continental shelf that the Komodo dragon colonized becoming isolated in their present island range as sea levels rose afterwards 1 12 ",
			"after": " In the wild an adult Komodo dragon usually weighs around 70 kg 150 lb although captive specimens often weigh more 14 According to the Guinness Book of World Records an average adult male will weigh 79 to 91 kg 174 to 201 lb and measure 2 59 m 8 5 ft while an average female will weigh 68 to 73 kg 150 to 161 lb and measure 2 29 m 7 5 ft 15 The largest verified wild specimen was 3 13 m 10 3 ft long and weighed 166 kg 366 lb including undigested food 12 The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body as well as about 60 frequently replaced serrated teeth that can measure up to 2 5 cm 1 in in length Its saliva is frequently blood tinged because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding 16 This creates an ideal culture for the bacteria that live in its mouth 17 It also has a long yellow deeply forked tongue 12 Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain mail 18 19 This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin poorly suited for making into leather ",
