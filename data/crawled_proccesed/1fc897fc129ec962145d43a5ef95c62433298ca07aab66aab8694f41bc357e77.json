			"previous": " Historically lemurs ranged across the entire island inhabiting a wide variety of habitats including dry deciduous forests lowland forests spiny thickets subhumid forests montane forest and mangrove Today their collective range is restricted to 10 of the island or approximately 60 000 km2 23 000 sq mi 54 Most of the remaining forests and lemurs are found along the periphery of the island The center of the island the Hauts Plateaux was converted by early settlers to rice paddies and grassland through slash and burn agriculture known locally as tavy As erosion depleted the soil the cyclical forest regrowth and burning ended as the forest gradually failed to return 55 Today the level of floral diversity increases with precipitation from the dry southern forests to the wetter northern forests to the rainforests along the east coast Increased foliage corresponds to increased faunal diversity including the diversity and complexity of lemur communities 16 ",
			"after": " Having evolved in Madagascar s challenging environment replete with poor soils extreme shifts in poor seasonal plant productivity and devastating climatic events such as extended droughts and annual cyclones 15 lemurs have adopted unique combinations of unusual traits to survive distinguishing them significantly from other primates In response to limited seasonal resources lemurs may exhibit seasonal fat storage hypometabolism including torpor and hibernation in some cheirogaleids small group sizes low encephalization relative brain size cathemerality activity both day and night and or strict breeding seasons 15 56 Secondarily extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are thought to have resulted in three other relatively common lemur traits female dominance sexual monomorphism lack of size differences between the sexes and male male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism conflict such as sperm competition 57 ",
