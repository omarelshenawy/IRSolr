			"after": " The country is home to some of the world s rarest plants and animals but human habitation and the introduction of non native species have threatened its indigenous flora and fauna 42 Due to its volcanic origin age isolation and its unique terrain Mauritius is home to a diversity of flora and fauna not usually found in such a small area Before its discovery by the Portuguese in 1507 there were no terrestrial mammals on the island This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species The arrival of man saw the introduction of invasive alien species and the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna Less than 2 of the native forest that once stretched from the mountain tops of the central plateau to the shore now remains concentrated in the Black River Gorges National Park in the southwest the Bamboo Mountain Range in the southeast and the Moka Port Louis Ranges in the northwest There are also some isolated mountains Corps de Garde Le Morne Brabant and several offshore islands with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened Conservation activities began in the 1980s with the implementation of programmes for the reproduction of threatened bird and plant species as well as habitat restoration in the national parks and nature reserves 53 ",
