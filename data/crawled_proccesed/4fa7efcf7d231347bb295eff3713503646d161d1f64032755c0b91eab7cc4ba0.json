			"after": " It was during the mid 2000s that alternative hip hop finally secured a place within the mainstream due in part to the crossover success of artists such as OutKast Kanye West and Gnarls Barkley 17 Not only did OutKast s Speakerboxxx The Love Below receive high acclaim from music critics manage to appeal to listeners of all ages and span numerous musical genres including rap rock R B punk jazz indie country pop electronica and gospel but it also spawned two number one hit singles and has been certified diamond by selling 11 times platinum by the RIAA for shipping more than 11 million units 130 becoming one of the best selling hip hop albums of all time as well as winning a Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards being only the second rap album to do so Industry observers view the sales race between Kanye West s Graduation and 50 Cent s Curtis as a turning point for hip hop West emerged the victor selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap if not more so 131 Although he designed it as a melancholic pop rather than rap Kanye s following 808s Heartbreak would have a significant effect on hip hop music While his decision to sing about love loneliness and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album predicted to be a flop its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music 132 133 During the release of The Blueprint 3 New York rap mogul Jay Z revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort stating it s not gonna be a 1 album That s where I m at right now I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made 134 Jay Z elaborated that like Kanye he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop was being inspired by indie rockers like Grizzly Bear and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip hop 135 ",
