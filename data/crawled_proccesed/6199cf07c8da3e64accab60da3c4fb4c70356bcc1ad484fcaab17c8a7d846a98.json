			"previous": " In the early years of the republic Istanbul was overlooked in favor of Ankara selected as Turkey s capital to distance the new secular country from its Ottoman history 71 However starting from the late 1940s and early 1950s Istanbul underwent great structural change as new public squares boulevards and avenues were constructed throughout the city sometimes at the expense of historical buildings 72 The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis This sudden sharp rise in the city s population caused a large demand for housing development and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul 73 ",
