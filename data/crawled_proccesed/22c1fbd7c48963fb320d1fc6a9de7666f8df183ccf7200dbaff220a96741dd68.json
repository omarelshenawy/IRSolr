			"previous": " In 2007 the first commercially operated solar tower power plant the PS10 solar power tower was commissioned It has a capacity of eleven megawatt and it is located near Sevilla in Sanl car la Mayor Spain DLR is prominently involved in developing the technology for this type of power plant 11 In solar tower power plants sun tracking mirrors heliostats redirect the solar radiation onto a central heat exchanger receiver on top of a tower This generates high temperature process heat which can then be used in gas or steam turbine power plants to generate electrical power for the public electricity grid In the future solar thermal tower plant technology could also be used to generate solar fuels such as hydrogen without CO2 emissions ",
