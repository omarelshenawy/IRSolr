			"previous": " In 1891 she exhibited a series of highly original colored drypoint and aquatint prints including Woman Bathing and The Coiffure inspired by the Japanese masters shown in Paris the year before See Japonism Cassatt was attracted to the simplicity and clarity of Japanese design and the skillful use of blocks of color In her interpretation she used primarily light delicate pastel colors and avoided black a forbidden color among the Impressionists Adelyn D Breeskin Cassatt s most noted historian and the author of two catalogue raisonn s of her work notes that these colored prints now stand as her most original contribution adding a new chapter to the history of graphic arts technically as color prints they have never been surpassed 60 ",
			"after": " Also in 1891 Chicago businesswoman Bertha Palmer approached Cassatt to paint a 12 58 mural about Modern Woman for the Women s Building for the World s Columbian Exposition to be held in 1893 Cassatt completed the project over the next two years while living in France with her mother The mural was designed as a triptych The central theme was titled Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science The left panel was Young Girls Pursuing Fame and the right panel Arts Music Dancing The mural displays a community of women apart from their relation to men as accomplished persons in their own right Palmer considered Cassatt to be an American treasure and could think of no one better to paint a mural at an exposition that was to do so much to focus the world s attention on the status of women 61 Unfortunately the mural did not survive following the run of the exhibition when the building was torn down Cassatt made several studies and paintings on themes similar to those in the mural so it is possible to see her development of those ideas and images 62 Cassatt also exhibited other paintings in the Exposition ",
