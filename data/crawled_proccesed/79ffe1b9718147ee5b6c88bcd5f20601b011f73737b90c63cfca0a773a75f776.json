			"previous": " In February 1999 the city announced it was negotiating with Frank Gehry to design a proscenium arch and orchestra enclosure for a bandshell as well as a pedestrian bridge crossing Columbus Drive and that it was seeking donors to cover his work 16 17 At the time the Chicago Tribune dubbed Gehry the hottest architect in the universe 18 in reference to the acclaim for his Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and they noted the designs would not include Mayor Richard M Daley s trademarks such as wrought iron and seasonal flower boxes 18 Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said Frank is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture 16 and noted that no other architect was being sought 16 Gehry was approached several times by Skidmore architect Adrian Smith on behalf of the city 19 His hesitance and refusal to accept the commission was overcome by Cindy Pritzker the philanthropist who had developed a relationship with the architect when he won the Pritzker Prize in 1989 According to John H Bryan who led fund raising for the park Pritzker enticed Gehry in face to face discussions using a 15 million funding commitment toward the bandshell s creation 20 Having Gehry get involved helped the city realize its vision of having modern themes in the park upon rumors of his involvement the Chicago Sun Times proclaimed Perhaps the future has arrived 16 while the Chicago Tribune noted that The most celebrated architect in the world may soon have a chance to bring Chicago into the 21st Century 19 ",
