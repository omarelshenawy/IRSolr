			"after": " Drosera regia plants are fairly large herbs that produce horizontal woody rhizomes and a crown of large linear leaves up to 70 cm 28 in long and 2 cm 0 8 in wide The leaves possess stalked glands tentacles on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly the entire length of the leaf The leaves lack petioles and stipules emerging by circinate vernation uncurling and tapering to a filiform point The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects In its native habitat D regia has been known to capture large beetles moths and butterflies Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud consisting of a tight cluster of short immature leaves Plants begin to break dormancy in mid July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April though this is variable and plants can continue growing year round without dormancy 1 2 3 Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years 4 ",
