			"after": " Researchers reported finding Armillaria gallica in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early 1990s during an unrelated research project to study the possible biological effects of extremely low frequency radio stations which were being investigated as a means to communicate with submerged submarines In one particular forest stand Armillaria infected oak trees had been harvested and their stumps were left to rot in the field Later when red pines were planted in the same location the seedlings were killed by the fungus identified as A gallica then known as A bulbosa Using molecular genetics they determined that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered 15 ha 37 acres weighing over 9 500 kilograms 21 000 lb with an estimated age of 1 500 years 38 39 The analysis used restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP and random amplification of polymorphic DNA RAPD to examine isolates collected from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots along 1 kilometer 0 6 mi transects in the forest The 15 hectare area yielded isolates that had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment patterns this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual or clone that had reached its size through vegetative growth In their conclusion the authors noted This is the first report estimating the minimum size mass and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth 40 After the Nature paper was published major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found as a result of this publicity the individual acquired the common name humongous fungus 39 There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood 41 ",
