			"previous": " Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour meaning the plain colour of an object such as basic red for a red robe rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light shade and reflection A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon This is evident in for example the art of India Tibet and Japan ",
			"after": " The long story of African Art includes both high sculpture perhaps typified by the brass castings of the Benin people as well as folk art In the ancient world Egypt is often thought of as the greatest artistic culture of Africa but it is also rivaled by Nubia which was located in present day Sudan Concurrent with the European Middle Ages in the eleventh century CE a nation that made grand architecture gold sculpture and intricate jewelry was founded in Great Zimbabwe Impressive sculpture was concurrently being cast from brass by the Yoruba people of what is now Nigeria Such a culture grew and was ultimately transformed to become the Benin Kingdom where elegant altar tusks brass heads plaques of brass and palatial architecture was created The Benin Kingdom was ended by the British in 1897 and little of the historical art now remains in Nigeria Today the most significant arts venue in Africa is the Johannesburg Biennale ",
