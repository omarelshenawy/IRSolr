			"previous": " The reaction of technetium with hydrogen produces the negatively charged hydride TcH2 9 ion which has the same type of crystal structure as is isostructural with ReH2 9 It consists of a trigonal prism with a technetium atom in the center and six hydrogen atoms at the corners Three more hydrogen atoms make a triangle lying parallel to the base and crossing the prism in its center Although those hydrogen atoms are not equivalent geometrically their electronic structure is almost the same This complex has a coordination number of 9 meaning that the technetium atom has nine neighbors which is the highest for a technetium complex Two hydrogen atoms in the complex can be replaced by sodium Na or potassium K ions 28 ",
			"after": " Metallic technetium slowly tarnishes in moist air 25 and in powder form will burn in oxygen Two oxides have been observed TcO2 and Tc2O7 Under oxidizing conditions which tend to strip electrons from atoms technetium VII will exist as the pertechnetate ion TcO 4 21 25 ",
