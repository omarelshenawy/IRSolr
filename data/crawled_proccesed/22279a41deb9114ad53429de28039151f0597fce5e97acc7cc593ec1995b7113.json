			"previous": " In some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder in which case it is said to be double acting ",
			"after": " In most types the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a crankshaft or by a swashplate or other suitable mechanism A flywheel is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un powered part of the cycle The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has generally the more vibration free smoothly it can operate The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons displacement ",
