			"after": " The rate of a reaction is dependent on the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state First binding forms a low energy enzyme substrate complex ES Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction ES Finally the enzyme product complex EP dissociates to release the products 1 8 3",
