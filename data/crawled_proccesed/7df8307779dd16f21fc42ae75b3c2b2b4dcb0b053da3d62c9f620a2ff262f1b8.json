			"after": " In steam powered ships compelling advantages of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size lower maintenance lighter weight and lower vibration A steam turbine is only efficient when operating in the thousands of RPM while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 RPM consequently precise thus expensive reduction gears are usually required although numerous early ships through World War I such as Turbinia had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts Another alternative is turbo electric transmission in which an electrical generator run by the high speed turbine is used to run one or more slow speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime Turbo electric drive was most used in large US warships designed during World War I and in some fast liners and was used in some troop transports and mass production destroyer escorts in World War II The purchase cost of turbines is offset by much lower fuel and maintenance requirements and the small size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power However from the 1950s diesel engines were capable of greater reliability and higher efficiencies propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50 yet diesel engines today routinely exceed 50 especially in marine applications 24 25 26 Diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required Thus conventional steam power is used in very few new ships An exception is LNG carriers which often find it more efficient to use boil off gas with a steam turbine than to re liquify it ",
