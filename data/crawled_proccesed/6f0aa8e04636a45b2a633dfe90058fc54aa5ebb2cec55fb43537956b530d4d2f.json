			"after": " Until the Normans invaded England the manors surrounding Altrincham were owned by the Saxon thegn Alweard after the invasion they became the property of Hamon de Massey 3 5 though Altrincham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book The earliest documented reference to the town is from 1290 6 when it was granted its charter as a Free Borough by Baron Hamon de Massey V 7 The charter allowed a weekly market to be held and it is possible that de Massey established the town to generate income through taxes on trade and tolls This suggests that Altrincham may have been a planned market town unusual during the Middle Ages when most communities were agricultural 8 Altrincham was probably chosen as the site of the planned town rather than Dunham which would have been protected by Dunham Castle because its good access to roads was important for trade 9 ",
