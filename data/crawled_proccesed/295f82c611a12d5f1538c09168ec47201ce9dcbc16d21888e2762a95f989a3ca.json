			"previous": " By contrast bioengineering is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches not necessarily the altering or using of biological materials directly for interfacing with and utilizing living things Bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and natural sciences to tissues cells and molecules This can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals 8 Relatedly biomedical engineering is an overlapping field that often draws upon and applies biotechnology by various definitions especially in certain sub fields of biomedical and or chemical engineering such as tissue engineering biopharmaceutical engineering and genetic engineering ",
