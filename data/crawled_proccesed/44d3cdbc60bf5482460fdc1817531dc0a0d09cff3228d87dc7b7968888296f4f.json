			"after": " Although sporadic work at what became known as the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Emery County Utah had taken place as early as 1927 and the fossil site itself described by William J Stokes in 1945 47 major operations did not begin there until 1960 Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40 institutions thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965 4 The quarry is notable for the predominance of Allosaurus remains the condition of the specimens and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be The majority of bones belong to the large theropod Allosaurus fragilis it is estimated that the remains of at least 46 A fragilis have been found there out of at minimum 73 dinosaurs and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well mixed Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the taphonomy of the site suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog to becoming trapped in deep mud to falling victim to drought induced mortality around a waterhole to getting trapped in a spring fed pond or seep 48 Regardless of the actual cause the great quantity of well preserved Allosaurus remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail making it among the best known theropods Skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes from less than 1 meter 3 3 feet 49 to 12 meters 39 feet long and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused 4 ",
