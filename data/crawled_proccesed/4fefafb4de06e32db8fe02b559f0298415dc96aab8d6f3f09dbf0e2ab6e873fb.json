			"after": " Due to the volume and seasonality of precipitation in its valley the Willamette River has often flooded In 1861 rainstorms and warm temperatures combined with a well above average snowpack in the Cascades created the largest Willamette River flood in recorded history An observer of the flood wrote The whole Willamette valley sic was a sheet of water 96 From Eugene to Portland thousands of acres of rich riverside farmland were washed away and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed The Great Flood as it is sometimes called was massively destructive to human development because most of that development was located in the river s floodplain Floodplain locations offer easy access to river transportation and the best soils for farming The 1861 flood peaked at 635 000 cubic feet per second 18 000 m3 s more than the Mississippi River usually discharges in the 21st century and inundated some 353 000 acres 1 430 km2 of land 6 96 97 ",
