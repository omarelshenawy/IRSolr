			"previous": " Temperatures in the region are fairly constant with both the daily temperature range and the seasonal range varying only slightly February is the hottest month averaging 25 C 77 F while August is the coolest averaging 19 C 66 F 16 Climbing the peaks temperature decreases by 1 C per 200 m of increased altitude 1 F per 360 ft and temperatures on the summit decline to 1 5 C 34 7 F in July 20 The relative humidity for the region hovers around 87 throughout most of the year although it rises to 97 between March and April 16 Rain falls every month on the southern side of the mountain with the region receiving at least 2 300 mm 91 in of rain annually 13 making it one of the wettest areas in Madagascar 16 18 The northern side of the mountain is more tropical with a 6 month dry season and receives about 1 500 mm 59 in of rain per year 13 The general region receives the most rainfall during the warm season from November through April when heavy rain and occasional cyclones are delivered from the northwest by monsoons During the cooler season between May and October lighter rains are delivered by winds from the southeast ",
			"after": " Both temperature and rainfall vary significantly by location within the park Lower temperatures are found at higher elevations 16 and the eastern slopes of the massif receive the most of the rainfall since the western slopes lie in the rain shadow of the mountain and consequently experience a prolonged dry period 16 17 The tops of the ridges experience strong winds and offer poor soil conditions The effect can be seen in the plant life and their growth rates The wide range in elevations and the rugged topography also play a crucial role in creation of the varied habitats distributed across the mountain slopes by affecting air temperature fluctuations in temperature and humidity levels The interplay between these factors impacts the growth and development of plants which form the foundation of the ecosystem The result is an extremely varied and unevenly distributed forest that covers 90 of the park 17 ",
