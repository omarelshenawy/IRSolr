			"previous": " By 1915 Americans were paying much more attention to the war The sinking of the Lusitania had a strong effect on public opinion because of the deaths of American civilians That year a strong Preparedness movement emerged 63 Proponents argued that the United States needed to immediately build up strong naval and land forces for defensive purposes an unspoken assumption was that America would fight sooner or later General Leonard Wood still on active duty after serving a term as Chief of Staff of the Army former president Theodore Roosevelt and former secretaries of war Elihu Root and Henry Stimson were the driving forces behind Preparedness along with many of the nation s most prominent bankers industrialists lawyers and scions of prominent families Indeed there emerged an Atlanticist foreign policy establishment a group of influential Americans drawn primarily from upper class lawyers bankers academics and politicians of the Northeast committed to a strand of Anglophile internationalism Representative was Paul D Cravath one of New York s foremost corporation lawyers For Cravath in his mid fifties when the war began the conflict served as an epiphany sparking an interest in international affairs that dominated his remaining career Fiercely Anglophile he strongly supported American intervention in the war and hoped that close Anglo American cooperation would be the guiding principle of postwar international organization 64 ",
			"after": " The Preparedness movement had a realistic philosophy of world affairs they believed that economic strength and military muscle were more decisive than idealistic crusades focused on causes like democracy and national self determination Emphasizing over and over the weak state of national defenses they showed that America s 100 000 man Army even augmented by the 112 000 National Guardsmen was outnumbered 20 to one by Germany s army which was drawn from a smaller population Reform to them meant UMT or universal military training They proposed a national service program under which the 600 000 men who turned 18 every year would be required to spend six months in military training and afterwards be assigned to reserve units The small regular army would primarily be a training agency ",
