			"previous": " Elephants have been represented in art since Paleolithic times Africa in particular contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals especially in the Sahara and southern Africa 177 In the Far East the animals are depicted as motifs in Hindu and Buddhist shrines and temples 178 Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first hand experience with them 179 The ancient Romans who kept the animals in captivity depicted anatomically accurate elephants on mosaics in Tunisia and Sicily At the beginning of Middle Ages when Europeans had little to no access to the animals elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures They were often depicted with horse or bovine like bodies with trumpet like trunks and tusks like a boar some were even given hooves Elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the Gothic churches As more elephants began to be sent to European kings as gifts during the 15th century depictions of them became more accurate including one made by Leonardo da Vinci Despite this some Europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion 180 Max Ernst s 1921 surrealist painting The Elephant Celebes depicts an elephant as a silo with a trunk like hose protruding from it 181 ",
			"after": " Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs The Mbuti people believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants 178 Similar ideas existed among other African tribes who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants During the 10th century AD the people of Igbo Ukwu buried their leaders with elephant tusks 182 The animals religious importance is only totemic in Africa 183 but is much more significant in Asia In Sumatra elephants have been associated with lightning Likewise in Hinduism they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata the father of all elephants represents both lightning and rainbows 178 One of the most important Hindu deities the elephant headed Ganesha is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva Vishnu and Brahma 184 Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires 178 In Buddhism Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human 185 In Islamic tradition the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant 186 Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars 178 The Land of a Million Elephants was the name of the ancient kingdom of Lan Xang and later the Lan Chang Province and it is now a nickname for Laos ",
