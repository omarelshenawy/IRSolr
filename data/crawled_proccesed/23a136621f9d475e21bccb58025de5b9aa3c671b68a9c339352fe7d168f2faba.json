			"previous": " Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals As a result birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal 74 The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction and become more rigid as they move away from the heart Blood moves through the arteries which undergo vasoconstriction and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body 75 As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart Veins unlike arteries are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart 75 Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body ",
