			"after": " Icelandic retains many grammatical features of other ancient Germanic languages and resembles Old Norwegian before much of its fusional inflection was lost Modern Icelandic is still a heavily inflected language with four cases nominative accusative dative and genitive Icelandic nouns can have one of three grammatical genders masculine feminine or neuter There are two main declension paradigms for each gender strong and weak nouns which are furthermore divided in sub classes of nouns based primarily on the genitive singular and nominative plural ending of a particular noun For example within the masculine nouns that have a strong declension there is a sub class class 1 that declines with an s Hests in the genitive singular and ar Hestar in the nominative plural However there is another sub class class 3 of strong masculine nouns that always declines with ar Hlutar in the genitive singular and ir Hlutir in the nominative plural Additionally Icelandic permits a quirky subject which is a phenomenon whereby certain verbs specify that their subjects are to be in a case other than the nominative ",
