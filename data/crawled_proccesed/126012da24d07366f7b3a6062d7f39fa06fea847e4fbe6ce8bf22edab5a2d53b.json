			"previous": " During the 1950s the United States experienced prolonged prosperity and solidified its place as a world leader Public Administration experienced a kind of heyday due to the successful war effort and successful post war reconstruction in Western Europe and Japan Government was popular as was President Eisenhower In the 1960s and 1970s government itself came under fire as ineffective inefficient and largely a wasted effort The costly American intervention in Vietnam along with domestic scandals including the bugging of Democratic party headquarters the 1974 Watergate scandal are two examples of self destructive government behavior that alienated citizens ",
			"after": " There was a call by citizens for efficient administration to replace ineffective wasteful bureaucracy Public administration would have to distance itself from politics to answer this call and remain effective Elected officials supported these reforms The Hoover Commission chaired by University of Chicago professor Louis Brownlow to examine reorganization of government Brownlow subsequently founded the Public Administration Service PAS at the university an organization which has provided consulting services to all levels of government until the 1970s citation needed ",
