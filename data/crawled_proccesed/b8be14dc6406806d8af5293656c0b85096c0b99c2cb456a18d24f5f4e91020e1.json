			"previous": " In preparation Johnson wrote a Plan for the Dictionary Philip Stanhope 4th Earl of Chesterfield was the patron of the Plan to Johnson s displeasure 82 Seven years after first meeting Johnson to go over the work Chesterfield wrote two anonymous essays in The World recommending the Dictionary 83 He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary Johnson did not like the tone of the essays and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the work s patron 84 In a letter to Chesterfield Johnson expressed this view and harshly criticised Chesterfield saying Is not a patron my lord one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water and when he has reached ground encumbers him with help The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours had it been early had been kind but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it till I am solitary and cannot impart it till I am known and do not want it 85 Chesterfield impressed by the language kept the letter displayed on a table for anyone to read 85 ",
			"after": " The Dictionary was finally published in April 1755 with the title page acknowledging that Oxford had awarded Johnson a Master of Arts degree in anticipation of the work 86 The dictionary as published was a huge book Its pages were nearly 18 inches 46 cm tall and the book was 20 inches 51 cm wide when opened it contained 42 773 entries to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions and it sold for the extravagant price of 4 10s perhaps the rough equivalent of 350 today 87 An important innovation in English lexicography was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation of which there were approximately 114 000 The authors most frequently cited include William Shakespeare John Milton and John Dryden 88 It was years before Johnson s Dictionary as it came to be known turned a profit Authors royalties were unknown at the time and Johnson once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled received no further money from its sale Years later many of its quotations would be repeated by various editions of the Webster s Dictionary and the New English Dictionary 89 ",
