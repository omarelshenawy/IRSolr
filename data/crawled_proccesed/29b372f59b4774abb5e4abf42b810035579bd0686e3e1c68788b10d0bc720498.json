			"previous": " There have been many proposals to preserve the Arctic over the years Most recently a group of stars at the Rio Earth Summit on June 21 2012 proposed protecting the Arctic similar to the Antarctic protection The initial focus of the campaign will be a UN resolution creating a global sanctuary around the pole and a ban on oil drilling and unsustainable fishing in the Arctic 27 ",
			"after": " The Arctic is especially vulnerable to the effects of any climate change as has become apparent with the reduction of sea ice in recent years Climate models predict much greater warming in the Arctic than the global average 30 resulting in significant international attention to the region In particular there are concerns that Arctic shrinkage a consequence of melting glaciers and other ice in Greenland could soon contribute to a substantial rise in sea levels worldwide 31 The climate models on which the IPCC report Nr 4 is based give a range of predictions of Arctic sea ice loss showing near complete to complete loss in September anywhere from 2040 to some time well beyond 2100 About half of the analyzed models show near complete to complete sea ice loss in September by the year 2100 3 More recently the Catlin Arctic Survey concluded that summer ice loss would occur around 2029 32 33 It has been apparent though since 2007 that those models grossly underestimate sea ice loss 34 ",
