			"after": " Salim Tamari notes the paradoxes produced by the search for nativist roots among Zionist figures and the so called Canaanite followers of Yonatan Ratosh 108 For example Ber Borochov one of the key ideological architects of Socialist Zionism claimed as early as 1905 that The Fellahin in Eretz Israel are the descendants of remnants of the Hebrew agricultural community 109 believing them to be descendants of the ancient Hebrew and Canaanite residents together with a small admixture of Arab blood 108 He further believed that the Palestinian peasantry would embrace Zionism and that the lack of a crystallized national consciousness among Palestinian Arabs would result in their likely assimilation into the new Hebrew nationalism 108 David Ben Gurion and Yitzhak Ben Zvi later becoming Israel s first Prime Minister and second President respectively tried to establish in a 1918 paper written in Yiddish that Palestinian peasants and their mode of life were living historical testimonies to Israelite practices in the biblical period 108 110 Tamari notes that the ideological implications of this claim became very problematic and were soon withdrawn from circulation 108 ",
