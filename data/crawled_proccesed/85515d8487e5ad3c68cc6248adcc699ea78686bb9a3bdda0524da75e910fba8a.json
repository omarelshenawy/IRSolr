			"previous": " It is also possible to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and or columns 67 even if being infinite objects one cannot write down such matrices explicitly All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows and every element in the set indexing columns there is a well defined entry these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers The basic operations of addition subtraction scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries and these are not defined in general ",
			"after": " If infinite matrices are used to describe linear maps then only those matrices can be used all of whose columns have but a finite number of nonzero entries for the following reason For a matrix A to describe a linear map f V W bases for both spaces must have been chosen recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a finite linear combination of basis vectors so that written as a column vector v of coefficients only finitely many entries vi are nonzero Now the columns of A describe the images by f of individual basis vectors of V in the basis of W which is only meaningful if these columns have only finitely many nonzero entries There is no restriction on the rows of A however in the product A v there are only finitely many nonzero coefficients of v involved so every one of its entries even if it is given as an infinite sum of products involves only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore well defined Moreover this amounts to forming a linear combination of the columns of A that effectively involves only finitely many of them whence the result has only finitely many nonzero entries because each of those columns do One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is well defined provided as usual that the column index and row index sets match is again of the same type and corresponds to the composition of linear maps ",
