			"previous": " The 8 000 Australians captured by Germany and Italy were generally treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions The majority of these men were taken during the fighting in Greece and Crete in 1941 with the next largest group being 1 400 airmen shot down over Europe Like other western Allied POWs the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths 192 Four Australians were also executed following a mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944 193 While the Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in World War I it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment 194 ",
			"after": " Like the other Allied personnel captured by the Japanese most of the thousands of Australians captured in the first months of 1942 during the conquest of Malaya and Singapore the NEI and New Guinea were held in harsh conditions Australians were held in camps across the Asia Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease hundreds were deliberately killed by their guards The Burma Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences as 13 000 Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese nearly 2 650 Australians died there 195 Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions 196 The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates 77 percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2 500 Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945 197 ",
