			"after": " One aspect of raccoon behavior is so well known that it gives the animal part of its scientific name Procyon lotor lotor is neo Latin for washer In the wild raccoons often dabble for underwater food near the shore line They then often pick up the food item with their front paws to examine it and rub the item sometimes to remove unwanted parts This gives the appearance of the raccoon washing the food The tactile sensitivity of raccoons paws is increased if this rubbing action is performed underwater since the water softens the hard layer covering the paws 125 However the behavior observed in captive raccoons in which they carry their food to water to wash or douse it before eating has not been observed in the wild 126 Naturalist Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon believed that raccoons do not have adequate saliva production to moisten food thereby necessitating dousing but this hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect 127 Captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream is not farther away than 3 m 10 ft 128 The widely accepted theory is that dousing in captive raccoons is a fixed action pattern from the dabbling behavior performed when foraging at shores for aquatic foods 129 This is supported by the observation that aquatic foods are doused more frequently Cleaning dirty food does not seem to be a reason for washing 128 Experts have cast doubt on the veracity of observations of wild raccoons dousing food 130 ",
