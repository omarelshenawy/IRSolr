			"previous": " The Andalusian horse has been known historically as the Iberian Saddle Horse Iberian War Horse Spanish Horse Portuguese Peninsular Extremeno Villanos Zapata Zamaranos Castilian 6 and Jennet 55 The Portuguese name refers to what is now the Lusitano while the Peninsular Iberian Saddle Horse and Iberian War Horse names refer to horses from the Iberian Peninsula as a whole The Extremeno name refers to Spanish horses from the Extremadura province of Spain and the Zapata or Zapatero name to horses that come from the Zapata family stud The Villano name has occasionally been applied to modern Andalusians but originally referred to heavy crossbred horses from the mountains north of Jaen 56 The Carthusian horse also known as the Carthusian Andalusian and the Cartujano is a sub type of the Andalusian rather than a distinct breed in itself 7 A common nickname for the Andalusian is the Horse of Kings 57 Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same differing only in the country of origin of individual horses 58 ",
			"after": " In many areas today the breeding showing and registration of the Andalusian and Lusitano are controlled by the same registries One example of this is the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association IALHA claimed to have the largest membership of any Andalusian registering organization 4 Other organizations such as The Association of Purebred Spanish Horse Breeders of Spain Asociaci n Nacional de Criadores de Caballo de Pura Raza Espa ola or ANCCE use the term Pura Raza Espa ola or PRE to describe the true Spanish horse and claim sole authority to officially register and issue documentation for PRE Horses both in Spain and anywhere else in the world In most of the world the terms Andalusian and PRE are considered one and the same breed 4 but the public position of the ANCCE is that terms such as Andalusian and Iberian horse refer only to crossbreds which the ANCCE considers to be horses that lack quality and purity without official documentation or registration from official Spanish Stud Book 10 ",
