			"previous": " The Caribbean monk seal was killed and exploited by Europeans settlers and their descendants since 1494 starting with Christopher Columbus himself The seals were easy targets for organized sealers fishermen turtle hunters and buccaneers because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus genetically tame In the Bahamas as many as 100 seals were slaughtered in one night In the mid nineteenth century the species was thought to have gone extinct until a small colony was found near the Yucat n Peninsula in 1886 Seal killings continued and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952 The IUCN declared it extinct in 1996 159 The Japanese sea lion was common around the Japanese islands but overexploitation and competition from fisheries drastically decreased the population in the 1930s The last recorded individual was a juvenile in 1974 160 ",
			"after": " Some species have become so numerous that they conflict with local people In the United States pinnipeds and other marine mammals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 MMPA Since that year California sea lion populations have risen to 250 000 These animals began exploiting more man made environments like docks for haul out sites Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions which causes major tilting and other problems Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them 161 162 Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks 163 In 2007 MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam 164 The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations 165 Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted to ward off the sea lions using bombs rubber bullets and bean bags 166 Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective 167 Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon 166 Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals In the 1980s and 1990s South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually have a negative effect on the fishing industry and the culling option was dropped in 1993 168 ",
