			"previous": " These megaliths are distinguished from other types by the presence of a burial shaft sometimes up to 4 m in depth which is lined with large cobbles 23 A large capstone is placed over the burial shaft without propping stones Capstone style megaliths are the most monumental type in the Korean Peninsula and they are primarily distributed near or on the south coast of Korea It seems that most of these burials date to the latter part of the Middle Mumun c 700 550 BC and they may have been built into the early part of the Late Mumun An example is found near modern Changwon at Deokcheon ni where a small cemetery contained a capstone burial No 1 with a massive rectangularly shaped stone and earthen platform Archaeologists were not able to recover the entire feature but the low platform was at least 56 X 18 m in size ",
