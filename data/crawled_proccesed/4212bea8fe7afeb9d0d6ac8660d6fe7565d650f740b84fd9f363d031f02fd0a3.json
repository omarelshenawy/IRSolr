			"after": " The plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related African sacred ibis and straw necked ibis which are also mainly white and glossy black In the reproductive season the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the African sacred ibis look similar to the feathers of an ostrich which echoes Dubois description Likewise a subfossil lower jaw found in 1994 showed that the bill of the R union ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis which corresponds with Dubois woodcock comparison 18 Cheke and Hume have suggested that the French word b casse from Dubois original description usually translated to woodcock could also mean oystercatcher another bird with a long straight but slightly more robust bill They have also pointed out that the last sentence is mistranslated and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it 2 The bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to iridescence as seen in the straw necked ibis 7 ",
