			"after": " In aeronautics a spoiler sometimes called a lift spoiler or lift dumper is a device intended to reduce lift in an aircraft Spoilers are plates on the top surface of a wing that can be extended upward into the airflow to spoil it By so doing the spoiler creates a controlled stall over the portion of the wing behind it greatly reducing the lift of that wing section Spoilers differ from airbrakes in that airbrakes are designed to increase drag without affecting lift while spoilers reduce lift as well as increasing drag ",
