			"after": " The Book of Kells is one of the finest and most famous of a group of manuscripts in what is known as the Insular style produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in monasteries in Ireland Scotland and England and in continental monasteries with Hiberno Scottish or Anglo Saxon foundations 1 These manuscripts include the Cathach of St Columba the Ambrosiana Orosius fragmentary Gospel in the Durham Dean and Chapter Library all from the early 7th century and the Book of Durrow from the second half of the 7th century From the early 8th century come the Durham Gospels the Echternach Gospels the Lindisfarne Gospels see illustration at right and the Lichfield Gospels Among others the St Gall Gospel Book belongs to the late 8th century and the Book of Armagh dated to 807 809 to the early 9th century 2 Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style script and textual traditions The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series either from the late 8th or early 9th century The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts For example the form of the decorated letters found in the incipit pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels Compare for example the incipit pages of the Gospel of Matthew in the Lindisfarne Gospels and in the Book of Kells both of which feature intricate decorative knot work patterns inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text For a more complete list of related manuscripts see List of Hiberno Saxon illustrated manuscripts 3 ",
