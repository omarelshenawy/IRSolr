			"previous": " Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith removed as head of the Agape Lodge believing that he had become a bad influence on other lodge members Parsons and Helen wrote to them to defend their mentor but Germer nevertheless ordered him to stand down and Parsons was appointed as temporary head of the Lodge 92 Some veteran Lodge members disliked Parsons influence concerned that it encouraged excessive sexual polyandry detrimental to the focused practice of Thelema but his charismatic orations at Lodge meetings compared to those of President Roosevelt assured his popularity among the majority of followers Parsons soon created the Thelemite journal Oriflamme in which he published his own poetry but Crowley was unimpressed particularly due to Parsons descriptions of his prolific drug use and the project was soon shelved 93 Helen gave birth to Smith s son in April the child was named Kwen Lanval Parsons 94 Smith and Helen left with Kwen for a two room cabin in Rainbow Valley in May 95 Concurrently in England Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith s birth chart and came to the conclusion that Smith was the incarnation of a god greatly altering his estimation of him Smith however remained skeptical Crowley s analysis was seemingly deliberately devised in Parsons favor encouraging Smith to step down from his role in the Agape Lodge and instructing him to take a meditative retreat 96 Refusing to take orders from Germer anymore Smith resigned from the OTO Parsons who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict and was weary of Crowley s appalling egotism bad taste bad judgement and pedanticism ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head but withdrew his resignation after receiving a pacifying letter from Crowley 97 ",
			"after": " By the summer of 1943 Aerojet was operating on a budget of 650 000 The same year Parsons and von K rm n traveled to Norfolk Virginia to consult on a new JATO contract for the U S Navy on the invitation of Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox Though JATOs were being mass produced for military applications JATO propelled aircraft could not keep up with larger bomber planes taking off from long aircraft carrier runways which made Aerojet s industry at risk of becoming defunct 98 Parsons demonstrated the efficacy of the newer JATOs to solve this issue by equipping a Grumman plane with solid fuel units its assisted takeoff from the USS Charger was successful but produced smoke containing a noxious yellow colored residue The Navy guaranteed Parsons a contract on the condition that this residue was removed this led to the invention of Aeroplex a technology for smokeless vapor trails developed at Aerojet under Parsons command 99 ",
