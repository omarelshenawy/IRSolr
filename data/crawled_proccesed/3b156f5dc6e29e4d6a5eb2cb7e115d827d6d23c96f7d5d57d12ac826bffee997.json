			"previous": " In January 1995 church lawyer Helena Kobrin attempted to shut down the newsgroup alt religion scientology by sending a control message instructing Usenet servers to delete the group 297 In practice this rmgroup message had little effect since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when sent to groups that receive substantial traffic and newgroup messages were quickly issued to recreate the group on those servers that did not do so However the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free speech advocates 298 299 Among the criticisms raised one suggestion is that Scientology s true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics 300 301 ",
			"after": " The Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the World Wide Web and lobbied for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general The Church supported the controversial Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act as well as the even more controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA Some of the DMCA s provisions notably the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US Internet service providers over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers ",
