			"previous": " During the period 2000 500 BCE in terms of culture many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age 25 The Vedas the oldest scriptures of Hinduism 26 were composed during this period 27 and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain 25 Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo Aryan migration into the subcontinent 28 26 The caste system arose during this period which created a hierarchy of priests warriors free peasants and traders and lastly the indigenous peoples who were regarded as impure and small tribal units gradually coalesced into monarchical state level polities 29 30 On the Deccan Plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation 25 In southern India a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period 31 as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions 31 ",
