			"previous": " Camas pocket gophers cause significant economic losses so may be treated as an agricultural pest Crops damaged include clover alfalfa and vetch 50 The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing This can injure the roots and expose them to air causing them to dry out Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption potatoes carrots parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged 50 An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to 1 5 million annual losses 50 Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt Buried vegetation can also compost enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits 55 ",
			"after": " Proposed methods for controlling gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions 50 clover carrots sweet potatoes and parsnips 10 Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them 10 Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail since the gophers will sometimes wall off a segment of the burrow 10 Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees 55 ",
