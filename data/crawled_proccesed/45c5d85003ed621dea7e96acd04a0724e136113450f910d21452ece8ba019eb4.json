			"previous": " After journeys to India and Pakistan French ethnologist Michel Peissel claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus s Histories 83 In Book 3 passages 102 to 105 Herodotus reports that a species of fox sized furry ants lives in one of the far eastern Indian provinces of the Persian Empire This region he reports is a sandy desert and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust These giant ants according to Herodotus would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust Peissel reports that in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the Deosai Plateau in Gilgit Baltistan province there is a species of marmot the Himalayan marmot a type of burrowing squirrel that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants Much like the province that Herodotus describes the ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust According to Peissel he interviewed the Minaro tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau and they have confirmed that they have for generations been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows Later authors like Pliny the Elder mentioned this story in the gold mining section of his Naturalis Historia ",
			"after": " Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for marmot with the word for mountain ant Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian or any other language except his native Greek and was forced to rely on a many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures he described 83 84 Herodotus did though follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the ants are said to chase and devour full grown camels ",
