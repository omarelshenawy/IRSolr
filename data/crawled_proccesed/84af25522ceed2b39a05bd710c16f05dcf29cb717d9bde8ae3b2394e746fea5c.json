			"previous": " In contrast to his output the previous year Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937 Henry Hathaway s adventure film Souls at Sea 139 A critical and box office failure 140 Cooper referred to it as his almost picture saying It was almost exciting and almost interesting And I was almost good 140 In 1938 he appeared in Archie Mayo s biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo 141 Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay 142 the film became Goldwyn s biggest failure to that date losing 700 000 143 During this period Cooper turned down several important roles 144 including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind 145 Cooper was producer David O Selznick s first choice for the part 145 He made several overtures to the actor 146 but Cooper had doubts about the project 146 and did not feel suited to the role 133 Cooper later admitted It was one of the best roles ever offered in Hollywood But I said no I didn t see myself as quite that dashing and later when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection I knew I was right 133 Note 6 ",
			"after": " Back at Paramount Cooper returned to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch s romantic comedy Bluebeard s Eighth Wife 1938 with Claudette Colbert 143 149 In the film Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France who falls in love with an impoverished aristocrat s daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife 150 Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder 151 and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert 149 audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer 151 For many of his fans Cooper had become Mr Deeds incarnate 151 In the fall of 1938 Cooper appeared in H C Potter s romantic comedy The Cowboy and the Lady with Merle Oberon about a sweet natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful believing her to be a poor hard working lady s maid 152 The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage what could have been a fine vehicle for Cooper 153 While more successful than its predecessor the film was Cooper s fourth consecutive box office failure 154 ",
