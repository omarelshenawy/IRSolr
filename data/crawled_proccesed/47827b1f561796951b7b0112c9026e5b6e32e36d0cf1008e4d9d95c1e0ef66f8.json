			"previous": " Although volunteer enthusiasm was essential to the Association s plans in the Harvest Campaign it did not rely on it at the higher levels the state chairs were compensated both by salary and commission J W Gibbes clerk of the South Carolina House of Representatives was hired as that state s executive director he undertook to sell 100 000 coins and received just under 3 500 in salary and commissions all paid in 1926 Local volunteers organized Chamber of Commerce luncheons to sell coins throughout the South chapters of the UDC purchased pieces to present to surviving Civil War veterans 46 Mrs N Burton Bass of Atlanta was reported to be the leading seller once disposing of 233 coins in an afternoon A series of dance balls honored the UDC members who sold large numbers of pieces Nevertheless Hyder and Colbert suggested that there was a general lack of more ladies such as Mrs Bass many municipalities had trouble finding local chairs 47 Outside the South sales were promoted by three professional publicists hired by the Association 48 To keep public interest high the Association released Lukeman s conceptions for Stone Mountain which were on a smaller scale than Borglum s 49 Lukeman conceived a scaled down concept of the three Confederate leaders on horseback 5 Despite the campaign sales were slower than expected 50 In late 1925 the Association offered Northern banks a commission of seven cents a coin it is uncertain if any took up the offer 51 The continuing opposition of the GAR to the coins dampened sales in the North 52 ",
			"after": " One means of fundraising that Harvest Campaign administrators decided on was to counterstamp some of the coins for sale at premium prices The letters and numbers are believed to have been punched by the Association as they are almost entirely uniform Some were given a state abbreviation and a number and were sent to be auctioned in various towns Gibbes reported that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for an average of 23 ranging from 10 to 110 and recommended that the auctions be preceded with the account of the sale of one in Bradenton Florida for 1 300 53 Which town got which number was the luck of the draw 54 Others were marked with U D C and a state abbreviation together with a number which probably represents a membership or chapter number These were intended for presentation to members deserving of special honor such as an outgoing president They did not sell well as the Association had alienated many UDC members over the firing of Borglum The Association also announced a program for sale to the Sons of Confederate Veterans although whether any coins were sold under this program is unclear as none have been identified 55 Pieces marked G L and S L were puzzled over by collectors for many years A Steve Deitert in the January 2011 edition of The Numismatist identified the markings as Gold Lavalier and Silver Lavalier These coins were given to county winners and runners up in a selling competition for young ladies 56 ",
