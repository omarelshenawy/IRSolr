			"previous": " It was also desirable to build a monoplane aircraft as the airflow around one wing negatively affects the other in a biplane s airframe design Early monoplanes used either struts as do some current light aircraft or cables like the 1909 Bleriot XI as do some modern home built aircraft The advantage in using struts or cables is a reduction in weight for a given strength but with the penalty of additional drag This reduces maximum speed and increases fuel consumption ",
			"after": " Hugo Junkers endeavored to eliminate virtually all major external bracing members only a dozen years after the Wright Brothers initial flights to decrease airframe drag in flight with the result being the Junkers J 1 pioneering all metal monoplane of late 1915 designed from the start with all metal cantilever wing panels About a year after the initial success of the Junkers J 1 Reinhold Platz of Fokker also achieved success with a cantilever winged sesquiplane built instead with wooden materials the Fokker V 1 ",
