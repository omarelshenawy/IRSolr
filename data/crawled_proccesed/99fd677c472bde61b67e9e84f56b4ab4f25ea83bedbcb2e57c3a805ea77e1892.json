			"previous": " Pei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949 29 when he designed a two story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta Georgia The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum 30 Pei s designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend house in Katonah in 1952 Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants which he chose from his associates at the GSD including Henry N Cobb and Ulrich Franzen They set to work on a variety of proposals including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building transforming Zeckendorf s office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office The project took one year and exceeded its budget but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results 31 ",
			"after": " In 1952 Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in Denver Colorado The first of these was the Mile High Center which compressed the core building into less than twenty five percent of the total site the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain dotted plazas 33 One block away Pei s team also redesigned Denver s Courthouse Square which combined office spaces commercial venues and hotels These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography I learned the process of development he said later and about the city as a living organism 34 These lessons he said became essential for later projects 34 The hyperbolic paraboloid structure was removed when the Denver Pavilions facility was constructed In 1982 he returned to design the 16th Street Mall essentially converting a street into a pedestrian only shopping district ",
