			"previous": " In 1975 UPS started its first international operations as it moved into Canada the next year it started service in Germany 5 As UPS had become a truly international company the need for its own fleet of aircraft was becoming imminent rather than relying on commercial flights Additionally competitor Federal Express with its own jet fleet was making inroads on UPS and had become profitable for the first time in 1976 In 1978 the Airline Deregulation Act gave UPS a significant opportunity the company could now establish its own airline and flying from city to city would require far fewer legislative hurdles as the federal government now encouraged competition between airlines In 1980 UPS opened its first major hub located in Louisville Kentucky The location was chosen largely because it is three hours flying distance by jet from the majority of the continental United States In addition Louisville has relatively mild weather and is at the westernmost point of the Eastern time zone Also in the early 1980s the company began acquiring a fleet of jet aircraft recently retired from commercial aircraft duty it was composed of Douglas DC 8s Boeing 727 100s and Boeing 747 100s ",
