			"previous": " Lindwall performed steadily during the 1955 56 which was purely domestic Lindwall was appointed the Queensland captain 6 and he took 30 wickets at 28 97 and made 383 runs at 32 55 81 Lindwall was duly selected for the 1956 Ashes tour Like the rest of the team Lindwall had a poor tour on a series of dry and underprepared pitches designed to favour the Surrey spin twins of Laker and Lock 82 Lindwall s tour was further compounded by a recurrence of his groin injury He took 0 43 in the first innings of the opening Test at Trent Bridge and broke down being unable to bowl in the second innings 21 This forced him to miss the Second Test at Lord s 21 and he returned for a disastrous Third Test at Headingley Although Lindwall took 3 67 in the first innings Australia was forced to follow on and fell to its first innings loss since 1938 83 as Laker and Lock ravaged the Australians 21 82 Lindwall took two wickets in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford but the results were the same 21 Australia suffered another innings defeat in what was known as Laker s Test the off spinner took 19 of the Australian wickets to fall 82 Lindwall bade farewell to Test cricket in England at The Oval taking two wickets Overall it had been a disappointing tour Lindwall had been fit for three and a half Tests and managed only seven wickets at 34 14 21 84 Lindwall s performance reignited calls for the aging paceman to be axed from the team Lindwall however had other ideas 84 ",
			"after": " Following the England tour the Australians returned home via a tour to the Indian subcontinent The first stop was Karachi where Australia played its first ever Test against Pakistan 84 Lindwall s poor run continued scoring two and a duck and taking match figures of 1 64 as Australia fell to a nine wicket defeat 21 84 The team travelled to Madras for the first of three Tests in India Lindwall briefly bowled on the first morning without success before succumbing to a severe stomach bug He took no further part in the first innings and spent the next two days in bed Lindwall briefly got out of his bed on day three to bat making only eight as Australia took a 158 run first innings lead He hauled himself out of bed on the fourth day and cut through the Indians in three spells taking 7 43 in an innings victory 84 ",
