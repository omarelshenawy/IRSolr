			"previous": " The fossil record of cockatoos is even more limited than that of parrots in general with only one truly ancient cockatoo fossil known a species of Cacatua most probably subgenus Licmetis found in Early Miocene 16 23 million years ago deposits of Riversleigh Australia 27 Although fragmentary the remains are similar to the western corella and the galah 28 In Melanesia subfossil bones of Cacatua species which apparently did not survive early human settlement have been found on New Caledonia and New Ireland 29 30 The bearing of these fossils on cockatoo evolution and phylogeny is fairly limited although the Riversleigh fossil does allow tentative dating of the divergence of subfamilies ",
			"after": " There are about 44 different birds in the cockatoo family Cacatuidae including recognized subspecies The current subdivision of this family is as follows Note 1  Subfamily Nymphicinae",
