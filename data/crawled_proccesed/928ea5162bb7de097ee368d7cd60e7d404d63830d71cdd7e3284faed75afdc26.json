			"previous": " If a ship suffers severe structural stress classically during a shipwreck when running aground in a heavy sea it is possible for the keel to break or be strained to the extent that it loses structural integrity In this case the ship is commonly said to have broken its back Such a failure means that the entire structure of the ship and its machinery has been compromised and repairing such damage would require virtually re building the ship from the ground up A ship that has broken its back is almost certainly unsalvagable and subsequently written off by its insurers ",
			"after": " The keel surface on the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater directional control and stability In non sailing hulls the keel helps the hull to move forward rather than slipping to the side In traditional boat building this is provided by the structural keel which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length In modern construction the bar keel or flat plate keel performs the same function There are many types of fixed keels including full keels long keels fin keels winged keels bulb keels and bilge keels among other designs Deep draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions",
