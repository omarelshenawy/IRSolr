			"after": " The basic equation of radiometric dating requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation The possible confounding effects of contamination of parent and daughter isotopes have to be considered as do the effects of any loss or gain of such isotopes since the sample was created It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of alteration 7 Precision is enhanced if measurements are taken on multiple samples from different locations of the rock body Alternatively if several different minerals can be dated from the same sample and are assumed to be formed by the same event and were in equilibrium with the reservoir when they formed they should form an isochron This can reduce the problem of contamination In uranium lead dating the concordia diagram is used which also decreases the problem of nuclide loss Finally correlation between different isotopic dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample For example a study of the Amitsoq gneisses from western Greenland used five different radiometric dating methods to examine twelve samples and achieved agreement to within 30 Ma million years on an age of 3 640 Ma 8 ",
