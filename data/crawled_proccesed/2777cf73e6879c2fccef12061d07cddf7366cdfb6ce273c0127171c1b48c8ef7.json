			"previous": " Christiaan Huygens following his invention of the pendulum clock in 1656 made the first attempt at a marine chronometer in 1673 in France under the sponsorship of Jean Baptiste Colbert 2 3 In 1675 Huygens who was receiving a pension from Louis XIV invented a chronometer that employed a balance wheel and a spiral spring for regulation instead of a pendulum opening the way to marine chronometers and modern pocket watches and wristwatches He obtained a patent for his invention from Colbert but his clock remained imprecise at sea 4 ",
			"after": " More attempts were made by Jeremy Thacker in England in 1714 and Henry Sully in France in 1716 who published his work in 1726 with Une Horloge invent e et execut e par M Sulli but these inventions remained unable to resist the rolling of the high seas and keep time precisely enough 5 ",
