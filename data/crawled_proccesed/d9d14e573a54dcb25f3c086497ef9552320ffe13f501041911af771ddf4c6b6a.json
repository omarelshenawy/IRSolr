			"previous": " The sciences of psychology and sociology were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new century s biographies 6 The demise of the great man theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset Human behavior would be explained through Darwinian theories Sociological biographies conceived of their subjects actions as the result of the environment and tended to downplay individuality The development of psychoanalysis led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject and induced biographers to give more emphasis to childhood and adolescence Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written as a culture of autobiography developed in which the telling of one s own story became a form of therapy 5 The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality ",
			"after": " British critic Lytton Strachey revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work Eminent Victorians consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the Victorian era Cardinal Manning Florence Nightingale Thomas Arnold and General Gordon 10 Strachey set out to breathe life into the Victorian era for future generations to read Up until this point as Strachey remarked in the preface Victorian biographies had been as familiar as the cort ge of the undertaker and wore the same air of slow funereal barbarism Strachey defied the tradition of two fat volumes of undigested masses of material and took aim at the four iconic figures His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes whom he regarded as no better than a set of mouth bungled hypocrites The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style its concise and factually accurate nature and its artistic prose 11 ",
