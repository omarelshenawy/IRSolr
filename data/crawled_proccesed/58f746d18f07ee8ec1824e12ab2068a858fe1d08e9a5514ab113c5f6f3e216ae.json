			"previous": " In the perspective of the history of art 7 artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early pre historic art to contemporary art however some theories restrict the concept of artistic works to modern Western societies 9 One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning which roughly translates to skill or craft as associated with words such as artisan English words derived from this meaning include artifact artificial artifice medical arts and military arts However there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymology ",
			"after": " Few modern scholars have been more divided than Plato and Aristotle on the question concerning the importance of art with Aristotle strongly supporting art in general and Plato generally being opposed to its relative importance Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational He speaks approvingly of this and other forms of divine madness drunkenness eroticism and dreaming in the Phaedrus 265a c and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer s great poetic art and laughter as well In Ion Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer s Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance if only it can be properly interpreted With regards to the literary art and the musical arts Aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art each varying in imitation by medium object and manner 10 For example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language The forms also differ in their object of imitation Comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average Lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama 11 Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind s advantages over animals 12 ",
