			"after": " The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction if one object A exerts a force FA on a second object B then B simultaneously exerts a force FB on A and the two forces are equal and opposite FA FB 24 The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies 25 26 and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body This law is sometimes referred to as the action reaction law with FA called the action and FB the reaction The action and the reaction are simultaneous and it does not matter which is called the action and which is called reaction both forces are part of a single interaction and neither force exists without the other 24 ",
