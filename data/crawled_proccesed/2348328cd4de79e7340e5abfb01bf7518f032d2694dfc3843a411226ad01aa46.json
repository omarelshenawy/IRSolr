			"previous": " The Crowns were open minded about the choice of artist wanting a modern work they solicited proposals from a list of prospective artists and architects 17 Jaume Plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied anthropomorphism in fountain imagery 18 Some of his early ideas for the project referenced Buckingham Fountain but these were soon abandoned 8 His presentation to the Crown family started with a slide show of fountains from the Middle Ages through the 20th century Plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains their history use and art 18 His presentation included computer animation of facial expressions 19 The other finalists were Maya Lin who presented a low height horizontal form and Robert Venturi who presented a fountain that would have been 150 feet 46 m tall 20 In January 2000 Plensa won the commission to design the fountain over Lin and Venturi 6 20 The installation is a video sculpture commissioned to operate thirty years 21 ",
			"after": " Prior to Crown Fountain Plensa s dominant theme had been dualism 22 which he had expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces In the 1990s he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light The Star of David 1998 at Stockholm s Raoul Wallenberg Square Bridge of Light 1998 in Jerusalem and LED technology video and computer design Gl serne Seele Mr Net in Brandenburg 1999 2000 23 In his public art Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art which led to his conception of the Crown Fountain 18 His objective was to create a socially relevant interactive fountain for the 21st century 24 Since water is the focus of a fountain and since Chicago and especially Millennium Park is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations 8 Because of the colder winters common to the climate of Chicago Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology 8 ",
