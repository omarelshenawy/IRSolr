			"previous": " Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics ",
			"after": " Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906 he had not given up on academia In 1908 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern 130 In ber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen ber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier 1909 paper Einstein showed that Max Planck s energy quanta must have well defined momenta and act in some respects as independent point like particles This paper introduced the photon concept although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N Lewis in 1926 and inspired the notion of wave particle duality in quantum mechanics Einstein saw this wave particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new unified foundation ",
