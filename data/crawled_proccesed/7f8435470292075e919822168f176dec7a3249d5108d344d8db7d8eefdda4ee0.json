			"previous": " Many of the plot elements of the German Reed Entertainments as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads would be reused by Gilbert later in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas These elements include paintings coming to life Ages Ago used again in Ruddigore a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man s son to a pirate instead of to a pilot by mistake Our Island Home 1870 reused in The Pirates of Penzance and the forceful mature lady who is an acquired taste Eyes and No Eyes 1875 reused in The Mikado 33 During this time Gilbert perfected the topsy turvy style that he had been developing in his Bab Ballads where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences however absurd 34 Mike Leigh describes the Gilbertian style as follows With great fluidity and freedom Gilbert continually challenges our natural expectations First within the framework of the story he makes bizarre things happen and turns the world on its head Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes and so on and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand to blend the surreal with the real and the caricature with the natural In other words to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way 35 ",
			"after": " At the same time Gilbert created several fairy comedies at the Haymarket Theatre This series of plays was founded upon the idea of self revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference 36 The first was The Palace of Truth 1870 based partly on a story by Madame de Genlis In 1871 with Pygmalion and Galatea one of seven plays that he produced that year Gilbert scored his greatest hit to date Together these plays and their successors such as The Wicked World 1873 Sweethearts 1874 and Broken Hearts 1875 did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque won him artistic credentials and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour The success of these plays especially Pygmalion and Galatea gave Gilbert a prestige that would be crucial to his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan 37 ",
