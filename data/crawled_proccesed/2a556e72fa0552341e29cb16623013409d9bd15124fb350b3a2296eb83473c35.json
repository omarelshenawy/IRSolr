			"previous": " For example consider a free particle In quantum mechanics there is wave particle duality so the properties of the particle can be described as the properties of a wave Therefore its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function The position and momentum of the particle are observables The Uncertainty Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision However one can measure the position alone of a moving free particle creating an eigenstate of position with a wavefunction that is very large a Dirac delta at a particular position x and zero everywhere else If one performs a position measurement on such a wavefunction the resultant x will be obtained with 100 probability i e with full certainty or complete precision This is called an eigenstate of position or stated in mathematical terms a generalized position eigenstate eigendistribution If the particle is in an eigenstate of position then its momentum is completely unknown On the other hand if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum then its position is completely unknown 73 In an eigenstate of momentum having a plane wave form it can be shown that the wavelength is equal to h p where h is Planck s constant and p is the momentum of the eigenstate 74 ",
