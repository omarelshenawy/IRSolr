			"previous": " Under Constantine Christianity did not become the exclusive religion of the state but enjoyed imperial preference because the emperor supported it with generous privileges Constantine established the principle that emperors could not settle questions of doctrine on their own but should summon instead general ecclesiastical councils for that purpose His convening of both the Synod of Arles and the First Council of Nicaea indicated his interest in the unity of the Church and showcased his claim to be its head 25 ",
			"after": " In 395 Theodosius I bequeathed the imperial office jointly to his sons Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West once again dividing Imperial administration In the 5th century the Eastern part of the empire was largely spared the difficulties faced by the West due in part to a more established urban culture and greater financial resources which allowed it to placate invaders with tribute and pay foreign mercenaries This success allowed Theodosius II to focus on the codification of the Roman law and the further fortification of the walls of Constantinople which left the city impervious to most attacks until 1204 26 ",
