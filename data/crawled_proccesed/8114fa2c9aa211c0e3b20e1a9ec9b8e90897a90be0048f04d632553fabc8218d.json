			"after": " The dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies should not be confused with shutting down a National Congress or Parliament The first refers to a legal measure that exist under Parliamentarism while the second is a dictatorial act There was a great care on the part of Brazilian monarchs at the time to exercise their prerogative to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies For example in the case of Pedro I he did not dissolve the Chamber of Deputies or postponed the Parliament during his reign 66 While Pedro II not once in his 58 years as Emperor that such dissolution occurred by his own initiative instead it was always solicited by the President of the Council of Ministers There were various dissolutions during the period of his reign eleven in all and of these ten occurred only after the Council of State was consulted on the matter something that was not obligatory 67 The power to veto laws was not absolute merely partial if two consecutive legislatures presented the same legislation without modifications the Emperor s signature would not be needed to pass it 68 ",
