			"previous": " Jet nozzles are also use in large rooms where the distribution of air via ceiling diffusers is not possible or not practical Diffusers that uses jet nozzles are called jet diffuser where it will be arranged in the side wall areas in order to distribute air When the temperature difference between the supply air and the room air changes the supply air stream is deflected upwards to supply warm air or downwards to supply cold air 1 ",
			"after": " Frequently the goal is to increase the kinetic energy of the flowing medium at the expense of its pressure and internal energy  Nozzles can be described as convergent narrowing down from a wide diameter to a smaller diameter in the direction of the flow or divergent expanding from a smaller diameter to a larger one A de Laval nozzle has a convergent section followed by a divergent section and is often called a convergent divergent nozzle con di nozzle ",
