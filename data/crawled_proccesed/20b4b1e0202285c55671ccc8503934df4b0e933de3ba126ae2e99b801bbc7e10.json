			"previous": " To find a definition for the square root that allows us to consistently choose a single value called the principal value we start by observing that any complex number x iy can be viewed as a point in the plane x y expressed using Cartesian coordinates The same point may be reinterpreted using polar coordinates as the pair r where r 0 is the distance of the point from the origin and is the angle that the line from the origin to the point makes with the positive real x axis In complex analysis this value is conventionally written r ei If",
