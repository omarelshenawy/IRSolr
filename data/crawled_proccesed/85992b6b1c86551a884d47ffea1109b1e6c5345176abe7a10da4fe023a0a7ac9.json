			"after": " The African crake is active during the day especially at dusk during light rain or after heavier rain It is less skulking and easier to flush from cover than other crakes and is often seen at the edges of roads and tracks An observer in a vehicle can approach to within 1 m 3 ft When a bird is flushed it normally flies less than 50 m 150 ft but new arrivals may occasionally fly twice as far A flushed crake will frequently land in a wet area or behind a thicket and crouch on landing In short grass it can escape from a dog using its speed and maneuverability running with the body held almost horizontal It may roost in a depression near grass tussock and it will bathe in puddles 2 ",
