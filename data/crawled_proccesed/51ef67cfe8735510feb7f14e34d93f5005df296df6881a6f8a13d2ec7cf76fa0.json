			"previous": " The pre production version of the F A 18 was an ideal host aircraft for proving AAW technology The F A 18 pre production wing has a relatively high wing aspect ratio for a fighter and originally was designed to have sufficient strength and to be free from buckling or flutter issues but no additional stiffness was added for static aeroelastic issues The X 53 F A 18 was modified to allow two leading edge control surfaces to work in concert with its two trailing edge surfaces to control wing aeroelastic twist and provide excellent high speed rolling performance ",
