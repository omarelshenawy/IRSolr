			"previous": " Between 1760 and 1820 conduct books reached the height of their popularity in Britain one scholar refers to the period as the age of courtesy books for women 6 As Nancy Armstrong writes in her seminal work on this genre Desire and Domestic Fiction 1987 so popular did these books become that by the second half of the eighteenth century virtually everyone knew the ideal of womanhood they proposed 7 ",
			"after": " Conduct books integrated the styles and rhetorics of earlier genres such as devotional writings marriage manuals recipe books and works on household economy They offered their readers a description of most often the ideal woman while at the same time handing out practical advice Thus not only did they dictate morality but they also guided readers choice of dress and outlined proper etiquette 8 Typical examples include Bluestocking Hester Chapone s Letters on the Improvement of the Mind 1773 which went through at least sixteen editions in the last quarter of the 18th century and the classically educated historian Catharine Macaulay s Letters on Education 1790 9 Chapone s work in particular appealed to Wollstonecraft at this time and influenced her composition of Thoughts because it argued for a sustained programme of study for women and was based on the idea that Christianity should be the chief instructor of our rational faculties 10 Moreover it emphasized that women should be considered rational beings and not left to wallow in sensualism 11 When Wollstonecraft wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792 she drew on both Chapone and Macaulay s works 12 ",
