			"previous": " The wingspans of the largest great albatrosses genus Diomedea are the largest of any bird exceeding 340 cm 11 2 ft although the other species wingspans are considerably smaller 1 75 m 5 7 ft 16 The wings are stiff and cambered with thickened streamlined leading edges Albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many long winged seabirds dynamic soaring and slope soaring Dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind thus gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient The only effort expended is in the turns at the top and bottom of every such loop This manoeuvre allows the bird to cover almost 1000 km a day without flapping its wings Slope soaring uses the rising air on the windward side of large waves Albatross have high glide ratios around 22 1 to 23 1 meaning that for every metre they drop they can travel forward 22 metres 3 They are aided in soaring by a shoulder lock a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended allowing the wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels 17 ",
			"after": " Albatrosses combine these soaring techniques with the use of predictable weather systems albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route and those flying south will fly counterclockwise 14 Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered but the landings take offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source 18 A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight although no direct evidence has ever been obtained 19 ",
