			"after": " The diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects Many species are important dispersers of seeds in Asia and Africa for example white sandalwood Indian Banyan In addition to trees they are also important dispersers of parasitic mistletoes In South Africa the red winged starling is an important disperser of the introduced Acacia cyclops Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over ripe fruit which led to the speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol 3 Laboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly 7 In addition to consuming fruits many starlings will also consume nectar The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown but at least some are such as the slender billed starling of alpine East Africa which pollinates giant lobelias 3 ",
