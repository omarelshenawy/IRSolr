			"after": " Castle Lake was within the range of the Okwanuchu tribe 28 one of a number of small Shastan speaking tribes of Native Americans who were closely related to the adjacent larger Shasta tribe 29 The Okwanuchu occupied territory near Mount Shasta including the nearby present day cities of Mount Shasta and Dunsmuir California and the upper Sacramento River canyon among other areas The Okwanuchu were speakers of the older Hokan speaking family of languages with archaeological sites associated with their range dating back more than 5000 years However members of a tribe of the Penutian speaking family of languages the Wintu who arrived in central Northern California about 1200 years ago 30 were out competing their Hokan language family neighbors and were expanding Wintu territory 31 It is unclear at the time of first contact with non Native Americans in the 1820s which tribe was living nearest to Castle Lake Little or no information is available about Native American use or beliefs regarding Castle Lake for example Castle Lake is not mentioned in a published collection of Wintu tales and legends 32 ",
