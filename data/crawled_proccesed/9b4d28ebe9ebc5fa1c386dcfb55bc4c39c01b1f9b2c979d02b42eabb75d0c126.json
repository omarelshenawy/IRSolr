			"previous": " By 1929 the remains of 34 mammoths with frozen soft tissues skin flesh or organs had been documented Only four of them were relatively complete Since then about that many more have been found In most cases the flesh showed signs of decay before its freezing and later desiccation 110 Since 1860 Russian authorities have offered rewards of up to 1000 for finds of frozen woolly mammoth carcasses Often such finds were kept secret due to superstition Several carcasses have been lost because they were not reported and one was fed to dogs In more recent years scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed Effie which was found in 1948 It consists of the head trunk and a foreleg and is about 25 000 years old 101 ",
			"after": " In 1977 the well preserved carcass of a seven to eight month old woolly mammoth calf named Dima was discovered This carcass was recovered near a tributary of the Kolyma River in northeastern Siberia This specimen weighed approximately 100 kg 220 lb at death and was 104 cm 41 in high and 115 cm 45 in long Radiocarbon dating determined that Dima died about 40 000 years ago Its internal organs are similar to those of modern elephants but its ears are only one tenth the size of those of an African elephant of similar age A less complete juvenile nicknamed Mascha was found on the Yamal Peninsula in 1988 It was 3 4 months old and a laceration on its right foot may have been the cause of death It is the westernmost frozen mammoth found 111 ",
