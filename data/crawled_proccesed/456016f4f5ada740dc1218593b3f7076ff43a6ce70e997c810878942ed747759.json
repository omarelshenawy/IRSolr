			"previous": " The city was proclaimed capital city of Wales on 20 December 1955 by a written reply by the Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George Caernarfon had also vied for this title 44 Cardiff therefore celebrated two important anniversaries in 2005 The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal Conservative constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have Although the city hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1958 Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the Welsh Office in 1964 which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the Arts Council of Wales and the Welsh Development Agency most of which were based in Cardiff ",
			"after": " The East Moors Steelworks closed in 1978 and Cardiff lost population during the 1980s 45 consistent with a wider pattern of counter urbanisation in Britain However it recovered and was one of the few cities outside London where population grew during the 1990s 46 During this period the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was promoting the redevelopment of south Cardiff an evaluation of the regeneration of Cardiff Bay published in 2004 concluded that the project had reinforced the competitive position of Cardiff and contributed to a massive improvement in the quality of the built environment although it had failed to attract the major inward investors originally anticipated 47 ",
