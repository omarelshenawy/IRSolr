			"previous": " Apollo 5 AS 204 was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit launched from pad 37 on January 22 1968 by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1 The LM engines were successfully test fired and restarted despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing The ascent engine was fired in abort mode known as a fire in the hole test where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned 71 ",
			"after": " Apollo 7 launched from LC 34 on October 11 1968 was the C mission crewed by Schirra Eisele and Cunningham It was an 11 day Earth orbital flight which tested the CSM systems  Apollo 8 was planned to be the D mission in December 1968 crewed by McDivitt Scott and Schweickart launched on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IB s In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth orbiting mission ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969 and eliminating the E mission This would keep the program on track The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15 1968 aboard Zond 5 and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts 72 73 The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7 Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell and rookie William Anders captured the world s attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve and returning safely to Earth ",
