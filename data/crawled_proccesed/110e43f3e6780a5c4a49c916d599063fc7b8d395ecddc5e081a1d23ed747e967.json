			"after": " The MiG 29 has two widely spaced Klimov RD 33 turbofan engines each rated at 50 0 kN 11 240 lbf dry and 81 3 kN 18 277 lbf in afterburner The space between the engines generates lift thereby reducing effective wing loading hence improving maneuverability The engines are fed through intake ramps fitted under the leading edge extensions LERXs which have variable ramps to allow high Mach speeds As an adaptation to rough field operations the main air inlet can be closed completely and alter using the auxiliary air inlet on the upper fuselage for takeoff landing and low altitude flying preventing ingestion of ground debris Thereby the engines receive air through louvers on the LERXs which open automatically when intakes are closed However the latest variant of the family the MiG 35 eliminated these dorsal louvers and adopted the mesh screens design in the main intakes similar to those fitted to the Su 27 20 ",
