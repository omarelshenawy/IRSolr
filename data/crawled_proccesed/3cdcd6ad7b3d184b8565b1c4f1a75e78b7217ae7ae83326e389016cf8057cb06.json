			"after": " The common name green and golden bell frog was first adopted by Harold Cogger in his 1975 book Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia Before this its common names were golden frog and golden tree frog The green and golden bell frog has many physical and behavioural characteristics representative of ranids hence its original classification as Rana It has a pointy snout long legs and almost complete toe webbing the tympanum is large and distinct and the overall body shape is similar to many Rana species Like many frogs in the Rana genus green and golden bell frogs are mostly aquatic and only travel over land during periods of rainfall It was removed from the genus because of anatomical differences with the family Ranidae The bone and cartilage structural formations of the green and golden bell frog are closest to those of species in the family Hylidae it was therefore reclassified ",
