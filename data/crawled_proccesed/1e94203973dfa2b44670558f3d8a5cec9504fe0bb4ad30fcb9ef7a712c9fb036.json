			"after": " Andronikos began his reign well in particular the measures he took to reform the government of the Empire have been praised by historians According to George Ostrogorsky Andronikos was determined to root out corruption Under his rule the sale of offices ceased selection was based on merit rather than favouritism officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery In the provinces Andronikos s reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement 133 The aristocrats were infuriated against him and to make matters worse Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced executions and violence became increasingly common and his reign turned into a reign of terror 134 Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter while the Emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime 133 ",
