			"previous": " The basidia of G quadrifidum have a basal clamp connection or they narrow into a hyphal part that ends at a clamp When they are young they are more or less ellipsoid to club shaped but in age they often become more or less bottle shaped ampullaceous or sometimes almost lecythiform among other shapes when mature they measure 14 21 x 4 5 7 m excluding the hyphal part The hyphal part is less than 1 6 x 1 2 m The sterigmata thin projections of the basidia that attach the to spore are 4 6 m long and mostly 1 1 5 m thick The hyphae located immediately underneath the basidia are thin walled 1 2 m wide provided with clamps and densely branched The hyphae of the tramal plates are roughly parallel thin walled 1 2 m wide and provided with clamps which may be dilated 18 ",
			"after": " The spores in mass are dark brown when mature They are spherical covered with warts or verrucae and measure 5 6 m in diameter including ornamentation nb 2 The spores often contain a drop of oil Scanning electron microscopy reveals the verrucae to be up to 0 8 m long conical to columnar processes with rounded to almost flattened tips The apiculus the part of a spore which attaches to the sterigmata at the end of a basidium is distinct with radiating ridge like processes The young spore is first broadly egg shaped before becoming roughly spherical in maturity 18 ",
