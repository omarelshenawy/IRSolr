			"after": " One of Kraft s most important contributions to manned spaceflight would be his origination of the concept of a Mission Control Center Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft where the role for ground support was minimal 12 However Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much particularly during the fast moving launch phase the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers ",
