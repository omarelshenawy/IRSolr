			"previous": " Southern style megalithic burials are distributed in the southern Korean Peninsula It is thought that most of them date to the latter part of the Early Mumun or to the Middle Mumun Period 20 21 Southern style megaliths are typically smaller in scale than northern megaliths The interment area of southern megaliths has an underground burial chamber made of earth or lined with thin stone slabs A massive capstone is placed over the interment area and is supported by smaller propping stones Most of the megalithic burials on the Korean Peninsula are of the southern type ",
			"after": " As with northern megaliths southern examples contain few if any artifacts However a small number of megalithic burials contain fine red burnished pottery bronze daggers polished groundstone daggers and greenstone ornaments Southern megalithic burials are often found in groups spread out in lines that are parallel with the direction of streams Megalithic cemeteries contain burials that are linked together by low stone platforms made from large river cobbles Broken red burnished pottery and charred wood found on these platforms has led archaeologists to hypothesize that these platform were sometimes used for ceremonies and rituals 22 The capstones of many southern megaliths have cup marks carvings A small number of capstones have human and dagger representations ",
