			"previous": " Northwest was purchased in a 1989 leveraged buyout by an investment group headed by Al Checchi Fred Malek and Gary Wilson with KLM and many others To pay off the debt incurred in their takeover the new management sold many of the airline s aircraft to leasing companies and sold property around the world including land in central Tokyo The expense of the buyout was so great that in 1993 following several years of losses due to industry overcapacity and a traffic downturn following the Gulf War Northwest threatened bankruptcy unless its employee groups agreed to three years of wage cuts After signing the concessionary agreements Northwest made its first profit since 1989 ",
			"after": " Also in 1993 Northwest began its strategic alliance with KLM which was the largest airline partnership ever conceived at the time This partnership eventually became the Wings Alliance However the alliance never grew beyond the two airlines Northwest gradually pulled out of its minor European destinations and once more focused its attention on the domestic and Asian markets On May 1 1996 Northwest began its first nonstop service from the U S to China on the Detroit Beijing route Nonstop Detroit Shanghai service followed in April 2000 Later these nonstop services were suspended in 2002 due to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS citation needed Northwest then served these routes via Tokyo The airline sought government approval to restore nonstop Detroit Shanghai service in March 2007 but lost its bid to United s Washington Dulles Beijing route however before their merger with Delta Air Lines Northwest received tentative authority to restart nonstop Detroit Shanghai service starting March 25 2009 ",
