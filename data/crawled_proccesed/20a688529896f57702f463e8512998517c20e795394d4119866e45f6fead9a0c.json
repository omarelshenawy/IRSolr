			"previous": " As the 19th century progressed fewer pines were left and more hemlocks and hardwoods were cut and processed locally 14 By 1810 there were 11 sawmills in the Pine Creek watershed and by 1840 there were 145 despite a flood in 1832 which wiped out nearly all the mills along the creek 11 14 Selective harvesting of pines was replaced by clearcutting of all lumber in a tract The first lumbering activity close to what is now Colton Point was in 1838 when William Dodge and partners built a settlement at Big Meadows and formed the Pennsylvania Joint Land and Lumber Company Dodge s company purchased thousands of acres of land in the area including what is now Colton Point State Park 8 In 1865 the last pine spar raft floated down the creek and on March 28 1871 the General Assembly passed a law which allowed construction of splash dams and allowed creeks to be cleared to allow loose logs to float better The earliest spring log drives floated up to 20 000 000 board feet 50 000 m3 of logs in Pine Creek at one time 14 These logs floated to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to sawmills near the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport 13 Log drives could be dangerous just north of the park is Barbour Rock named for Samuel Barbour who lost his life on Pine Creek there after breaking up a log jam 15 Hemlock wood was not widely used until the advent of wire nails but the bark was used to tan leather After 1870 the largest tanneries in the world were in the Pine Creek watershed and required 2 000 pounds 900 kg of bark to produce 150 pounds 70 kg of quality sole leather 14 ",
