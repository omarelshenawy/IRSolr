			"previous": " In 1934 the Austrian philosopher Hans Kelsen continued the positivist tradition in his book the Pure Theory of Law 43 Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality it is endowed with normativity meaning we ought to obey it While laws are positive is statements e g the fine for reversing on a highway is 500 law tells us what we should do Thus each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm Grundnorm instructing us to obey Kelsen s major opponent Carl Schmitt rejected both positivism and the idea of the rule of law because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions 44 Therefore Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception state of emergency which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience 45 ",
			"after": " Later in the 20th century H L A Hart attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in The Concept of Law 46 Hart argued law is a system of rules divided into primary rules of conduct and secondary ones rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication to resolve legal disputes rules of change allowing laws to be varied and the rule of recognition allowing laws to be identified as valid Two of Hart s students continued the debate In his book Law s Empire Ronald Dworkin attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue Dworkin argues that law is an interpretive concept 47 that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute given their constitutional traditions Joseph Raz on the other hand defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart s soft social thesis approach in The Authority of Law 48 Raz argues that law is authority identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning In his view any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to sociology rather than jurisprudence 49 ",
