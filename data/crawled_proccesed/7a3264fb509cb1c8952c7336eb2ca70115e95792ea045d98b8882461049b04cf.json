			"after": " Gravitational time dilation is at play for ISS astronauts too and it has the opposite effect of the relative velocity time dilation To simplify velocity and gravity each slow down time as they increase Velocity has increased for the astronauts slowing down their time whereas gravity has decreased speeding up time the astronauts are experiencing less gravity than on Earth Nevertheless the ISS astronaut crew ultimately end up with slower time because the two opposing effects are not equally strong The velocity time dilation explained above is making a bigger difference and slowing down time The time speeding up effects of low gravity would not cancel out these time slowing down effects of velocity unless the ISS orbited much farther from Earth ",
