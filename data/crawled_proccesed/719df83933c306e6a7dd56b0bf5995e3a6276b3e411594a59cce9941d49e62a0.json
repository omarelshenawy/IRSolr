			"after": " A propfan engine also called unducted fan open rotor or ultra high bypass is a jet engine that uses its gas generator to power an exposed fan similar to turboprop engines Like turboprop engines propfans generate most of their thrust from the propeller and not the exhaust jet The primary difference between turboprop and propfan design is that the propeller blades on a propfan are highly swept to allow them to operate at speeds around Mach 0 8 which is competitive with modern commercial turbofans These engines have the fuel efficiency advantages of turboprops with the performance capability of commercial turbofans 16 While significant research and testing including flight testing has been conducted on propfans no propfan engines have entered production ",
