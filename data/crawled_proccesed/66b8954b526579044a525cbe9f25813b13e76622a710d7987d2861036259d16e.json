			"previous": " Clark s reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird Sir Richard Owen and Alfred Newton both wanted to be first to describe the post cranial anatomy of the dodo and Owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for Newton which led to rivalry between the two Owen described the bones in Memoir on the Dodo in October 1866 but erroneously based his reconstruction on the Edwards s Dodo painting by Savery making it too squat and obese In 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance making it more upright Newton moved his focus to the R union solitaire instead The remaining bones not sold to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums 3 In 1889 Th odor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the historical souvenirs of Mauritius and find more dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes He was successful and also found remains of other extinct species 106 ",
			"after": " In October 2005 after a hundred years of neglect a part of the Mare aux Songes swamp was excavated by an international team of researchers To prevent malaria the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius which had to be removed Many remains were found including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity though no juveniles and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird which have been preserved in their natural position 107 These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden 63 of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus and 7 1 belonged to dodos which had been deposited within several centuries 4 000 years ago 108 Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4 200 years ago 107 Furthermore cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp which died of intoxication dehydration trampling and miring 109 Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp few were found during the 19th century probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting 73 In June 2007 adventurers exploring a cave in Mauritius discovered the most complete and best preserved dodo skeleton ever found The specimen was nicknamed Fred after the finder 110 ",
