			"previous": " Details of giant otter reproduction and life cycle are scarce and captive animals have provided much of the information Females appear to give birth year round although in the wild births may peak during the dry season The estrous cycle is 21 days with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days 43 Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation 3 At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany long term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen with copulation most frequently taking place in water 44 Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days giving birth to one to five pups with an average of two 43 44 Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive 3 Other sources have found greater intervals with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild 43 ",
