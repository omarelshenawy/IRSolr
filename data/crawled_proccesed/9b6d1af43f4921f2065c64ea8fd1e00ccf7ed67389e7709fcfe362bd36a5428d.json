			"previous": " Edward FitzGerald s Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam though formally derived from the Persian ruba i nevertheless shows a strong Horatian influence since as one modern scholar has observed the quatrains inevitably recall the stanzas of the Odes as does the narrating first person of the world weary ageing Epicurean Omar himself mixing sympotic exhortation and carpe diem with splendid moralising and memento mori nihilism nb 32 Matthew Arnold advised a friend in verse not to worry about politics an echo of Odes 2 11 yet later became a critic of Horace s inadequacies relative to Greek poets as role models of Victorian virtues observing If human life were complete without faith without enthusiasm without energy Horace would be the perfect interpreter of human life 121 Christina Rossetti composed a sonnet depicting a woman willing her own death steadily drawing on Horace s depiction of Glycera in Odes 1 19 5 6 and Cleopatra in Odes 1 37 nb 33 A E Housman considered Odes 4 7 in Archilochian couplets the most beautiful poem of antiquity 122 and yet he generally shared Horace s penchant for quatrains being readily adapted to his own elegiac and melancholy strain 123 The most famous poem of Ernest Dowson took its title and its heroine s name from a line of Odes 4 1 Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae as well as its motif of nostalgia for a former flame Kipling wrote a famous parody of the Odes satirising their stylistic idiosyncrasies and especially the extraordinary syntax but he also used Horace s Roman patriotism as a focus for British imperialism as in the story Regulus in the school collection Stalky Co which he based on Odes 3 5 124 Wilfred Owen s famous poem quoted above incorporated Horatian text to question patriotism while ignoring the rules of Latin scansion However there were few other echoes of Horace in the war period possibly because war is not actually a major theme of Horace s work 125 ",
