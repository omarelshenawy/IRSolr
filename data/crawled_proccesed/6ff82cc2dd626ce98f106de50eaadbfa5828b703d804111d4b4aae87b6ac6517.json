			"after": " Trimmer is perhaps most famous now for her condemnation of fairy tales such as the various translations of Charles Perrault s Histoires ou Contes du Temps pass 1697 She disliked fairy tales because they endorsed an irrational view of the world and success without work 22 Trimmer s view of fairy tales although often ridiculed by modern critics was widespread at the end of the eighteenth century in part because most educators accepted John Locke s theory that the mind was a tabula rasa and therefore particularly sensitive to impressions early in life 23 Trimmer was opposed to fairy tales that were not grounded in reality and which would excite an unregulated sensibility in the reader Without a proper moral or a moralizing narrator fairy tales could lead a reader astray 24 Above all she was concerned about unmediated unknown and unsupervised feelings in the child reader One of the reasons Trimmer believed fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences 25 She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections complaining that little children whose minds are susceptible of every impression and who from the liveliness of their imaginations are apt to convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy should not be allowed to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his wife s head off 26 ",
