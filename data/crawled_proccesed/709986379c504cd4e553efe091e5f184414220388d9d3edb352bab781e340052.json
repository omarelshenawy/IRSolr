			"previous": " Spatial economics deal with distance and area and how these may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Th nen however Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier 86 Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories markets and population centres that is individuals strive to lower transportation costs 87 Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital due to transportation costs transportation costs vary on transportation type for example water transportation was considered cheaper than land based transportation and larger goods that are more difficult to transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production 88 For example Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation 89 Similarly Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property because they could afford the transportation costs 90 In Essai spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets 91 ",
			"after": " Apart from originating theories on the entrepreneur and spatial economics Cantillon also provided a dedicated theory on population growth Unlike William Petty who believed there always existed a considerable amount of unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth Cantillon theorised that population grows only as long as there are economic opportunities present 92 Specifically Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size natural resources technology and culture 93 Therefore populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed 94 Furthermore Cantillon s population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised 95 ",
