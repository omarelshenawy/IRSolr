			"previous": " The Puerto Rican amazon is a secondary cavity nester nesting in tree trunk cavities both naturally occurring and excavated by other species It prefers to nest in Palo colorado trees Cyrilla racemiflora but uses other trees including the laurel sabino Magnolia splendens and tabonuco Dacryodes excelsa to a lesser extent These trees are mature cavity forming trees which provide protection against predators and the entry of water Recently the species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed as part of the recovery plan for the species Nest height varies from 7 15 m 23 49 ft above ground The male usually leads the search for nest sites although the final decision seems to be taken by the female 36 Once a site is selected the pair will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it No lining material is added to the nest ",
			"after": " The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at 4 years of age in the wild and at 3 years in captivity The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July the dry season Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse 37 Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female s back 38 As the time for egg laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation 39 The female lays 2 4 eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days while the male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food 40 Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame 41 The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest usually 60 to 65 days after they hatch 2 Nonetheless they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season 3 ",
