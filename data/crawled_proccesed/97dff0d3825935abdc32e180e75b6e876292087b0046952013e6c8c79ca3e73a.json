			"previous": " Several Yogo sapphires are kept at the Smithsonian Institution The earliest donations were noted in the museum s annual report on June 30 1899 when the institution reported that Dr L T Chamberlain gave them two cut Yogos and 21 other sapphires for their Dr Isaac Lea gem and mineral collection 90 The record setting 10 2 carat 2 04 g cut Yogo is also held by the Smithsonian 11 27 28 In 2006 gemologist Robert Kane of Fine Gems International in Helena which has the world s largest selection of Montana sapphires donated 333 Montana sapphires weighing a total of 27 07 carats 5 414 g to the Smithsonian s Gem and Mineral Collection along with 98 48 grams of 18K yellow gold for the creation of a piece of jewelry 91 92 A representative of the Smithsonian asked Paula Crevoshay a jewelry designer from Albuquerque New Mexico to create a piece of finished jewelry from these gems 93 92 Crevoshay felt that a butterfly motif would best represent America s natural beauty honor her mother s love of butterflies and display the wide range of colors found in Montana sapphires Crevoshay named the brooch Conchita in honor of her mother it is also referred to as the Sapphire Butterfly Brooch Conchita Sapphire Butterfly and the Montana Butterfly Brooch Two of the sapphires used are cabochon cut and the rest are brilliant cut 93 The majority are from the Rock Creek deposit The largest one however is a blue Yogo used for the butterfly s head Other sapphires used included yellow purple pink and orange gems Crevoshay completed the brooch in 2007 she and Kane presented the finished brooch to Smithsonian curator Jeffrey Post on May 7 2007 in Washington DC 93 94 ",
			"after": " In the earliest years of Yogo sapphire mining before Yogos achieved their own reputation Oriental sapphires were sold in Montana with claims they were Yogos while in Europe Yogos were sold as Oriental sapphires 95 However Yogos became notable in their own right Paulding Farnham 1859 1927 used Yogos in several jewelry pieces he designed for the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris 96 where Yogo sapphires received a silver medal among all gems for color and clarity 97 An entry of uncut loose Yogo sapphires also won a bronze medal at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis Missouri 98 Farnham was the creator of the most elaborate piece of jewelry ever made with Yogos the life size Tiffany Iris Brooch a brooch ornament which contains 120 Yogo sapphires set in platinum 99 and sold on March 17 1900 for 6 906 84 100 In 1923 First Lady Florence Harding was given an all Montana ring made from a Yogo sapphire and Montana gold In 1952 Gadsden gave cut Yogos to President Harry Truman his wife Bess and their daughter Margaret 28 Many Yogos were also sold in Europe as some Yogo mining was conducted by British interests 27 Yogos may have been in the personal collections of some members of the British royal family in the 1910s 27 but promotional claims that Yogos are in any of the crown jewels of England cannot be conclusively proven or disproven 27 42 101 Claims that the gem in the engagement ring of Lady Diana Spencer and Kate Middleton is a Yogo are dubious the gem is thought to be of Sri Lankan origin 102 Its size also indicates it is unlikely to be a Yogo the sapphire is large most often reported as being 9 carats 1 8 g in size though it has also been described as 12 carats 2 4 g and even 18 carats 3 6 g however the latter number is the karat purity of the gold setting 103 The story that the gem is a Yogo can be traced to a 1984 Los Angeles Times article that described the ring as a 9 carat 1 8 g sapphire and quoted Intergem president Dennis Brown s claim that the gem may have come from a British owned Yogo mine 104 ",
