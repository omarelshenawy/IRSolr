			"previous": " If the Anglo Saxon Chronicle is to be believed the various Anglo Saxon kingdoms which eventually merged to become England were founded when small fleets of three or five ships of invaders arrived at various points around the coast of England to fight the Sub Roman British and conquered their lands 23 As Margaret Gelling points out in the context of place name evidence what actually happened between the departure of the Romans and the coming of the Normans is the subject of much disagreement by historians 24 ",
			"after": " The arrival of the Anglo Saxons into Britain can be seen in the context of a general movement of Germanic peoples around Europe between the years 300 and 700 known as the Migration period also called the Barbarian Invasions or V lkerwanderung In the same period there were migrations of Britons to the Armorican peninsula Brittany and Normandy in modern day France initially around 383 during Roman rule but also c 460 and in the 540s and 550s the 460s migration is thought to be a reaction to the fighting during the Anglo Saxon mutiny between about 450 to 500 as was the migration to Britonia modern day Galicia in northwest Spain at about the same time 25 The historian Peter Hunter Blair expounded what is now regarded as the traditional view of the Anglo Saxon arrival in Britain 26 He suggested a mass immigration fighting and driving the Sub Roman Britons off their land and into the western extremities of the islands and into the Breton and Iberian peninsulas 27 This view was probably influenced by sources such as Bede where he talks about the Britons being slaughtered or going into perpetual servitude 28 According to H rke the more modern view is of co existence between the British and the Anglo Saxons 29 30 31 He suggests that several modern archaeologists have now re assessed the invasion model they have developed a co existence model largely based on the Laws of Ine The laws include several clauses that provide six different wergild levels for the Britons of which four are below that of freeman 32 Although it was possible for the Britons to be rich freemen in Anglo Saxon society generally it seems that they had a lower status than that of the Anglo Saxons 31 32 ",
