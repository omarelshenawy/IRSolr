			"previous": " Diplodocus had an extremely long tail composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae 14 which is almost double the number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails such as Shunosaurus with 43 and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had such as Camarasaurus with 53 There has been speculation as to whether it may have had a defensive 15 or noisemaking by cracking it like a coachwhip function 16 The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck The middle part of the tail had double beams oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside which gave Diplodocus its name They may have provided support for the vertebrae or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal s heavy tail pressed against the ground These double beams are also seen in some related dinosaurs 17 ",
			"after": " No skull has ever been found that can be confidently said to belong to Diplodocus though skulls of other diplodocids closely related to Diplodocus such as Galeamopus are well known The skulls of diplodocids were very small compared with the size of these animals Diplodocus had small peg like teeth that pointed forward and were only present in the anterior sections of the jaws 18 Its braincase was small The neck was composed of at least fifteen vertebrae and may have been held parallel to the ground and unable to be elevated much past horizontal 19 ",
