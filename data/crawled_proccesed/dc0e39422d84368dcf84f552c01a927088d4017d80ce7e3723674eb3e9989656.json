			"previous": " Among its other influences on popular culture Pinafore had perhaps its most profound influence on the development of musical theatre According to theatre historian John Kenrick Pinafore became an international sensation reshaping the commercial theater in both England and the United States 212 Music writer Andrew Lamb notes The success of H M S Pinafore in 1879 established British comic opera alongside French op ra bouffe throughout the English speaking world 213 Historian John Bush Jones opines that Pinafore and the other Savoy operas demonstrate that musical theatre can address contemporary social and political issues without sacrificing entertainment value and that Pinafore created the model for a new kind of musical theatre the integrated musical where book lyrics and music combined to form an integral whole 214 He adds that its unprecedented popularity fostered an American audience for musical theatre while the show itself became a model for form content and even intention of musicals ever since especially socially relevant musicals 215 Its popularity also led to the musical theatre adaptations of Pinafore described above musicals in which the story line involves a production of Pinafore 216 and other musicals that parody the opera or that use or adapt its music 217 The first such parody was a short lived burlesque presented at the Opera Comique in 1882 called The Wreck of the Pinafore by H Lingard and Luscombe Searelle the opera s characters are shipwrecked on a desert island It was described by The Era as chiefly remarkable for its impudence 218 ",
			"after": " Likewise the opera s popularity has led to the widespread parody and pastiche of its songs in politics literature and films on television and in a variety of other media 219 Many comedians have used Pinafore songs for comic and satiric effect For example in his comedy album My Son the Celebrity Allan Sherman parodies When I Was a Lad from the point of view of a young man who goes to an Ivy League school and then rises to prominence in business At the end of the song he thanks old Yale thanks the Lord and thanks his father who is chairman of the board 220 Literary references to Pinafore songs include Harris s attempt to sing When I Was a Lad in Jerome K Jerome s Three Men in a Boat 221 Another is found in the story Runaround from I Robot by Isaac Asimov where a robot sings part of I m Called Little Buttercup 222 Pinafore and its songs have been performed by rock musicians such as Todd Rundgren Taj Mahal and Michele Rundgren who performed Never Mind the Why and Wherefore on Night Music Sunday Night in 1989 223 ",
