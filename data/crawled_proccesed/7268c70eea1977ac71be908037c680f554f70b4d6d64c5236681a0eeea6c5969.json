			"after": " During the winter of 1980 1981 a new glacier appeared Now officially named Crater Glacier it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier Shadowed by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches it grew rapidly 14 feet 4 3 m per year in thickness By 2004 it covered about 0 36 square miles 0 93 km2 and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe Typically by late summer the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions As of 2006 the ice had an average thickness of 300 feet 100 m and a maximum of 650 feet 200 m nearly as deep as the much older and larger Carbon Glacier of Mount Rainier The ice is all post 1980 making the glacier very young geologically However the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the pre 1980 glaciers combined 9 10 11 12 13 ",
