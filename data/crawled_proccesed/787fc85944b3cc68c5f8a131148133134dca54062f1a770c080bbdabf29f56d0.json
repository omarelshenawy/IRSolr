			"after": " Lactarius torminosus is a mycorrhizal species and as such plays an important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees It grows in association with birch Betula and hemlock Tsuga in mixed forests It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby 22 A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands 48 Fruit bodies grow on the ground scattered or grouped together They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel 41 and serve as breeding sites for some fungus feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families 49 Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus which produces a cream ochre to cinnamon colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed 50 ",
