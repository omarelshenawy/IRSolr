			"previous": " Biographer Jane Stedman wrote that Pinafore is satirically far more complex than The Sorcerer She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads including the idea of gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from Captain Reece 1868 and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from General John 1867 Dick Deadeye based on a character in Woman s Gratitude 1869 represents another of Gilbert s favorite and semi autobiographical satiric themes the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding face and form makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense 12 141 Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera The Gentleman in Black which includes the device of baby switching 142 ",
			"after": " Historian H M Walbrook wrote in 1921 that Pinafore satirizes the type of nautical drama of which Douglas Jerrold s Black Eyed Susan is a typical instance and the God s Englishman sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude striking an attitude and doing little or nothing to help one s country 117 In 2005 Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera saying they all sing He is an Englishman and you know damn well they re sending it up but the music is so military that you can t help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire 143 In addition he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera H M S Pinafore is basically a satire on the British love of the class system A t this moment all of the men on board say But of course Ralph can marry the Captain s daughter because he s British and therefore he s great 143 144 145 ",
