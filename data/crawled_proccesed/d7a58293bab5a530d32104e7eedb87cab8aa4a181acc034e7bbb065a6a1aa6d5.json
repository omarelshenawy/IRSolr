			"previous": " The Caribbean initially provided England s most important and lucrative colonies 27 but not before several attempts at colonisation failed An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits 28 Colonies in St Lucia 1605 and Grenada 1609 also rapidly folded but settlements were successfully established in St Kitts 1624 Barbados 1627 and Nevis 1628 29 The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil which depended on slave labour and at first Dutch ships to sell the slaves and buy the sugar 30 To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces a series of Anglo Dutch Wars which would eventually strengthen England s position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch 31 In 1655 England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas 32 ",
