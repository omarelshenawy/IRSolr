			"after": " The Albanian language forms a separate branch of the Indo European languages family tree A traditional view based mainly on the territory where the languages were spoken links the origin of Albanian with Illyrian Not enough Illyrian archaeological evidence is left behind however to come to a definite conclusion Another theory links the Albanian as originating from the Thracian language however this theory takes exception to the territory since the Thracian language was spoken in an area distinct from Albania and no significant population movements have been recorded in the period when the shift from one language to the other is supposed to have occurred 75 ",
