			"previous": " The complexity class QP consists of all problems which have quasi polynomial time algorithms It can be defined in terms of DTIME as follows 12  Quasi polynomial time algorithms typically arise in reductions from an NP hard problem to another problem For example one can take an instance of an NP hard problem say 3SAT and convert it to an instance of another problem B but the size of the instance becomes In that case this reduction does not prove that problem B is NP hard this reduction only shows that there is no polynomial time algorithm for B unless there is a quasi polynomial time algorithm for 3SAT and thus all of NP Similarly there are some problems for which we know quasi polynomial time algorithms but no polynomial time algorithm is known Such problems arise in approximation algorithms a famous example is the directed Steiner tree problem for which there is a quasi polynomial time approximation algorithm achieving an approximation factor of n being the number of vertices but showing the existence of such a polynomial time algorithm is an open problem ",
			"after": " In complexity theory the unsolved P versus NP problem asks if all problems in NP have polynomial time algorithms All the best known algorithms for NP complete problems like 3SAT etc take exponential time Indeed it is conjectured for many natural NP complete problems that they do not have sub exponential time algorithms Here sub exponential time is taken to mean the second definition presented below On the other hand many graph problems represented in the natural way by adjacency matrices are solvable in subexponential time simply because the size of the input is square of the number of vertices This conjecture for the k SAT problem is known as the exponential time hypothesis 13 Since it is conjectured that NP complete problems do not have quasi polynomial time algorithms some inapproximability results in the field of approximation algorithms make the assumption that NP complete problems do not have quasi polynomial time algorithms For example see the known inapproximability results for the set cover problem ",
