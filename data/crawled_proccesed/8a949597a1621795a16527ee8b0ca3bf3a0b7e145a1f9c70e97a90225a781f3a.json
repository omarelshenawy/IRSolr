			"after": " During the process of DNA replication errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand These errors called mutations can have an impact on the phenotype of an organism especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene Error rates are usually very low 1 error in every 10 100 million bases due to the proofreading ability of DNA polymerases 68 69 Processes that increase the rate of changes in DNA are called mutagenic mutagenic chemicals promote errors in DNA replication often by interfering with the structure of base pairing while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the DNA structure 70 Chemical damage to DNA occurs naturally as well and cells use DNA repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks The repair does not however always restore the original sequence ",
