			"previous": " Optimization Say you sell lemonade at a lemonade stand and notice that at 1 you can sell 197 glasses of lemonade per day and that for each increase of 0 01 you will sell one glass of lemonade less per day If you could charge 1 485 you would maximize your profit but due to the constraint of having to charge a whole cent amount charging 1 49 per glass will yield the maximum income of 220 52 per day ",
			"after": " Differential equation If you set up 100 fans to blow air from one end of the room to the other and then you drop a feather into the wind what happens The feather will follow the air currents which may be very complex One approximation is to measure the speed at which the air is blowing near the feather every second and advance the simulated feather as if it were moving in a straight line at that same speed for one second before measuring the wind speed again This is called the Euler method for solving an ordinary differential equation ",
