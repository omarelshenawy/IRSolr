			"previous": " Early experiments using rockets to boost gliders into the air were conducted in Germany in the 1920s Lippisch Ente and later both the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe introduced such systems in World War II 1 The British system used fairly large solid fuel rockets to shoot planes typically the Hawker Hurricane off a small ramp fitted to the fronts of merchant ships known in service as Catapult armed merchantmen or CAM Ships in order to provide some cover against German maritime patrol planes After firing the rocket was released from the back of the plane to fall into the water and sink The task done the pilot would fly to friendly territory if possible or parachute from the plane hopefully to be picked up by one of the escort vessels Over two years the system was only employed nine times to attack German aircraft with eight kills recorded for the loss of a single pilot ",
			"after": " The Luftwaffe also used the technique with both liquid fueled and solid fuel often jettisonable rocket motors in order to help their small bombers and the enormous Gigant Messerschmitt Me 321 glider conceived in 1940 for the invasion of Britain and used to supply the Russian front which also had air tow assistance from up to three Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters in a so called Troika Schlepp arrangement into the air with loads that would have made the takeoff run too long otherwise This became especially important late in the war when the lengths of usable runways were severely curtailed due to the results of Allied bombing Their system typically used Walter HWK 109 500 or 501 Starthilfe start help liquid fuel monopropellant rocket engines driven by chemical decomposition of T Stoff essentially almost pure hydrogen peroxide A parachute pack at the blunt contour front of the motor s exterior housing was used to slow its fall after being released from the plane so the system could be re used First experiments were held in 1937 on an Heinkel He 111 piloted by test pilot Erich Warsitz at Neuhardenberg a large field about 70 kilometres east of Berlin listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war 2 Other German experiments with JATO were aimed at assisting the launch of interceptor aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 262C as the Heimatsch tzer special versions usually fitted with either a version of the Walter HWK 109 509 liquid fuelled rocket engine from the Me 163 Komet program either in the extreme rear of the fuselage or semi podded beneath it just behind the wing s trailing edge to assist its Junkers Jumo 004 turbojets or a pair of specially rocket boosted BMW 003R combination jet rocket powerplants in place of the Jumo 004s so that the Me 262C Heimatsch tzer interceptors could reach enemy bomber formations sooner Two prototypes of the Heimatsch tzer versions of the Me 262 were built and test flown of the three designs proposed ",
