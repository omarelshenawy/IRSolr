			"previous": " Baum also anonymously wrote The Last Egyptian A Romance of the Nile He continued theatrical work with Harry Marston Haldeman s men s social group The Uplifters 30 for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations He also wrote the group s parodic by laws The group which also included Will Rogers was proud to have had Baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent Although many of these play s titles are known only The Uplift of Lucifer is known to survive it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s Prior to that his last produced play was The Tik Tok Man of Oz based on Ozma of Oz and the basis for Tik Tok of Oz a modest success in Hollywood that producer Oliver Morosco decided did not do well enough to take to Broadway Morosco incidentally quickly turned to film production as would Baum ",
			"after": " In 1914 having moved to Hollywood years earlier Baum started his own film production company The Oz Film Manufacturing Company 31 which came as an outgrowth of the Uplifters He served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter The rest of the board consisted of Louis F Gottschalk Harry Marston Haldeman and Clarence R Rundel The films were directed by J Farrell MacDonald with casts that included Violet MacMillan Vivian Reed Mildred Harris Juanita Hansen Pierre Couderc Mai Welles Louise Emmons J Charles Haydon and early appearances by Harold Lloyd and Hal Roach Silent film actor Richard Rosson appeared in one of the films whose younger brother Harold Rosson photographed The Wizard of Oz 1939 After little success probing the unrealized children s film market Baum came clean about who wrote The Last Egyptian and made a film of it portions of which are included in Decasia but the Oz name had for the time being become box office poison and even a name change to Dramatic Feature Films and transfer of ownership to Frank Joslyn Baum did not help Unlike with The Fairylogue and Radio Plays Baum invested none of his own money in the venture but the stress probably took its toll on his health ",
