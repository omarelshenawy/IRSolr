			"previous": " Huntington did not present any evidence that Latin Americans see themselves as foreign in comparison to other Western cultures or even a probably existing Western point of view of Latin Americans as foreigners in relation to Europeans and their direct descendants though hardly for reasons other than the mixed race descent pervasive among them as just like in its ruling colonial powers both the Renaissance and the Enlightenment were strongly felt in the region With the Latin American racial whitening policies reflecting a still living regional tendency to the preference of imitating or prizing not only North American and European appearance but also fashion cultural taste and items political values and even lexicon or given names known as mentalidade de colonizado colonized mentality in Portuguese citation needed it seems more ludicrous that the reality is most often quite the reverse i e that Latin Americans especially those from Brazil and the Southern Cone would be readily phobic about being otherized by Westerners and put in the same category as their often ridiculed or disparaged worker classes and rural people or poorer neighboring and close cultural relative nations and thus as a consequence also phobic to being seen as collectively very different or especial in general ",
			"after": " According to Huntington Turkey whose political leadership has systematically tried to Westernize the country since the 1920s is his chief example of a torn country that is attempting to join Western civilization The country s elite started the Westernization efforts beginning with Mustafa Kemal Atat rk who took power as first president of the modern Turkish nation state in 1923 imposed western institutions and dress embraced the Latin alphabet joined NATO and are seeking to join the European Union It should also be noted however that the integration of Turkey with the West can be traced back to the 18th century during which the Ottoman Empire was actively engaged in Westernization 35 ",
