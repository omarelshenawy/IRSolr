			"previous": " In summer and autumn 1951 the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF s 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing only 44 at one point continued seeking battle in MiG Alley where the Yalu River marks the Chinese border against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of deploying some 500 aircraft Following Colonel Harrison Thyng s communication with the Pentagon the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951 for the next year and a half stretch of the war aerial warfare continued 275 On the ground the battle lines had stabilized by early 1951 and a static front developed which changed little till the armistice was signed in 1953 276 ",
			"after": " UN forces held air superiority in the Korean theater from the outset but this was challenged by the arrival of the Soviet MiGs It was regained in 1951 and was maintained for the duration of the conflict This was decisive for the UN first for attacking into the peninsular north and second for resisting the Chinese intervention 264 North Korea and China also had jet powered air forces Their limited training and experience made it strategically untenable to lose them against the better trained UN air forces Thus the United States and the Soviet Union fed mat riel to the war battling by proxy and finding themselves virtually matched technologically when the USAF deployed the F 86F against the MiG 15 late in 1952 ",
