			"after": " The combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season November April with frequently destructive cyclones and a relatively cooler dry season May October Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island s eastern coast the heavy precipitation supports the area s rain forest ecosystem The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still and a semi arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island 15 Tropical cyclones annually cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life 17 In 2004 Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar The storm killed 172 people left 214 260 homeless 18 and caused more than US 250 million in damage 19 ",
