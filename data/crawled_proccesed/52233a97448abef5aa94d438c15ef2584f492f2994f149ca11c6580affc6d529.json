			"previous": " These two localities are unusual in having cliff top dunes of siliceous sand cliff top dunes are an unusual topographic formation and nearly all soil in the area is calcareous As Banksia species are intolerant of calcareous soils and are not adapted to long range seed dispersal the two populations of B epica appear to be reproductively isolated Nelson has suggested that there was once a continuous strip of siliceous sand along the coast providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for B epica rises in the sea level had submerged this strip leaving only the cliff top dunes as suitable habitat The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly speciated since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for only a short time perhaps only since the Last Glacial Maximum 6 ",
			"after": " Pollinators of B epica include Phylidonyris novaehollandiae New Holland Honeyeater and Acanthiza chrysorrhoa Yellow rumped Thornbill 15 No other pollinators have been recorded but the species is poorly surveyed and studies of other Banksia species have consistently indicated a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate pollinators For example a survey of the closely related and co occurring B media found that honeyeater birds and marsupial nectarivores were abundant in the study area and most carried the pollen of Banksia media while it flowered Self pollination and pollination by insects clearly also play major roles in seed production 16 ",
