			"previous": " Due to differences in state laws regarding the incorporation of communities there is a great variation in the distribution and nature of unincorporated areas Unincorporated regions are essentially nonexistent in seven of the northeastern states All of the land in New Jersey Pennsylvania Connecticut Massachusetts and Rhode Island and nearly all of the land in New Hampshire and Vermont is part of an incorporated area of some type In these areas types and official names of local government entities can vary In New England which includes the last five of those seven states plus the less fully incorporated state of Maine local municipalities are known as towns and are administered by a form of direct democracy such as the open town meeting or representative town meeting Larger towns in New England may be incorporated as cities with some form of mayor council government In New Jersey multiple types exist as well such as city township town borough or village but these differences are in the structure of the legislative branches not in the powers or functions of the entities themselves ",
			"after": " On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Virginia strong county model 8 Virginia and other states with this model such as Alabama Maryland and Tennessee set strict requirements on incorporation or grant counties and townships broad powers that in other states are carried out by cities creating a disincentive to incorporate and thus have large urbanized areas which have no municipal government below the county or township level ",
