			"previous": " GPS receivers may include an input for differential corrections using the RTCM SC 104 format This is typically in the form of an RS 232 port at 4 800 bit s speed Data is actually sent at a much lower rate which limits the accuracy of the signal sent using RTCM citation needed Receivers with internal DGPS receivers can outperform those using external RTCM data citation needed As of 2006 update even low cost units commonly include Wide Area Augmentation System WAAS receivers ",
			"after": " Many GPS receivers can relay position data to a PC or other device using the NMEA 0183 protocol Although this protocol is officially defined by the National Marine Electronics Association NMEA 71 references to this protocol have been compiled from public records allowing open source tools like gpsd to read the protocol without violating intellectual property laws clarification needed Other proprietary protocols exist as well such as the SiRF and MTK protocols Receivers can interface with other devices using methods including a serial connection USB or Bluetooth ",
