			"previous": " Although Fox insisted on maintaining CinemaScope for a time some actors disliked the system For Fox s 1965 production Von Ryan s Express Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year Von Ryan s Express was the studio s first picture with Panavision lenses 19 To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses Gottschalk had Bausch Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings with a new astigmatic attachment improving them greatly This was revealed many years after Gottschalk s death a lead designer from Bausch Lomb who had been involved with the original CinemaScope project came to work as a designer for Panavision and after opening some of the older lenses figured out the secret 4 ",
			"after": " In the mid 1960s Gottschalk altered Panavision s business model The company now maintained its full inventory making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental 20 This meant that equipment could be maintained modified and regularly updated by the company When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs as it was not directly competing on sales price This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability 21 ",
