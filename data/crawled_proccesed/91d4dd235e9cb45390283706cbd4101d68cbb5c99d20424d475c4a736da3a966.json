			"previous": " Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens living in anaerobic environments such as swamps This form of metabolism evolved early and it is even possible that the first free living organism was a methanogen 103 A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea such as coenzyme M and methanofuran 104 Other organic compounds such as alcohols acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens These reactions are common in gut dwelling archaea Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly by acetotrophic archaea These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales and are a major part of the communities of microorganisms that produce biogas 105 ",
			"after": " Other archaea use CO 2 in the atmosphere as a source of carbon in a process called carbon fixation they are autotrophs This process involves either a highly modified form of the Calvin cycle 107 or a recently discovered metabolic pathway called the 3 hydroxypropionate 4 hydroxybutyrate cycle 108 The Crenarchaeota also use the reverse Krebs cycle while the Euryarchaeota also use the reductive acetyl CoA pathway 109 Carbon fixation is powered by inorganic energy sources No known archaea carry out photosynthesis 110 Archaeal energy sources are extremely diverse and range from the oxidation of ammonia by the Nitrosopumilales 111 112 to the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur by species of Sulfolobus using either oxygen or metal ions as electron acceptors 100 ",
