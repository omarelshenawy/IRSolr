			"previous": " In 1856 Burges established his own architectural practice in London at 15 Buckingham Street The Strand 18 Some of his early pieces of furniture were created for this office and were later moved to The Tower House Melbury Road Kensington the home he built for himself towards the end of his life 19 His early architectural career produced nothing of major note although he won prestigious commissions for Lille Cathedral 20 the Crimea Memorial Church 21 and the Bombay School of Art 22 None were built to Burges s designs His failed entry for the Law Courts in the Strand if successful would have given London its own Carcassonne the plans being described by the architectural writers Dixon and Muthesius as a re creation of a thirteenth century dream world with a skyline of great inventiveness 23 In 1859 he submitted a French inspired design for St John s Cathedral in Brisbane Australia which was rejected 24 25 He also provided designs for Colombo Cathedral in Ceylon and St Francis Xavier s Cathedral Adelaide without success 26 In 1855 however he obtained a commission for the reconstruction of the chapter house of Salisbury Cathedral 27 Henry Clutton was the lead architect but Burges as assistant contributed to the restoration of the sculpture and to the general decorative scheme 27 Much was lost in restorations of the 1960s 28 More lasting was Burges s work of 1858 onwards in the substantial remodelling of Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire for Robert Carrington 2nd Baron Carrington 29 Rooms there contain some of his large signature fireplaces with carving by Burges s long time collaborator Thomas Nicholls in particular those in the Drawing Room which include motifs from Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained 29 He also designed a circular lavatory for the male servants which Jeremy Cooper describes as being surmounted by a growling Cerberus each of his three heads inset with bloodshot glass eyes 30 ",
			"after": " In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu Dover which was completed in 1861 31 32 Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs 33 Burges later designed the Council Chamber added in 1867 33 and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover a town meeting and concert hall 31 The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices Although Burges designed the project most of it was completed after his death by his partners Pullan and Chapple 33 In 1859 60 Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter working with Poynter s son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher 34 He commissioned Edward Burne Jones of James Powell Sons to make three stained glass windows for the east end representing the Tree of Jesse 35 36 ",
