			"previous": " In preparation for the Democratic convention Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor The squad s focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party MFDP delegation which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state The squad s activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King s room as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee SNCC and the Congress of Racial Equality CORE From beginning to end the squad s assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high ranking officials 101 ",
			"after": " In fact Johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem 102 The convention s Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color 103 The MFDP rejected the committee s ruling The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left SNCC chairman John Lewis would call it a turning point in the civil rights movement 104 ",
