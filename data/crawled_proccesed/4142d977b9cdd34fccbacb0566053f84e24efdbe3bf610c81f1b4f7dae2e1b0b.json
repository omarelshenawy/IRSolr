			"previous": " Stanislavski treated the theatre as an art form that is autonomous from literature and one in which the playwright s contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists 58 His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream western performance training for much of the last century 59 That many of the precepts of his system of actor training seem to be common sense and self evident testifies to its hegemonic success 60 Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so 60 Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings Stanislavski s system acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States 61 Many actors routinely equate his system with the North American Method although the latter s exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski s multivariant holistic and psychophysical approach which explores character and action both from the inside out and the outside in and treats the actor s mind and body as parts of a continuum 62 ",
			"after": " Theatre presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception The structure of dramatic texts unlike other forms of literature is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception 37 The production of plays usually involves contributions from a playwright director a cast of actors and a technical production team that includes a scenic or set designer lighting designer costume designer sound designer stage manager and production manager Depending on the production this team may also include a composer dramaturg video designer or fight director ",
