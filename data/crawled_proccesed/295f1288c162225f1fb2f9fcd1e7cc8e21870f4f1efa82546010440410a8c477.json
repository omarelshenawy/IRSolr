			"previous": " From an early age Jos Rizal Mercado showed a precocious intellect He learned the alphabet from his mother at 3 and could read and write at age 5 12 Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila Jos dropped the last three names that make up his full name on the advice of his brother Paciano Rizal and the Mercado Rizal family thus rendering his name as Jos Protasio Rizal Of this Rizal writes My family never paid much attention to our second surname Rizal but now I had to use it thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child 13 This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Gomburza ",
			"after": " From early childhood Jos and Paciano were already advancing unheard of political ideas of freedom and individual rights which infuriated the authorities note 1 note 2 Despite the name change Jos as Rizal soon distinguished himself in poetry writing contests impressing his professors with his facility with Castilian and other foreign languages and later in writing essays that were critical of the Spanish historical accounts of the pre colonial Philippine societies Indeed by 1891 the year he finished his El Filibusterismo this second surname had become so well known that as he writes to another friend All my family now carry the name Rizal instead of Mercado because the name Rizal means persecution Good I too want to join them and be worthy of this family name 13 ",
