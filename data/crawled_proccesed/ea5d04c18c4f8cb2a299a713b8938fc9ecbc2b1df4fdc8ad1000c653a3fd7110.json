			"previous": " At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution the mechanics of the hand operated Gutenberg style press were still essentially unchanged although new materials in its construction amongst other innovations had gradually improved its printing efficiency By 1800 Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90 while doubling the size of the printed area 52 With a capacity of 480 pages per hour it doubled the output of the old style press 53 Nonetheless the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious ",
			"after": " Two ideas altered the design of the printing press radically First the use of steam power for running the machinery and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818 54 Having moved to London in 1804 Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807 52 Patented in 1810 Koenig had designed a steam press much like a hand press connected to a steam engine 52 The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811 He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer ",
