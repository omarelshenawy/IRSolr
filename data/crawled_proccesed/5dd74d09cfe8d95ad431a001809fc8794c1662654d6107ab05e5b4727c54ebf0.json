			"previous": " William met the invasion by dividing his forces into two groups The first which he led faced Henry The second which included some who became William s firm supporters such as Robert Count of Eu Walter Giffard Roger of Mortemer and William de Warenne faced the other invading force This second force defeated the invaders at the Battle of Mortemer In addition to ending both invasions the battle allowed the duke s ecclesiastical supporters to depose Mauger from the archbishopric of Rouen Mortemer thus marked another turning point in William s growing control of the duchy 39 although his conflict with the French king and the Count of Anjou continued until 1060 40 Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057 but were defeated by William at the Battle of Varaville This was the last invasion of Normandy during William s lifetime 41 and the deaths of the count and the king in 1060 cemented the shift in the balance of power towards William 41 ",
			"after": " One factor in William s favour was his marriage to Matilda of Flanders the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders The union was arranged in 1049 but Pope Leo IX forbade the marriage at the Council of Rheims in October 1049 h The marriage nevertheless went ahead some time in the early 1050s 43 i possibly unsanctioned by the pope According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable papal sanction was not secured until 1059 but as papal Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident it was probably secured earlier 45 Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen one by William and one by Matilda 46 j The marriage was important in bolstering William s status as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors 45 Contemporary writers considered the marriage which produced four sons and five or six daughters to be a success 48 ",
