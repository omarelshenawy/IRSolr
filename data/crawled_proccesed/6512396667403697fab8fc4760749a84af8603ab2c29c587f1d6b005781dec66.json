			"after": " Despite his fervour Saglio s negotiations with the local people were unsuccessful Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach but both failed The inhabitants were reluctant to participate and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages 124 The project was eventually abandoned and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern functional building Despite the failure of Saglio s initiative in Carabane agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns note 8 ",
