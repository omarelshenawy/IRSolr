			"previous": " Sanskrit originated in an oral society and the oral tradition was maintained through the development of early classical Sanskrit literature 61 Writing was not introduced to India until after Sanskrit had evolved into the Prakrits when it was written the choice of writing system was influenced by the regional scripts of the scribes Therefore Sanskrit has no native script of its own 2 As such virtually all the major writing systems of South Asia have been used for the production of Sanskrit manuscripts ",
			"after": " The earliest known inscriptions in Sanskrit date to the first century BCE They are in the Br hm script which was originally used for Prakrit not Sanskrit It has been described as a paradox that the first evidence of written Sanskrit occurs centuries later than that of the Prakrit languages which are its linguistic descendants 61 In northern India there are Br hm inscriptions dating from the third century BCE onwards the oldest appearing on the famous Prakrit pillar inscriptions of king Ashoka The earliest South Indian inscriptions in Tamil Brahmi written in early Tamil belong to the same period When Sanskrit was written down it was first used for texts of an administrative literary or scientific nature The sacred texts were preserved orally and were set down in writing reluctantly according to one commentator and at a comparatively late date 41 62 ",
