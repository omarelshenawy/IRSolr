			"previous": " These magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby Next in intensity are close swoops where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly snap their beaks or even peck or bite at the face neck ears or eyes More rarely a bird may dive bomb and strike the intruder s usually a cyclist s head with its chest A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim s chest and peck at the face and eyes 88 ",
