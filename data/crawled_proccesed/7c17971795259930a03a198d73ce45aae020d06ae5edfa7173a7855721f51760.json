			"previous": " Two other partial skeletons with skull material were named Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis by Fernando Novas in 1986 35 but this species too is now thought to be a synonym 13 Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis was discovered in 1975 and was described by Novas 1986 who considered it a primitive saurischian and possibly a theropod Novas 1992 and Sereno and Novas 1992 examined the Freguellisaurus remains and found them referable to Herrerasaurus 36 Ischisaurus cattoi was discovered in 1960 and described by Reig in 1963 Novas 1992 and Sereno and Novas 1992 reviewed its remains and found them to be referable to Herrerasaurus 36 ",
			"after": " A complete Herrerasaurus skull was not found until 1988 by a team of paleontologists led by Paul Sereno 4 Based on the new fossils authors such as Thomas Holtz 37 and Jos Bonaparte 38 classified Herrerasaurus at the base of the saurischian tree before the divergence between prosauropods and theropods However Sereno favored classifying Herrerasaurus and the Herrerasauridae as primitive theropods These two classifications have become the most persistent with Rauhut 2003 39 and Bittencourt and Kellner 2004 40 favoring the early theropod hypothesis and Max Langer 2004 9 Langer and Benton 2006 41 and Randall Irmis and his coauthors 2007 42 favoring the basal saurischian hypothesis If Herrerasaurus were indeed a theropod it would indicate that theropods sauropodomorphs and ornithischians diverged even earlier than herrerasaurids before the middle Carnian and that all three lineages independently evolved several dinosaurian features such as a more advanced ankle joint or an open acetabulum 43 This view is further supported by ichnological records showing large tridactyl three toed footprints that can be attributed only to a theropod dinosaur These footprints date from the Ladinian Middle Triassic of the Los Rastros Formation in Argentina and predate Herrerasaurus by 3 to 5 million years 44 45 ",
