			"previous": " More recent views of Columbus particularly those of Native Americans have tended to be much more critical 101 102 103 This is because the native Taino of Hispaniola where Columbus began a rudimentary tribute system for gold and cotton disappeared so rapidly after contact with the Spanish because of overwork and especially after 1519 when the first pandemic struck Hispaniola 104 because of European diseases 105 Some estimates indicate case fatality rates of 80 90 percent in Native American populations during smallpox epidemics 106 The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved via the encomienda system 107 which resembled a feudal system in Medieval Europe 108 The pre Columbian population is estimated to have been perhaps 250 000 300 000 According to the historian Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes by 1548 56 years after Columbus landed fewer than five hundred Taino were left on the island 109 ",
			"after": " Columbus treatment of the Hispaniola natives was even worse his soldiers raped killed and enslaved with impunity at every landing When Columbus fell ill in 1495 soldiers were reported to have gone on a rampage slaughtering 50 000 natives Upon his recovery Columbus organized his troops efforts forming a squadron of several hundred heavily armed men and more than twenty attack dogs The men tore across the land killing thousands of sick and unarmed natives Soldiers would use their captives for sword practice attempting to decapitate them or cut them in half with a single blow 110 ",
