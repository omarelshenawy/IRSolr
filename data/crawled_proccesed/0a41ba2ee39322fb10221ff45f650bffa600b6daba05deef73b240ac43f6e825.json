			"previous": " Most of Cape Cod s geological history involves the advance and retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet in the late Pleistocene geological era and the subsequent changes in sea level Using radiocarbon dating techniques researchers have determined that around 23 000 years ago the ice sheet reached its maximum southward advance over North America and then started to retreat Many kettle ponds clear cold lakes were formed and remain on Cape Cod as a result of the receding glacier By about 18 000 years ago the ice sheet had retreated past Cape Cod By roughly 15 000 years ago it had retreated past southern New England When so much of Earth s water was locked up in massive ice sheets the sea level was lower Truro s bayside beaches used to be a petrified forest before it became a beach ",
			"after": " As the ice began to melt the sea began to rise Initially sea level rose quickly about 15 metres 49 ft per 1 000 years but then the rate declined On Cape Cod sea level rose roughly 3 metres 9 8 ft per millennium between 6 000 and 2 000 years ago After that it continued to rise at about 1 metre 3 3 ft per millennium By 6 000 years ago the sea level was high enough to start eroding the glacial deposits that the vanished continental ice sheet had left on Cape Cod The water transported the eroded deposits north and south along the outer Cape s shoreline through a process known as longshore drift Those reworked sediments that moved north went to the tip of Cape Cod The entire town of Provincetown at the extreme tip of the Cape is a spit consisting largely of deposited marine sediment that was eroded and transported from farther south along the shore Those sediments that instead moved south created the islands and shoals of Monomoy So while other parts of the Cape have dwindled from the action of the waves these parts of the Cape have grown through the deposition of sediment in just the last 6 000 years ",
