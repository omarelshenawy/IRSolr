			"after": " Amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines Nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic 122 Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs Xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape 122 123 Caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the Cayenne caecilian Typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil 124 In some salamanders the skin is poisonous The rough skinned newt Taricha granulosa from North America and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin TTX the most toxic non protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish Handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly In feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible 125 126 The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis In locations where both snake and salamander co exist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity 127 Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity 126 Some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms Altogether over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated 128 ",
