			"previous": " In 2006 Martinair purchased four Boeing 747 400s from Singapore Airlines These passenger planes were converted to freighters to replace the older Boeing 747 200Fs In 2009 three out of the four 747s were stored because of the economic crisis In the end of 2010 two of the 747 400s were leased to Air Cargo Germany 28 29 The remaining 747 PH MPS returned into service in May 2011 with an untitled colour scheme because Martinair wasn t sure yet if the plane would remain operating for them 30 As of January 2015 the PH MPS remains active in Martinair s fleet as the only 747BCF The two ex ACG planes are stored and the remaining 747BCF is currently operating for Saudi Arabian Airlines",
			"after": " The first McDonnell Douglas MD 11 was delivered in December 1994 Throughout the next three years six other brand new MD 11 s were delivered to Martinair In total four McDonnell Douglas MD 11CFs Convertible Freighter and two full freighters were delivered 31 32 Martinair was the launch customer of the convertible freighter In 2004 another MD 11F was added to the fleet this one was previously owned by Swissair and then converted to full freighter 33 From 1995 to 2006 some of the convertible MD 11 were reconfigured to transport passengers in the high passenger peaks during the summer period The passenger configuration was fitted with 390 seats 34 After 2006 the demand lowered and Martinair did not need extra seats anymore The lowering of the demand continued until after 53 years of Dutch service Martinair ceased all their passenger flights ",
