			"previous": " John Watkins Brett an engineer from Bristol sought and obtained permission from Louis Philippe in 1847 to establish telegraphic communication between France and England The first undersea cable was laid in 1850 and connected London with Paris After an initial exchange of greetings between Queen Victoria and President Napoleon it was almost immediately severed by a French fishing vessel 34 The line was relaid the next year 34 and then followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries ",
			"after": " The Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed in London in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean It was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship SS Great Eastern captained by Sir James Anderson after many mishaps along the way 35 Earlier transatlantic submarine cables installations were attempted in 1857 1858 and 1865 The 1857 cable only operated intermittently for a few days or weeks before it failed The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long transmission lines An overland telegraph from Britain to India was first connected in 1866 but was unreliable so a submarine telegraph cable was connected in 1870 36 Several telegraph companies were combined to form the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1872 ",
