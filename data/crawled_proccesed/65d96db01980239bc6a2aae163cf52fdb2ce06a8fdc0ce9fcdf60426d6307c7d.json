			"previous": " The moral authority of Barre s government gradually eroded as many Somalis had become disillusioned with life under military rule By the mid 1980s resistance movements supported by Ethiopia s communist Derg administration had sprung up across the country Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas especially in the northern regions The clampdown included bombing of cities with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa a Somali National Movement SNM stronghold among the targeted areas in 1988 13 37 The bombardment was led by General Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan Barre s son in law 38 ",
			"after": " Although the SNM at its inception had a unionist constitution it eventually began to pursue independence looking to secede from the rest of Somalia 39 Under the leadership of Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur the local administration declared the northwestern Somali territories independent at a conference held in Burao between 27 April 1991 and 15 May 1991 40 Tuur then became the newly established Somaliland polity s first President but subsequently renounced the separatist platform in 1994 and began instead to publicly seek and advocate reconciliation with the rest of Somalia under a power sharing federal system of governance 39 Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal was appointed as Tuur s successor in 1993 by the Grand Conference of National Reconciliation in Borama which met for four months leading to a gradual improvement in security as well as a consolidation of the new territory 41 Egal was reappointed in 1997 and remained in power until his death on 3 May 2002 The vice president Dahir Riyale Kahin who was during the 1980s the highest ranking National Security Service NSS officer in Berbera in Siad Barre s government was sworn in as president shortly afterwards 42 In 2003 Kahin became the first elected president of Somaliland ",
