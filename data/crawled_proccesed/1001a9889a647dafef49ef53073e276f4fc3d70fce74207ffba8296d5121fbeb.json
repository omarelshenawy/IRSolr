			"previous": " Succinate Q oxidoreductase also known as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase is a second entry point to the electron transport chain 23 It is unusual because it is the only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD cofactor iron sulfur clusters and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species 24 25 It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient ",
			"after": " In some eukaryotes such as the parasitic worm Ascaris suum an enzyme similar to complex II fumarate reductase menaquinol fumarate oxidoreductase or QFR operates in reverse to oxidize ubiquinol and reduce fumarate This allows the worm to survive in the anaerobic environment of the large intestine carrying out anaerobic oxidative phosphorylation with fumarate as the electron acceptor 26 Another unconventional function of complex II is seen in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum Here the reversed action of complex II as an oxidase is important in regenerating ubiquinol which the parasite uses in an unusual form of pyrimidine biosynthesis 27 ",
