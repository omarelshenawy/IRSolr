			"previous": " Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya s gross domestic product GDP after the service sector In 2005 agriculture including forestry and fishing accounted for 24 of GDP as well as for 18 of wage employment and 50 of revenue from exports The principal cash crops are tea horticultural produce and coffee Horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya s exports The production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather related fluctuations Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid for example in 2004 aid for 1 8 million people because of one of Kenya s intermittent droughts citation needed ",
			"after": " A consortium led by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics ICRISAT has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties instead of maize in particularly dry areas Pigeon peas are very drought resistant so can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro dealer networks for distribution and marketing This work which included linking producers to wholesalers helped to increase local producer prices by 20 25 in Nairobi and Mombasa The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty 80 ",
