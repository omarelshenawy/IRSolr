			"after": " The general design of Oliver typewriters remained mostly unchanged throughout the company s history 10 The Olivers are down strike typewriters meaning the typebars strike the platen also known as the roller from above rather than from below up strike or from the front front strike Unlike the up strike method which prints text out of sight on the underside of the platen the down strike is a visible print design meaning the full page is visible to the typist as the text is being entered The relatively greater striking power of the down strike design led Olivers to be preferred for specialty uses such as stencil cutting or manifolding copying using carbon paper 14 The front strike method a competing visible print design was patented around the same time 1889 91 but an effective machine that did not interfere with the typist s line of sight was not available until 1897 when roughly three years after the introduction of the Oliver No 1 the Underwood No 1 appeared on the market 15 ",
