			"previous": " After defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig Harold left much of his army in the north including Morcar and Edwin and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion 80 He probably learned of William s landing while he was travelling south Harold stopped in London and was there for about a week before marching to Hastings so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south averaging about 27 miles 43 kilometres per day 81 for the distance of approximately 200 miles 320 kilometres 82 Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans William s scouts reported the English arrival to the duke The exact events preceding the battle are obscure with contradictory accounts in the sources but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy 83 Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill present day Battle East Sussex about 6 miles 9 7 kilometres from William s castle at Hastings 84 ",
			"after": " The battle began at about 9 am on 14 October and lasted all day but while a broad outline is known the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts in the sources 85 Although the numbers on each side were about equal William had both cavalry and infantry including many archers while Harold had only foot soldiers and few if any archers 86 The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that William s army was thrown back with heavy casualties Some of William s Breton troops panicked and fled and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry During the Bretons flight rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed but William succeeded in rallying his troops Two further Norman retreats were feigned to once again draw the English into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry 87 The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon but it appears that the decisive event was Harold s death about which differing stories are told William of Jumi ges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold s death by an arrow to the eye but that may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head 88 ",
