			"previous": " Like many mid 1400s polyptychs the exterior panels borrow heavily from the Ghent Altarpiece which was completed in 1432 The combination of naturalistic donor portraits with grisaille imitation statues of saints is borrowed from that work as is the treatment of the Annunciation 47 Van der Weyden used iconography in the Beaune exterior panels not found in his other works which suggests Rolin may have commissioned the altarpiece to follow van Eyck s example 19 Van der Weyden was not inclined merely to imitate though and arranged the panels and figures in a concentrated and compact format 47 Jacobs writes that the exterior presents the most consistent pictorial rendering of trompe l oeil sculpture to date Gabriel s scroll and Mary s lily appear to be made of stone the figures cast shadows against the back of their niches creating a sense of depth which adds to the illusion 20 ",
			"after": " The exterior panels are drab according to Blum who writes that on Rolin s panel the most colourful figure is the red angel which with its gold helmet and keys emerges like an apparition 19 Rolin and de Salins can be identified by the coats of arms held by the angels 1 husband and wife kneel at cloth covered prie dieux portable altars displaying their emblems Although De Salins was reputedly pious and charitable and even perhaps the impetus for the building of the hospice she is placed on the exterior right 19 traditionally thought of as an inferior position corresponding to Hell linking her to Eve original sin and the Fall of man 44 ",
