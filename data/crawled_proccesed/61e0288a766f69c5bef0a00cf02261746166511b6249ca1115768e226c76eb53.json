			"previous": " In the first case the cipher can be broken using the same techniques as for a general simple substitution cipher such as frequency analysis or pattern words 13 While solving it is likely that an attacker will quickly notice the regularity in the solution and deduce that a Caesar cipher is the specific algorithm employed ",
			"after": " In the second instance breaking the scheme is even more straightforward Since there are only a limited number of possible shifts 26 in English they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack 14 One way to do this is to write out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts 15 a technique sometimes known as completing the plain component 16 The example given is for the ciphertext EXXEGOEXSRGI the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four Another way of viewing this method is that under each letter of the ciphertext the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down them in reverse order The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows ",
