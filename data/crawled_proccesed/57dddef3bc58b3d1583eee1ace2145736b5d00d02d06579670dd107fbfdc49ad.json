			"previous": " In September 2007 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a committee opinion on these and other female genital surgeries including vaginal rejuvenation designer vaginoplasty revirgination and G spot amplification This opinion states that the safety of these procedures has not been documented ACOG recommends that women seeking these surgeries need to be informed about the lack of data supporting these procedures and the potential associated risks such as infection altered sensation dyspareunia adhesions and scarring 14 ",
			"after": " With the growing popularity of female cosmetic genital surgeries the practice increasingly draws criticism from an opposition movement of cyberfeminist activist groups and platforms the so called labia pride movement The major point of contention is that heavy advertising for these procedures in combination with a lack of public education fosters body insecurities in women with larger labia in spite of the fact that there is gross individual variation in the size of labia The preference for small labia is purely a matter of fashion and is without clinical or functional significance 15 16 ",
