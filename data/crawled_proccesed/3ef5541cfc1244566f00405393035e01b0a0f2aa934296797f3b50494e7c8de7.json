			"previous": " Brownhills is situated on the ancient Watling Street and there is evidence of early settlement in the area including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle 1 2 The name Brownhills however is not recorded before the 17th century The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area 3 ",
			"after": " The settlement is first recorded as Brownhill on Robert Plot s 1680 map of Staffordshire at which time it was a hamlet within the manor of Ogley Hay which in turn was part of the parish of Norton Canes 3 Ogley Hay itself had existed since at least the 11th century and is mentioned in the Domesday Book 1 although the 1801 census lists it as having a population of only 8 people 4 Beyond Ogley Hay lay Catshill another hamlet which pre dated Brownhills and which lay within the parish of Shenstone ",
