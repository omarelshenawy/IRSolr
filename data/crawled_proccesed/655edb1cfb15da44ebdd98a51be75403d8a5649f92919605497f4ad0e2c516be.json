			"previous": " The second law of thermodynamics puts a fundamental limit on the thermal efficiency of all heat engines Even an ideal frictionless engine can t convert anywhere near 100 of its input heat into work The limiting factors are the temperature at which the heat enters the engine and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat measured in an absolute scale such as the Kelvin or Rankine scale From Carnot s theorem for any engine working between these two temperatures 4 ",
			"after": " This limiting value is called the Carnot cycle efficiency because it is the efficiency of an unattainable ideal reversible engine cycle called the Carnot cycle No device converting heat into mechanical energy regardless of its construction can exceed this efficiency ",
