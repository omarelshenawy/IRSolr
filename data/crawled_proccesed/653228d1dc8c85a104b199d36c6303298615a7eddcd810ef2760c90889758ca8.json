			"after": " Jet streams are fast flowing narrow air currents found in the atmosphere of some planets including Earth 1 The main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds flowing west to east Their paths typically have a meandering shape jet streams may start stop split into two or more parts combine into one stream or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet The strongest jet streams are the polar jets at around 7 12 km 23 000 39 000 ft above sea level and the higher and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at around 10 16 km 33 000 52 000 ft The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America Europe and Asia and their intervening oceans while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round ",
