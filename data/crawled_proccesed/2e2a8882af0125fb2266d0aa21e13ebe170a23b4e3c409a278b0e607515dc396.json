			"previous": " Douglas s influences were not from England alone Although he never travelled abroad he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries especially Germany and France This combination of Gothic styles contributed to what has come to be known as the High Victorian style Its features include a sense of massiveness steep roofs which are frequently hipped round turrets with conical roofs pinnacles heavy corbel tables and the use of polychromism Many of Douglas s works especially his earlier ones are High Victorian in style or incorporate High Victorian features 29 One characteristic feature of Douglas s work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs 30 ",
			"after": " Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture By the time Douglas moved to Chester the black and white revival using half timbering was well under way and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere 31 The black and white revival did not start in Chester but it did become Chester s speciality 32 The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T A Richardson and James Harrison 33 and it came to be developed mainly by T M Lockwood and by Douglas 34 Part of Douglas s earliest work for the Grosvenor family the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park used half timbering in its upper storey this is the first known use by Douglas of black and white 35 Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture in particular the Tudor style These include tile hanging pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks In this style Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw 36 Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries 16 ",
