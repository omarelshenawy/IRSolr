			"previous": " Hydrodynamics concerns the flow of water around the ship s hull bow stern and over bodies such as propeller blades or rudder or through thruster tunnels Resistance resistance towards motion in water primarily caused due to flow of water around the hull Powering calculation is done based on this Propulsion to move the vessel through water using propellers thrusters water jets sails etc Engine types are mainly internal combustion Some vessels are electrically powered using nuclear or solar energy Ship motions involves motions of the vessel in seaway and its responses in waves and wind Controllability maneuvering involves controlling and maintaining position and direction of the vessel",
