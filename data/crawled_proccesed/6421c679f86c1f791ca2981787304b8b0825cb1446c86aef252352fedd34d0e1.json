			"previous": " The prototype G ASHG rolled out of the Hurn assembly hall on 28 July 1963 at which point BAC had received orders for the type from a number of operators On 20 August 1963 the prototype conducted its first flight painted in BUA s livery The first flight had taken place almost a year before the Douglas DC 9 a rival American jetliner BAC considered the BAC to hold a technological edge 17 The One Eleven s lead was of significant importance commercially since as shown by the Bonanza Air Lines case US authorities could refuse to approve sales of foreign aircraft to domestic airlines where an American alternative existed ",
			"after": " The One Eleven prototype flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow crashed on 22 October during Stall testing with the loss of all on board The investigation led to the discovery of what became known as deep stall or superstall a phenomenon caused by reduced airflow to the tailplane caused by the combined blanking effects of the wing and the aft mounted engine nacelles at high angles of attack which prevents recovery of normal nose down flight 18 To prevent such stalls BAC designed and added devices known as stick shakers and stick pushers to the One Eleven s control system 19 It also redesigned the wing s leading edge to smooth airflow into the engines and over the tailplane The specially modified aircraft used for testing this problem is at Brooklands Museum ",
