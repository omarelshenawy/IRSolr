			"previous": " The Beaver was designed for flight in rugged and remote areas of the world Its short takeoff and landing capability made it ideal for areas normally only accessible by canoe or foot Because it often flies to remote locations often in cold climates its oil reservoir filler is located in the cockpit and oil can be filled in flight A series of upgrades to the basic design were incorporated One major customer introduced the use of flat steps replacing the earlier tubes a feature that is now almost universal In 1987 the Canadian Engineering Centennial Board named the DHC 2 one of the top ten Canadian engineering achievements of the 20th century 2 ",
			"after": " At one point in its production plans to license and build the type in New Zealand were proposed The remaining tooling was purchased by Viking Air of Victoria Canada which manufactures replacement parts for most of the early de Havilland line On 24 February 2006 Viking purchased the type certificates from Bombardier Aerospace for all the original de Havilland designs 3 The ownership of the certificates gives Viking the exclusive right to manufacture new Beavers Viking now sells a remanufactured and rebuilt DHC 2T Turbo Beaver upgraded with a Pratt Whitney Canada PT6A 34 680 hp 507 kW turboprop engine With a maximum gross takeoff weight increased to 6 000 lb 2 700 kg it can carry 2 450 lb 1 110 kg of freight 4 However Viking Turbo Beavers are only rebuilt from existing air frames and are not new builds unlike Viking s own DHC 6 Series 400 Twin Otter which is manufactured from a completely new airframe ",
