			"previous": " The first detailed scientific description was made by Tasmania s Deputy Surveyor General George Harris in 1808 five years after first settlement of the island 20 21 Harris originally placed the thylacine in the genus Didelphis which had been created by Linnaeus for the American opossums describing it as Didelphis cynocephala the dog headed opossum Recognition that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from the known mammal genera led to the establishment of the modern classification scheme and in 1796 Geoffroy Saint Hilaire created the genus Dasyurus where he placed the thylacine in 1810 To resolve the mixture of Greek and Latin nomenclature the species name was altered to cynocephalus In 1824 it was separated out into its own genus Thylacinus by Temminck 22 The common name derives directly from the genus name originally from the Greek th lakos meaning pouch or sack 23 a ",
			"after": " Several studies support the thylacine as being a basal member of the Dasyuromorphia and the Tasmanian devil as its closest living relative However research published in Genome Research in January 2009 suggests the numbat may be more basal than the devil and more closely related to the thylacine The resulting cladogram follows below 24 ",
