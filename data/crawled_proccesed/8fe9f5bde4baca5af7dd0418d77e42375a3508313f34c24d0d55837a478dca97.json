			"previous": " Sir Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3 5 tons with a 110 foot 34 meter wingspan that was powered by two 360 horsepower 270 kW steam engines driving two propellers In 1894 his machine was tested with overhead rails to prevent it from rising The test showed that it had enough lift to take off The craft was uncontrollable which Maxim it is presumed realized because he subsequently abandoned work on it 14 ",
