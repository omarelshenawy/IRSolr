			"previous": " Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45 an amount that humans being vertically oriented and tailless can spin in a fraction of a second 93 The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity like a human carrying a heavy timber although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster 94 ",
			"after": " Scientists have produced a wide range of maximum speed estimates mostly around 11 metres per second 40 km h 25 mph but a few as low as 5 11 metres per second 18 40 km h 11 25 mph and a few as high as 20 metres per second 72 km h 45 mph Researchers have to rely on various estimating techniques because while there are many tracks of very large theropods walking so far none have been found of very large theropods running and this absence may indicate that they did not run 95 Scientists who think that Tyrannosaurus was able to run point out that hollow bones and other features that would have lightened its body may have kept adult weight to a mere 4 5 metric tons 5 0 short tons or so or that other animals like ostriches and horses with long flexible legs are able to achieve high speeds through slower but longer strides Additionally some have argued that Tyrannosaurus had relatively larger leg muscles than any animal alive today which could have enabled fast running 40 70 kilometres per hour 25 43 mph 96 ",
