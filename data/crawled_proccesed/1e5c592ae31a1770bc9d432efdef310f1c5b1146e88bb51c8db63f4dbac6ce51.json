			"previous": " Britain which had concluded as early as 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire s sea lanes responded to the perceived threat from France Russia and increasingly Germany with a resumption of armored cruiser construction in 1898 with the Cressy class At 21 knots the Cressys were slower than the newer French cruisers However their 6 inch 152 mm belt of Krupp steel was expected to keep out armor piercing shells from a 6 inch 152 mm quick firing gun at likely battle ranges while their two 9 2 inch 233 7 mm and 12 6 inch 152 mm guns offered comparable firepower The 2 500 ton weight of their belt armor was an improvement over the 1809 tons of the otherwise similar Diadem class and very similar to that of the Canopus class of battleships The Cressys were the beginning of a rapid expansion in British cruiser construction Between 1899 and 1905 seven classes of armored cruisers were either completed or laid down a total of 35 ships 20 ",
			"after": " Japan which now received British technical assistance in naval matters and purchased larger vessels from France and Britain began an armored cruiser program of its own With the end of the First Sino Japanese War in 1895 and the return under pressure from Russia in what became known as the Triple Intervention of the Liaotung peninsula to China Japan began a 10 year naval build up program under the slogan Perseverance and determination Gashinsh tan in preparation for further confrontations The core of this 109 ship build up was the Six Six Program of six battleships and six eventually eight armored cruisers comparable to the British Cressy class The Yakumo followed the basic pattern for these cruisers on a 9 646 long tons 9 801 t displacement she carried four 7 99 inch 203 mm and twelve 6 inch 150 mm guns was protected by a 3 5 6 7 inch 89 170 mm main belt 2 4 inch 61 mm armored deck and 5 9 inch 150 mm turret armor and steamed at 20 5 knots 23 6 mph 38 0 km h They were considered a compromise between cruiser and battleship and were intended to augment capital ship strength in battle squadrons This practice would persist until World War I 21 22 ",
