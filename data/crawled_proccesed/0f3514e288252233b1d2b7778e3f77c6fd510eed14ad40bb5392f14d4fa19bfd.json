			"previous": " As B menziesii is not similar to any other Banksia hybrids are unlikely to occur The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B hookeriana Hooker s Banksia found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery 27 Manual cross fertilisation with B attenuata has resulted in germination indicating that these two species are genetically compatible but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times 28 ",
			"after": " Banksia menziesii grows primarily in deep sandy soils of the Swan Coastal Plain and Geraldton Sandplains extending from Waroona in the south to Kalbarri in the north 27 However It is uncommon south of Mandurah 29 It is generally limited to the east by the heavy soils of the Darling Scarp but does grow on isolated patches of sand in the Jarrah Forest and Avon Wheatbelt regions such as occur near Beverley Toodyay and Wongan Hills The easternmost known occurrence is a specimen collected by Roger Hnatiuk in 1979 from north east of Brookton about 125 km 75 mi from the coast 27 Much of its range on the Swan Coastal Plain coincides with Perth s expanding metropolitan area and much habitat has been lost to clearing 30 ",
