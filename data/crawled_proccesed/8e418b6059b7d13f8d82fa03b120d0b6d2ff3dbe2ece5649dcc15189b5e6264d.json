			"previous": " In 2006 the book was displayed in Joan Mir Illustrated Books at the Vero Beach Museum of Art One critic said it is an especially powerful set not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book s creation The lithographs are long narrow verticals and while they feature Mir s familiar shapes there s an unusual emphasis on texture The critic continued I was instantly attracted to these four prints to an emotional lushness that s in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Mir s work Their poignancy is even greater I think when you read how they came to be The artist met and became friends with Desnos perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer in 1925 and before long they made plans to collaborate on a livre d artiste Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish Civil War and World War II Desnos bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Auschwitz and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945 Nearly three decades later at the suggestion of Desnos widow Mir set out to illustrate the poet s manuscript It was his first work in prose which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration ",
