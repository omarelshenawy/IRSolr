			"previous": " A topological map is a very general type of map the kind one might sketch on a napkin It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information Beck s London Underground map is an iconic example Though the most widely used map of The Tube it preserves little of reality it varies scale constantly and abruptly it straightens curved tracks and it contorts directions The only topography on it is the River Thames letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space 30 Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know so the map fulfils its purpose 31 ",
			"after": " Arthur H Robinson an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography stated that a map not properly designed will be a cartographic failure He also claimed when considering all aspects of cartography that map design is perhaps the most complex 32 Robinson codified the mapmaker s understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs ",
