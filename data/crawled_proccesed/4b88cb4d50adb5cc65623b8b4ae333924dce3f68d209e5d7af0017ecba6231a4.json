			"previous": " Also sometime in the early 1960s automobiles would also provide a boost through the early work of Pierre B zier at Renault who used Paul de Casteljau s curves now called B zier curves after B zier s work in the field to develop 3d modeling techniques for Renault car bodies These curves would form the foundation for much curve modeling work in the field as curves unlike polygons are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well ",
			"after": " It was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics TRW Lockheed Georgia General Electric and Sperry Rand are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid 1960s IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal the first commercially available graphics computer Ralph Baer a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to Magnavox and called the Odyssey While very simplistic and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen It was the first consumer computer graphics product David C Evans was director of engineering at Bendix Corporation s computer division from 1953 to 1962 after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people In 1966 the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest This new department would become the world s primary research center for computer graphics ",
