			"previous": " In 1999 SAS sold half of its 40 stake in British Midland to Lufthansa which was seeking a stronger position at London Heathrow following which British Midland joined Star Alliance At the time British Midland chairman Sir Michael Bishop owned a 50 share of the company Between 1999 and 2004 Lufthansa sought to sell some or all of its share in the airline Virgin Atlantic hoped to buy the shares to then merge both airlines as BMI was already Virgin s preferred feeder airline into Heathrow Virgin argued that the merger would have brought together two airlines with combined ticket sales of more than 2 billion forming a powerful force in the aviation industry BMI was believed to have initiated the talks after it began losing money following the 11 September 2001 attacks A merger would have strengthened Virgin Atlantic s base at Heathrow where BMI had hundreds of highly valued take off and landing slots to increase the competition with British Airways 48 ",
			"after": " The two airlines combined would have had 17 of Heathrow slots against British Airways 43 Worried about the increased competition it would face if such a merger went ahead British Airways considered the takeover of either BMI or Virgin Atlantic to stop the merger British Airways concluded it would be easier to take over the financially weaker and less high profile BMI However in 2004 talks of any merger of the three airlines ended In late 2006 the airline again dismissed renewed speculation that Virgin Atlantic was preparing to make a bid to acquire full control of BMI despite Sir Richard Branson repeating in a radio interview that such a merger would be a logical business move 49 ",
