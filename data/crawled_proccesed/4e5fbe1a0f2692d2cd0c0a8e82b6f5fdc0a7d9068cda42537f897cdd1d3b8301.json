			"previous": " The Greek and Roman civilizations are credited for initially advancing water clock design to include complex gearing which was connected to fanciful automata and also resulted in improved accuracy These advances were passed on through Byzantium and Islamic times eventually making their way back to Europe Independently the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks in 725 A D passing their ideas on to Korea and Japan ",
			"after": " Some water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade Pre modern societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern industrial societies where every hour of work or rest is monitored and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions Instead water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for astrological reasons These early water clocks were calibrated with a sundial While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia until it was replaced by the more accurate pendulum clock in 17th century Europe ",
