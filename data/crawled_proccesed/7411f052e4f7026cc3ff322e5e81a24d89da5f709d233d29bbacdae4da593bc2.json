			"previous": " The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n If the result of any of these divisions is an integer then n is not a prime otherwise it is a prime Indeed if is composite with a and b 1 then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most For example for the trial divisions are by m 2 3 4 5 and 6 None of these numbers divides 37 so 37 is prime This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime For example to check the primality of 37 only three divisions are necessary m 2 3 and 5 given that 4 and 6 are composite ",
