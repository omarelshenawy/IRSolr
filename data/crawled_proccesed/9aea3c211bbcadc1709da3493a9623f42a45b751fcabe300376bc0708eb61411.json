			"previous": "   The following four timelines show the geologic time scale The first shows the entire time from the formation of the Earth to the present but this compresses the most recent eon Therefore the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale The second scale compresses the most recent era so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs it is further expanded in the fourth scale The second third and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks The Holocene the latest epoch is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right another reason for expanding the fourth scale The Pleistocene P epoch Q stands for the Quaternary period ",
