			"previous": " At 03 49 on the morning of August 9 1945 Bockscar flown by Sweeney s crew carried Fat Man with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission with two B 29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B 29s in Sweeney s flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged 177 ",
			"after": " During pre flight inspection of Bockscar the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use 640 US gallons 2 400 l 530 imp gal of fuel carried in a reserve tank This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back consuming still more fuel Replacing the pump would take hours moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well as the bomb was live Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission 178 179 ",
