			"previous": " Illuminated manuscripts represent the most complete record of Gothic painting providing a record of styles in places where no monumental works have otherwise survived The earliest full manuscripts with French Gothic illustrations date to the middle of the 13th century 11 Many such illuminated manuscripts were royal bibles although psalters also included illustrations the Parisian Psalter of Saint Louis dating from 1253 to 1270 features 78 full page illuminations in tempera paint and gold leaf 12 ",
			"after": " During the late 1200s scribes began to create prayer books for the laity often known as books of hours due to their use at prescribed times of the day 12 The earliest known example seems to have written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240 Nobility frequently purchased such texts paying handsomely for decorative illustrations among the most well known creators of these is Jean Pucelle whose Hours of Jeanne d Evreux was commissioned by King Charles IV as a gift for his queen Jeanne d vreux 13 Elements of the French Gothic present in such works include the use of decorative page framing reminiscent of the architecture of the time with elongated and detailed figures 12 The use of spatial indicators such as building elements and natural features such as trees and clouds also denote the French Gothic style of illumination 12 ",
