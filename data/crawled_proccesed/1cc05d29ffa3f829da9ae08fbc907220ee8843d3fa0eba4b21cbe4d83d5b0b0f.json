			"after": " In Hellenistic Egypt the mathematician Euclid laid down the foundations of mathematical rigor and introduced the concepts of definition axiom theorem and proof still in use today in his Elements considered the most influential textbook ever written 27 Archimedes considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time 28 is credited with using the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of Pi 29 He is also known in physics for laying the foundations of hydrostatics statics and the explanation of the principle of the lever ",
