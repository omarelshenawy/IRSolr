			"after": " A tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways One such way is if it moves over land thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself quickly losing strength 75 Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two or evolve into extratropical cyclones There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water such as with Hurricane Ivan If it remains over mountains for even a short time weakening will accelerate 76 Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall 77 This may lead to deadly floods and mudslides as was the case with Hurricane Mitch in 1998 78 Without warm surface water the storm cannot survive 79 ",
