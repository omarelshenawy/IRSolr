			"previous": " On February 17 1865 in the last months of the Civil War much of Columbia was destroyed by fire while being occupied by Union troops under the command of General William Tecumseh Sherman 9 Jeff Goodwyn mayor of Columbia sent William B Stanley and Thomas W Radcliffe to surrender the city to Sherman s troops According to legend Columbia s First Baptist Church barely missed being torched by Sherman s troops The soldiers marched up to the church and asked the sexton if he could direct them to the First Baptist Church The sexton directed the men to the nearby Washington Street Methodist Church thus the historic landmark was saved from destruction by Union soldiers and the sexton preserved his employment at the cost of another 10 ",
			"after": " Controversy surrounding the burning of the city started soon after the war ended General Sherman blamed the high winds and retreating Confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton which had been stacked in the streets General Sherman denied ordering the burning though he did order militarily significant structures such as the Confederate Printing Plant destroyed Firsthand accounts by local residents Union soldiers and a newspaper reporter offer a tale of revenge by Union troops for Columbia s and South Carolina s pivotal role in leading Southern states to secede from the Union Still other accounts portray it as mostly the fault of the Confederacy citation needed Today tourists can follow the path General Sherman s army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire ",
