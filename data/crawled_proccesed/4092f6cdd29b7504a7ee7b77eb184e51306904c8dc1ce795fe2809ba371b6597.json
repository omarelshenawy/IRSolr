			"previous": " Wisconsin has been home to a wide variety of cultures over the past 12 000 years The first people arrived around 10 000 BCE during the Wisconsin Glaciation These early inhabitants called Paleo Indians hunted now extinct ice age animals exemplified by the Boaz mastodon a prehistoric mastodon skeleton unearthed along with spear points in southwest Wisconsin 9 After the ice age ended around 8000 BCE people in the subsequent Archaic period lived by hunting fishing and gathering food from wild plants Agricultural societies emerged gradually over the Woodland period between 1000 BCE to 1000 CE Toward the end of this period Wisconsin was the heartland of the Effigy Mound culture which built thousands of animal shaped mounds across the landscape 10 Later between 1000 and 1500 CE the Mississippian and Oneota cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at Aztalan in southeast Wisconsin 11 The Oneota may be the ancestors of the modern Ioway and Ho Chunk tribes who shared the Wisconsin region with the Menominee at the time of European contact 12 Other American Indian groups living in Wisconsin when Europeans first settled included the Ojibwa Sauk Fox Kickapoo and Pottawatomie who migrated to Wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 1700 13 ",
			"after": " The first European to visit what became Wisconsin was probably the French explorer Jean Nicolet He canoed west from Georgian Bay through the Great Lakes in 1634 and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near Green Bay at Red Banks 14 Pierre Radisson and M dard des Groseilliers visited Green Bay again in 1654 1666 and Chequamegon Bay in 1659 1660 where they traded for fur with local American Indians 15 In 1673 Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet became the first to record a journey on the Fox Wisconsin Waterway all the way to the Mississippi River near Prairie du Chien 16 Frenchmen like Nicholas Perrot continued to ply the fur trade across Wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries but the French made no permanent settlements in Wisconsin before Great Britain won control of the region following the French and Indian War in 1763 Even so French traders continued to work in the region after the war and some beginning with Charles de Langlade in 1764 now settled in Wisconsin permanently rather than returning to British controlled Canada 17 ",
