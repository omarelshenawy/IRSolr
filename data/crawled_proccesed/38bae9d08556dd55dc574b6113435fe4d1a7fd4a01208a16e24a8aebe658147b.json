			"after": " During the Sun Dance which is practiced by many Plains Indian tribes the eagle is represented in several ways The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance Also during the dance a medicine man may direct his fan which is made of eagle feathers to people who seek to be healed The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient The fan is then held up toward the sky so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator 128 ",
