			"previous": " Little is known about Johnson s life between the end of 1729 and 1731 It is likely that he lived with his parents He experienced bouts of mental anguish and physical pain during years of illness 41 his tics and gesticulations associated with Tourette syndrome became more noticeable and were often commented upon 42 By 1731 Johnson s father was deeply in debt and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield Johnson hoped to get an usher s position which became available at Stourbridge Grammar School but since he did not have a degree his application was passed over on 6 September 1731 41 At about this time Johnson s father became ill and developed an inflammatory fever which led to his death in December 1731 43 Johnson eventually found employment as undermaster at a school in Market Bosworth run by Sir Wolstan Dixie 4th Baronet who allowed Johnson to teach without a degree 44 Although Johnson was treated as a servant 45 he found pleasure in teaching even though he considered it boring After an argument with Dixie he quit the school and by June 1732 he had returned home 46 ",
			"after": " Johnson continued to look for a position at a Lichfield school After being turned down for a job at Ashbourne he spent time with his friend Edmund Hector who was living in the home of the publisher Thomas Warren At the time Warren was starting his Birmingham Journal and he enlisted Johnson s help 47 This connection with Warren grew and Johnson proposed a translation of Jeronimo Lobo s account of the Abyssinians 48 Johnson read Abb Joachim Le Grand s French translations and thought that a shorter version might be useful and profitable 49 Instead of writing the work himself he dictated to Hector who then took the copy to the printer and made any corrections Johnson s A Voyage to Abyssinia was published a year later 49 He returned to Lichfield in February 1734 and began an annotated edition of Poliziano s Latin poems along with a history of Latin poetry from Petrarch to Poliziano a Proposal was soon printed but a lack of funds halted the project 50 ",
