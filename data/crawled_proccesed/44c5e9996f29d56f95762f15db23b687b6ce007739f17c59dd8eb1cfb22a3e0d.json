			"previous": " The Kawasaki C 1 has been in use since 1974 but will be replaced by the Kawasaki C 2 which has a longer range The first of twenty C 2s is expected to be delivered in 2014 2  Japanese policies at the time on military equipment were strict in that they were not to have offensive capabilities and so the maximum range was cut in order to keep the aircraft s operational range inside Japan This proved to be a problem after Okinawa was returned to Japan from the US and the aircraft had trouble reaching the island from distant areas Thus production was reduced and the C 130 was introduced ",
			"after": " Note Three C 1s were allocated to the MSDF as airborne minelayers under the Fourth Defense Buildup Plan 1972 76 It is unknown what designation was given to them or indeed whether they were ever actually delivered ",
