			"previous": " Algebraic topology is another domain which prominently associates groups to the objects the theory is interested in There groups are used to describe certain invariants of topological spaces They are called invariants because they are defined in such a way that they do not change if the space is subjected to some deformation For example the fundamental group counts how many paths in the space are essentially different The Poincar conjecture proved in 2002 2003 by Grigori Perelman is a prominent application of this idea The influence is not unidirectional though For example algebraic topology makes use of Eilenberg MacLane spaces which are spaces with prescribed homotopy groups Similarly algebraic K theory relies in a way on classifying spaces of groups Finally the name of the torsion subgroup of an infinite group shows the legacy of topology in group theory ",
