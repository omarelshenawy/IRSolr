			"previous": " The Late Middle Ages witnessed the rise of strong royalty based nation states throughout Europe particularly in England France and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula Aragon Castile and Portugal The long conflicts of the later Middle Ages strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry Kings profited from warfare which extended royal legislation throughout their kingdoms and increased the lands they directly controlled 267 Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient and the rate of taxation often increased 268 The requirement to obtain the consent of those being taxed meant that representative bodies such as the English Parliament or the French Estates General gained power and authority 269 ",
			"after": " Throughout the 14th century French kings sought to expand their influence throughout the kingdom at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility 270 They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France leading to the Hundred Years War 271 which lasted until 1453 272 Early in the war the English under Edward III r 1327 77 and his son Edward the Black Prince d 1376 AF won the battles of Cr cy and Poitiers captured the city of Calais and won control of much of France AG The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war 275 In the early 15th century France once more came close to dissolving but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc d 1431 led to the victory of the French kings over the English and the capture of the last of the English possessions in southern France in 1453 276 The price was high as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict Conversely the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal The conflict with the French also helped create a national culture in England that was separate from French culture which had been the dominant cultural influence in England before the outbreak of the Hundred Years War 277 The early Hundred Years War also saw the dominance of the English longbow 278 and the appearance of cannon on the battlefield at Cr cy in 1346 232 ",
