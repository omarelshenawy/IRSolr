			"after": " While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990 there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years In the mid 19th century Alexander von Humboldt s book Kosmos and Robert Chambers s 1844 book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation 15 were seen as early precursors to the field 15 In a sense Darwin s theory of evolution was in itself an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause and effect processes In the first half of the 20th century secular biologist Julian Huxley originated the term evolutionary humanism 1 while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin examined links between cosmic evolution and a tendency towards complexification including human consciousness while envisaging compatibility between cosmology evolution and theology In the mid and later 20th century The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective Later Eric Chaisson explored the subject of cosmic evolution quantitatively in terms of the energy rate density and the astronomer Carl Sagan wrote Cosmos 1 Thomas Berry a cultural historian and the academic Brian Swimme explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond organized religion 1 ",
