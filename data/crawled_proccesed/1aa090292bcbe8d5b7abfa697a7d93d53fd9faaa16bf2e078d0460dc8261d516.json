			"previous": " Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from Brown University which has a large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the doctorate to Santa Clara University which offers only the M S in applied mathematics 5 Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include MIT Brigham Young University also has an Applied and Computational Emphasis ACME a program that allows student to graduate with a Mathematics degree with an emphasis in Applied Maths Students in this program also learn another skill Computer Science Engineering Physics Pure Math etc to supplement their applied maths skills ",
