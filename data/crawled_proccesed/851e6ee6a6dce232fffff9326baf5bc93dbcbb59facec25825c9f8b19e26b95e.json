			"after": " Caspar David Friedrich 5 September 1774 7 May 1840 was a 19th century German Romantic landscape painter generally considered the most important German artist of his generation 2 He is best known for his mid period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies morning mists barren trees or Gothic ruins His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature and his often symbolic and anti classical work seeks to convey a subjective emotional response to the natural world Friedrich s paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes reducing the figures to a scale that according to the art historian Christopher John Murray directs the viewer s gaze towards their metaphysical dimension 3 ",
