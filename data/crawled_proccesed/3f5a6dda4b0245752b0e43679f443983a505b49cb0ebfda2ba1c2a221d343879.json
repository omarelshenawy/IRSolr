			"after": " Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years  Some branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society such as liberalism and conservatism or focus on the environment Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society Radical feminism considers the male controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women s oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary 4 Conservative feminism is conservative relative to the society in which it resides Libertarian feminism conceives of people as self owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference 83 Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships Lesbian feminism is thus closely related Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist 6 Ecofeminists see men s control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment ecofeminism has been criticised for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature 84 ",
