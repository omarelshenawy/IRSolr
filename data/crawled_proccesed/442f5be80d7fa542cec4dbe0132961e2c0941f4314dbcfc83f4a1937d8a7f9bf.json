			"previous": " The use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution Early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal 21 with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans 22 Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history Approximately 50 000 years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language 23 ",
			"after": " Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of Homo sapiens approximately 200 000 years ago 24 The earliest methods of stone tool making known as the Oldowan industry date back to at least 2 3 million years ago 25 with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in Ethiopia within the Great Rift Valley dating back to 2 5 million years ago 26 This era of stone tool use is called the Paleolithic or Old stone age and spans all of human history up to the development of agriculture approximately 12 000 years ago ",
