			"previous": " Pilots including the present day pilots of the Commemorative Air Force s Fifi the last remaining flying B 29 describe flight after takeoff as being an urgent struggle for airspeed generally flight after takeoff should consist of striving for altitude Radial engines need airflow to keep them cool and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine runup before takeoff 20 ",
			"after": " In wartime the B 29 was capable of flight at altitudes up to 31 850 feet 9 710 m 21 at speeds of up to 350 mph 560 km h true airspeed This was its best defense because Japanese fighters could barely reach that altitude and few could catch the B 29 even if they did attain that altitude Only the heaviest of anti aircraft weapons could reach it and since the Axis forces did not have proximity fuzes hitting or damaging the aircraft from the ground in combat proved difficult citation needed ",
