			"after": " Blown flaps are a powered aerodynamic high lift device invented by the British and used on the wings of certain aircraft to improve low speed lift during takeoff and landing The process is sometimes called a boundary layer control system BLCS They were a popular design feature in the 1960s but fell from use due to their complex maintenance needs Today a simpler version can be found on military transport aircraft although the term is not widely used Additionally the early concepts have been refined by modern engineers to create the circulation control wing a far more effective device with applications in the modern aviation industry 1 ",
