			"previous": "  Clipping may be described as hard in cases where the signal is strictly limited at the threshold producing a flat cutoff or it may be described as soft in cases where the clipped signal continues to follow the original at a reduced gain Hard clipping results in many high frequency harmonics soft clipping results in fewer higher order harmonics and intermodulation distortion components ",
			"after": " In the audio domain clipping may be heard as general distortion or as pops  Because the clipped waveform has more area underneath it than the smaller unclipped waveform the amplifier produces more power than its rated sine wave output when it is clipping This extra power can damage any part of the loudspeaker including the woofer or the tweeter by causing over excursion or by overheating the voice coil It may cause damage to the amplifier s power supply or simply blow a fuse ",
