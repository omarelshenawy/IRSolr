			"after": " Malfunctions or human errors or a combination of these related to retractable landing gear have been the cause of numerous accidents and incidents throughout aviation history Distraction and preoccupation during the landing sequence played a prominent role in the approximately 100 gear up landing incidents that occurred each year in the United States between 1998 and 2003 10 A gear up landing incident also known as a belly landing is an accident that may result from the pilot simply forgetting or failing to lower the landing gear before landing or a mechanical malfunction that does not allow the landing gear to be lowered Although rarely fatal a gear up landing is very expensive as it causes massive airframe damage If the landing results in a prop strike a complete engine rebuild may also be required Many aircraft between the wars at the time when retractable gear was becoming commonplace were deliberately designed to allow the bottom of the wheels to protrude below the fuselage even when retracted to reduce the damage caused if the pilot forgot to extend the landing gear or in case the plane was shot down and forced to crash land Examples include the Avro Anson Boeing B 17 Flying Fortress and the Douglas DC 3 The modern day Fairchild Republic A 10 Thunderbolt II carries on this legacy it is similarly designed in an effort to avoid further damage during a gear up landing a possible consequence of battle damage citation needed ",
