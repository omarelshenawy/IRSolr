			"previous": " When bound to a protein NAD and NADH are usually held within a structural motif known as the Rossmann fold 38 The motif is named after Michael Rossmann who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide binding proteins 39 This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta alpha beta alpha beta This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide binding domains for NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor 39 However this fold is not universal among NAD dependent enzymes since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme but lack this motif 40 ",
			"after": " When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate Depending on the enzyme the hydride donor is positioned either above or below the plane of the planar C4 carbon as defined in the figure Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above class B enzymes transfer the it from below Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is prochiral this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme s mechanism This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens so the enzyme will reduce NAD by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen In this case an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH 41 ",
