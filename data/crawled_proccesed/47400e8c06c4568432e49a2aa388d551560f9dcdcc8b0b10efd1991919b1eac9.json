			"previous": " After training Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg Germany on October 1 156 Introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant while on maneuvers he became practically evangelical about their benefits not only for energy but for strength and weight loss as well and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging 157 The Army also introduced Presley to karate which he studied seriously later including it in his live performances 158 Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley s wish to be seen as an able ordinary soldier despite his fame and to his generosity He donated his Army pay to charity purchased TV sets for the base and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit 159 ",
			"after": " While in Friedberg Presley met 14 year old Priscilla Beaulieu They would eventually marry after a seven and a half year courtship 160 In her autobiography Priscilla says that despite his worries that it would ruin his career Parker convinced Presley that to gain popular respect he should serve his country as a regular soldier rather than in Special Services where he would have been able to give some musical performances and remain in touch with the public 161 Media reports echoed Presley s concerns about his career but RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two year hiatus Armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material they kept up a regular stream of successful releases 162 Between his induction and discharge Presley had ten top 40 hits including Wear My Ring Around Your Neck the best selling Hard Headed Woman and One Night 163 in 1958 and Now and Then There s A Fool Such as I and the number one A Big Hunk o Love in 1959 164 RCA also generated four albums compiling old material during this period most successfully Elvis Golden Records 1958 which hit number three on the LP chart 165 ",
