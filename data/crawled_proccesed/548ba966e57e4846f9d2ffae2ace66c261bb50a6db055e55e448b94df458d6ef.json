			"previous": " Early writers claimed the Mascarene parrot was found on Madagascar an idea that led French naturalist and ornithologist Ren Primev re Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831 5 His new genus name prevailed and when Tommaso Salvadori combined it with the earlier specific name in 1891 it became a tautonym a scientific name in which the two parts are identical 2 Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus but this was not accepted by other writers The following year German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system and the lesser vasa parrot Coracopsis nigra English zoologist William Alexander Forbes believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name since it was identical to the genus name coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879 in honour of Dubois 6 The binomial name was emended from M mascarinus to M mascarin in 2014 1 ",
			"after": " An unidentified dark parrot seen alive by Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa was given the name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758 who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766 Because of this association some authors believed it was from the Mascarene Islands as well but this dark parrot s description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot 7 This disagreement led some authors to use now invalid combinations of the scientific names such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot Psittacus erithacus instead 2 ",
