			"previous": " By contrast the Byzantine position in Southern Italy was gradually consolidated so that by 873 Bari had once again come under Byzantine rule 72 and most of Southern Italy would remain in the Empire for the next 200 years 73 On the more important eastern front the Empire rebuilt its defences and went on the offensive The Paulicians were defeated and their capital of Tephrike Divrigi taken while the offensive against the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of Samosata 72 ",
			"after": " Under Basil s son and successor Leo VI the Wise the gains in the east against the now weak Abbasid Caliphate continued However Sicily was lost to the Arabs in 902 and in 904 Thessaloniki the Empire s second city was sacked by an Arab fleet The weakness of the Empire in the naval sphere was quickly rectified so that a few years later a Byzantine fleet had re occupied Cyprus lost in the 7th century and also stormed Laodicea in Syria Despite this revenge the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911 74 ",
