			"previous": " Boilers can be classified into the following configurations  The source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels such as wood coal oil or natural gas Electric steam boilers use resistance or immersion type heating elements Nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam either directly BWR or in most cases in specialised heat exchangers called steam generators PWR Heat recovery steam generators HRSGs use the heat rejected from other processes such as gas turbine ",
			"after": " To define and secure boilers safely some professional specialized organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME develop standards and regulation codes For instance the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety security and design standards 6 ",
