			"previous": " In the 1960s some of the older buildings were demolished making way for the country s first high rises The Shalom Meir Tower which was completed in 1965 was Israel s tallest building until 1999 Tel Aviv s population peaked in the early 1960s at 390 000 representing 16 percent of the country s total 53 A long period of steady decline followed however and by the late 1980s the city had an aging population of 317 000 53 High property prices pushed families out and deterred young people from moving in 53 At this time gentrification began in the poor neighborhoods of southern Tel Aviv and the old port in the north was renewed 20 unreliable source New laws were introduced to protect Modernist buildings and efforts to preserve them were aided by UNESCO recognition of the Tel Aviv s White City as a world heritage site In the early 1990s the decline in population was reversed partly due to the large wave of immigrants from the former Soviet Union 53 Tel Aviv also began to emerge as a high tech center 20 unreliable source The construction of many skyscrapers and high tech office buildings followed In 1993 Tel Aviv was categorized as a world city 54 The city is regarded as a strong candidate for global city status 10 ",
			"after": " In the Gulf War in 1991 Tel Aviv was attacked by Scud missiles from Iraq Iraq hoped to provoke an Israeli military response which could have destroyed the US Arab alliance The United States pressured Israel not to retaliate and after Israel acquiesced the US and Netherlands rushed Patriot missiles to defend against the attacks but they proved largely ineffective Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities continued to be hit by Scuds throughout the war and every city in the Tel Aviv area except for Bnei Brak was hit A total of 74 Israelis died as a result of the Iraqi attacks mostly from suffocation and heart attacks 55 while approximately 230 Israelis were injured 56 Extensive property damage was also caused and some 4 000 Israelis were left homeless It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with nerve agents or sarin As a result the Israeli government issued gas masks to its citizens When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas The inhabitants of the southeastern suburb of HaTikva erected an angel monument as a sign of their gratitude that it was through a great miracle that many people were preserved from being killed by a direct hit of a Scud rocket 57 ",
