			"previous": " Because of the poor soils and rugged terrain Samuel Lewis said Crompton s inhabitants were a race of hardy and laborious men 10 They have also been described as having a reputation for being a hardy frugal and somewhat independent breed 8 which has been attributed to the tradition of absentee landlords and self sustenance in earlier times 18 There had been a chapel of ease at the hamlet of Shaw since at least the early 16th century but due to ecclesiastical arrangements for the parish of Prestwich cum Oldham the inhabitants were obliged to contribute money towards Oldham Parish Church which in turn had obligation to the mother Church of St Mary the Virgin at Prestwich 8 On several occasions during the 15th and 16th centuries the Archdeacon of Chester had to intervene because Crompton s inhabitants refused to contribute towards holy bread and candles used at Prestwich 8 In 1826 a poll was taken regarding the re building of Oldham Church Not one person in Crompton voted in favour of the rebuilding and when a rate was levied to raise money for the new church at Oldham the people of Crompton refused to pay 8 ",
			"after": " The manufacture of textiles in Crompton can be traced back to 1474 when a lease dated from that year outlines that the occupant of Crompton Park had spinning wheels cards and looms all of which suggest that cloth was being produced in large quantities 21 The upland geography of the area constrained the output of crop growing and so prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade Wills and inventories from the 15th and 16th centuries suggest most families were involved with small scale pasture but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens in the domestic system and selling cloth linen and fustians to travelling chapmen for the markets in Manchester and Rochdale 21 Despite its remoteness by the Pennines by the Early Modern period the domestic system in Crompton had produced relatively wealthy inhabitants 22 The most affluent were those involved in cloth and linen and their wealth was comparable to that of the merchants of Manchester and Salford 22 ",
