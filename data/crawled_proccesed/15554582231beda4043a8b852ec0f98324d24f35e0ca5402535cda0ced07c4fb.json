			"previous": " Modernized and up engined versions are produced today by Cub Crafters of Washington and by American Legend Aircraft in Texas as the Cub continues to be sought after by bush pilots for its STOL Short Takeoff and Landing capabilities as well as by recreational pilots for its nostalgia appeal The new aircraft are actually modeled on the PA 11 though the Legend company does sell an open cowl version with the cylinder heads exposed like the J 3 Cub An electrical system is standard from both manufacturers citation needed ",
			"after": " The J 3 is distinguished from its successors by having a cowl that exposes its engine s cylinder heads the exposed cylinders of any J 3 s engine were usually fitted with sheet metal eyebrow air scoops to direct air over the cylinder s fins for more effective engine cooling in flight There are very few other examples of flat aircraft engine installations as opposed to radial engines in which the cylinder heads are exposed From the PA 11 on through the present Super Cub models the cowling surrounds the cylinder heads citation needed ",
