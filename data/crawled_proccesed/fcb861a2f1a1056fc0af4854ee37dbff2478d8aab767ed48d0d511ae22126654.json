			"previous": " The grove snail Cepaea nemoralis is famous for the rich polymorphism of its shell The system is controlled by a series of multiple alleles The shell colour series is brown genetically the top dominant trait dark pink light pink very pale pink dark yellow and light yellow the bottom or universal recessive trait Bands may be present or absent and if present from one to five in number Unbanded is the top dominant trait and the forms of banding are controlled by modifier genes see epistasis ",
			"after": " In England the snail is regularly predated by the song thrush Turdus philomelos which breaks them open on thrush anvils large stones Here fragments accumulate permitting researchers to analyse the snails taken The thrushes hunt by sight and capture selectively those forms which match the habitat least well Snail colonies are found in woodland hedgerows and grassland and the predation determines the proportion of phenotypes morphs found in each colony ",
