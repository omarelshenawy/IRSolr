			"previous": " The early farmers from the Early Basketmaker II Era lived in the Petrified Forest from about 1 CE to about 800 CE They occupied pit houses at fewer than 100 sites at first on mesas or other vantage points and later at the base of bluffs and in lowlands where the soil was better As climatic conditions worsened for farming between 750 and 900 CE the settlements changed with the Pueblo I Era Rather than below ground pits the Pueblo Builders constructed above ground houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for more than one year At the same time climatic conditions changed again this time for the better between 900 and 1275 CE More than 200 pueblo builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations at the mouths of washes near seeps and on moisture holding sand dunes 21 ",
			"after": " During the Pueblo I Era most sites were single family homes but as soils became exhausted many sites were abandoned by 1250 CE in favor of very large multi room pueblos close to more dependable sources of water 22 The Pueblo Builders constructed two of these large pueblos one called Stone Axe about 0 5 miles 0 8 km east of the park and the other at Puerco Pueblo which overlooks the Puerco River near the middle of the park 23 There they built about 100 one story rooms around an open plaza 23 The rooms had no windows or doors but each could be entered by climbing a ladder and descending through a hole in the roof At its peak perhaps 200 people lived in this pueblo 23 Over time however a persistently dry climate led to out migration and the last residents abandoned Puerco Pueblo in about 1380 CE 24 ",
