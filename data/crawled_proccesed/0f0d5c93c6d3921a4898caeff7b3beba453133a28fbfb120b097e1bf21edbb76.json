			"previous": " On 23 March 2007 Knut was presented to the public for the first time 14 Around 400 journalists visited the Berlin Zoo on what was dubbed Knut Day to report on the cub s first public appearance to a worldwide audience 15 Because Knut became the focus of worldwide media at a very young age many stories and false alarms regarding the cub s health and well being were circulated during his first year For example on 16 April 2007 Knut was removed from display due to teething pains resulting from the growth of his right upper canine tooth but initial reports vaguely stated that he was suffering from an unknown illness and subsequently put on antibiotics 16 Much ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15 00 local time on Wednesday 18 April 2007 The zoo had received an anonymous letter by fax which said Knut ist tot Donnerstag Mittag Knut is dead Thursday noon 17 In response the police increased their security measures around the bear The time frame for the threat passed without incident or harm to Knut 18 19 ",
			"after": " Despite Der Spiegel reporting on 30 April 2007 that Knut was steadily getting less cute as he increased in age 20 Knut continued to bring in record crowds to the zoo that summer After reaching seven months old and 50 kg 110 lb in July 2007 Knut s scheduled twice daily public appearances were canceled due to the zoo s concern for the safety of his keeper Zoo spokeswoman Regine Damm also said it was time for the bear to associate with other bears and not with other people 21 After living in the same enclosure as Ernst a Malaysian black bear cub who was born a month before Knut and its mother 22 Knut was then moved to his own private living space While visitor numbers dwindled from extreme highs in March and April Knut remained a major attraction at the zoo for the rest of 2007 400 000 guests were recorded in August 2007 which was an all time high 23 ",
