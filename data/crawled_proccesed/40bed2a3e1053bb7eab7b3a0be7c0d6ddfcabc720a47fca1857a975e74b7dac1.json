			"previous": " The encyclopedia uses some material from his memories of earlier times and from his prior works such as the book on Germany There is no evidence that he had planned to use this material in an encyclopedia later in his career Most of the references in the encyclopedia must have come from his extracts which he kept on an ongoing basis using a slave as reader and a separate slave for a secretary to document them Pliny even furnished that secretary with gloves and long sleeves in winter so that his writing hand would not stiffen with cold and he subsequently would be unable to take notes as is detailed by Pliny the Younger in avunculus meus The extracts collected for this purpose filled rather less than 160 volumes which Larcius Licinius the Praetorian legate of Hispania Tarraconensis vainly offered to purchase for 400 000 sesterces 16 That would have been in 73 74 see above At his death Pliny left the 160 volumes to his nephew When composition began is unknown Since he was preoccupied with his other works under Nero and then had to finish the history of his times it is unlikely he began before 70 The procuratorships offered the ideal opportunity for an encyclopedic frame of mind The date of an overall composition cannot be assigned to any one year The dates of different parts must be determined if they can by philological analysis the post mortem of the scholars ",
