			"after": " Outside the Northeast Corridor and stretches of track in Southern California and Michigan most Amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads  Freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to Amtrak trains Some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track The railroads dispatching practices were investigated in 2008 78 resulting in stricter laws about train priority which had a dramatic result Amtrak s overall on time performance went up from 74 7 in fiscal 2008 to 84 7 in 2009 with long distance trains and others outside the NEC seeing the greatest benefit The Missouri River Runner jumped from a very poor 11 to 95 becoming one of Amtrak s best performers The Texas Eagle went from 22 4 to 96 7 and the California Zephyr with an abysmal 5 on time record in 2008 went up to 78 3 79 However this improved performance also coincided with a general economic downturn resulting in the lowest freight rail traffic volumes since at least 1988 meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic 80 ",
