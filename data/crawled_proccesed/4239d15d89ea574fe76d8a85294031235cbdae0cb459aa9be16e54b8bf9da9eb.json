			"previous": " By World War II most fighters were all metal monoplanes armed with batteries of machine guns or cannons and some were capable of speeds approaching 400 mph Most fighters up to this point had one engine but a number of twin engine fighters were built however they were found to be outmatched against single engine fighters and were relegated to other tasks such as night fighters equipped with primitive radar sets ",
			"after": " By the end of the war turbojet engines were replacing piston engines as the means of propulsion further increasing aircraft speed Since the weight of the engine was so much less than on piston engined fighters having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used depending on requirements This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape and G suits to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers ",
