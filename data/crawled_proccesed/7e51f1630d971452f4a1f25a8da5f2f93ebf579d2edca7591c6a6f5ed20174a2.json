			"previous": " Let Z x be the value of the variable of interest at a certain location x This value is unknown e g temperature rainfall piezometric level geological facies etc Although there exists a value at location x that could be measured geostatistics considers this value as random since it was not measured or has not been measured yet However the randomness of Z x is not complete but defined by a cumulative distribution function CDF that depends on certain information that is known about the value Z x ",
			"after": " Typically if the value of Z is known at locations close to x or in the neighborhood of x one can constrain the CDF of Z x by this neighborhood if a high spatial continuity is assumed Z x can only have values similar to the ones found in the neighborhood Conversely in the absence of spatial continuity Z x can take any value The spatial continuity of the random variables is described by a model of spatial continuity that can be either a parametric function in the case of variogram based geostatistics or have a non parametric form when using other methods such as multiple point simulation or pseudo genetic techniques ",
