			"previous": " European maps continued to show this hypothesized land until Captain James Cook s ships HMS Resolution and Adventure crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773 in December 1773 and again in January 1774 12 Cook came within about 75 miles 121 km of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773 13 The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals According to various organizations the National Science Foundation 14 NASA 15 the University of California San Diego 16 and other sources 17 18 ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820 von Bellingshausen a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy Edward Bransfield a captain in the Royal Navy and Nathaniel Palmer a sealer out of Stonington Connecticut The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km 20 mi from Queen Maud s Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69 21 28 S 2 14 50 W 69 35778 S 2 24722 W 69 35778 2 24722 19 that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820 The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis apparently at Hughes Bay near Cape Charles in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821 although some historians dispute this claim 20 21 The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in 1895 22 ",
