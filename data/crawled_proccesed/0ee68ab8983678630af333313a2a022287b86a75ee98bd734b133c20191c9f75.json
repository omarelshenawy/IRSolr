			"previous": " The mechanism for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general but somewhat dependent on the amino acid sequence Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine have been shown to inhibit substrate unfolding decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps 49 Such glycine alanine repeats are also found in nature for example in silk fibroin in particular certain Epstein Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex 50 ",
