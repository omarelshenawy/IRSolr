			"previous": " The most important gold item in the hoard is the body chain which consists of four finely looped gold chains made using the loop in loop method called fox tail in modern jewellery and attached at front and back to plaques 49 At the front the chains have terminals in the shape of lions heads and the plaque has jewels mounted in gold cells with a large amethyst surrounded by four smaller garnets alternating with four empty cells which probably held pearls that have decayed At the back the chains meet at a mount centred on a gold solidus of Gratian r 375 383 which has been converted from an earlier use probably as a pendant and which may have been a family heirloom 49 Body chains of this type appear in Roman art sometimes on the goddess Venus or nymphs some examples have erotic contexts but they are also worn by respectable high ranking ladies They may have been regarded as a suitable gift for a bride 50 The Hoxne body chain worn tightly would fit a woman with a bust size of 76 81 cm 30 32 inches 51 Few body chains have survived one of the most complete from the early Byzantine era and found in Egypt is also in the British Museum 52 ",
