			"previous": " Mauritius has long sought sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago located 1 287 km to the northeast Chagos was administratively part of Mauritius from the 18th century when the French first settled the islands All of the islands forming part of the French colonial territory of Isle de France as Mauritius was then known were ceded to the British in 1810 under the Act of Capitulation signed between the two powers 39 In 1965 three years before the independence of Mauritius the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius and the islands of Aldabra Farquhar and Desroches from the Seychelles to form the British Indian Ocean Territory BIOT The islands were formally established as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom on 8 November 1965 On 23 June 1976 Aldabra Farquhar and Desroches were returned to Seychelles as a result of its attaining independence The BIOT now comprises the Chagos Archipelago only The UK leased the main island of the archipelago Diego Garcia to the United States under a 50 year lease which expires in 2016 to establish a Military base 39 40 Mauritius has repeatedly asserted that the separation of its territories is a violation of United Nations resolutions banning the dismemberment of colonial territories before independence and claims that the Chagos Archipelago including Diego Garcia forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius under both Mauritian law and international law 41 After initially denying that the islands were inhabited British officials forcibly expelled approximately 2 000 Chagossians who had lived on those islands for a century to mainland Mauritius Since 1971 only the atoll of Diego Garcia is inhabited home to some 3 000 UK and US military and civilian contracted personnel Chagossians have since engaged in activism to return to the archipelago claiming that the forced expulsion and dispossession were illegal 42 43 ",
			"after": " On 18 March 2015 the Permanent Court of Arbitration unanimously held that the marine protected area MPA which the UK purported to declare around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 was illegal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as Mauritius had legally binding rights to fish in the waters surrounding the Chagos Archipelago to an eventual return of the Chagos Archipelago and to the preservation of any minerals or oil discovered in or near the Chagos Archipelago prior to its return 44 45 The tribunal considered in detail the undertakings given by the United Kingdom to the Mauritian Ministers at the Lancaster House talks in September 1965 The UK had argued that those undertakings were not binding and had no status in international law The Tribunal firmly rejected that argument holding that those undertakings became a binding international agreement upon the independence of Mauritius and have bound the UK ever since It found that the UK s commitments towards Mauritius in relation to fishing rights and oil and mineral rights in the Chagos Archipelago are legally binding 46 47 ",
