			"previous": " The absence of a strategic bomber force for the Luftwaffe following General Wever s accidental death in 1936 and the end of the Ural bomber program he fostered before the invasion of Poland would not be addressed again until the authorization of the Bomber B design competition in July 1939 which sought to replace the medium bomber force with which the Luftwaffe was to begin the war and the partly achieved Schnellbomber high speed medium bomber concept with more advanced twin engined high speed bomber aircraft fitted with pairs of relatively high power engines of 1 500 kW 2 000 hp output levels and upwards each as a follow on to the earlier Schnellbomber project that would also be able to function as shorter range heavy bombers ",
			"after": " The spring 1942 Amerika Bomber program also sought to produce useful strategic bomber designs for the Luftwaffe with their prime design priority being an advanced trans oceanic range capability as the main aim of the project to directly attack the United States from Europe or the Azores Inevitably both the Bomber B and Amerika Bomber programs were victims of the continued emphasis of the Wehrmacht s insistence for the Luftwaffe to support the Army as its primary mission as well as the increasingly devastating results of the RAF Bomber Command at night and by 1943 the USAAF s Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces heavy bomber raids by daylight on the German aviation industry which catastrophically diminished the Third Reich s overall aviation production capacity later in World War II ",
