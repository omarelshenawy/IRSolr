			"previous": " Regardless of the type of metabolic process they employ the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes The Planctomycetes are the exception as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles endocytosis the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items 28 94 ",
			"after": " Unlike in multicellular organisms increases in cell size cell growth and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission a form of asexual reproduction 95 Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9 8 minutes 96 In cell division two identical clone daughter cells are produced Some bacteria while still reproducing asexually form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces or budding Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell ",
