			"after": " The first two rolls were done with roughly the same amount of detail while the lesser rowbarges essentially small galleys were done more hastily The first two ships of the first roll the Henry Grace Dieu and the Mary Rose have traces of a grid pattern indicating that they were transferred from a different drawing while the rest are done in freehand Overall the ships follow a formula depending on the type of ship The exceptions are stern galleries of some of the galleasses and the figureheads of the Mary Rose Salamander and the Unicorn the latter both captured from the Scots in 1544 18 The prominent exception is the Galley Subtle placed in the middle of the second roll It is more consistent in type with Mediterranean type galleys than the galleasses and small rowbarges and features a considerable amount of detail not present in the other ships 19 It is the only ship where any crew is visible in this case rowers behind pavisades as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing a bonnet full skirted armorial doublet and baggy breeches holding a stick or baton as if beating the time of the strokes of the rowers 20 ",
