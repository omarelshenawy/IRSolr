			"previous": " Bacon s work from the 1970s has been described by the art critic Hugh Davies as the frenzied momentum of a struggle against death Bacon admitted during a 1974 interview that he thought the most difficult aspect of aging was losing your friends This was a bleak period in his life and though he was to live for another seventeen years he felt that his life was almost over and all the people I ve loved are dead His concern is reflected in the darkened flesh and background tones of his paintings from this period 29 His acute sense of mortality and awareness of the fragility of life were heightened by Dyer s death in Paris In the next three years he painted many images of his former lover including the series of three Black Triptychs which have come to be seen as among his best work A number of characteristics bind the triptychs together the form of a monochromatically rendered doorway features centrally in all and each is framed by flat and shallow walls 29 In each three Dyer is stalked by a broad shadow which takes the form of pools of blood or flesh in the outer panels and the wings of the angel of death in the left hand and central images 30 In its display caption for Triptych August 1972 the Tate gallery wrote What death has not already consumed seeps incontinently out of the figures as their shadows 31 ",
			"after": " Each of the three Black triptychs displays sequential views of a single figure and each seems to be intended to be viewed as if stills from a film 22 The figures rendered are not drawn from any of Bacon s usual intellectual sources they do not depict Golgotha Handes or Leopold Bloom In these pictures Bacon strips Dyer from the context of both Dyer s own life and the artist s life and presents him as a nameless slumped gathering of flesh awaiting the onset of death 32 Describing the Black Triptychs in 1993 the art critic Juan Vicente Aliaga wrote that the horror the abjection that oozed from the crucifixes has been transformed in his last paintings into quiet solitude The masculine bodies entwined in a carnal embrace have given way to the solitary figure leaning over the washbasin standing firm on the smooth ground neutral bald headed his convex back deformed his testicles contracted in a fold 33 ",
