			"previous": " Statements were collected from all the crew These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company and that it had been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship rather than the one which he described Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify In contrast to his statement at the inquest Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship not one 1 363 In an interview in 1933 Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo 1 457 Most witnesses said there had been two but a couple said three possibly involving a second submarine Clem Edwards representing the seamen s union attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey 1 367",
			"after": " It was during the closed hearings that the Admiralty tried to lay the blame on Captain Turner their intended line being that Turner had been negligent The roots of this view began in the first reports about the sinking from Vice Admiral Coke commanding the navy at Queenstown He reported that ship was especially warned that submarines were active on south coast and to keep mid channel course avoiding headlands also position of submarine off Cape Clear at 10 00 was communicated by W T to her Captain Webb Director of the Trade Division began to prepare a dossier of signals sent to the Lusitania which Turner may have failed to observe First Sea Lord Fisher noted on one document submitted by Webb for review As the Cunard company would not have employed an incompetent man its a certainty that Captain Turner is not a fool but a knave I hope that Turner will be arrested immediately after the enquiry whatever the verdict First Lord Winston Churchill noted I consider the Admiralty s case against Turner should be pressed by a skilful counsel and that Captain Webb should attend as a witness if not employed as an assessor We will pursue the captain without check In the event both Churchill and Fisher were replaced in their positions before the enquiry because of the failures of the Gallipoli campaign 39 ",
