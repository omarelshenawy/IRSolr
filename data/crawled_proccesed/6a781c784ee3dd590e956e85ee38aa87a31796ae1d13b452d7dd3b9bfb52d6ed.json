			"after": " Wheeled undercarriages normally come in two types conventional or taildragger undercarriage where there are two main wheels towards the front of the aircraft and a single much smaller wheel or skid at the rear or tricycle undercarriage where there are two main wheels or wheel assemblies under the wings and a third smaller wheel in the nose The taildragger arrangement was common during the early propeller era as it allows more room for propeller clearance Most modern aircraft have tricycle undercarriages Taildraggers are considered harder to land and take off because the arrangement is usually unstable that is a small deviation from straight line travel will tend to increase rather than correct itself and usually require special pilot training Sometimes a small tail wheel or skid is added to aircraft with tricycle undercarriage in case of tail strikes during take off The Concorde for instance had a retractable tail bumper wheel as delta winged aircraft need a high angle when taking off The Boeing 727 also has a retractable tail bumper Some aircraft with retractable conventional landing gear have a fixed tailwheel which generates minimal drag since most of the airflow past the tailwheel has been blanketed by the fuselage and even improves yaw stability in some cases citation needed ",
