			"after": " The first named specimen now attributed to Triceratops is a pair of brow horns attached to a skull roof found near Denver Colorado in the spring of 1887 81 This specimen was sent to Othniel Charles Marsh who believed that the formation from which it came dated from the Pliocene and that the bones belonged to a particularly large and unusual bison which he named Bison alticornis 81 82 He realized that there were horned dinosaurs by the next year which saw his publication of the genus Ceratops from fragmentary remains 83 but he still believed B alticornis to be a Pliocene mammal It took a third and much more complete skull to change his mind The specimen collected in 1888 by John Bell Hatcher from the Lance Formation of Wyoming was initially described as another species of Ceratops 84 After reflection Marsh changed his mind and gave it the generic name Triceratops accepting his Bison alticornis as another species of Ceratops 85 it would later be added to Triceratops 25 The sturdy nature of the animal s skull has ensured that many examples have been preserved as fossils allowing variations between species and individuals to be studied Triceratops remains have subsequently been found in the American states of Montana and South Dakota in addition to Colorado and Wyoming and in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta ",
