			"previous": " Inglis was involved with the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps CUOTC being commissioned a second lieutenant on 24 May 1909 20 He served with the CUOTC s engineering detachment and noticed that when the unit was deployed on field days with the rest of the force it often had little to do 7 To remedy this Inglis designed a reusable steel bridge with the intention that it could be erected and dismantled by the unit in a single afternoon 7 An army general who was inspecting the unit noticed his design and offered advice If you re making anything for the army keep it simple no complicated gadgets 2 7 Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Inglis volunteered for active service in the British Army and was officially listed as an Assistant Instructor in the School of Military Engineering with the temporary rank of lieutenant 21 The army expressed interest in Inglis bridge design it was approved for use by a panel of army officers that included the general who had first commented on the design to whom Inglis said I hope Sir you will find I have profited by your advice 7 The design remained in service with the British Army until the higher capacity Bailey bridge was introduced during the Second World War 22 23 ",
			"after": " The Inglis Bridge was designed so that all of its components could be moved by manpower alone moreover it could be erected with few tools in a short span of time a troop of 40 sappers could erect a 60 foot 18 m bridge in 12 hours 23 The design was composed of a series of 15 foot 4 6 m Warren truss bays made from tubular steel sections to a maximum span of six bays 90 feet or 27 metres 23 The design went through three revisions with the Mark II replacing the original design s variable length tubes with identical length ones and during the Second World War the Mark III using higher strength steel but smaller tube diameters increasing the carrying capacity to 26 long tons 26 t 22 23 In addition to his bridge design during the war s course he developed the similar Inglis Tubular Observation Tower 10 Inglis received a US Patent for his bridge on 25 April 1916 and for the type of joints used in it on 26 June 1917 24 25 ",
