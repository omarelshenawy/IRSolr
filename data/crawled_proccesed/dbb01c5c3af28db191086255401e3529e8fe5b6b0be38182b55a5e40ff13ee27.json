			"previous": " Antarctica has no indigenous population and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century However belief in the existence of a Terra Australis a vast continent in the far south of the globe to balance the northern lands of Europe Asia and North Africa had existed since the times of Ptolemy 1st century AD who suggested the idea to preserve the symmetry of all known landmasses in the world Even in the late 17th century after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled Antarctica geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size ",
			"after": " Integral to the story of the origin of the name Antarctica is how it was not named Terra Australis this name was given to Australia instead and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a significant landmass would not be found further south of Australia Explorer Matthew Flinders in particular has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name Terra Australis to Australia He justified the titling of his book A Voyage to Terra Australis 1814 by writing in the introduction ",
