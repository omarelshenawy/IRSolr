			"after": " The pied currawong is common in both wet and dry sclerophyll forests rural and semi urban environments throughout eastern Australia from Cape York Peninsula to western Victoria and Lord Howe Island where it occurs as an endemic subspecies In general the pied currawong is sedentary although some populations from higher altitudes move to areas of lower elevation in winter 24 However evidence for the extent of migration is conflicting and the species movements have been little studied to date 27 It has adapted well to European presence and has become more common in many areas of eastern Australia with surveys in Nanango Queensland Barham New South Wales Geelong Victoria as well as the Northern Tablelands and South West Slopes regions in New South Wales all showing an increase in population This increase has been most marked however in Sydney and Canberra since the 1940s and 1960s respectively In both cities the species had previously been a winter resident only but now remains year round and breeds there 13 They are a dominant species and common inhabitant of Sydney gardens 28 More recently still a survey of the population of pied currawongs in southeastern Queensland between 1980 and 2000 had found the species had become more numerous there including suburban Brisbane 29 One 1992 survey reported the total number of pied currawongs in Australia had doubled from 3 million birds in the 1960s to 6 million in the early 1990s 13 ",
