			"after": " In 1929 Marshall was 28 years old and less than a year away from completing a PhD in plant pathology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore Maryland when he made his first trip to Alaska visiting the upper Koyukuk River and the central Brooks Range 13 The scientific objective of the trip was to study tree growth at the northern timberline near the Arctic Divide 34 For his 15 month sojourn in the small town of Wiseman Alaska Marshall rented a one room cabin next to the only roadhouse in the village and furnished it with books records a phonograph player and a writing desk 35 He placed the desk so that he could sit by the cabin s single window and admire the view of the Koyukuk River and the range of steep snow covered mountains in the background His travels engendered in him a great love for the central Brooks Range in the Alaskan wilderness Marshall was one of the first to explore much of the range especially the headwaters of the North fork of the Koyukuk River where he bestowed the name Gates of the Arctic on a pair of mountains On September 11 1929 Marshall s father Louis died in Z rich Switzerland at the age of 73 Because their mother had died of cancer in 1916 the four children inherited most of their father s estate worth several million dollars Although he became financially independent Bob Marshall continued to work throughout his life 36 ",
