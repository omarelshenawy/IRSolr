			"previous": " The Mint had trouble striking the new design This was due to the hard copper nickel alloy and the fact that the eagle on one side of the piece was directly opposite parts of the reverse design efforts to bring out the design more fully led to increased die breakage Many Flying Eagle cents show weaknesses especially at the eagle s head and tail which are opposite the wreath 27 28 In 1857 Snowden suggested the replacement of the eagle with a head of Christopher Columbus Longacre replied that as there had been objections to proposals to place George Washington on the coinage there would also be to a Columbus design 29 Despite the difficulties the 17 450 000 Flying Eagle cents struck at Philadelphia in 1857 constituted the greatest production of a single coin in a year at a U S mint to that time 30 ",
			"after": " In 1858 the Mint tried to alleviate the breakage problem using a new version of the cent with a shallower relief This attempt led to the major variety of the series as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier The two varieties are about equally common and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety the 1858 7 as 1857 dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year 31 ",
