			"previous": " Due to the complexity of proteins conformation space the set of possible shapes a protein can take and limitations in computational power all atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds 14 16 before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales 8 General purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding but such systems are intrinsically expensive and typically shared among many research groups Additionally because the computations in kinetic models are serial in nature strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult 17 18 Moreover as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time it is computationally challenging to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process 19 20 ",
			"after": " Protein folding does not occur in a single step 13 Instead proteins spend the majority of their folding time nearly 96 in some cases 21 waiting in various intermediate conformational states each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein s energy landscape Through a process known as adaptive sampling these conformations are used by Folding home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories As the simulations discover more conformations the trajectories are restarted from them and a Markov state model MSM is gradually created from this cyclic process MSMs are discrete time master equation models which describe a biomolecule s conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them The adaptive sampling Markov state model approach significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself and is amenable to distributed computing including on GPUGRID as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short independent simulation trajectories 22 The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run i e the number of processors available In other words it achieves linear parallelization leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein s phase space all the conformations a protein can take on and the transitions between them The model illustrates folding events and pathways i e routes and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments 5 19 23 ",
