			"previous": " It is commonly believed that General American English evolved as a result of an aggregation of rural and suburban Midwestern dialects though the English of the Upper Midwest can deviate quite dramatically from the sounds of General American especially since that region s twentieth century Northern Cities Vowel Shift NCVS The local accent often gets more distinct the farther north one goes within the Midwest with the Northern Midwest featuring its own dialect North Central American English General American is also highly divergent from the accents typical of larger Midwestern cities and the Great Lakes region in general such as Chicago and Minneapolis where speech has undergone the NCVS The fact that a rural Midwestern dialect became the basis of what is General American English is often attributed to the mass migration of Midwestern farmers to California and the Pacific Northwest from where it spread However General American has origins dating back even before conservative Midwestern speech itself stemming from interior Pennsylvania and upstate New York 1 ",
