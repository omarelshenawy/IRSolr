			"after": " The music video was filmed during the last week of October 1989 at Culver Studios in Culver City California and was directed by David Fincher who worked with Madonna in her video for Express Yourself 16 Described by Carol Clerk author of Madonnastyle as harrowingly autobiographical the video was shot entirely in black and white and recreates the death scene of a young woman exploring the tempestuous relationship that ensues between the husband and the daughter she has left behind 47 It begins with a young girl playing in the backyard as snow falls on the ground The scene shifts to that of a bedside where a young woman who has died lies Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays Madonna wearing a long black coat sings the song underneath a snow covered dead tree as the young girl plays with her dead mother s jewelry The husband comes and shouts at the girl tearing away the woman s pearl necklace which drop at the little girl s feet The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother s grave The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face as the little girl cries in front of the grave She is taken away from the graveyard by her father as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother her trying to reach the knob of a door and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face As the singer walks through a forest the father is shown resorting to drinking in grief A funeral scene follows showing the girl walking up to her mother s wake When she sees her mother s lips sealed with thread she runs away from the wake Madonna walks through a house where shadows show the girl being scolded and shouted at by the father Ultimately she walks to the graveyard and stands beside an old man implying that she herself is the little girl portrayed The video ends with the little girl dancing in front of her mother s grave as snow falls around her ",
