			"previous": " In late 1077 or early 1078 trouble began between William and his eldest son Robert Although Orderic Vitalis describes it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers William and Henry including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert it is much more likely that Robert was feeling powerless Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men many of them the sons of William s supporters Included among them was Robert of Belleme William de Breteuil and Roger the son of Richard fitzGilbert This band of young men went to the castle at Remalard where they proceeded to raid into Normandy The raiders were supported by many of William s continental enemies 115 William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard but King Philip gave them the castle at Gerberoi where they were joined by new supporters William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079 After three weeks the besieged forces sallied from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman William s forces were forced to lift the siege and the king returned to Rouen By 12 April 1080 William and Robert had reached an accommodation with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died 116 ",
			"after": " Word of William s defeat at Gerberoi stirred up difficulties in northern England In August and September 1079 King Malcolm of Scots raided south of the River Tweed devastating the land between the River Tees and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive and in the spring of 1080 they rebelled against the rule of Walcher the Bishop of Durham and Earl of Northumbria The bishop was killed on 14 May 1080 and William dispatched his half brother Odo to deal with the rebellion 117 William departed Normandy in July 1080 118 and in the autumn William s son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms building a fortification at Newcastle on Tyne while returning to England 117 The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for Whitsun in 1081 ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions A papal embassy arrived in England during this period asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy a request that William rejected 118 William also visited Wales during 1081 although the English and the Welsh sources differ on the exact purpose of the visit The Anglo Saxon Chronicle states that it was a military campaign but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to St Davids in honour of Saint David William s biographer David Bates argues that the former explanation is more likely explaining that the balance of power had recently shifted in Wales and that William would have wished to take advantage of the changed circumstances to extend Norman power By the end of 1081 William was back on the continent dealing with disturbances in Maine Although he led an expedition into Maine the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate 119 ",
