			"previous": "  A controllable pitch propeller CPP or variable pitch propeller is a type of propeller with blades that can be rotated around their long axis to change the blade pitch Reversible propellers those where the pitch can be set to negative values can also create reverse thrust for braking or going backwards without the need to change the direction of shaft revolution ",
			"after": " Propellers whose blade pitch could be adjusted while the aircraft was on the ground were used by a number of early aviation pioneers 1 including A V Roe and Louis Breguet  The French aircraft firm Levasseur displayed a variable pitch propeller at the 1921 Paris Airshow which it claimed had been tested by the French government in a ten hour run and could change pitch at any engine RPM 2 ",
