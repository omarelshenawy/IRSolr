			"after": " The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level but variations in this trend begin above 11 km where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere In the stratosphere starting above about 20 km the temperature increases with height due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes in the aptly named thermosphere above 90 km ",
