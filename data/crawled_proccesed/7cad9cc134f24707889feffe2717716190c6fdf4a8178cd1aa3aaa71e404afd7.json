			"after": " In 1999 the Mint struck a number of Sacagawea dollars in 9167 fine 22 karat gold 27 During the initial production of the coins they were denominated at five dollars in order to help the public distinguish them from their circulating counterparts 27 The plan was to sell gold versions of the coins to collectors 27 On March 20 this plan was halted when some Congressmen questioned the authority of Mint officials to strike the coins in a composition different from what had already been authorized 27 Full scale coin production never took place even though the Mint maintained that it did have authority to do so as the coins would be considered numismatic items and not regular issue coins 27 Similar gold coins were also struck this time bearing the denomination of one dollar and a W mint mark signifying that the coins were struck at the West Point Mint 28 In total 39 such coins were struck twelve of which were found to be of adequate quality while the rest were eventually destroyed 27 Unlike those denominated at five dollars the one dollar pieces were struck to commemorate the historic flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia in July 1999 according to Former Mint Director Ed Moy 28 The twelve surviving gold dollars were sent into space aboard Columbia on mission STS 93 in July 1999 28 Following the return of the shuttle the coins were placed in storage at Fort Knox where they remained until 2007 when they were exhibited at the American Numismatic Association World s Fair of Money in Milwaukee Wisconsin 28 After the event the coins were returned to Fort Knox however the Mint is currently planning to loan the coins to various museums throughout the country 27 ",
