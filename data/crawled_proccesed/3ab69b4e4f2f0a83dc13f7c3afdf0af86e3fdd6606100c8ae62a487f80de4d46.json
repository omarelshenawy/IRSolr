			"previous": " Due to the height of many branches and the potentially disastrous consequences of a fall balance is of primary importance to arboreal animals 1 On horizontal and gently sloped branches the primary problem is tipping to the side due to the narrow base of support 1 The narrower the branch the greater the difficulty in balancing a given animal faces On steep and vertical branches tipping becomes less of an issue and pitching backwards or slipping downwards becomes the most likely failure 1 In this case large diameter branches pose a greater challenge since the animal cannot place its forelimbs closer to the center of the branch than its hindlimbs ",
