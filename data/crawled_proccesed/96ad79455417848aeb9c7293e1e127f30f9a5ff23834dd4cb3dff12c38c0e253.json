			"after": " The video depicts the incident that took place on the upper deck of a double decker 2 Kowloon Motor Bus Route no 68X 4 en route to Yuen Long Hong Kong at approximately 11 00 pm on 27 April 2006 5 It began when a young bespectacled male passenger tapped the shoulder of a middle aged man in front of him who was chatting on his mobile phone asking the man to lower his voice The older man later claimed that when he was tapped on the shoulder he was under stress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the Samaritans However the younger man said that he was in fact merely chatting with friends 6 The older man turned around 3 and started a monologue ranting about being unnecessarily provoked under stress 2 The younger man who seldom talked back expressed a desire to end the discussion However the middle aged man insisted that the matter was not settled and requested an apology from him The younger man apologised reluctantly shook hands but also warned the older man regarding the use of mother insults 7 This last warning resulted in more profanities from the older man 3 The video ends with the older man receiving a phone call 8 ",
