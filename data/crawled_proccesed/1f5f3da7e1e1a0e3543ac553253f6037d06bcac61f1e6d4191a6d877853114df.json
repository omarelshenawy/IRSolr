			"after": " An afterburner or a reheat is an additional component present on some jet engines mostly military supersonic aircraft Its purpose is to provide an increase in thrust usually for supersonic flight takeoff and for combat situations Afterburning is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the jet pipe downstream of i e after the turbine The advantage of afterburning is significantly increased thrust the disadvantage is its very high fuel consumption and inefficiency though this is often regarded as acceptable for the short periods during which it is usually used ",
