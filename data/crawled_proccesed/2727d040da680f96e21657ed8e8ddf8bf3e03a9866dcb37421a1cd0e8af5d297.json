			"after": " Aristotle 384 322 BC and Pliny 23 79 AD both wrote about the legend of a contest among the birds to see who should be their king the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest Initially it looked as though the eagle would win easily but as he began to tire a small bird that had hidden under the eagle s tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title 69 70 Following from this legend in much European folklore the wren has been described as the king of the birds or as a flame bearer However these terms were also applied to the Regulus species the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles 71 and because of the legend s reference to the smallest of birds becoming king the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren 31 72 The confusion was probably compounded by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Greek words for the wren basileus king and the crests basiliskos kinglet 73 In English the association between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been reinforced by the kinglet s old name of gold crested wren 74 ",
