			"previous": " The Commission disliked the sketches from the Mint submitted by Barber 13 and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek to submit proposals for the new coins The sculptors could submit multiple sketches Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor the designs were not fully interchangeable by statute an eagle had to appear on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar but could not appear on the dime Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece 14 ",
			"after": " The three sculptors submitted design sketches in mid February and on February 23 met with Woolley in New York so the artists could make presentations of the work to him and answer his questions After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo Weinman was notified on February 28 that five of his sketches had been selected for the dime and half dollar and the reverse of the quarter The same day Woolley wrote to MacNeil to tell him he would sculpt the quarter s obverse and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success 15 Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter subject to the sculptor producing a design satisfactory to Woolley 16 ",
