			"after": " At the dawn of the establishment of the Ottoman Empire in Southeast Europe the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1415 and established formal jurisdiction over most of Albania by 1431 61 However on 1443 a great and longstanding revolt broke under the lead of the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg which lasted until 1479 many times defeating major Ottoman armies led by sultans Murad II and Mehmed II Skanderbeg united initially the Albanian princes and later established a centralized authority over most of the non conquered territories becoming Lord of Albania He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans He frustrated every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and western Europe His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from Naples the papacy Venice and Ragusa 62 Finally after decades of resistance Ottomans captured Shkod r in 1479 and Durr s in 1501 63 Skanderbeg s long struggle to keep Albania free became highly significant to the Albanian people as it strengthened their solidarity made them more conscious of their national identity and served later as a great source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity freedom and independence 62 64 The invasion triggered a several waves of migration of Albanians from Albania Epir and Peoponesse to the south of Italy constituting an Arbereshe community Albanians were recruited all over Europe as a light cavalry known as stratioti The stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during this era In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army Hungarian hussars and German mercenary cavalry units Schwarzreitern 65 By the 16th century Ottoman rule over Southeast Europe was largely secure The Ottomans proceeded in stages first appointing a qadi along with governors and then military retainers in the cities Timar holders not necessarily converts to Islam would occasionally rebel the most famous case of which is Skanderbeg His figure would be used later in the 19th century as a central component of Albanian national identity Ottoman control over the Albanian territories was secured in 1571 when Ulcinj presently in Montenegro was captured The most significant impact on the Albanians was the gradual Islamisation process of a large majority of the population although such a process only became widespread in the 17th century 66 Mainly Catholics converted in the 17th century while the Orthodox Albanians became Muslim mainly in the following century Initially confined to the main city centres of Elbasan and Shkod r by this time the countryside was also embracing the new religion 66 In Elbasan Muslims made up just over half the population in 1569 70 whereas in Shkod r this was almost 90 and in Berat closer to 60 In the 17th century however Catholic conversion to Islam increased even in the countryside The motives for conversion according to scholars were diverse depending on the context The lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues 66 Albanians could also be found across the empire in Egypt Algeria and across the Maghreb as vital military and administrative retainers 67 ",
