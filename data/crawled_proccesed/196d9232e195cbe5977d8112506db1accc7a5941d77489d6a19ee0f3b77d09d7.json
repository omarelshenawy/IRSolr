			"previous": " The name Britannia was chosen in April 1950 with Britannia 101 the designation for first two prototypes powered by the early series Proteus 625 the follow up from the 600 series engine that had successfully completed its type trials 15 The first prototype registered G ALBO with Bristol Chief Test Pilot A J Bill Pegg at the controls flew for the first time on 16 August 1952 at Filton Aerodrome 4 16 The maiden flight was eventful as the over sensitive flying controls led to a wild pitching before Pegg restored control During the landing approach smoke filled the cockpit and the main undercarriage bogie was stuck in its cycle only fully deploying seconds before landing 16 The snags proved to be minor and by September the prototype was cleared to perform at the 1952 SBAC Display at Farnborough where spectators commented on the quietness of the giant airliner 1 In November 1952 Popular Science reported that by 1954 BOAC would have 25 of these aircraft on routes such as London to Tokyo over the Arctic and North Pole 17 However in 1953 and 1954 three de Havilland Comets crashed without explanation and the Air Ministry demanded the Britannia undergo lengthy tests 18 Further delays were attributed to teething problems with the engine resulting in the loss in December 1953 of the second prototype G ALRX caused by a failed reduction gear that led to an engine fire and the aircraft landing on the mudflats of the Severn Estuary Resolving easily avoidable inlet icing issues by selecting a slightly different cruising height than that specified which were exaggerated by BOAC destroying the Britannia s sales prospects and delaying the Britannia s introduction by two years 19 also took time 20 21 The first prototype G ALBO was subsequently modified to more closely approximate a production standard but was retained by the company to undergo engine testing and development 22 ",
			"after": " Bristol revised the design into a larger transatlantic airliner for BOAC resulting in the Series 200 and 300 with the Britannia 300LR Long Range seen as eminently suitable for BOAC s services between London and Sydney 23 Qantas had been considering purchasing a fleet of Britannia aircraft but the extended development time had worn away the advantage the aircraft would hold until newer aircraft such as the Douglas DC 8 and de Havilland Comet 4 came onto the market 24 Route proving trials continued through 1955 although orders were on the books from El Al and Canadian Pacific Air Lines as well as BOAC s standing order 22 ",
