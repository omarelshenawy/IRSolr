			"previous": " The significance of atomic numbers to the organization of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood Mendeleev s periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements information determinable to fair precision in his time Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to as noted give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known Substitution of atomic numbers once understood gave a definitive integer based sequence for the elements still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied 64 ",
			"after": " In 1871 Mendeleev published his periodic table in a new form with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element s oxidation state He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing but should exist 65 These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements 66 It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was francium referred to by Mendeleev as eka caesium in 1939 67 However plutonium produced synthetically in 1940 was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring primordial element in 1971 68 and by 2011 it was known that all the elements up to californium can occur naturally as trace amounts in uranium ores by neutron capture and beta decay 1 ",
