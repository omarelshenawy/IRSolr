			"previous": " A pitot static system is a system of pressure sensitive instruments that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft s airspeed Mach number altitude and altitude trend A pitot static system generally consists of a pitot tube a static port and the pitot static instruments 1 This equipment is used to measure the forces acting on a vehicle as a function of the temperature density pressure and viscosity of the fluid in which it is operating 2 Other instruments that might be connected are air data computers flight data recorders altitude encoders cabin pressurization controllers and various airspeed switches Errors in pitot static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system such as altitude is often critical to a successful flight Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to a failure of the pitot static system 3 ",
