			"previous": " Venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System has had more landers sent to it nearly all from the Soviet Union than any other planet in the Solar System The first successful Venus flyby was the American Mariner 2 spacecraft which flew past Venus in 1962 Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies In 1967 Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus In 1970 Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere ",
