			"previous": " The ruff normally feeds using a steady walk and pecking action selecting food items by sight but it will also wade deeply and submerge its head On saline lakes in East Africa it often swims like a phalarope picking items off the surface 3 It will feed at night as well as during the day 55 When feeding the ruff frequently raises its back feathers producing a loose pointed peak on the back this habit is shared only by the black tailed godwit 10 ",
			"after": " During the breeding season the ruff s diet consists almost exclusively of the adults and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies On migration and during the winter the ruff eats insects including caddis flies water beetles mayflies and grasshoppers crustaceans spiders molluscs worms frogs small fish and also the seeds of rice and other cereals sedges grasses and aquatic plants 21 Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site Green aquatic plant material spilt rice and maize flies and beetles were found along with varying amounts of grit 56 On the main wintering grounds in West Africa rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out 57 ",
