			"previous": " The first potential evidence for herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodon bernissartensis ornithischians which were then thought to have perished together in Bernissart Belgium after they fell into a deep flooded sinkhole and drowned 73 Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered Those along with multiple trackways suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck bills hadrosaurids may have moved in great herds like the American bison or the African springbok Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species at least in Oxfordshire England 74 although there is not evidence for specific herd structures 75 Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense for migratory purposes or to provide protection for young There is evidence that many types of slow growing dinosaurs including various theropods sauropods ankylosaurians ornithopods and ceratopsians formed aggregations of immature individuals One example is a site in Inner Mongolia that has yielded the remains of over 20 Sinornithomimus from one to seven years old This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud 76 The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey 77 78 However this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds crocodiles and other reptiles and the taphonomic evidence suggesting mammal like pack hunting in such theropods as Deinonychus and Allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals as is seen in many modern diapsid predators 79 ",
