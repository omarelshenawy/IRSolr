			"previous": " The 1907 panic began with a stock manipulation scheme to corner the market in F Augustus Heinze s United Copper Company Heinze had made a fortune as a copper magnate in Butte Montana In 1906 he moved to New York City where he formed a close relationship with notorious Wall Street banker Charles W Morse Morse had once successfully cornered New York City s ice market and together with Heinze gained control of many banks the pair served on at least six national banks ten state banks five trust companies and four insurance firms 17 ",
			"after": " Augustus brother Otto devised the scheme to corner United Copper believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze s shares had been borrowed and sold short by speculators betting that the stock price would drop and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply pocketing the difference Otto proposed a short squeeze whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price and being unable to find shares elsewhere the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes who could then name their price 18 ",
