			"previous": " The first permanent European settlers in the Miami area did not come until the early 19th century The first settlements around Biscayne Bay were small farms on Elliott Key growing crops like key limes and pineapples John James Audubon visited Elliott Key in 1832 26 Colonel Robert E Lee surveyed the area around Biscayne Bay for potential fortification sites in 1849 25 At the end of the American Civil War in 1865 a number of Confederates passed through the area as they were attempting to escape to Cuba Elliott Key was a brief stopping point for John C Breckinridge during his flight to Cuba The former United States vice president Confederate general and Confederate secretary of war spent two nights in Biscayne Bay on his journey 27 Few people lived in the park area until 1897 when Israel Lafayette Jones an African American property manager bought Porgy Key for 300 US The next year Jones bought the adjoining Old Rhodes Key and moved his family there clearing land to grow limes and pineapples In 1911 Jones bought 212 acre 86 ha Totten Key which had been used as a pineapple plantation for a dollar an acre selling in 1925 for 250 000 28 Before Israel Jones death in 1932 29 the Jones plantations were for a while among the largest lime producers on the Florida east coast 30 ",
