			"previous": " Lettuce varieties will cross with each other making spacing of 5 to 20 feet 1 5 to 6 1 m between varieties necessary to prevent contamination when saving seeds Lettuce will also cross with Lactuca serriola wild lettuce with the resulting seeds often producing a plant with tough bitter leaves Celtuce a lettuce variety grown primarily in Asia for its stems crosses easily with lettuces grown for their leaves 17 This propensity for crossing however has led to breeding programs using closely related species in Lactuca such as L serriola L saligna and L virosa to broaden the available gene pool Starting in the 1990s such programs began to include more distantly related species such as L tatarica 32 Seeds keep best when stored in cool conditions and unless stored cryogenically remain viable the longest when stored at 4 F 20 C they are relatively short lived in storage 1 At room temperature lettuce seeds remain viable for only a few months However when newly harvested lettuce seed is stored cryogenically this life increases to a half life of 500 years for vaporized nitrogen and 3 400 years for liquid nitrogen this advantage is lost if seeds are not frozen promptly after harvesting 33 ",
