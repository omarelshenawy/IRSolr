			"previous": " In 1793 the newly established Philadelphia Mint began striking cents and half cents 7 Coinage of precious metal was delayed Congress required the assayer and chief coiner to each post a security bond of 10 000 a huge sum in 1793 In 1794 Congress lowered the chief coiner s bond to 5 000 and the assayer s to 1 000 President Washington s appointees to those positions were thus able to qualify and take office Subsequently silver coinage began that year 8 ",
			"after": " The half dime was struck to various designs by Mint Engraver Robert Scot from 1794 until 1805 though none were dated 1798 1799 or 1804 9 By 1804 silver US coins were heavily exported as they could be exchanged at par in the West Indies with heavier Spanish coins which were then imported as bullion and deposited at the Mint for melting and restriking In response in 1804 the US stopped striking silver dollars issuance of the half dime was discontinued from 1805 until 1829 In 1807 mint Director Robert Patterson in a letter explained to Jefferson by then president nearly the whole of our Silver Bullion chiefly Spanish dollars come through the Banks and it is very seldom that they will consent to take any coin less than half dollars 10 ",
