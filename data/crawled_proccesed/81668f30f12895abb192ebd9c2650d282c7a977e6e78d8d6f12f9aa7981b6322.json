			"previous": " Initial studies looked at turbojets and turbofans but the lower frontal cross sectional area of turbojets in the end was shown to be a critical factor in achieving superior performance The competing Russian Tu 144 initially used a turbofan with reheat but changed to a turbojet without reheat 4 with considerable improvement in performance ",
