			"previous": " The evolutionary history of life stretches back to over 3 000 million years ago possibly as far as 3 800 million years ago Earth formed about 4 570 million years ago and after a collision that formed the Moon about 40 million years later may have cooled quickly enough to have oceans and an atmosphere about 4 440 million years ago 45 However there is evidence on the Moon of a Late Heavy Bombardment from 4 000 to 3 800 million years ago If as seem likely such a bombardment struck Earth at the same time the first atmosphere and oceans may have been stripped away 46 The oldest clear evidence of life on Earth dates to 3 000 million years ago although there have been reports often disputed of fossil bacteria from 3 400 million years ago and of geochemical evidence for the presence of life 3 800 million years ago 9 47 Some scientists have proposed that life on Earth was seeded from elsewhere 48 but most research concentrates on various explanations of how life could have arisen independently on Earth 49 ",
			"after": " For about 2 000 million years microbial mats multi layered colonies of different types of bacteria were the dominant life on Earth 51 The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis enabled them to play the major role in the oxygenation of the atmosphere 52 from about 2 400 million years ago This change in the atmosphere increased their effectiveness as nurseries of evolution 53 While eukaryotes cells with complex internal structures may have been present earlier their evolution speeded up when they acquired the ability to transform oxygen from a poison to a powerful source of energy in their metabolism This innovation may have come from primitive eukaryotes capturing oxygen powered bacteria as endosymbionts and transforming them into organelles called mitochondria 54 The earliest evidence of complex eukaryotes with organelles such as mitochondria dates from 1 850 million years ago 20 ",
