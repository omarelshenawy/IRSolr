			"previous": " It is generally understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870 having developed from Dr Henry Grace s West Gloucestershire club 104 Gloucestershire acquired first class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2 3 4 June 1870 105 With Grace and his brothers E M and Fred playing Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly became one of the best teams in England The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874 106 Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs Grace scored 143 sharing a second wicket partnership with Frank Townsend 89 of 234 107 The Grace family ran the show at Gloucestershire and E M was chosen as secretary which as Birley points out put him in charge of expenses a source of scandal that was to surface before the end of the decade 36 W G though aged only 21 was from the start the team captain and Birley puts this down to his commercial drawing power 36 ",
			"after": " In 1878 Gloucestershire made its first visit to Old Trafford Cricket Ground in July to play Lancashire and this was the match immortalised by Francis Thompson in his idyllic poem At Lord s 108 In a match against Surrey at Clifton the ball lodged in Grace s shirt after he had played it and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and following a discussion it was agreed that three runs should be awarded 109 ",
