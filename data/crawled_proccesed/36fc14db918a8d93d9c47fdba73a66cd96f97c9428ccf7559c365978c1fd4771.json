			"previous": " The fruiting structure is a stout woody cone with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts 1 Up to 70 woody follicles each of which contains a single seed may be embedded in the cone As with other Banksia species only a small proportion of flowers go on to form follicles in the case of B telmatiaea the proportion is around 4 for those cones that set some fruit However about 80 of fruiting structures set no fruit at all According to John K Scott there is no obvious reason on the basis of morphology of pollination for this lack of seed set 3 ",
			"after": " B telmatiaea was first collected around 1840 by Ludwig Preiss and James Drummond For many years it was included in B sphaerocarpa but by 1980 it was recognised as a distinct species In recognition of its distinctness from yet affinity with B sphaerocarpa it was for a time informally referred to as Banksia aff Sphaerocarpa 5 It was eventually published by Alex George in his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L f Proteaceae based on a specimen collected by him on the Brand Highway about 45 km 28 mi north of Regans Ford on 14 May 1969 and labelled A S George 9309 He found it most closely resembled B leptophylla but regarded its preference for swampy rather than sandy soils and winter flowering as worthy of warranting species status 2 George gave it the specific name telmatiaea from the Greek stem telmat the mud of a pond 6 in reference to its swampy habitat 2 Thus the full name for the species is Banksia telmatiaea A S George 7 Common names for B telmatiaea include swamp fox banksia and marsh banksia 8 ",
