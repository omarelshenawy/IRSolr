			"previous": " In response to this reported threat Col Tillman said he flew Air Force One out into the Gulf of Mexico to test whether the other aircraft would follow The other jet continued on its route and Tillman said that it was later explained to him that an airliner had lost its transponder and that the pilots on board neglected to switch to another radio frequency The transponder of a plane broadcasts an electronic identification signal of itself 31 A threat came again when Tillman received a message warning of an imminent attack on Air Force One We got word from the vice president and the staff that Angel was next Angel being the classified call sign for the Air Force One Once we got into the Gulf of Mexico and they passed to us that Angel was next at that point I asked for fighter support If an airliner was part of the attack it would be good to have fighters on the wing to go ahead and take care of us At this point Tillman said that the plan to fly the president back to Washington DC was aborted and instead Tillman landed at Barksdale Air Force Base Louisiana and Offutt Air Force Base Nebraska where the president made a speech Tillman explained that this was due to his concern that because of the reported threat Air Force One would be attacked when he returned to Andrews Air Force Base 31 ",
			"after": " After the preliminary stops the president was returned to Washington The next day officials at the White House and the Justice Department explained that President Bush did this because there was specific and credible information that the White House and Air Force One were also intended targets 32 The White House later could not confirm evidence of a threat made against Air Force One and subsequent investigation found the original claim to be a result of miscommunication 33 ",
