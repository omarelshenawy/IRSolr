			"previous": " Another component of the ritual is the slaughter of water buffalo The more powerful the person who died the more buffalo are slaughtered at the death feast Buffalo carcasses including their heads are usually lined up on a field waiting for their owner who is in the sleeping stage Torajans believe that the deceased will need the buffalo to make the journey and that they will be quicker to arrive at Puya if they have many buffalo Slaughtering tens of water buffalo and hundreds of pigs using a machete is the climax of the elaborate death feast with dancing and music and young boys who catch spurting blood in long bamboo tubes Some of the slaughtered animals are given by guests as gifts which are carefully noted because they will be considered debts of the deceased s family 28 However a cockfight known as bulangan londong is an integral part of the ceremony As with the sacrifice of the buffalo and the pigs the cockfight is considered sacred because it involves the spilling of blood on the earth In particular the tradition requires the sacrifice of at least three chickens However it is common for at least 25 pairs of chickens to be set against each other in the context of the ceremony 29 ",
			"after": " There are three methods of burial the coffin may be laid in a cave or in a carved stone grave or hung on a cliff It contains any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff The grave is usually expensive and takes a few months to complete In some areas a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family A wood carved effigy called Tau tau is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land 30 The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree This hanging grave usually lasts for years until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground ",
