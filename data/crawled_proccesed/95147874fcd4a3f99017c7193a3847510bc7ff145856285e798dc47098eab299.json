			"previous": " A sideline to the Il 62 story concerns alleged industrial espionage As the Il 62 was developed at about the same time as the VC10 to which it bears a marked external resemblance British Cold War commentators implied that the VC10 design may have been copied by dubbing the Il 62 the VC10 ski Thiel 2001 No evidence of this was ever presented and as noted above later model VC10s adopted some of the Il 62 wing design features Il 62 type landing gear was also used by several leading aircraft manufacturers There are significant differences between the Il 62 and the VC10 as the Russian type is larger lifts a greater load covers a longer range and is suited only to developed airports vis a vis the British type s adaptability to up country bases Unlike the VC10 the Il 62 uses conservative technology such as mechanical control surface linkages and is an entirely civil machine whereas the VC10 was designed to double as an airlifter as well as a military freighter The Il 62 found more buyers and was built in larger numbers than the VC10 292 vs 54 and was still in civilian service as at 2013 whereas the VC10 has long been retired from that role in 1966 BOAC described the aircraft as uneconomic and asked for government subsidies to continue its operation At the end of its civilian career some VC10s were used by Britain s Royal Air Force in support roles China and Czechoslovakia were two countries that considered buying the VC10 for CAAC and Czechoslovak Airlines respectively before opting for the Il 62 see VC10 Sales and airline service ",
			"after": " After the introduction of the Il 62M Aeroflot the largest operator of the plane gradually upgraded and later replaced its fleet of NK 8 powered Il 62s with the newer Soloviev D 30 KU powered Il 62M Coupled with engine nacelle and other modifications greatly reduced the chance of contiguous powerplant damage By mid 1973 the airline was operating some 60 Il 62s and by 1989 this had increased to 165 Il 62 and Il 62M Thiel 2001 The Il 62M had a dispatch rate with Aeroflot of 97 with some examples logging as many as 17 flight hrs day and it was described as the most reliable type in the fleet at that time Gordon et al 2004 It set several international records in its class mostly exemplifying a range capability far in excess of the conservative Aeroflot calculations applied in Soviet times Some of these records were set by an all woman crew of five captained by Iraida Inna Vertiprahova With 10 tonnes of freight the Il 62M had a maximum range of 10 300 km compared to 9 412 km for the VC10 carrying the same weight With a 23 tonne payload the Il 62M range was 8000 km compared to 6 920 km for a Boeing 707 with maximum payload Because of its capacity the plane has historically been used for emergency evacuation flights one of the most notable being the landing of an Aeroflot registered Il 62 at Santiago Airport Chile on the night of 10 Sep 1973 the day before the military coup by Augusto Pinochet in order to evacuate 147 Cuban embassy personnel More recently April 2015 two EMERCOM IL 62Ms including RA 86495 of the Russian Federation Air Force were used to evacuate many hundreds of foreign nationals and Yemenis from Sanaa during the Saudi led military operation against Yemen ",
