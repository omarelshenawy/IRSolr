			"previous": " The anarchy in the duchy lasted until 1047 21 and control of the young duke was one of the priorities of those contending for power At first Alan of Brittany had custody of the duke but when Alan died in either late 1039 or October 1040 Gilbert of Brionne took charge of William Gilbert was killed within months and another guardian Turchetil was also killed around the time of Gilbert s death 22 Yet another guardian Osbern was slain in the early 1040s in William s chamber while the duke slept It was said that Walter William s maternal uncle was occasionally forced to hide the young duke in the houses of peasants 23 although this story may be an embellishment by Orderic Vitalis The historian Eleanor Searle speculates that William was raised with the three cousins who later became important in his career William fitzOsbern Roger de Beaumont and Roger of Montgomery 24 Although many of the Norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feuds during William s minority the viscounts still acknowledged the ducal government and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of William 25 ",
			"after": " King Henry continued to support the young duke 26 but in late 1046 opponents of William came together in a rebellion centred in lower Normandy led by Guy of Burgundy with support from Nigel Viscount of the Cotentin and Ranulf Viscount of the Bessin According to stories that may have legendary elements an attempt was made to seize William at Valognes but he escaped under cover of darkness seeking refuge with King Henry 27 In early 1047 Henry and William returned to Normandy and were victorious at the Battle of Val s Dunes near Caen although few details of the actual fighting are recorded 28 William of Poitiers claimed that the battle was won mainly through William s efforts but earlier accounts claim that King Henry s men and leadership also played an important part 2 William assumed power in Normandy and shortly after the battle promulgated the Truce of God throughout his duchy in an effort to limit warfare and violence by restricting the days of the year on which fighting was permitted 29 Although the Battle of Val s Dunes marked a turning point in William s control of the duchy it was not the end of his struggle to gain the upper hand over the nobility The period from 1047 to 1054 saw almost continuous warfare with lesser crises continuing until 1060 30 ",
