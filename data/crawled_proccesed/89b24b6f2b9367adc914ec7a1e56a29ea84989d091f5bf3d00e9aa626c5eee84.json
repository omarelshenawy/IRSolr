			"previous": " P ron s interview describes some aspects of the behaviour of the King Island emu He writes that the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time then wandered off in pairs They ate berries grass and seaweed and foraged mainly during morning and evening They were swift runners but were apparently slower than the mainland birds due to being fat They swam well but only did so when necessary They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline rather than open areas They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves If unable to flee from the hunting dogs of the sealers they would defend themselves by kicking which could inflict a great deal of harm 20 ",
			"after": " Captain Matthew Flinders did not encounter emus when he visited King Island in 1802 but his naturalist Robert Brown examined their dung and noted they had chiefly fed on the berries of Leptecophylla juniperina 4 An account by English ornithologist John Latham about the Van Diemen s cassowary may also refer to the King Island emu based on the small size described In addition to a physical description he stated that they gathered in groups of 70 to 80 individuals in a given location while foraging behaviour that was exploited by hunters 10 ",
