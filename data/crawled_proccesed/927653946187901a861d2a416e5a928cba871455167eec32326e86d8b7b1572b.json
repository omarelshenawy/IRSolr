			"after": " Seal hunting by humans has existed since the Stone Age Originally seals were hit with clubs during haul out Eventually seal hunters used harpoons to spear the animals from boats out at sea and hooks for killing pups on ice or land They were also trapped in nets The use of firearms in seal hunting during the modern era drastically increased the number of killings Pinnipeds are typically hunted for their meat and blubber The skins of fur seals and phocids are made into coats and the tusks of walruses continue to be used for carvings or as ornaments 153 There is a distinction between the subsistence hunting of seals by indigenous peoples of the Arctic and commercial hunting subsistence hunters typically use seal products for themselves and depend on them for survival 154 National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of killing are seen as less destructive and wasteful This distinction is being questioned as indigenous people are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with and are selling seal products in the marketplace Some anthropologists argue that the term subsistence should also apply to these cash based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption More than 100 000 phocids especially ringed seals as well as around 10 000 walruses are harvested annually by native hunters 153 ",
