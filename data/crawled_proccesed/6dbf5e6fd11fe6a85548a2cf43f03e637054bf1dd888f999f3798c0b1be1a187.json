			"previous": " Once a male has found a mate he selects a territory marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch After circling the perimeter he performs two flight displays first repeating a low flat flight then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight tucking his wings close to his body plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony perhaps to aid in defense against predators 16 ",
			"after": " The nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a deciduous shrub or tree at a height of up to 10 m 33 ft The nest building lasts approximately six days during which time the female works in 10 40 minute increments The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials and though he may carry some materials back to the nest he leaves its construction to the female The outer shell of the nest is built of bark weeds vines and grass 23 The inside diameter of the finished nest is about 6 5 cm 2 6 in 22 The rim is reinforced with bark bound by spiderwebs and caterpillar silk and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed thistle or cattail The nest is so tightly woven that it can hold water and it is possible for nestlings to drown following a rainstorm if the parents do not cover the nest 17 ",
