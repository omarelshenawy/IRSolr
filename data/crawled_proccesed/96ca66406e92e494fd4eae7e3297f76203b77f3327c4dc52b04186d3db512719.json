			"after": " Female elk have a short estrus cycle of only a day or two and matings usually involve a dozen or more attempts By the autumn of their second year females can produce one and very rarely two offspring although reproduction is most common when cows weigh at least 200 kilograms 440 lb 36 The gestation period is 240 to 262 days and the offspring weigh between 15 and 16 kilograms 33 and 35 lb When the females are near to giving birth they tend to isolate themselves from the main herd and will remain isolated until the calf is large enough to escape predators 32 Calves are born spotted as is common with many deer species and they lose their spots by the end of summer Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older After two weeks calves are able to join the herd and are fully weaned at two months of age 37 Elk calves are as large as an adult white tailed deer by the time they are six months old 38 The offspring will remain with their mothers for almost a year leaving about the time that the next season s offspring are produced 35 The gestation period is the same for all subspecies ",
