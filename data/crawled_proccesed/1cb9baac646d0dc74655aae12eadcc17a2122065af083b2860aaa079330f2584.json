			"previous": " Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic meaning it obtains nutrients from decomposing organic matter 38 It grows scattered or clustered in small groups on rotting hardwoods such as basswood maple and especially elm 27 in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut 26 The mushroom prefers low lying logs in areas that are periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight such as areas shaded by forest canopy 27 A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates It is often found growing on dark stained wood especially the dried out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark 39 R palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather from spring to autumn in the United States 28 or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe 31 ",
