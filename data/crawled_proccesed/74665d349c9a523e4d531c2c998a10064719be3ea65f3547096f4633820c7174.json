			"after": " To prevent control surface flutter aeroelastic flutter the center of lift of the control surface should be behind the center of gravity of that surface To achieve this lead weights may be added to the front of the aileron In some aircraft the aileron construction may be too heavy to allow this system to work without huge weight increases In this case the weight may be added to a lever arm to move the weight well out in front to the aileron body These balance weights are tear drop shaped to reduce drag which make them appear quite different from spades although both project forward and below the aileron In addition to reducing flutter mass balances also reduce the stick forces required to move the control surface in flight ",
