			"previous": " In addition to an abnormally short gestation period ruffed lemurs share another feature with small nocturnal lemurs by producing the largest litters of the family Lemuridae 9 11 13 Litters typically include two or three infants although up to five have been reported 9 11 19 Birth weights in captivity average between 83 to 101 7 g 2 93 to 3 59 oz and range from 70 to 140 grams 2 5 to 4 9 oz 19 Ruffed lemur infants are altricial 13 and are born with their eyes open and a full coat of fur 19 ",
			"after": " Ruffed lemurs are the only known primates to build arboreal nests used exclusively for birth and for the first week or two of life 9 11 14 19 Starting three weeks prior to birth 13 females begin constructing the nest from twigs branches leaves and vines locating it within her core area and 10 to 25 metres 33 to 82 ft above ground 11 19 The nests have only one apparent entry point and are shallow and dish shaped During the first couple of weeks the mother is mostly solitary and does not travel far from the nest spending as much as 70 90 of her time with the newborns in captivity 19 In order to find food she will leave the infants alone in the nest or after the first couple of weeks will carry them in her mouth and stash them in concealed locations in the canopy while she forages 11 14 Since this early developmental period corresponds with the end of the cold dry season which offers the least amount of fruit energy is conserved for lactation while travel is limited 13 As the hot rainy season begins fruit availability rises lactation demands rise as well and females increase their travel distance in search of food 11 ",
