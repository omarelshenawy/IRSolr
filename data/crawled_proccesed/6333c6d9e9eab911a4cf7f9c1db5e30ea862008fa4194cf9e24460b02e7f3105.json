			"previous": " In 1787 army lieutenant and part time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby now part of the Stockholm Archipelago 3 Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten 27 he named it ytterbite note 4 and sent samples to various chemists for further analysis 3 ",
			"after": " Johan Gadolin at the University of bo identified a new oxide or earth in Arrhenius sample in 1789 and published his completed analysis in 1794 28 note 5 Anders Gustaf Ekeberg confirmed this in 1797 and named the new oxide yttria 29 In the decades after Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within which in this case would have been yttrium note 6 ",
