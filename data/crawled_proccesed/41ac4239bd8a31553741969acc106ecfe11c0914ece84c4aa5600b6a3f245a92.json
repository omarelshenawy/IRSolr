			"after": " Edison had recognised the scarcity of iron ore in the 1870s 1 particularly in the east of the United States His developments in the field of electricity meant that he had sufficient finances to invest in other projects Discovering that beach sand contained relatively high deposits of iron 1 he decided to form the Edison Ore Milling Company in 1881 2 He patented a method of extracting the metal using a large electromagnet after developing the process in an addition to his laboratory The remaining deposits of iron in the eastern side of the United States were of poor quality and the difficulty in separating it from the rock and other debris made it unprofitable Edison believed that his method was a cheaper alternative allowing him to keep costs down 3 William Kennedy Dickson had been put in charge of much of the laboratory and further refined the techniques along with mining expert John Birkinbine 1 However the market for Edison s iron was not sufficient to bring in a profit and the operation was closed down after just a few years 2 3 ",
