			"previous": " Saturn I the first US heavy lift launch vehicle was initially planned to launch partially equipped CSMs in low Earth orbit tests The S I first stage burned RP 1 with liquid oxygen LOX oxidizer to produce 1 500 000 pounds force 6 670 kN of thrust The S IV second stage used six liquid hydrogen fueled RL 10 engines with 90 000 pounds force 400 kN of thrust A planned Centaur S V third stage with two RL 10 engines never flew on Saturn I 45 ",
			"after": " The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC 34 with only live first stages carrying dummy upper stages filled with water The first flight with a live S IV was launched from LC 37 This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs designated AS 101 through AS 105 into orbit in 1964 and 1965 The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts 46 ",
