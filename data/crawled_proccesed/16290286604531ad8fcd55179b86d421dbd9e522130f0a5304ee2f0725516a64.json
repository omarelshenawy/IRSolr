			"previous": " One of the most common types of arc welding is shielded metal arc welding SMAW 28 it is also known as manual metal arc welding MMA or stick welding Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod which is made of filler material typically steel and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide CO2 gas during the welding process The electrode core itself acts as filler material making a separate filler unnecessary 28 ",
			"after": " The process is versatile and can be performed with relatively inexpensive equipment making it well suited to shop jobs and field work 28 29 An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience Weld times are rather slow since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag the residue from the flux must be chipped away after welding 28 Furthermore the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron nickel aluminum copper and other metals 29 ",
