			"previous": " The Chancery came to prominence after the decline of the Exchequer dealing with the law of equity something more fluid and adaptable than the common law The early Court of Chancery dealt with verbal contracts matters of land law and matters of trusts and had a very liberal view when setting aside complaints poverty for example was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation 9 Complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition which had to show that the common law did not provide a remedy for the problem The Chancery writs were in French and later English rather than the Latin used for common law bills 10 In the reign of Edward III the Court found a fixed home at Westminster Hall where it sat almost continually until its dissolution 11 Prior to this the disposing of justice had been made difficult by the fact that the Lord Chancellor was required to travel with the King wherever he went 12 ",
			"after": " By 1345 the Lord Chancellor began to be seen as the leader of the Court of Chancery rather than as a representative of the King and writs and bills were addressed directly to him Under Richard II it became practice to consider the Chancery separate from the curia academic William Carne considers this a key moment in confirming the independence of the Court of Chancery 13 The Chancellor and his clerks often heard the cases directly rather than having them referred to the council itself occasionally a committee of lay and church members disposed of them assisted by the judges of the common law courts 14 John Baker argues that it was the late 14th century that saw Chancery procedure become fixed citing the work done by John Waltham as Master of the Rolls between 1381 and 1386 and notes that this period also saw the first complaints about the Chancery 15 ",
