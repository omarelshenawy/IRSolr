			"previous": " The only known soft tissue remains the Oxford head specimen OUM 11605 and foot belonged to the last known stuffed dodo which was first mentioned as part of the Tradescant collection in 1656 and was moved to the Ashmolean Museum in 1659 It has been suggested that this might be the remains of the bird that Hamon L Estrange saw in London 2 Many sources state that the museum burned the stuffed dodo around 1755 because of severe decay saving only the head and leg Statute 8 of the museum states That as any particular grows old and perishing the keeper may remove it into one of the closets or other repository and some other to be substituted 100 The deliberate destruction of the specimen is now believed to be a myth it was removed from exhibition to preserve what remained of it This remaining soft tissue has since degraded further the head was dissected by Strickland and Melville separating the skin from the skull in two halves The foot is in a skeletal state with only scraps of skin and tendons Very few feathers remain on the head It is probably a female as the foot is 11 smaller and more gracile than that of the London specimen yet appears to be fully grown 101 ",
			"after": " The dried London foot first mentioned in 1665 and transferred to the British Museum in the 18th century was displayed next to Savery s Edwards s Dodo painting until the 1840s and it too was dissected by Strickland and Melville It was not posed in a standing posture which suggests that it was severed from a fresh specimen not a mounted one By 1896 it was mentioned as being without its integuments and only the bones are believed to remain today though its present whereabouts are unknown 2 ",
