			"previous": " The Einstein field equations can be written briefly in abstract index notation as rank 2 symmetric tensors  Einstein s theory of general relativity 1915 stated that the presence of mass energy and momentum causes spacetime to become curved Because of this curvature the paths that objects in inertial motion follow can deviate or change direction over time This deviation appears to us as an acceleration towards massive objects which Newton characterized as being gravity In general relativity however this acceleration or free fall is actually inertial motion So objects in a gravitational field appear to fall at the same rate due to their being in inertial motion while the observer is the one being accelerated This identification of free fall and inertia is known as the Equivalence principle ",
