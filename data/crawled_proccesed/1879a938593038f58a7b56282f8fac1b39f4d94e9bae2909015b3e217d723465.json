			"previous": " The Il 32 made its first flight on 20 August 1948 towed by a twin engined Ilyushin Il 12 but the Il 12 wasn t powerful enough to tow a fully loaded glider and the four engined Il 18 airliner prototype was adapted to tow it from 20 September During these flight tests it reached a cruising speed of 323 km h 201 mph at an altitude of 3 000 metres 9 800 ft and a weight of 16 000 kg 35 000 lb The flight tests were satisfactory and preparations were made to begin series production but the lack of suitable tugs was a problem None of the Soviet four engined aircraft that could be used were either in production or available Both the Tupolev Tu 70 and Il 18 airliners had been canceled as had the Tu 75 transport and the Tu 4 was dedicated to the strategic bombing mission Experiments were made with a pair of Il 12s towing the Il 32 but this was both difficult and risky for all involved The Il 32 was therefore canceled for lack of a proper tug 3 ",
