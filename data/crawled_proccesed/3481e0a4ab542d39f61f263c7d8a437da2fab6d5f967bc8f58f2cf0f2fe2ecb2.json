			"previous": " At least 700 grizzly bears are believed to exist in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Shoshone National Forest with approximately 125 grizzlies in the forest 36 42 The grizzly is listed as a threatened species by the U S Fish and Wildlife Service and the forest is one of their last strongholds For what are considered to be nuisance bears non lethal traps are set to capture them so that they can be relocated to remote areas away from civilization 43 In the case of the grizzly each captured bear is tranquilized and then ear tagged with an identifying number Each number is registered and if the bear continues to return to areas where they pose a risk of imminent threat to human safety they are exterminated 43 The grizzly recovery efforts implemented by federal agencies have often resulted in major disagreements with local landowners and surrounding municipalities 42 This situation occurs less frequently with the smaller and less aggressive black bear An active management program in conjunction with other National Forests and National Parks within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem works cooperatively to maximize human safety and to ensure habitat protection for both species of endemic bears Visitors are mandated to store their food in their vehicles or in steel containers found in campgrounds and bear proof trash receptacles are located in the front country zones throughout the forest In the backcountry food must be stored some distance from campsites and other related precautions are enforced to help prevent bad encounters 37 ",
			"after": " The cougar mountain lion and the gray wolf are large apex predators that inhabit the forest Since the 1990s wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park wolves have migrated into the forest and established permanent packs 44 Approximately a dozen wolf packs totaling 70 individual wolves were documented in the forest in 2012 45 The wolf was delisted as endangered once their population levels had reached management objectives and limited hunting of wolves was permitted in the forest starting in 2012 46 47 Cougars are generally noctural and rarely seen but hunting of this species is also allowed in highly regulated harvests 48 Wolverines are rare and elusive so documentation is often only from their tracks 49 The Canada lynx was native to the forest but no known populations may still exist due to the rarity of its primary food source the Snowshoe hare Shoshone National Forest is considered critical habitat for lynx recovery since the species is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act and the forest is in their historical range 50 Other generally carnivorous mammals include coyote bobcat weasel marten ferret and badger 51 ",
