			"previous": " In 15 16th century French and English depictions of relationships between women Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brant me in 1665 John Cleland s 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure L Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778 writers attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act Physical relationships between women were often encouraged men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women 196 At worst if a woman became enamored of another woman she became a tragic figure Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges 197 ",
			"after": " Lesbianism became almost exclusive to French literature in the 19th century based on male fantasy and the desire to shock bourgeois moral values 199 Honor de Balzac in The Girl with the Golden Eyes 1835 employed lesbianism in his story about three people living amongst the moral degeneration of Paris and again in Cousin Bette and S raph ta His work influenced novelist Th ophile Gautier s Mademoiselle de Maupin which provided the first description of a physical type that became associated with lesbians tall wide shouldered slim hipped and athletically inclined 200 Charles Baudelaire repeatedly used lesbianism as a theme in his poems Lesbos Femmes damn es 1 Damned Women and Femmes damn es 2 201 ",
