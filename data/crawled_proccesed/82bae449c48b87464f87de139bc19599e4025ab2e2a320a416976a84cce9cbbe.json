			"after": " After World War II the growing demand for electricity sparked interest in constructing another power plant supported by the Grand Coulee Dam 58 One obstacle to an additional power plant was the great seasonality of the Columbia River s streamflow Today the flow is closely managed there is almost no seasonality Historically about 75 of the river s annual flow occurred between April and September 59 During low flow periods the river s discharge was between 50 000 cu ft s 1 400 m3 s and 80 000 cu ft s 2 300 m3 s while maximum spring runoff flows were around 500 000 cu ft s 14 000 m3 s Only nine out of the dam s eighteen generators could run year round The remaining nine operated for less than six months a year 60 In 1952 Congress authorized 125 000 for Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on the Third Powerplant which was completed in 1953 and recommended two locations Nine identical 108 MW generators were recommended but as matters stood they would be able to operate only in periods of high water 58 ",
