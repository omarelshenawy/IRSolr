			"previous": " Thus a net power is released into the electric field equal to the photon energy h times this net transition rate In order for this to be a positive number indicating net stimulated emission there must be more atoms in the excited state than in the lower level Otherwise there is net absorption and the power of the wave is reduced during passage through the medium The special condition is known as a population inversion a rather unusual condition that must be effected in the gain medium of a laser ",
			"after": " Although energy generated by stimulated emission is always at the exact frequency of the field which has stimulated it the above rate equation refers only to excitation at the particular optical frequency corresponding to the energy of the transition At frequencies offset from the strength of stimulated or spontaneous emission will be decreased according to the so called line shape Considering only homogeneous broadening affecting an atomic or molecular resonance the spectral line shape function is described as a Lorentzian distribution ",
