			"after": " Each 32 bit word of RAM could contain either a program instruction or data In a program instruction bits 0 12 represented the memory address of the operand to be used and bits 13 15 specified the operation to be executed such as storing a number in memory the remaining 16 bits were unused 25 The SSEM s single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit the accumulator or the program counter instruction address program instructions specified only the address of the data in memory ",
