			"after": " Sicily s second city Catania was the most damaged of all the larger cities in 1693 41 with only the medieval Castello Ursino and three tribunes of the cathedral remaining Thus it was replanned and rebuilt The new design separated the city into quarters divided by two roads meeting at an intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo Cathedral Square Rebuilding was supervised by the Bishop of Catania and the city s only surviving architect Alonzo di Benedetto 42 Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in from Messina which quickly began to rebuild concentrating first on the Piazza del Duomo Three palazzi are situated here the Bishop s Palace the Seminario and one other The architects worked in complete harmony and it is impossible to distinguish di Benedetto s work from that of his junior colleagues The work is competent but not remarkable with decorated rustication in the 17th century Sicilian style but often the decoration on the upper floors is superficial This is typical of the Baroque of this period immediately after the earthquake 42 ",
