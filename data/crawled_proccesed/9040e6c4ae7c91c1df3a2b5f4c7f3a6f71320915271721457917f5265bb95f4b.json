			"previous": " Caspar David Friedrich was born on 5 September 1774 in Greifswald Swedish Pomerania on the Baltic coast of Germany 8 The sixth of ten children he was brought up in the strict Lutheran creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich a candle maker and soap boiler 4 Records of the family s financial circumstances are contradictory while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored others record that they were raised in relative poverty 9 Caspar David was familiar with death from an early age His mother Sophie Dorothea Bechly died in 1781 when he was just seven 10 A year later his sister Elisabeth died 11 while a second sister Maria succumbed to typhus in 1791 9 Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood was the 1787 death of his brother Johann Christoffer at the age of thirteen Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake and drown 12 Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David who was also in danger on the ice 13 ",
			"after": " Friedrich began his formal study of art in 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city at which the art department is now named in his honour Caspar David Friedrich Institut 15 Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions as a result Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age 16 Through Quistorp Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten who taught that nature was a revelation of God 16 Quistorp introduced Friedrich to the work of the German 17th century artist Adam Elsheimer whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape and nocturnal subjects 17 During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life 18 Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallery s collection of 17th century Dutch landscape painting At the Academy he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen and the landscape painter Jens Juel These artists were inspired by the Sturm und Drang movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning neo classical ideal Mood was paramount and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology 19 ",
