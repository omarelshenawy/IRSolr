			"previous": " The ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs and pterosaur she found along with the first dinosaur fossils which were discovered by Gideon Mantell and William Buckland during the same period showed that during previous eras the earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier s that there had been an age of reptiles when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life This phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled The Age of Reptiles that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land air and sea 64 These discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived This discipline eventually came to be called palaeontology 65 Illustrations of scenes from deep time now known as paleoart such as Henry De la Beche s ground breaking painting Duria Antiquior helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past De la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the food chain of the Lias by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites The study of coprolites pioneered by Anning and Buckland would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems 35 ",
