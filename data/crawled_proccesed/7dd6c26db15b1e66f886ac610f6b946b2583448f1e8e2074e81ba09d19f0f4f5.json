			"previous": " By 1853 silver was overvalued with respect to gold This was due to large discoveries of gold especially in California and silver was heavily exported To correct this situation Secretary of the Treasury Thomas Corwin advocated reducing the precious metal content of most silver coins to prevent their export The opposition to the bill was led by Tennessee Representative Andrew Johnson who believed that Congress had no authority to alter the gold silver price ratio and if it did it should not exercise it Nevertheless Congress passed the bill which became law on February 21 1853 4 That bill also authorized a three dollar gold coin according to numismatic writer Don Taxay provision for it had been inserted at the behest of gold interests 5 ",
			"after": " According to Breen Congress believed the new coin would be convenient for exchange for rolls or small bags of silver 3 pieces and for buying sheets of 3 stamps always bypassing use of copper cents 2 In 1889 then Mint Director James P Kimball wrote that it is supposed that the three dollar piece was designed to be a multiple of the three cent piece for the convenience of postal transactions 6 Numismatist Walter Hagans in his 2003 article on the three dollar coin notes and dismisses the postal explanation writing the actual reason for the gold 3 coin was the abundant supply of gold discovered in California 7 Coin dealer and author Q David Bowers notes that whether or not the 3 denomination was actually necessary or worthwhile has been a matter of debate among numismatists for well over a century 8 ",
