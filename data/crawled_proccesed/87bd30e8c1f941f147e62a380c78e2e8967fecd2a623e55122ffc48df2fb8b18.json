			"previous": " Even though the Beagle departed from the Gal pagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck these weren t for scientific study but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing Their shells and bones were thrown overboard leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses 99 It has been suggested 100 that this oversight was made because Darwin only reported seeing tortoises on San Crist bal 101 chathamensis and Santiago 102 darwini both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other Though he did visit Floreana the nigra subspecies found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals 44 ",
			"after": " However Darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands These were pet tortoises taken by himself from San Salvador his captain FitzRoy two from Espa ola and his servant Syms Covington from Floreana 103 Unfortunately they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences 104 Although the British Museum had a few specimens their provenance within the Gal pagos was unknown 105 However conversations with the naturalist Gabriel Bibron who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that there were distinct varieties 106 ",
