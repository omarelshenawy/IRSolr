			"previous": " It was during the mid 2000s that alternative hip hop finally secured a place within the mainstream due in part to the crossover success of artists such as OutKast Kanye West and Gnarls Barkley 17 Not only did OutKast s Speakerboxxx The Love Below receive high acclaim from music critics manage to appeal to listeners of all ages and span numerous musical genres including rap rock R B punk jazz indie country pop electronica and gospel but it also spawned two number one hit singles and has been certified diamond by selling 11 times platinum by the RIAA for shipping more than 11 million units 130 becoming one of the best selling hip hop albums of all time as well as winning a Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards being only the second rap album to do so Industry observers view the sales race between Kanye West s Graduation and 50 Cent s Curtis as a turning point for hip hop West emerged the victor selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap if not more so 131 Although he designed it as a melancholic pop rather than rap Kanye s following 808s Heartbreak would have a significant effect on hip hop music While his decision to sing about love loneliness and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album predicted to be a flop its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music 132 133 During the release of The Blueprint 3 New York rap mogul Jay Z revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort stating it s not gonna be a 1 album That s where I m at right now I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made 134 Jay Z elaborated that like Kanye he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop was being inspired by indie rockers like Grizzly Bear and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip hop 135 ",
			"after": " The alternative hip hop movement is not limited only to the United States as rappers such as Somali Canadian poet K naan Japanese rapper Shing02 and Sri Lankan British artist M I A have achieved considerable worldwide recognition In 2009 TIME magazine placed M I A in the Time 100 list of World s Most Influential people for having global influence across many genres 136 137 Global themed movements have also sprung out of the international hip hop scene with microgenres like Islamic Eco Rap addressing issues of worldwide importance through traditionally disenfranchised voices 138 139 Today due in part to the increasing use of music distribution through the internet many alternative rap artists find acceptance by far reaching audiences Several artists such as Kid Cudi and Drake have managed to attain chart topping hit songs Day n Nite and Best I Ever Had respectively by releasing their music on free online mixtapes without the help of a major record label New artists such as Wale J Cole Lupe Fiasco The Cool Kids Jay Electronica and B o B some of whom mention being directly influenced by their nineties alt rap predecessors in addition to the southern rap sound while their music has been noted by critics as expressing eclectic sounds life experiences and emotions rarely seen in mainstream hip hop 140 141 ",
