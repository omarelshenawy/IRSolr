			"previous": " The woman who is probably in her late teens or early twenties is shown half length and in three quarters profile set against a two dimensional interior background of deep blue green The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden s devotional works Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck c 1395 1441 when working in portraiture he used dark planes to focus attention on the sitter 5 It was not until Hans Memling c 1435 1494 a pupil of van der Weyden that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape 6 In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman s face and quiet self possession 2 Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features the woman s headdress dress face and hands The background has darkened with age it is likely that the angles created by the sitter s hennin and dress were once much sharper ",
			"after": " The woman wears an elegant low cut black dress with dark bands of fur at the neck and wrist 1 8 Her clothes are of the then fashionable Burgundian style which emphasises the tall and thin aesthetic of the Gothic ideal note 1 Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts The buff coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil which spills over her shoulders reaching her upper arms Van der Weyden s attention to the structure of the clothing the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position is typical for the artist 9 ",
