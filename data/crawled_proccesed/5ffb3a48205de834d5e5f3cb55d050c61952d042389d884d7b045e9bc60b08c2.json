			"previous": " As noted an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen see the filled orbitals in the diagram orbitals which are of equal energy i e degenerate is a configuration termed a spin triplet state Hence the ground state of the O 2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen 13 a The highest energy partially filled orbitals are antibonding and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two ",
			"after": " In the triplet form O 2 molecules are paramagnetic That is they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O 2 molecules clarification needed 14 Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that in laboratory demonstrations a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet 15 b ",
