			"after": " The show received positive reviews from critics Jon Pareles from The New York Times compared the concert with aerobics and said that the concert was more of a workout than being erotic 19 Isabel Albiston from The Daily Telegraph compared the tour with the 2006 Confessions Tour and said that two years later Madonna s biceps are no smaller and with the news that 100 pairs of fishnet pantyhose have been procured from eBay for the artist her costumes no less raunchy Madonna seemed to have a point to prove 18 Another review by Helen Brown from the same publication said that Sticky Sweet s highlights include a fresh crunchy and gipsied up La Isla Bonita complete with fiddles flamenco and a spliced in Romani folk tune and a raved up Like a Prayer 28 Sarah Liss from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commented that something about witnessing the 50 year old crow s feet and wrinkles on Madonna s face projected a hundred times larger than life as she works her ass off to paraphrase part of her stage banter for a crowd of almost 20 000 feels more awe inspiring than any of her old school shock tactics 17 ",
