			"previous": " By contrast the Habsburg frontier had settled somewhat a stalemate caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defences 54 The Long War against Habsburg Austria 1593 1606 created the need for greater numbers of infantry equipped with firearms resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps which were never fully solved 55 Irregular sharpshooters Sekban were also recruited and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts 1595 1610 which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries 56 With the Empire s population reaching 30 000 000 people by 1600 the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government 57 In spite of these problems the Ottoman state remained strong and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats The only exception were campaigns against the Safavid dynasty of Persia where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost some permanently However its campaigns became increasingly inconclusive even against weaker states with much smaller forces such as Poland or Austria ",
