			"previous": " While the fundamental theorem of algebra states a general existence result it is of some interest both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view to have information on the location of the zeros of a given polynomial The simpler result in this direction is a bound on the modulus all zeros of a monic polynomial satisfy an inequality R where",
			"after": " Notice that as stated this is not yet an existence result but rather an example of what is called an a priori bound it says that if there are solutions then they lie inside the closed disk of center the origin and radius R However once coupled with the fundamental theorem of algebra it says that the disk contains in fact at least one solution More generally a bound can be given directly in terms of any p norm of the n vector of coefficients that is Rp where Rp is precisely the q norm of the 2 vector q being the conjugate exponent of p 1 p 1 q 1 for any 1 p Thus the modulus of any solution is also bounded by",
