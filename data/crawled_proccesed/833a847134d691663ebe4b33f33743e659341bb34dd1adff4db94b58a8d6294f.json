			"after": " A multi tool is a hand tool that incorporates several tools into a single portable device the Swiss army knife represents one of the earliest examples Other tools have a primary purpose but also incorporate other functionality for example lineman s pliers incorporate a gripper and cutter and are often used as a hammer and some hand saws incorporate a carpenter s square in the right angle between the blade s dull edge and the saw s handle This would also be the category in which the multi purpose tools since they are also multiple tools in one multi use and multi purpose can be used interchangeably These types of tools were specifically made to catch the eye of many different craftsman who traveled to do their work To these workers these types of tools were revolutionary because they were one tool or one device that could do several different things With this new revolution of tools the traveling craftsman would not have to carry so many tools with them to job sites being that their space would be limited to the vehicle they were driving The problem of having to deal with so many different tools was solved with the overtaking of multi use tools ",
