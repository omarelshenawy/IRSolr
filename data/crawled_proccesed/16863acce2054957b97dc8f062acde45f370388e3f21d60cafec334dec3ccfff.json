			"previous": " The F 22 is among only a few aircraft that can supercruise or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel inefficient afterburners targets can be intercepted which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach 7 108 The Raptor s high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters 109 The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat configured fighters due to a lack of aerodynamic drag from external stores The F 22 s structure contains extensive amounts of high strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight Respectively titanium alloys and composites comprise 39 and 24 of the aircraft s structural weight 110 ",
			"after": " The F 22 is highly maneuverable at both supersonic and subsonic speeds Computerized flight control system and full authority digital engine control FADEC make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable at aggressive pilot inputs 111 112 The Raptor s relaxed stability and powerful thrust vectoring powerplants enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha angle of attack maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver J turn and Pugachev s Cobra The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60 alpha while having some roll control 113 ",
