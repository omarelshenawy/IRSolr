			"previous": " Neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core but unlike photons they rarely interact with matter so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were lower than theories predicted by a factor of 3 This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of neutrino oscillation the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory but neutrino detectors were missing 2 3 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected 93 ",
			"after": " The Sun has a magnetic field that varies across a wide range of timescales The most prominent of such variation is related to the quasi periodic 11 year solar cycle waxing and waning in the number and size of sunspots 14 95 Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun s photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface As a result sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere and so they appear dark At a typical solar minimum few sunspots are visible and occasionally none can be seen at all Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator a phenomenon known as Sp rer s law The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across 96 ",
