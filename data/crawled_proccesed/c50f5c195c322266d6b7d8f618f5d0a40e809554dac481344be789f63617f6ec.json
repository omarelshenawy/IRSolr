			"previous": " So called natural or endocrinological castrati are born with hormonal anomalies such as Kallmann s syndrome or have undergone unusual physical or medical events during their early lives that reproduce the vocal effects of castration without being castrated Jimmy Scott and Radu Marian are examples of this type of high male voice 23 Michael Maniaci is somewhat different in that he has no hormonal or other anomalies but for some unknown reason his voice did not break in the usual manner leaving him still able to sing in the soprano register 24 Other uncastrated male adults sing soprano generally using some form of falsetto but in a much higher range than most countertenors Examples are Aris Christofellis 25 J rg Waschinski 26 and Ghio Nannini 27 However it is believed the castrati possessed more of a tenorial chest register the aria Navigante che non spera in Leonardo Vinci s opera Il Medo written for Farinelli requires notes down to C3 28 Similar low voiced singing can be heard from the jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott whose range matches approximately that used by female blues singers 29 while the Turkish popular singer Cem Adrian has the ability to sing from bass to soprano his vocal folds having been reported to be three times the average length 30 Actor Chris Colfer has a similar range Colfer has stated in interviews that when his voice began to change at puberty he sang in a high voice constantly in an effort to retain his range 31 The late musician Jeff Buckley had a four octave range which allowed him to cover women s songs in a natural voice and reach notes from bass to soprano 32 ",
