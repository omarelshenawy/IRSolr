			"previous": " The difficulty with this reasoning is the assumption that the minimizing function u must have two derivatives Riemann argued that the existence of a smooth minimizing function was assured by the connection with the physical problem membranes do indeed assume configurations with minimal potential energy Riemann named this idea the Dirichlet principle in honor of his teacher Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet However Weierstrass gave an example of a variational problem with no solution minimize",
			"after": " among all functions that satisfy and W can be made arbitrarily small by choosing piecewise linear functions that make a transition between 1 and 1 in a small neighborhood of the origin However there is no function that makes W 0 The resulting controversy over the validity of Dirichlet s principle is explained in http turnbull mcs st and ac uk history Biographies Riemann html Eventually it was shown that Dirichlet s principle is valid but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations see Jost and Li Jost 1998 ",
