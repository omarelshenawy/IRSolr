			"after": " The constant re arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2 4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations Before this time any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials notably iron Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15 by the end of the Precambrian 30 The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic eon during the earliest period of which the Cambrian oxygen requiring metazoan life forms began to appear ",
