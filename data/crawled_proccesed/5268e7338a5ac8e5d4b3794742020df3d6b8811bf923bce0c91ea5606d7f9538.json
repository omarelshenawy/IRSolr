			"previous": " A robot is an electro mechanical or bio mechanical device that can perform autonomous or preprogrammed tasks Robots may be used to perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans such as radioactive waste clean up or may be used to automate mindless repetitive tasks that should be performed with more precision by a robot than by a human such as automobile production ",
			"after": " The word robot is used to refer to a wide range of machines the common feature of which is that they are all capable of movement and can be used to perform physical tasks Robots take on many different forms ranging from humanoid which mimic the human form and way of moving to industrial whose appearance is dictated by the function they are to perform Robots can be grouped generally as mobile robots e g autonomous vehicles manipulator robots e g industrial robots and self reconfigurable robots which can conform themselves to the task at hand Robots may be controlled directly by a human such as remotely controlled bomb disposal robots and robotic arms or may act according to their own decision making ability provided by artificial intelligence However the majority of robots fall in between these extremes being controlled by pre programmed computers ",
