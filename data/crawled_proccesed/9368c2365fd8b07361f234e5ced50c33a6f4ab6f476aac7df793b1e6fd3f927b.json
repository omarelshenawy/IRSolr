			"previous": " In response to Apple s Macintosh look and feel lawsuits against Microsoft and Hewlett Packard in 1988 Stallman called for a boycott of Apple products on the grounds that a successful look and feel lawsuit would put an end to free software that could substitute for commercial software 62 The boycott was lifted in 1995 which meant the FSF started to accept patches to GNU software for Apple operating systems 63 ",
			"after": " Stallman has characterized Steve Jobs as having a malign influence on computing because of Jobs leadership in guiding Apple to produce closed platforms 64 65 In 1993 while Jobs was at NeXT Jobs asked Stallman if he could distribute a modified GCC in two parts one part under GPL and the other part an Objective C preprocessor under a proprietary license Stallman initially thought this would be legal but since he also thought it would be very undesirable for free software he asked a lawyer for advice The response he got was that judges would consider such schemes to be subterfuges and would be very harsh toward them and a judge would ask whether it was really one program rather than how the parts were labeled Therefore Stallman sent a message back to Jobs which said they believed Jobs plan was not allowed by the GPL which resulted in NeXT releasing the Objective C front end under GPL 66 ",
