			"previous": " The introduction of the quartz watch in 1969 was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology 15 In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at 5 beats per second it used a quartz crystal resonator which vibrated at 8 192 Hz driven by a battery powered oscillator circuit Since the 1980s more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed ",
			"after": " A movement of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time and possibly other information including date month and day Movements may be entirely mechanical entirely electronic potentially with no moving parts or they might be a blend of both Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements with mechanical hands on the watch face indicating the time ",
