			"after": " When Webster returned to the Senate from his wife s funeral in March 1828 he found the chamber considering a new tariff bill that sought to increase the duties on foreign manufactured goods on top of the increases of 1816 and 1824 both of which Webster had opposed Now however Webster changed his position to support a protective tariff Explaining the change Webster stated that after the failure of the rest of the nation to heed New England s objections in 1816 and 1824 nothing was left to New England but to conform herself to the will of others and now consequently being heavily invested in manufacturing he would not now do them injury It is the more blunt opinion of Justus D Doenecke that Webster s support of the 1828 tariff was a result of his new closeness to the rising mill owning families of the region the Lawrences and the Lowells 8 Webster also gave greater approval to Clay s American System a change that along with his modified view of the tariff brought him closer to Henry Clay ",
