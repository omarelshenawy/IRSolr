			"previous": " According to folklore brachial gland secretions are generally thought to contain venom because of apparent anaphylactic reactions by humans following their bites 101 Slow lorises can indeed inflict painful bites Animal dealers in Southeast Asia keep tanks of water nearby so that in case of a bite they can submerge both their arm and the slow loris to make the animal let go 99 The secretion from the brachial gland is similar to the allergen in cat dander hence it seems most plausible that the secretions merely elicit an allergic reaction not toxicosis 102 Loris bites cause a painful swelling and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock 103 However although the toxin is only produced when the brachial secretion and saliva are mixed both the secretion and saliva may have unique chemical properties and may act separately Furthermore secondary toxins may be introduced from the consumption of wild food augmenting the toxicity The combined brachial secretion and saliva of recently captured wild lorises was shown to contain batrachotoxins which were not found in slow lorises held in captivity for more than a year 104 ",
			"after": " Studies suggest that slow lorises are polygynandrous 105 Infants are either parked on branches while their parents find food or else are carried by one of the parents 90 Due to their long gestations about six months small litter sizes low birth weights long weaning times three to six months 106 and long gaps between births slow loris populations have one of the slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size 107 Pygmy slow lorises are likely to give birth to twins from 50 to 100 of births depending on the study in contrast this phenomenon is rare 3 occurrence in Bengal slow lorises A seven year study of captive bred pygmy slow lorises showed a skewed sex distribution with 1 68 males born for every 1 female 49 ",
