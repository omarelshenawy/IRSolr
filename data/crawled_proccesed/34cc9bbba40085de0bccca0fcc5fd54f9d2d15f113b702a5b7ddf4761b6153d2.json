			"after": " The main deck cargo volume of the Beluga is greater than that of the C 5 Galaxy or the Antonov An 124 but still smaller than Antonov An 225 However it is restricted by cargo weight capacity of 47 tonnes compared to 122 5 tonnes for the C 5 Galaxy and 150 tonnes for the An 124 4 Despite this width the Beluga cannot carry most fuselage parts of the A380 which are normally transported by ship and road The Beluga has been used to transport a few A380 components 5 ",
