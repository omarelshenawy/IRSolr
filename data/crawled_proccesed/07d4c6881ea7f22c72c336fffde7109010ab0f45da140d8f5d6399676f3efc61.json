			"previous": " Blackrock was filmed over a period of two weeks with a cast and crew of about 70 A call for extras received an enthusiastic response by many teenagers in the Newcastle area Filming locations included Stockton Maroubra Beach Caves Beach and NESCA House 3 Notable Stockton landmarks seen in the film include the Stockton Ferry 16 and Stockton Bridge 3 ",
			"after": " The community of Stockton opposed filming in the area as memories of Leigh s murder were still fresh and the details of the script were too close for comfort 10 When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996 18 locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available The local media treated them with hostility 10 Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production saying I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else 3 Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so 18 3 The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers denial that the film was specifically about Leigh despite their choice of Stockton for filming 19 During production in September 1996 Elfick told The Newcastle Herald that he was getting a bit bored of people mentioning Leigh s murder While acknowledging that the comments were understandable Elfick concluded Unfortunately that event happens all over Australia We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders He was also quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald as saying The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing 4 Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive way of looking at the circumstances that led to Leigh s death 3 and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future 20 Leigh s family were vehemently opposed to the film saying that the filmmakers were feasting on an unfortunate situation 10 insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death and portraying her negatively while doing so 18 One of Leigh s aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month saying David Elfick doesn t seem to mind free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault rape and murder of a fourteen year old virgin not as he called it the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia 21 Enright said that while Leigh s murder served as the inspiration the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another 3 ",
