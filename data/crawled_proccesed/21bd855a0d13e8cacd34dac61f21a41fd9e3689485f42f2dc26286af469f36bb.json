			"previous": " As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought 65 66 Godwin was according to Peter Kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work 43 while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke 67 ",
			"after": " Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism He argued in Political Justice 1793 66 68 that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power Rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution 66 69 ",
