			"previous": " Over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing 193 Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew stern trawlers purse seiners long line factory vessels and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks processing and freezing great quantities of fish The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines other seines trawls dredges gillnets and long lines The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty 196 ",
			"after": " As well as the wild stock about 79 million metric tons 87 million tons of food and non food products were produced by sea farming in 2010 an all time high About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured some for use in seeding wild populations The animals raised included finfish aquatic reptiles crustaceans molluscs sea cucumbers sea urchins sea squirts and jellyfish 197 Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally 198 in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful multi species techniques can used to e g feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon Various methods are employed Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas cages can be used in more sheltered waters or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea 199 Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae oysters and mussels Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed 200 Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine 201 At least 145 species of seaweed red green and brown algae are eaten worldwide some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries there is great potential for additional algaculture 202 Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire which is eaten both raw and cooked 203 A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease In the 1990s disease wiped out China s farmed Farrer s scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species 204 Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia 205 ",
