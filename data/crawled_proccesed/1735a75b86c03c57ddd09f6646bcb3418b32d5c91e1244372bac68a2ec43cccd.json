			"after": " The beginning to the race highlighted the dominance of the Kenyan and Ethiopian runners as they set a high tempo from the outset By the time the first 5 km marker was passed Australia s Nikki Chapple was the only athlete left in the leading pack to come from outside of the two historically strong nations A few kilometres later she dropped back from the pack and at the 10 km mark five Ethiopians and four Kenyans had a fifteen second advantage on the rest of the field As the race reached the midway point the temperature began to increase and the heat and humidity reduced the pace of the runners The conditions took their toll on some of the leaders in this section of the race Chepchirchir slowed considerably while Meseret Mengistu Joyce Chepkirui and Fate Tola were the next to gradually lose contact with the front runners Kiplagat Dire Arusei and Feyse Tadese were the sole contenders remaining as the race headed towards the final stages but Kiplagat and Dire soon left the other two trailing a few minutes later ",
