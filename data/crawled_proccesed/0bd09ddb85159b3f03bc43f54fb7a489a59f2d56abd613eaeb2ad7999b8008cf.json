			"previous": " The aldol reaction is an important carbon carbon bond formation reaction in organic chemistry In its usual form it involves the nucleophilic addition of a ketone enolate to an aldehyde to form a hydroxy ketone or aldol aldehyde alcohol a structural unit found in many naturally occurring molecules and pharmaceuticals ",
			"after": " Sometimes the aldol addition product loses a molecule of water during the reaction to form an unsaturated ketone This is called an aldol condensation The aldol reaction was discovered independently by Charles Adolphe Wurtz and by Alexander Porfyrevich Borodin in 1872 Borodin observed the aldol dimerization of 3 hydroxybutanal from acetaldehyde under acidic conditions The aldol reaction is used widely in the large scale production of commodity chemicals such as pentaerythritol and in the pharmaceutical industry for the synthesis of optically pure drugs For example Pfizer s initial route to the heart disease drug Lipitor INN atorvastatin approved in 1996 employed two aldol reactions allowing access to multigram scale quantities of the drug ",
