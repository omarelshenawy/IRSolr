			"after": " Diffusion of innovations is a theory that seeks to explain how why and at what rate new ideas and technology spread through cultures Everett Rogers a professor of communication studies popularized the theory in his book Diffusion of Innovations the book was first published in 1962 and is now in its fifth edition 2003 1 Rogers argues that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the participants in a social system The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines Rogers proposes that four main elements influence the spread of a new idea the innovation itself communication channels time and a social system This process relies heavily on human capital The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self sustain Within the rate of adoption there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass The categories of adopters are innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards 2 Diffusion manifests itself in different ways in various cultures and fields and is highly subject to the type of adopters and innovation decision process ",
