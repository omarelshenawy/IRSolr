			"previous": " In 1960 Democrat Frank Church a U S Senator from Idaho first introduced legislation for a feasibility study to survey the area for national park status 10 11 While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on Church admitted that it was not designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a national recreation area managed by the Forest Service In April 1966 Church introduced two bills one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the Sawtooth National Recreation Area SNRA The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B Jordan another Senator from Idaho because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging hunting and grazing The legislation was not supported by Idaho s members of the U S House of Representatives 10 ",
			"after": " In 1968 the American Smelting and Refining Company ASARCO discovered a molybdenum deposit at the base of Castle Peak the highest peak in the White Cloud Mountains ASARCO filed paperwork with the Forest Service to construct roads and to allow for an open pit mine below Castle Peak to extract the ore The proposed mine would have been 350 ft 110 m deep 700 ft 210 m wide and 7 000 ft 2 100 m long About 20 000 short tons 18 000 t of material would be processed daily with 99 5 percent being deposited in waste piles and settling ponds ASARCO estimated that the mine would create 350 jobs and 1 million 6 78 million today 12 in taxes per year while the roads would open up opportunities for further exploration The Forest Service would not be able to stop mining and protect the White Cloud Mountains because the General Mining Act of 1872 gave mining rights to anyone who had located a lode or placer 11 Nationally opposition to the mine mounted while in 1970 Republican Idaho Governor Don Samuelson voiced support for the mine saying that ASARCO was not going to tear down mountains They are only going to dig a hole He also characterized Castle Peak as nothing but sagebrush on one side and scraggly trees on the other 10 Samuelson lost reelection in 1970 to Cecil D Andrus a Democrat and supporter of preserving the forest who later 1977 81 served as U S interior secretary in the Carter Administration 10 ",
