			"previous": " In Virginia state legislators school board members and other public officials mounted a campaign of obstructionism and outright defiance to integration called Massive Resistance It entailed a series of actions to deny state funding to integrated schools and instead fund privately run segregation academies for white students Farmville Virginia in Prince Edward County was one of the plaintiff African American communities involved in the 1954 Brown v Board of Education Supreme Court decision As a last ditch effort to avoid court ordered desegregation officials in the county shut down the county s entire public school system in 1959 and it remained closed for five years 116 White students were able to attend private schools established by the community for the sole purpose of circumventing integration The largely black rural population of the county had little recourse Some families were split up as parents sent their children to live with relatives in other locales to attend public school but the majority of Prince Edward s more than 2 000 black children as well as many poor whites simply remained unschooled until federal court action forced the schools to reopen five years later ",
