			"previous": " Studies by Nathaniel Kleitman in 1938 and by Derk Jan Dijk and Charles Czeisler in the 1990s put human subjects on enforced 28 hour sleep wake cycles in constant dim light and with other time cues suppressed for over a month Because normal people cannot entrain to a 28 hour day in dim light if at all citation needed this is referred to as a forced desynchrony protocol Sleep and wake episodes are uncoupled from the endogenous circadian period of about 24 18 hours and researchers are allowed to assess the effects of circadian phase on aspects of sleep and wakefulness including sleep latency and other functions page needed 53 ",
			"after": " Timing of medical treatment in coordination with the body clock may significantly increase efficacy and reduce drug toxicity or adverse reactions 54  A number of studies have concluded that a short period of sleep during the day a power nap does not have any measurable effect on normal circadian rhythms but can decrease stress and improve productivity medical citation needed ",
