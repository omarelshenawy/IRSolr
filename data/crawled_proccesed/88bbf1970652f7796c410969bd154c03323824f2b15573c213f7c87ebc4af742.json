			"previous": " Colts are assessed in their two year old year by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions any animal failing the assessment must be gelded Once approved every spring usually in March the stallions must pass the Verderers assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed 42 The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the ponies running out on the New Forest and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest run ponies the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project which will use hardy Forest run mares mostly over eleven years old bred to stallions that have not been run out on the Forest or closely related to those that have 44 ",
			"after": " Drifts to gather the animals are carried out in autumn Most colts and some fillies are removed along with any animals considered too poor to remain on the Forest over the winter The remaining fillies are branded with their owner s mark and many animals are wormed 45 46 Many owners choose to remove a number of animals from the Forest for the winter turning them out again the following spring 47 Animals surplus to their owner s requirements often are sold at the Beaulieu Road Pony Sales run by the New Forest Livestock Society 48 Tail hair of the ponies is trimmed and cut into a recognisable pattern to show that the pony s grazing fees have been paid for the year Each Agister has his own tail mark indicating the area of the Forest where the owner lives 49 The Agisters keep a constant watch over the condition of the Forest running stock and an animal may be ordered off the Forest at any time 38 The rest of the year the lives of the ponies are relatively unhindered unless they need veterinary attention or additional feeding when they are usually taken off the Forest 50 ",
