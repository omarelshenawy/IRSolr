			"previous": " The plan assumes between two weeks and 20 days notice of an eruption and foresees the emergency evacuation of 600 000 people almost entirely comprising all those living in the zona rossa red zone i e at greatest risk from pyroclastic flows 4 61 The evacuation by trains ferries cars and buses is planned to take about seven days and the evacuees will mostly be sent to other parts of the country rather than to safe areas in the local Campania region and may have to stay away for several months However the dilemma that would face those implementing the plan is when to start this massive evacuation since if it is left too late then thousands could be killed while if it is started too early then the precursors of the eruption may turn out to have been a false alarm In 1984 40 000 people were evacuated from the Campi Flegrei area another volcanic complex near Naples but no eruption occurred 61 ",
			"after": " Ongoing efforts are being made by the government at various levels especially of Regione Campania to reduce the population living in the red zone by demolishing illegally constructed buildings establishing a national park around the upper flanks of the volcano to prevent the erection of further buildings 61 and by offering financial incentives to people for moving away 62 One of the underlying goals is to reduce the time needed to evacuate the area over the next 20 or 30 years to two or three days 63 ",
