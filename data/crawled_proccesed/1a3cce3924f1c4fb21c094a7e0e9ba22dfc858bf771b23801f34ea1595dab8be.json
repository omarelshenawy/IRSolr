			"previous": " In the east Islamic art s rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns calligraphy and architecture Further east religion dominated artistic styles and forms too India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines China saw the flourishing of many art forms jade carving bronzework pottery including the stunning terracotta army of Emperor Qin poetry calligraphy music painting drama fiction etc Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty So for example Tang Dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse emphasizing idealized landscapes but Ming Dynasty paintings are busy and colorful and focus on telling stories via setting and composition Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century ",
			"after": " The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post monarchist world such as Blake s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer or David s propagandistic paintings This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans exemplified in the novels of Goethe The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements such as academic art Symbolism impressionism and fauvism among others ",
