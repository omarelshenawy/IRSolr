			"after": " The skull of Tarbosaurus was completely described for the first time in 2003 Scientists noted key differences between Tarbosaurus and the North American tyrannosaurids Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite When the upper jaw bit down on an object force was transmitted up through the maxilla the primary tooth bearing bone of the upper jaw into surrounding skull bones In North American tyrannosaurids this force went from the maxilla into the fused nasal bones on top of the snout which were firmly connected in the rear to the lacrimal bones by bony struts These struts locked the two bones together suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals 5 ",
