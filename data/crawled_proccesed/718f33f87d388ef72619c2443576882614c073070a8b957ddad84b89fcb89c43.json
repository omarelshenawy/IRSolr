			"previous": " A particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy which began among the Babylonians who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations 15 The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros 16 ",
			"after": " Following the Babylonians significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational physical explanation for celestial phenomena 17 In the 3rd century BC Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun and was the first to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system 18 In the 2nd century BC Hipparchus discovered precession calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe 19 Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy 20 The Antikythera mechanism c 150 80 BC was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun Moon and planets for a given date Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe 21 ",
