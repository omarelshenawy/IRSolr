			"after": " Limbert wrote I had made two trips into the northern end covering practically the same region as that traversed by a Geological Survey party in 1901 My first was a hiking and camping trip with Ad Santel the wrestler Dr Dresser and Albert Jones the second was with Wes Watson and Era Martin ranchers living about four miles 6 km from the northern edge The peculiar features seen on those trips led me to take a third across the region in the hope that even more interesting phenomena might be encountered 22 ",
