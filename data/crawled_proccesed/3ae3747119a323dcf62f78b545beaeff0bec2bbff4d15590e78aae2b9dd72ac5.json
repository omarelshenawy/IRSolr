			"previous": " As mentioned above Heath s government oversaw two years of a steep rise in unemployment which they later successfully reversed His Labour predecessor as prime minister Harold Wilson had inherited an unemployment count of around 400 000 at the time of his general election win of October 1964 but seen unemployment peak at 631 000 during the spring of 1967 though it had fallen to 582 000 by the time Heath seized power in June 1970 Like Wilson and Labour Heath and the Tories were pledged to full employment but within a year it became clear that they were losing that battle as the official unemployment count crept towards 1 000 000 and some newspapers suggested that it was even higher In January 1972 it was officially confirmed that unemployment had risen above 1 000 000 a level not seen for more than 30 years 29 Various other reports around this time suggested that unemployment was higher still with The Times newspaper claiming that nearly 3 000 000 people were jobless by March of that year 30 ",
