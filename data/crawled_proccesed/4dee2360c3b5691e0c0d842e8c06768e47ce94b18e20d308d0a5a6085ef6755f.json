			"after": " This type of engine has cylinders lined up in one row It typically has an even number of cylinders but there are instances of three and five cylinder engines The greatest advantage of an inline engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimise drag If the engine crankshaft is located above the cylinders it is called an inverted inline engine this allows the propeller to be mounted high up to increase ground clearance enabling shorter landing gear The disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power to weight ratio because the crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy An in line engine may be either air cooled or liquid cooled but liquid cooling is more common because it is difficult to get enough air flow to cool the rear cylinders directly Inline engines were common in early aircraft one was used in the Wright Flyer the aircraft that made the first controlled powered flight However the inherent disadvantages of the design soon became apparent and the inline design was abandoned becoming a rarity in modern aviation ",
