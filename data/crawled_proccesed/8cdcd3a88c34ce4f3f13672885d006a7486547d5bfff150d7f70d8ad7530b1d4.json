			"previous": " The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth the atmosphere the biosphere and the lithosphere The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis which is responsible for modern Earth s atmosphere Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere In the present equilibrium production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1 2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year ",
			"after": " Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world s water bodies The increased solubility of O 2 at lower temperatures see Physical properties has important implications for ocean life as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content 43 Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of O 2 in eutrophic water bodies Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water s biochemical oxygen demand or the amount of O 2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration 44 ",
