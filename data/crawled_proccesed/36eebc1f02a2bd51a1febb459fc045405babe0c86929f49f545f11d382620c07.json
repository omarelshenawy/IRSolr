			"previous": " Tandem rotors are two horizontal main rotor assemblies mounted one behind the other Tandem rotors achieve pitch attitude changes to accelerate and decelerate the helicopter through a process called differential collective pitch To pitch forward and accelerate the rear rotor increases collective pitch raising the tail and the front rotor decreases collective pitch simultaneously dipping the nose To pitch upward while decelerating or moving rearward the front rotor increases collective pitch to raise the nose and the rear rotor decreases collective pitch to lower the tail Yaw control develops through opposing cyclic pitch in each rotor To pivot right the front rotor tilts right and the rear rotor tilts left To pivot left the front rotor tilts left and the rear rotor tilts right All rotor power contributes to lift and it is simpler to handle changes in the center of gravity fore aft However it requires the expense of two large rotors rather than the more common one large main rotor and a much smaller tail rotor The Boeing CH 47 Chinook is the most common tandem rotor helicopter ",
			"after": " Coaxial rotors are a pair of rotors mounted one above the other on the same shaft and turning in opposite directions The advantage of the coaxial rotor is that in forward flight the lift provided by the advancing halves of each rotor compensates for the retreating half of the other eliminating one of the key effects of dissymmetry of lift retreating blade stall However other design considerations plague coaxial rotors There is an increased mechanical complexity of the rotor system because it requires linkages and swashplates for two rotor systems Also because the rotors must rotate in opposite directions the mast is more complex and control linkages for pitch changes to the upper rotor system must pass through the lower rotor system ",
