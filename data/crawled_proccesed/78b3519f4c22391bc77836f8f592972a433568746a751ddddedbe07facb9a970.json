			"previous": " By mid 1942 the Allies began to regroup and while some Allied aircraft such as the Brewster Buffalo and the P 39 were hopelessly outclassed by fighters like Japan s Zero others such as the Army s P 40 and the Navy s Wildcat possessed attributes such as superior firepower ruggedness and dive speed and the Allies soon developed tactics such as the Thach weave to take advantage of these strengths These changes soon paid dividends as the Allied ability to deny Japan air superiority was critical to their victories at Coral Sea Midway Guadalcanal and New Guinea In China the Flying Tigers also used the same tactics with some success although they were unable to stem the tide of Japanese advances there ",
			"after": " By 1943 the Allies began to gain the upper hand in the Pacific Campaign s air campaigns Several factors contributed to this shift First second generation Allied fighters such as the Hellcat and the P 38 and later the Corsair the P 47 and the P 51 began arriving in numbers These fighters outperformed Japanese fighters in all respects except maneuverability Other problems with Japan s fighter aircraft also became apparent as the war progressed such as their lack of armor and light armament which made them inadequate as bomber interceptors or ground attack planes roles Allied fighters excelled at Most importantly Japan s training program failed to provide enough well trained pilots to replace losses In contrast the Allies improved both the quantity and quality of pilots graduating from their training programs ",
