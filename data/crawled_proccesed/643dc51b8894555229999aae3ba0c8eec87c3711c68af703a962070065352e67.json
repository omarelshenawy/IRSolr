			"previous": " The design team also chose to use externally blown flaps to increase lift This system uses double slotted flaps to direct part of the jet exhaust downwards while the rest of the exhaust passed through the flap and then followed the downward curve due to the Coand effect Although the effects had been studied for some time at NASA along with similar concepts until the introduction of the turbofan the hot and concentrated exhaust of existing engines made the system difficult to use By the time of the AMST project engines had changed dramatically and now provided larger volumes of less concentrated and much cooler air For the YC 15 four engines were used versions of the Pratt Whitney JT8D 17 widely used on the Boeing 727 and Douglas DC 9 The YC 15 borrowed components from other McDonnell Douglas aircraft with its nose gear coming from the Douglas DC 8 and the nose section cockpit being derived from the Douglas DC 10 3 4 Parts borrowed from other aircraft included the Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation UARRSI taken from a Fairchild A 10 anti tipover stabilizer struts from the Lockheed C 141 Starlifter pumps taken from the McDonnell Douglas F 15 Eagle Lockheed C 5 Galaxy DC 9 and C 141 and actuators taken from the C 5 Galaxy and DC 10 In addition the environmental cooling system was composed of components taken from the DC 9 C 141 and Boeing KC 135 5 ",
