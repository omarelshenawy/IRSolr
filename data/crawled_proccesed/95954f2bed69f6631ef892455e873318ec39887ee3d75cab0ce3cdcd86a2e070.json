			"previous": " The DB 1 design was essentially that of the DC 2 with several modifications The wingspan was 4 5 ft 1 4 m greater The fuselage was deeper to better accommodate bombs and the six member crew the wings were fixed in the middle of the cross section rather than to the bottom but this was due to the deeper fuselage Added armament included nose dorsal and ventral gun turrets ",
			"after": " The initial contract called for 133 B 18s including DB 1 using Wright R 1820 radial engines The last B 18 of the run designated DB 2 by the company had a power operated nose turret This design did not become standard Additional contracts in 1937 177 aircraft and 1938 40 aircraft were for the B 18A which had the bombardier s position further forward over the nose gunner s station The B 18A also used more powerful engines ",
