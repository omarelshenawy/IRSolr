			"after": " Since the re establishment of independence the monument has become a focal point for a variety of events One of these on March 16 the commemoration day of veterans of the Latvian Legion of the Waffen SS who fought the Soviet Union during World War II has caused controversy 24 The date was first celebrated by Latvians in exile before being brought to Latvia in 1990 and for a short time 1998 2000 was the official remembrance day 24 25 In 1998 the event drew the attention of the foreign mass media and in the following year the Russian government condemned the event as a glorification of Nazism 24 The event evolved into a political conflict between Latvians and Russians posing a threat to public safety 13 26 ",
