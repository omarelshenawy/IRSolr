			"after": " The Lunar Module LM was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module Not designed to fly through the Earth s atmosphere or return to Earth its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages each with its own engine The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant surface stay consumables and surface exploration equipment The ascent stage contained the crew cabin ascent propellant and a reaction control system The initial LM model weighed approximately 33 300 pounds 15 100 kg and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours An Extended Lunar Module weighed over 36 200 pounds 16 400 kg and allowed surface stays of over 3 days 37 ",
