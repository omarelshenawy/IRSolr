			"previous": " In 1919 the frustrations caused by delays to Irish home rule led members of Sinn F in a pro independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats at Westminster in the 1918 British general election to establish an Irish assembly in Dublin at which Irish independence was declared The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration 141 The Anglo Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo Irish Treaty creating the Irish Free State a Dominion within the British Empire with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown 142 Northern Ireland consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom 143 ",
			"after": " A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence 144 Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts This led to tension 145 particularly in the Punjab region where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy and those who viewed it with revulsion 145 The subsequent Non Co Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years 146 ",
