			"previous": " Baden Powell was the garrison commander during the subsequent Siege of Mafeking which lasted 217 days Although Baden Powell could have destroyed his stores and had sufficient forces to break out throughout much of the siege especially since the Boers lacked adequate artillery to shell the town or its forces he remained in the town to the point of his intended mounted soldiers eating their horses The garrison held out until relieved in part thanks to cunning deceptions devised by Baden Powell Fake minefields were planted and his soldiers pretended to avoid non existent barbed wire while moving between trenches 18 Baden Powell did most of the reconnaissance work himself 19 In one instance noting that the Boers had not removed the rail line Baden Powell loaded an armoured locomotive with sharpshooters and successfully sent it down the rails into the heart of the Boer encampment and back again in a strategic attempt to decapitate the Boer leadership ",
			"after": " Contrary views of Baden Powell s actions during the siege argue that his success in resisting the Boers was secured at the expense of the lives of the native African soldiers and civilians including members of his own African garrison Pakenham stated that Baden Powell drastically reduced the rations to the native garrison 20 However in 2001 after subsequent research Pakenham decidedly retreated from this position 9 21 ",
