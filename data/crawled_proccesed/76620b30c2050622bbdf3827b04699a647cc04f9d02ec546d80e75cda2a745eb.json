			"after": " The Iron Age involved the adoption of iron smelting technology It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents In many Eurasian cultures the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language though again this was not universally the case It was not possible to mass manufacture steel because high furnace temperatures were needed but steel could be produced by forging bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a controllable way Iron ores were much more widespread than either copper or tin In Europe large hill forts were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements In some cases existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased providing more farmland to support the growing population ",
