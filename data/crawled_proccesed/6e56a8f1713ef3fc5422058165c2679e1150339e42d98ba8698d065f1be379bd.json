			"after": " In 2006 the Bornean slow loris was elevated to the species level as Nycticebus menagensis based on molecular analysis of DNA sequences of the D loop and the cytochrome b gene 42 In 2008 Groves and Ibnu Maryanto confirmed the promotion of the fifth species the Javan slow loris to species status a move that had been suggested in previous studies from 2000 They based their decision on an analysis of cranial morphology and characteristics of pelage 43 Species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology such as size fur color and head markings 44 ",
