			"previous": " Some of the sea otter s preferred prey species particularly abalone clams and crabs are also food sources for humans In some areas massive declines in shellfish harvests have been blamed on the sea otter and intense public debate has taken place over how to manage the competition between sea otters and humans for seafood 162 ",
			"after": " The debate is complicated because sea otters have sometimes been held responsible for declines of shellfish stocks that were more likely caused by overfishing disease pollution and seismic activity 53 163 Shellfish declines have also occurred in many parts of the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of shellfish on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade s near extirpation of the sea otter 163 Although many factors affect shellfish stocks sea otter predation can deplete a fishery to the point where it is no longer commercially viable 162 Scientists agree that sea otters and abalone fisheries cannot exist in the same area 162 and the same is likely true for certain other types of shellfish as well 111 ",
