			"previous": " For example the graphs shown to the right show the error in approximating log x and exp x for N 4 The red curves for the optimal polynomial are level that is they oscillate between and exactly Note that in each case the number of extrema is N 2 that is 6 Two of the extrema are at the end points of the interval at the left and right edges of the graphs ",
			"after": " To prove this is true in general suppose P is a polynomial of degree N having the property described that is it gives rise to an error function that has N 2 extrema of alternating signs and equal magnitudes The red graph to the right shows what this error function might look like for N 4 Suppose Q x whose error function is shown in blue to the right is another N degree polynomial that is a better approximation to f than P In particular Q is closer to f than P for each value xi where an extreme of P f occurs so",
