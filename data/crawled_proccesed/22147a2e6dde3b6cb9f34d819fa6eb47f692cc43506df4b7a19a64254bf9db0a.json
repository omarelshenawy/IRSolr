			"previous": " It has been claimed that IUCN put the needs of nature above those of humans disregarding economic considerations and the interests of indigenous peoples and other traditional users of the land Until the 1980s IUCN favored the Yellowstone Model of conservation which called for the removal of humans from protected areas The expulsion of the Maasai people from Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is perhaps the best known example of this approach 2 6 ",
			"after": " This is linked to another criticism that has been directed at IUCN namely that throughout its history it has mainly been Northern focused i e had a West European or North American perspective on global conservation Some critics point to the fact that many individuals involved in the establishment of IUCN had been leading figures in the British Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of Empire which wanted to protect species against the impact of native hunting pressure in order to safeguard hunting by Europeans 29 The fact that at least until the 1990s most of IUCN staff the chairs of the Commissions and the IUCN President came from western countries has also led to criticism 10 Over the past decade IUCN has changed its approach It now aims to work in close cooperation with indigenous groups It has also become more regionalized in its operations and more truly global in its staffing 10 ",
