			"after": " Modern artillery is most obviously distinguished by its long range firing an explosive shell or rocket and a mobile carriage for firing and transport However its most important characteristic is the use of indirect fire whereby the firing equipment is aimed without seeing the target through its sights Indirect fire emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and was greatly enhanced by the development of predicted fire methods in World War I However indirect fire was area fire it was and is not suitable for destroying point targets its primary purpose is area suppression Nevertheless by the late 1970s precision munitions started to appear notably the US 155mm Copperhead and its Soviet 152mm equivalent that had success in Indian service These relied on laser designation to illuminate the target that the shell homed onto However in the early 21st Century the Global Positioning System GPS enabled relatively cheap and accurate guidance for shells and missiles notably the US 155mm Excalibur and the 227mm GMLRS rocket The introduction of these led to a new issue the need for very accurate three dimensional target coordinates the mensuration process ",
