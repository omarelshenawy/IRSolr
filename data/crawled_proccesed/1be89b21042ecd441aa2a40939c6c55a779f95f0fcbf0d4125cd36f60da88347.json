			"previous": " Locke dedicates the bulk of Some Thoughts Concerning Education to explaining how to instill virtue in children He defines virtue as a combination of self denial and rationality that a man is able to deny himself his own desires cross his own inclinations and purely follow what reason directs as best though the appetite lean the other way Locke s emphasis 25 Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self denial but also to see the rational path Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings Moreover he argues that parents should above all attempt to create a habit of thinking rationally in their children 26 Locke continually emphasises habit over rule children should internalise the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke s concerns in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding Throughout the Essay Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability because of the authority of custom to change or forfeit long held beliefs 27 His attempt to solve this problem is not only to treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments 28 For Locke rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists such sensations arouse passions rather than reason 29 He argues that such a sort of slavish discipline makes a slavish temper Locke s emphasis 30 ",
			"after": " What is important to understand is what exactly Locke means when he advises parents to treat their children as reasoning beings Locke first highlights that children love to be treated as Rational Creatures thus parents should treat them as such Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are motivated only by rewards and punishments to achieve that goal 31 ",
