			"previous": " Cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the secreted products of those cells e g shells hairs and nails etc All cells arise from other cells through cell division In multicellular organisms every cell in the organism s body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes 19 In addition the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as metabolism Finally cells contain hereditary information DNA which is passed from cell to cell during cell division ",
			"after": " A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution and that all life forms known have a common origin The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth both living and extinct have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about 3 5 billion years ago 20 Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria archaea and eukaryotes see origin of life 21 ",
