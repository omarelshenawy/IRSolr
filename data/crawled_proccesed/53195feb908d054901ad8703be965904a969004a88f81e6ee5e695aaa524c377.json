			"after": " The bobcat resembles other species of the Lynx genus but is on average the smallest of the four Its coat is variable though generally tan to grayish brown with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail Its spotted patterning acts as camouflage The ears are black tipped and pointed with short black tufts There is generally an off white color on the lips chin and underparts Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest colored coats while those in the northern forested regions are darkest Kittens are born well furred and already have their spots 11 A few melanistic bobcats have been sighted and captured in Florida They appear black but may still exhibit a spot pattern 12 ",
