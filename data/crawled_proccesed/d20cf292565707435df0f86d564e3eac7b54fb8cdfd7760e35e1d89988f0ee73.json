			"previous": " The calculation of the overall 3x3 grid slope S and aspect A for methods that determine east west and north south component use the following formulas respectively  The elevation at a point or unit of terrain will have perpendicular tangents slope passing through the point in an east west and north south direction These two tangents give two components z x and z y which then be used to determine the overall direction of slope and the aspect of the slope The gradient is defined as a vector quantity with components equal to the partial derivatives of the surface in the x and y directions 26 ",
