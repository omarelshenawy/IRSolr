			"previous": " As the 1970s began the New Left faded away 69 and many movements arose in its wake among them the feminist men s liberation spiritual human potential ecology appropriate technology intentional community and holistic health movements 70 71 After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972 11 Satin immersed himself in all these movements either directly 72 or as a reporter for Canada s underground press 6 He also took up residence in a free love commune 15 One fierce winter s day he says it dawned on me that the ideas and energies from the various fringe movements were beginning to generate a coherent new politics But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics instead of merely bits and pieces of it 73 Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions 73 He wrote designed typeset and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself in 1976 74 A 240 page edition was published by Vancouver s Whitecap Books in 1978 75 and a 349 page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979 It is now widely regarded as the first 76 most ambitious 77 or most adequate 78 attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post socialist politics arising in the wake of the New Left Some academics say it offers a new ideology 3 79 ",
			"after": " At the heart of New Age Politics is a critique of the consciousness we all supposedly share a six sided prison that has kept us all trapped for hundreds of years The six sides of the prison are said to be patriarchal attitudes egocentricity scientific single vision the bureaucratic mentality nationalism xenophobia and the big city outlook fear of nature Since consciousness according to Satin ultimately determines our institutions prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for monolithic institutions that offer us little in the way of freedom of choice or connection with others Some representative monolithic institutions are bureaucratic government automobile centered transportation systems attorney centered law doctor centered health care and church centered spirituality 81 ",
