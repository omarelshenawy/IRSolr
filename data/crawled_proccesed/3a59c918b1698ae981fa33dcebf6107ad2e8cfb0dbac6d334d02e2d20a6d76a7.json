			"after": " The Andean condor is considered near threatened by the IUCN 1 It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970 54 a status which is assigned to an animal that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range 55 Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution 56 It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years 57 Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution 32 most of which stems from the fact that it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock 47 Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception 58 Reintroduction programs using captive bred Andean condors which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations 58 have been introduced in Argentina Venezuela and Colombia The first captive bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989 59 When raising condors human contact is minimal chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans 60 The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in 60 Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive 27 ",
