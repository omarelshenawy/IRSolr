			"previous": " Print media is not widely read in Sierra Leone especially outside Freetown and other major cities partially due to the low levels of literacy in the country 177 In 2007 there were 15 daily newspapers in the country as well as those published weekly 178 Among newspaper readership young people are likely to read newspapers weekly and older people daily The majority of newspapers are privately run and are often critical of the government The standard of print journalism tends to be low due to lack of training and people trust the information published in newspapers less than that found on the radio 177 ",
			"after": " Radio is the most popular and most trusted media in Sierra Leone with 85 of people having access to a radio and 72 of people in the country listening to the radio daily 177 These levels do vary between areas of the country with the Western Area having the highest levels and Kailahun the lowest Stations mainly consist of local commercial stations with a limited broadcast range combined with a few stations with national coverage Capital Radio Sierra Leone being the largest of the commercial stations ",
