			"previous": " Modern social anthropology was founded in Britain at the London School of Economics and Political Science following World War I Influences include both the methodological revolution pioneered by Bronis aw Malinowski s process oriented fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands of Melanesia between 1915 and 1918 17 and Alfred Radcliffe Brown s theoretical program for systematic comparison that was based on a conception of rigorous fieldwork and the structure functionalist conception of Durkheim s sociology 18 19 Other intellectual founders include W H R Rivers and A C Haddon whose orientation reflected the contemporary Parapsychologies of Wilhelm Wundt and Adolf Bastian and Sir E B Tylor who defined anthropology as a positivist science following Auguste Comte Edmund Leach 1962 defined social anthropology as a kind of comparative micro sociology based on intensive fieldwork studies Scholars have not settled a theoretical orthodoxy on the nature of science and society and their tensions reflect views which are seriously opposed ",
			"after": " A R Radcliffe Brown also published a seminal work in 1922 He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the Andaman Islands in the old style of historical reconstruction However after reading the work of French sociologists mile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss Radcliffe Brown published an account of his research entitled simply The Andaman Islanders that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths Over time he developed an approach known as structural functionalism which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously This contrasted with Malinowski s functionalism and was quite different from the later French structuralism which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism ",
