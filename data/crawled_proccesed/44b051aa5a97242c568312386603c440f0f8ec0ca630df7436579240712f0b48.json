			"previous": " With a population of over 1 3 billion and dwindling natural resources the government of China is very concerned about its population growth rate and has attempted since 1979 with mixed results 366 to implement a strict family planning policy known as the one child policy Before 2013 this policy sought to restrict families to one child each with exceptions for ethnic minorities and a degree of flexibility in rural areas A major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013 allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child 367 China s family planning minister indicated in 2008 that the one child policy would be maintained until at least 2020 368 The one child policy is resisted particularly in rural areas primarily because of the need for agricultural labour and a traditional preference for boys Families who breach the policy often lie during the census 369 Data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may now be around 1 4 370 ",
			"after": " The policy along with traditional preference for boys may be contributing to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth 371 372 According to the 2010 census the sex ratio at birth was 118 06 boys for every 100 girls 373 which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls 374 The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51 27 percent of the total population 373 However China s sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953 when males accounted for 51 82 percent of the total population 373 ",
