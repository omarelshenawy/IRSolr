			"after": " The Total Force Policy was adopted by Chief of Staff of the Army General Creighton Abrams in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and involves treating the three components of the army the Regular Army the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve as a single force 18 Believing that no U S president should be able to take the United States and more specifically the U S Army to war without the support of the American people General Abrams intertwined the structure of the three components of the army in such a way as to make extended operations impossible without the involvement of both the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve 19 ",
