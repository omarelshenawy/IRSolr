			"previous": " Nevado del Ruiz which lies about 129 kilometers 80 mi west of Bogot is part of the Andes mountain range The volcano is part of the Ruiz Tolima volcanic massif or Cordillera Central a group of five ice capped volcanoes which includes the Tolima Santa Isabel Quindio and Machin volcanoes 6 7 The massif is located at the intersection of four faults some of which still are active 8 ",
			"after": " Nevado del Ruiz lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire a region that encircles the Pacific Ocean and contains some of the world s most active volcanoes It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene age volcanoes in South America 9 The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate 10 As is the case for many subduction zone volcanoes Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit producing large and sometimes devastating lahars mud and debris flows 5 ",
