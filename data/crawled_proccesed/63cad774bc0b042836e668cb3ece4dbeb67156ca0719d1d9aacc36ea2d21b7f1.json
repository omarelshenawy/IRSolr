			"previous": " In development significant attention was given to the Tornado s short field take off and landing STOL performance Germany in particular encouraged this design aspect 55 For shorter take off and landing distances the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25 degree position and deploy its full span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds 56 These features in combination with the thrust reverser equipped engines gives the Tornado excellent low speed handling and landing characteristics 57 ",
			"after": " The Tornado features a tandem seat cockpit crewed by a pilot and a navigator weapons officer both electromechanical and electro optical controls are used to fly the aircraft and manage its systems 58 An array of dials and switches are mounted on either side of a centrally placed CRT monitor controlling the navigational communications and weapons control computers 59 BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced Radar Display Information System TARDIS a 32 5 centimetre 12 8 in multi function display to replace the rear cockpit s Combined Radar and Projected Map Display the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004 60 ",
