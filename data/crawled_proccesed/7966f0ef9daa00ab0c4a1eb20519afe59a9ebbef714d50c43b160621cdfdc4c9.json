			"after": " Like its flora Madagascar s fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism Lemurs have been characterized as Madagascar s flagship mammal species by Conservation International 20 In the absence of monkeys and other competitors these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species As of 2012 there were officially 103 species and subspecies of lemur 33 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008 34 They are almost all classified as rare vulnerable or endangered At least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since man arrived on Madagascar all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species 35 A number of other mammals including the cat like fossa are endemic to Madagascar Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island of which over 60 percent including four families and 42 genera are endemic 20 The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species with over 90 percent of these being endemic 36 including one endemic family 20 The island is home to two thirds of the world s chameleon species 36 including the smallest known 37 and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons Endemic fish of Madagascar include two families 15 genera and over 100 species primarily inhabiting the island s freshwater lakes and rivers Although invertebrates remain poorly studied on Madagascar researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic as are a majority of the island s butterflies scarab beetles lacewings spiders and dragonflies 20 ",
