			"previous": " More recent works have emphasized the role of character in ethics a movement known as the aretaic turn that is the turn towards virtues One strain of this movement followed the work of Bernard Williams Williams noted that rigid forms of consequentialism and deontology demanded that people behave impartially This Williams argued requires that people abandon their personal projects and hence their personal integrity in order to be considered moral G E M Anscombe in an influential paper Modern Moral Philosophy 1958 revived virtue ethics as an alternative to what was seen as the entrenched positions of Kantianism and consequentialism Aretaic perspectives have been inspired in part by research of ancient conceptions of virtue For example Aristotle s ethics demands that people follow the Aristotelian mean or balance between two vices and Confucian ethics argues that virtue consists largely in striving for harmony with other people Virtue ethics in general has since gained many adherents and has been defended by such philosophers as Philippa Foot Alasdair MacIntyre and Rosalind Hursthouse ",
			"after": " Political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals or families and clans to communities including the state It includes questions about justice law property and the rights and obligations of the citizen Politics and ethics are traditionally inter linked subjects as both discuss the question of what is good and how people should live From ancient times and well beyond them the roots of justification for political authority were inescapably tied to outlooks on human nature In The Republic Plato presented the argument that the ideal society would be run by a council of philosopher kings since those best at philosophy are best able to realize the good Even Plato however required philosophers to make their way in the world for many years before beginning their rule at the age of fifty ",
