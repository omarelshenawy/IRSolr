			"previous": " The city acquired land for Forest Park bit by bit over several decades In 1897 Donald Macleay a Portland merchant and real estate developer deeded a 108 acre 44 ha tract of land along Balch Creek to the city to provide an outdoor space for patients from nearby hospitals 12 In the 1890s Frederick Van Voorhies Holman a Portland lawyer and a president of the Oregon Historical Society proposed a gift of 52 acres 21 ha of nearby land that was added to the city s holdings in 1939 when his siblings George F and Mary Holman completed the donation 5 Clark and Wilson Timber Company donated 17 acres 6 9 ha in 1927 to create a Western Oregon timber park near Northwest Germantown Road 13 Nine years later the estate of Aaron Meier one of the founders of the Meier Frank chain of department stores donated land for Linnton Park near Portland s Linnton neighborhood along Highway 30 14 These smaller parks became part of the larger park when it was finally created Some of them such as Macleay Park are still referred to by their original names even though they are part of Forest Park 15 ",
