			"previous": " These designs were so successful that it was many years before newer designs bettered them enough to make it worthwhile to develop There were a few exceptions generally tailored to more specific roles For instance the Handley Page Jetstream first flight in 1968 was intended for fewer passengers at much higher speeds displacing smaller designs like the Beechcraft Queen Air The Fairchild Swearingen Metro developed from the original Queen Air through a number of stages filled a similar niche ",
			"after": " By the 1970s the first generation regional airliners were starting to wear out but there had been little effort in producing new designs for this market A varied list of light transport aircraft supplanted by newer and more modern 30 seat designs by Shorts with their Shorts 330 and 360 as well as other aircraft manufacturers replaced and sometimes provided growth to established commuter markets Additional development came to the regional airline industry with the arrival of some of the earlier De Havilland Canada types such as the Dash 7 delivered in 1978 but this was tailored more to the short range and STOL Short Take Off and Landing role than as a regional airliner Feedback from the airlines was fairly consistent however and De Havilland responded with the Dash 8 in 1984 which had economic benefits over the earlier generation machines and was faster and quieter as well ",
