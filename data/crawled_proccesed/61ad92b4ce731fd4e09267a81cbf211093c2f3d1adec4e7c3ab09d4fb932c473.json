			"after": " The choice of material used to construct the runway depends on the use and the local ground conditions For a major airport where the ground conditions permit the most satisfactory type of pavement for long term minimum maintenance is concrete clarification needed Although certain airports have used reinforcement clarification needed in concrete pavements this is generally found to be unnecessary with the exception of expansion joints across the runway where a dowel assembly which permits relative movement of the concrete slabs is placed in the concrete Where it can be anticipated that major settlements of the runway will occur over the years because of unstable ground conditions it is preferable to install asphaltic concrete surface as it is easier to patch on a periodic basis For fields with very low traffic of light planes it is possible to use a sod surface Some runways also make use of salt flat runways ",
