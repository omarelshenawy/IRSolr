			"previous": " The first settlements in Fiji were started by voyaging traders and settlers from the west about 5000 years ago Lapita pottery shards have been found at numerous excavations around the country Aspects of Fijian culture are similar to the Melanesian culture of the western Pacific but have a stronger connection to the older Polynesian cultures Trade between these three nations clarification needed long before European contact is quite obvious with canoes made from native Fijian trees found in Tonga and Tongan words being part of the language of the Lau group of islands Pots made in Fiji have been found in Samoa and even the Marquesas Islands ",
