			"previous": " In the years between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation Weber took an interest in contemporary social policy In 1888 he joined the Verein f r Socialpolitik 25 a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the historical school who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues He also involved himself in politics joining the left leaning Evangelical Social Congress 26 In 1890 the Verein established a research program to examine the Polish question or Ostflucht the influx of Polish farm workers into eastern Germany as local labourers migrated to Germany s rapidly industrialising cities 4 Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report 4 25 which generated considerable attention and controversy and marked the beginning of Weber s renown as a social scientist 4 From 1893 to 1899 Weber was a member of the Alldeutscher Verband Pan German League an organization that campaigned against the influx of the Polish workers the degree of Weber s support for the Germanisation of Poles and similar nationalist policies is still debated by modern scholars 27 28 In some of his work in particular his provocative lecture on The Nation State and Economic Policy delivered in 1895 Weber criticises the immigration of Poles and blames the Junker class for perpetuating Slavic immigration to serve their selfish interests 29 ",
			"after": " Also in 1893 he married his distant cousin Marianne Schnitger later a feminist activist and author in her own right 4 30 who was instrumental in collecting and publishing Weber s journal articles as books after his death while her biography of him is an important source for understanding Weber s life 31 32 They would have no children and it is usually acknowledged that their marriage was never consummated 20 The marriage granted long awaited financial independence to Weber allowing him to finally leave his parents household 18 The couple moved to Freiburg in 1894 where Weber was appointed professor of economics at the university 23 24 before accepting the same position at the University of Heidelberg in 1896 23 24 There Weber became a central figure in the so called Weber Circle composed of other intellectuals such as his wife Marianne Georg Jellinek Ernst Troeltsch Werner Sombart Marc Bloch Robert Michels and Gy rgy Luk cs 4 Weber also remained active in the Verein and the Evangelical Social Congress 4 His research in that period was focused on economics and legal history 33 ",
