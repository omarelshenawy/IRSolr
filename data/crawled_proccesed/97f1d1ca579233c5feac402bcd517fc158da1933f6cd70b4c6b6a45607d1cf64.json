			"after": " Killer whales are apex predators meaning that they themselves have no natural predators They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea because they hunt in groups like wolf packs 109 Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish cephalopods mammals sea birds and sea turtles 110 However different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species 111 Those that feed on mammals may not even recognize fish as food This specialization in diet and hunting combined with small differences in markings suggest that they might be different species rather than populations Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations 59 ",
