			"after": " From early times these lift struts have been streamlined often by enclosing metal load bearing members in shaped casings The Farman F 190 for example had its high wings joined to the lower fuselage by parallel duralumin tubes enclosed in streamlined spruce fairings 3 and the Westland Lysander used extruded I section beams of light alloy onto which were screwed a fore and aft pair of duralumin fairings 4 Later aircraft have had streamlined struts formed directly from shaped metal like the extruded light alloy struts of the Auster AOP 9 5 or from composites for example the carbon fibre lift struts of the Remos GX eLITE 6 Designers have adopted different methods of improving the aerodynamics of the strut wing and strut body using similar approaches to those used in interplane struts Sometimes the streamlining is tapered away close to the wing as on the Farman F 190 3 other designs have an extended faired foot for example the Skyeton K 10 Swift 7 ",
