			"previous": " Constant False Alarm Rate a form of Automatic Gain Control AGC is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest The receiver s gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter it does help to distinguish strong target sources In the past radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver As radars evolved AGC became computer software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells ",
			"after": " Clutter may also originate from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection refraction e g Anomalous propagation This clutter type is especially bothersome since it appears to move and behave like other normal point targets of interest In a typical scenario an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one The radar may try to unify the targets reporting the target at an incorrect height or eliminating it on the basis of jitter or a physical impossibility Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward 26 These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar s surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation In newer air traffic control radar equipment algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent as well as calculating return improbabilities ",
