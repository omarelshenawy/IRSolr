			"after": " The largest skulls of Paraceratherium are around 1 3 metres 4 3 ft long 33 to 38 centimetres 13 to 15 in at the back of the skull and 61 centimetres 24 in wide across by the zygomatic arches Paraceratherium had a long forehead which was smooth and lacked the roughened area that serves as attachment point for the horns of other rhinoceroses The bones above the nasal region are long and the nasal incision goes far into the skull This indicates that Paraceratherium had a prehensile upper lip similar to that of the black rhinoceros and the Indian rhinoceros or a short proboscis or trunk as in tapirs The back of the skull was low and narrow without the large lambdoid crests at the top and along the sagittal crest which are otherwise found in horned and tusked animals that need strong muscles to push and fight It also had a deep pit for the attachment of nuchal ligaments which hold up the skull automatically The occipital condyle was very wide and Paraceratherium appears to have had large strong neck muscles which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches 4 One skull of P transouralicum has a domed forehead whereas others have flat foreheads possibly because of sexual dimorphism 14 A brain endocast of P transouralicum shows it was only 8 percent of the skull length while the brain of the Indian rhinoceros is 17 7 percent of its skull length 18 ",
