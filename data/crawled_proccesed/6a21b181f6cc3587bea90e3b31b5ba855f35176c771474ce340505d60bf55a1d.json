			"after": " The basic units of beaver social organization are families consisting of an adult male and adult female in a monogamous pair and their kits and yearlings 51 Beaver families can have as many as ten members in addition to the monogamous pair Groups this size or close to this size build more lodges to live in while smaller families usually need only one 51 However large families in the northern hemisphere have been recorded living in one lodge Beaver pairs mate for life however if a beaver s mate dies it will partner with another one Extra pair copulations also occur 51 In addition to being monogamous both the male and female take part in raising offspring They also both mark and defend the territory and build and repair the dam and lodge 51 When young are born they spend their first month in the lodge and their mother is the primary caretaker while their father maintains the territory In the time after they leave the lodge for the first time yearlings will help their parents build food caches in the fall and repair dams and lodges Still adults do the majority of the work and young beavers help their parents for reasons based on natural selection rather than kin selection They are dependent on them for food and for learning life skills 51 Young beavers spend most of their time playing but also copy their parents behavior However while copying behavior helps imprint life skills in young beavers it is not necessarily immediately beneficial for parents as the young beaver do not perform the tasks as well as the parents 51 ",
