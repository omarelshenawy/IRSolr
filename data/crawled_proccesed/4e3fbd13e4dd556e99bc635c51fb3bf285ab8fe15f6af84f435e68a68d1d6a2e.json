			"previous": " After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s became wary of taking on a greater role in ruling the nation They looked to the Emperor as providing a fundamental and useful source of authority essential both for governing and for national survival Pedro II s natural ability and proficiency as a ruler encouraged greater deference as time passed The political establishment perceived him as the key to the successful working of the political system someone whose reputation and authority protected him from all discussion 44 These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until by the 1880s they had almost entirely been replaced by a younger generation of politicians who had no experience of the Regency and early years of Pedro II s reign when external and internal dangers threatened the nation s existence They had only known a stable administration and prosperity 44 In sharp contrast those of the previous era the young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation 45 Pedro II s role in achieving an era of national unity stability and good government now went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites By his very success Pedro II had made himself redundant as emperor 46 ",
			"after": " The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also diminished the long term prospects for continuation of the Brazilian monarchy The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel and respected her strong character However he considered the idea of a female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil s ruler Destiny had spoken in the loss of his two male heirs and the lack after their death of any more sons 47 That view was also shared by the political establishment who continued to harbor reservations when it came to any thought of accepting a female ruler 48 Isabel s children were also discounted as heirs Pedro II had not raised them as possible successors to the throne but rather in hopes that they would become worthy citizens 49 The consensus was that a suitable successor had to be a man that is a male of the Braganza line 50 ",
