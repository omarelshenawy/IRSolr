			"after": " A pitot pi to PEE toh tube is a pressure measurement instrument used to measure fluid flow velocity The pitot tube was invented by the French engineer Henri Pitot in the early 18th century 1 and was modified to its modern form in the mid 19th century by French scientist Henry Darcy 2 It is widely used to determine the airspeed of an aircraft water speed of a boat and to measure liquid air and gas flow velocities in industrial applications The pitot tube is used to measure the local flow velocity at a given point in the flow stream and not the average flow velocity in the pipe or conduit 3 ",
