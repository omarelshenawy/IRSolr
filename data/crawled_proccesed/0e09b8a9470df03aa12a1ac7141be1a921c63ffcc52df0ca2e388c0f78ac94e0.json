			"previous": " Paraceratherium is considered the largest known land mammal that has ever existed but its exact size is unclear because of the lack of complete specimens Early estimates of 30 tonnes 66 000 lb are now considered exaggerated it may have been in the range of 15 to 20 tonnes 33 000 to 44 000 lb at maximum and as low as 11 tonnes 24 000 lb on average Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of P transouralicum because this species is known from the most complete remains 4 Estimates have been based on skull teeth and limb bone measurements but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations resulting in several weight ranges 28 29 Its total body length was estimated as 8 70 m 28 5 ft from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936 and 7 40 m 24 3 ft by Vera Gromova in 1959 but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated The weight of Paraceratherium was approached by some extinct proboscideans with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the steppe mammoth Mammuthus trogontherii 28 In spite of the roughly equivalent mass Paraceratherium was still taller than any proboscidean 4 Its shoulder height was estimated as 5 25 m 17 2 ft at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory but 4 8 m 16 ft by Gregory S Paul in 1997 30 The neck was estimated at 2 to 2 5 m 6 6 to 8 2 ft long by Michael P Taylor and Mathew J Wedel in 2013 31 The teeth of P orgosensis which that species is mainly known from are 25 percent bigger than those of P transouralicum making it the largest known indricothere 3 ",
			"after": " No complete set of vertebrae and ribs of Paraceratherium have yet been found and the tail is completely unknown The atlas and axis vertebrae of the neck are wider than in most modern rhinoceroses with space for strong ligaments and muscles that would be needed to hold up the large head The rest of the vertebrae were also very wide and had large zygapophyses with much room for muscles tendons ligaments and nerves to support the head neck and spine The neural spines were long and formed a long hump along the back where neck muscles and nuchal ligaments for holding up the skull were attached The ribs were similar to those of modern rhinoceroses but the ribcage would have looked smaller in proportion to the long legs and large bodies because modern rhinoceroses are comparatively short limbed The last vertebra of the lower back was fused to the sacrum a feature found in advanced rhinoceroses 4 Like sauropod dinosaurs Paraceratherium had pleurocoel like openings hollow parts of the bone in their pre sacral vertebrae which may have helped to lighten the skeleton 32 ",
