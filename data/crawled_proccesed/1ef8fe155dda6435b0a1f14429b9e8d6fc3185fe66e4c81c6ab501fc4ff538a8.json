			"previous": " In this scene more than any of the others Hogarth s sympathies seem to be with the lower classes and more specifically with the English Although there is disorder on the English side of the street there is an abundance of good eating and the characters are rosy cheeked and well nourished Even the street girl can eat her fill The pinch faced Huguenots on the other hand have their customs and dress treated as mercilessly as any characters in the series 17 A national enmity towards the French even French refugees may explain why the English are depicted somewhat more flatteringly here than they are by figures in the accompanying scenes Hogarth mocked continental fashions again in Marriage la mode 1743 1745 and made a more direct attack on the French in The Gate of Calais which he painted immediately upon returning to England in 1748 after he was arrested as a spy while sketching in Calais 1 ",
