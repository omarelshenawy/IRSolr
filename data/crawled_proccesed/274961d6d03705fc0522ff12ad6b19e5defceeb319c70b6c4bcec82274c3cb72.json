			"previous": " Woolly mammoth bones were used as construction material for dwellings by both Neanderthals and modern humans during the ice age More than 70 such dwellings are known mainly from the Russian Plain The bases of the huts were circular and ranged from 8 to 24 square metres 86 to 258 sq ft The arrangement of dwellings varied and ranged from 1 m 3 3 ft to 20 m 66 ft apart depending on location Large bones were used as foundations for the huts tusks for the entrances and the roofs were probably skins held in place by bones or tusks Some huts had floors that extended 40 cm 16 in below ground Some huts included fireplaces which used bones as fuel probably because wood was scarce It is possible that some of the bones used for materials came from mammoths killed by humans but the state of the bones and the fact that bones used to build a single dwelling varied by several thousands of years in age suggests that they were collected remains of long dead animals Woolly mammoth bones were also made into various tools furniture and musical instruments Large bones such as shoulder blades were also used to cover dead human bodies during burial 75 ",
			"after": " Woolly mammoth ivory was used to create art objects Several Venus figurines including the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue were made from this material Weapons made from ivory such as daggers spears and a boomerang are also known To be able to process the ivory the large tusks had to be chopped chiselled and split into smaller more manageable pieces Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened and it is unknown how this was achieved 76 ",
