			"previous": " Historically Chorioactis was considered to be in the family Sarcosomataceae 9 10 A 1983 monograph on the family included Chorioactis in the tribe Sarcosomateae along with the genera Desmazierella Sarcosoma Korfiella Plectania and Urnula a grouping of fungi characterized by having spores lacking small wartlike projections verruculae capable of absorbing blue dye 11 A 1994 study of the structural features of the asci and the ascospores concluded that Chorioactis was more closely aligned with the Sarcoscyphaceae although it conceded that the layering of the cells comprising the walls of the ascus differed considerably from the other members of the family 12 It was not until 1999 that the results of phylogenetic analysis firmly challenged the traditional classification showing C geaster to be part of a distinct lineage or clade that includes species in the genera Desmazierella Neournula and Wolfina taxa that were distributed among both families 13 This analysis was later corroborated when it was shown that the grouping of these four genera by then called the Chorioactis clade represented a sister clade to the Sarcosomataceae 14 and a new family the Chorioactidaceae was erected to contain them 15 Although C geaster shares some characteristics with the other Chorioactidaceae genera including dark colored superficial hairs on the outer surface of the fruit bodies it is distinguished from them by its tan to orange rather than black hymenia 16 ",
			"after": " The specific epithet geaster alludes to members of genus Geastrum which also open to form star shaped fruit bodies commonly called earthstars In the United States Chorioactis geaster is commonly known as the Texas star or the devil s cigar 17 Regarding the origin of the latter name American mycologist Fred Jay Seaver commented Whether the name Devil s Cigar refers to the form of the young specimens which resemble a bloated cigar in form as well as in color or to the fact that the fungus appears to smoke at maturity we cannot say At any rate the name is very appropriate 7 In 1997 Texan state Senator Chris Harris filed a bill to make C geaster the official state fungus of Texas 18 The bill passed the Senate but did not succeed in the House 19 In Japan the mushroom is called kirinomitake because the immature unopened fruit body bears a superficial resemblance to the seed pods of kiri the empress tree Paulownia tomentosa 20 ",
