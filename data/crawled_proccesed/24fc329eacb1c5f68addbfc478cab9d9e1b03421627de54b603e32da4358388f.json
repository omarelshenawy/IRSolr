			"previous": " Since CHUR defines initial ratios of continental rocks through time it was deduced that measurements of 143Nd 144Nd and 147Sm 144Nd with the use of CHUR could produce model ages for the segregation from the mantle of the melt which formed any crustal rock This has been termed t CHUR 3 In order for a TCHUR age to be calculated fractionation between Nd Sm would have to have occurred during magma extraction from the mantle to produce a continental rock This fractionation would then cause a deviation between the crustal and mantle isotopic evolution lines The intersection between these two evolution lines then indicates the crustal formation age The TCHUR age is defined by the following equation ",
			"after": " The TCHUR age of a rock can yield a formation age for the crust as a whole if the sample has not suffered disturbance after its formation Since Sm Nd are rare earth elements REE their characteristic immobility enables their ratios to resist partitioning during metamorphism and melting of silicate rocks This therefore allows for crustal formation ages to be calculated despite any metamorphism the sample has undergone ",
