			"after": " The industrial revolution led to the development of factories for large scale production with consequent changes in society 2 Originally the factories were steam powered but later transitioned to electricity once an electrical grid was developed The mechanized assembly line was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion with individual workers performing specific steps during the process This led to significant increases in efficiency lowering the cost of the end process Later automation was increasingly used to replace human operators This process has accelerated with the development of the computer and the robot ",
