			"previous": " CAD has been proven to be useful to engineers as well Using four properties which are history features parameterization and high level constraints The construction history can be used to look back into the model s personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model Parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size shape and other properties of the different modeling elements The features in the CAD system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength yield strength electrical or electro magnetic properties Also its stress strain timing or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures etc ",
