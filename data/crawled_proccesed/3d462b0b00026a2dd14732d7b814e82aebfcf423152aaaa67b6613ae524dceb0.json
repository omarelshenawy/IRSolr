			"previous": " The commercial and cultural rivalry of Genoa and Venice was played out through the 13th century The Republic of Venice played a significant role in the Fourth Crusade diverting Latin energies to the ruin of its former patron and present trading rival Constantinople As a result Venetian support of the newly established Latin Empire meant that Venetian trading rights were enforced and Venice gained control of large portion of the commerce of the eastern Mediterranean 2 The Republic of Genoa in order to regain control of the commerce allied with Michael VIII Palaiologos Emperor of Nicaea who wanted to restore the Byzantine Empire by recapturing Constantinople In March 1261 the treaty of the alliance was signed in Nymphaeum 2 On July 25 1261 Nicaean troops under Alexios Strategopoulos recaptured Constantinople 2 As a result the balance of favour tipped toward Genoa which was granted free trade rights in the Latin Empire besides the control of commerce in the hands of Genoese merchants Genoa received ports and way stations in many islands and settlements in the Aegean Sea 2 The islands of Chios and Lesbos became commercial stations of Genoa as well as the city of Smyrna Izmir ",
			"after": " Genoa and Pisa became the only states with trading rights in the Black Sea 2 In the same century the Republic conquered many settlements in Crimea where the Genoese colony of Caffa was established The alliance with the restored Byzantine Empire increased the wealth and power of Genoa and simultaneously decreased Venetian and Pisan commerce The Byzantine Empire had granted the majority of free trading rights to Genoa In 1282 Pisa tried to gain control of the commerce and administration of Corsica after being called for support by the judge Sinucello who revolted against Genoa 12 In August 1282 part of the Genoese fleet blockaded Pisan commerce near the river Arno 12 During 1283 both Genoa and Pisan made war preparations Genoa built 120 galleys 60 of which belonged to the Republic while the other 60 galleys were rented to individuals More than 15 000 mercenaries were hired as rowmen and soldiers The Pisan fleet avoided combat and tried to wear out the Genoese fleet during 1283 On August 5 1284 in the naval Battle of Meloria the Genoese fleet consisting of 93 ships led by Oberto Doria and Benedetto I Zaccaria defeated the Pisan fleet which consisted of 72 ships and was led by Alberto Morosini and Ugolino della Gherardesca Genoa captured 30 Pisan ships and sank seven 12 About 8 000 Pisans were killed during the battle more than half of the Pisan troops which were about 14 000 12 The defeat of Pisa which never fully recovered as a maritime competitor resulted in gain of control of the commerce of Corsica by Genoa The Sardinian town of Sassari which was under Pisan control became a commune which was controlled by Genoa Control of Sardinia however did not pass permanently to Genoa the Aragonese kings of Naples disputed control and did not secure it until the 15th century ",
