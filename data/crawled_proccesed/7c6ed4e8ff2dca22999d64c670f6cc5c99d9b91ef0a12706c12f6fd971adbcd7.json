			"previous": " Increased interest would turn the LWF into a serious acquisition program North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO allies Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Norway were seeking to replace their F 104G fighter bombers 22 In early 1974 they reached an agreement with the U S that if the USAF ordered the LWF winner they would consider ordering it as well The USAF also needed to replace its F 105 and F 4 fighter bombers The U S Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter NACF program that would be a navalized fighter bomber variant of the LWF The four NATO allies had formed the Multinational Fighter Program Group MFPG and pressed for a U S decision by December 1974 thus the USAF accelerated testing 23 24 25 ",
			"after": " To reflect this serious intent to procure a new fighter bomber the LWF program was rolled into a new Air Combat Fighter ACF competition in an announcement by U S Secretary of Defense James R Schlesinger in April 1974 Schlesinger also made it clear that any ACF order would be in addition to the F 15 which extinguished opposition to the LWF 24 25 ACF also raised the stakes for GD and Northrop because it brought in competitors intent on securing what was touted at the time as the arms deal of the century 26 These were Dassault Breguet s proposed Mirage F1M 53 the SEPECAT Jaguar and the proposed Saab 37E Eurofighter Northrop offered the P 530 Cobra which was similar to the YF 17 The Jaguar and Cobra were dropped by the MFPG early on leaving two European and the two U S candidates On 11 September 1974 the U S Air Force confirmed plans to order the winning ACF design to equip five tactical fighter wings Though computer modeling predicted a close contest the YF 16 proved significantly quicker going from one maneuver to the next and was the unanimous choice of those pilots that flew both aircraft 27 ",
