			"previous": " Most of Southern California including all of Orange County was periodically part of the Pacific Ocean the most recent epoch was approximately 10 million years ago MYA The Santa Ana Mountains which now border the creek to the north and east began their uplift about 5 5 million years ago along the Elsinore Fault 21 Aliso Creek formed about this time running from the mountains across the broad coastal plain to the Pacific ",
			"after": " About 1 22 million years ago the San Joaquin Hills along the Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust extending south from the Los Angeles Basin 22 As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream or one that had formed prior to the mountains uplift it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek and to the south at San Juan Creek The uplift also caused Aliso Creek s largest tributary Sulphur Creek to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek 5 The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present day form with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys 5 ",
