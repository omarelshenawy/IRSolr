			"previous": " Boulton was widely involved in civic activities in Birmingham His friend Dr John Ash had long sought to build a hospital in the town A great fan of the music of Handel Boulton conceived of the idea to hold a music festival in Birmingham to raise funds for the hospital The festival took place in September 1768 the first of a series stretching well into the twentieth century 98 The hospital opened in 1779 Boulton also helped build the General Dispensary where outpatient treatment could be obtained 98 A firm supporter of the Dispensary he served as treasurer and wrote If the funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support I will make up the deficiency 99 The Dispensary soon outgrew its original quarters and a new building in Temple Row was opened in 1808 shortly before Boulton s death 99 ",
			"after": " Boulton helped found the New Street Theatre in 1774 and later wrote that having a theatre encouraged well to do visitors to come to Birmingham and to spend more money than they would have otherwise 98 Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent entitled to present serious drama he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807 100 He also supported Birmingham s Oratorio Choral Society and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in 1799 He maintained a pew at St Paul s Church Birmingham a centre of musical excellence 98 When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the incorrect belief it was the centennial of Handel s birth and the correct belief that it was the 25th anniversary of his death Boulton attended and wrote I scarcely know which was grandest the sounds or the scene Both was transcendibly fine that it is not in my power of words to describe In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body 101 ",
