			"previous": " Like any magnetic device compasses are affected by nearby ferrous materials as well as by strong local electromagnetic forces Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields car electrical systems automobile engines steel pitons etc as that can affect their accuracy 93 Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built in magnets or other devices Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on and off electrical fields caused by the vehicle s ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors ",
			"after": " A similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel Fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading ",
