			"after": " During the 1870s the rapid increase in the size and power of armor piercing guns caused problems for the designers of battleships and cruisers alike Even a ship designed with adequate armor protection from the current generation of guns might be vulnerable to new guns powerful enough to penetrate its armor Consequently naval designers tried a novel method of armoring their ships The vital parts engines boilers magazines and enough hull structure to keep the ship stable in the event of damage could be positioned underneath an armored deck just below the waterline This deck which would only be struck very obliquely by shells could be thinner and lighter than belt armor The sides of the ship would be entirely unarmored but would be as effective as an armored belt which would not stop shellfire Cruisers designed along these guidelines known as protected cruisers superseded armored cruisers in the 1880s and early 1890s 11 ",
