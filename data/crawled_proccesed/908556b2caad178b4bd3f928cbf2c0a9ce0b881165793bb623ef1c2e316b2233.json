			"previous": " Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium it may also have a rocky core of heavier elements Because of its rapid rotation Jupiter s shape is that of an oblate spheroid it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries A prominent result is the Great Red Spot a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope Surrounding the planet is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere There are also at least 63 moons including the four large moons called the Galilean moons that were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 Ganymede the largest of these moons has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto bound New Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007 The probe used the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa ",
