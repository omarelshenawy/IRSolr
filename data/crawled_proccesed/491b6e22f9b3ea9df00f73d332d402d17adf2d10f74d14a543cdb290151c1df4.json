			"after": " Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics the very theory he helped create despite its acceptance by other physicists stating that God is not playing at dice 142 Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76 143 In 1917 at the height of his work on relativity Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser 144 This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie s work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first In another major paper from this era Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton Jacobi equation of mechanics This paper would inspire Schr dinger s work of 1926 ",
