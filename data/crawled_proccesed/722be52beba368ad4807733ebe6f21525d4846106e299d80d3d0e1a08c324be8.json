			"previous": " In 1793 William Godwin who has often 65 been cited as the first anarchist wrote Political Justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism 66 68 Godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge 66 179 Godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good 180 181 ",
			"after": " An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism 182 or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the German Max Stirner 75 Stirner s The Ego and Its Own published in 1844 is a founding text of the philosophy 75 According to Stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire 183 without regard for God state or morality 184 To Stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality 185 Stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will 186 which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state 187 Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals 188 Egoism has inspired many interpretations of Stirner s philosophy It was re discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay ",
