			"previous": " The borough council is pushing for an additional Crossrail station in the north of the borough at Kensal 10 off Ladbroke Grove Canal Way A turn back facility will have to be built not too far west of Paddington and siting the turn back at Kensal rather than next to Paddington would provide a frequent service helping to regenerate the area 11 12 13 London Mayor Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it met three tests it must not delay construction of Crossrail it must not compromise performance of Crossrail or any other railway and it must not increase Crossrail s overall cost In response the borough council agreed to underwrite the projected 33 million cost of the station to the extent that section 106 payments from the promoters of property developments expected near the station do not reach this sum 14 The Council funded a consultancy study which concluded that in many scenarios a Kensal station would not compromise Crossrail performance TfL is conducting a feasibility study on the station The project is supported by local MPs the residents of the Borough National Grid retailers Sainsbury s and Cath Kidston and Jenny Jones Green Party member of the London Assembly 15 It is also supported by the adjoining London Borough of Brent 16 ",
