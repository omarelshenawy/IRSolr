			"previous": " A dependency is commonly distinguished from other subnational entities in that they are not considered to be part of the integral territory of the governing State A subnational entity typically represents a division of the State proper while a dependent territory often maintains a great degree of autonomy from the controlling State Historically most colonies were considered to be dependencies of their controlling State The dependencies that remain generally maintain a very high degree of political autonomy At the same time not all autonomous entities are considered to be dependencies 2 ",
			"after": " Many political entities have a special position recognized by international treaty or agreement resulting in a certain level of autonomy or differences in immigration rules These are sometimes 3 considered dependencies 4 but are officially considered by their controlling states to be integral parts of the state 3 Examples are land Finland Hong Kong China and Macau China 5 ",
