			"after": " By early 1986 the planned launch date of October that year looked feasible but the Challenger accident brought the U S space program to a halt grounding the Space Shuttle fleet and forcing the launch of Hubble to be postponed for several years The telescope had to be kept in a clean room powered up and purged with nitrogen until a launch could be rescheduled This costly situation about 6 million per month pushed the overall costs of the project even higher This delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests swap out a possibly failure prone battery and make other improvements 48 Furthermore the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986 and in fact was barely ready by the 1990 launch 49 ",
