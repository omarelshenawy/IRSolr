			"after": " The Holy Thorn Reliquary is made of gold enamel rock crystal pearls rubies and sapphires It is just over 30 centimetres 12 in high and weighs 1 4 kilograms 3 1 lb There are some areas of damage including what appears to be deliberate removal of enamel in the 19th century and small losses and repairs but generally the reliquary is in good condition The central front compartment holding the relic is protected by a thin pane of rock crystal which has kept it in perfect condition 1 The enamel is mostly in ronde bosse technique applied to three dimensional figures with white as the dominant colour White enamel using lead was only recently developed and very fashionable dominating many contemporary ronde bosse works 13 There is also red green blue pink and black enamel Pure gold is used throughout which is rare even in royal commissions of such pieces at this period most use cheaper silver gilt for the structural framework 14 ",
