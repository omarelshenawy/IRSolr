			"previous": " Yorkshire is drained by several rivers In western and central Yorkshire the many rivers empty their waters into the River Ouse which reaches the North Sea via the Humber Estuary 59 The most northerly of the rivers in the Ouse system is the River Swale which drains Swaledale before passing through Richmond and meandering across the Vale of Mowbray Next draining Wensleydale is the River Ure which the Swale joins east of Boroughbridge Near Great Ouseburn the Ure is joined by the small Ouse Gill Beck and below the confluence the river is known as the Ouse The River Nidd rises on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and flows along Nidderdale before reaching the Vale of York and the Ouse 59 The River Wharfe which drains Wharfedale joins the Ouse upstream of Cawood 59 The Rivers Aire and Calder are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse and the most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the River Don which flows northwards to join the main river at Goole Further north and east the River Derwent rises on the North York Moors flows south then westwards through the Vale of Pickering then turns south again to drain the eastern part of the Vale of York It empties into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh 59 ",
			"after": " In the far north of the county the River Tees flows eastwards through Teesdale and empties its waters into the North Sea downstream of Middlesbrough The smaller River Esk flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at Whitby 59 To the east of the Yorkshire Wolds the River Hull flows southwards to join the Humber Estuary at Kingston upon Hull ",
