			"previous": " Reconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features The eruption lasted two days The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document Pliny the Younger In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high altitude column from which ash began to fall blanketing the area Rescues and escapes occurred during this time At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began Lights were seen on the mountain interpreted as fires People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives The flows were rapid moving dense and very hot knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape including the coastline These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples By evening of the second day the eruption was over leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly ",
			"after": " The latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi phase eruption 37 The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15 and 30 kilometres 49 000 and 98 000 ft high which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma created from ground water seeping over time into the deep faults of the region ",
