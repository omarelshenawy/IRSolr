			"after": " As noted above an enzyme inhibitor is characterised by its two dissociation constants Ki and Ki to the enzyme and to the enzyme substrate complex respectively The enzyme inhibitor constant Ki can be measured directly by various methods one extremely accurate method is isothermal titration calorimetry in which the inhibitor is titrated into a solution of enzyme and the heat released or absorbed is measured 5 However the other dissociation constant Ki is difficult to measure directly since the enzyme substrate complex is short lived and undergoing a chemical reaction to form the product Hence Ki is usually measured indirectly by observing the enzyme activity under various substrate and inhibitor concentrations and fitting the data 6 to a modified Michaelis Menten equation",
