			"previous": " Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place An example is the classification of finite simple groups also called the enormous theorem whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500 odd journal articles by about 100 authors and filling tens of thousands of pages A group of French mathematicians including Jean Dieudonn and Andr Weil publishing under the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education 130 ",
			"after": " Differential geometry came into its own when Einstein used it in general relativity Entire new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic topology and John von Neumann s game theory changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods All kinds of structures were abstracted using axioms and given names like metric spaces topological spaces etc As mathematicians do the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to category theory Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincar had begun in the 1890s Measure theory was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Applications of measures include the Lebesgue integral Kolmogorov s axiomatisation of probability theory and ergodic theory Knot theory greatly expanded Quantum mechanics led to the development of functional analysis Other new areas include Laurent Schwartz s distribution theory fixed point theory singularity theory and Ren Thom s catastrophe theory model theory and Mandelbrot s fractals Lie theory with its Lie groups and Lie algebras became one of the major areas of study ",
