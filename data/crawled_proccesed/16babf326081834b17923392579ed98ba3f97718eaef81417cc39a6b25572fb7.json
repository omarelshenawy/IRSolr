			"after": " Interdigital filters are another form of coupled line filter Each section of line is about 4 in length and is terminated in a short circuit at one end only the other end being left open circuit The end which is short circuited alternates on each line section This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy As with the parallel coupled line filter the advantage of a mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure as such higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved and Q values as low as 1 4 are possible 60 61 ",
