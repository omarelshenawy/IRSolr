			"previous": " Many of the numerous human figures revel in an innocent self absorbed joy as they engage in a wide range of activities some appear to enjoy sensory pleasures others play unselfconsciously in the water and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals seemingly at one with nature In the middle of the background a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner s genitals and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity According to Fraenger the eroticism of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of spiritual transition or a playground of corruption 36 ",
