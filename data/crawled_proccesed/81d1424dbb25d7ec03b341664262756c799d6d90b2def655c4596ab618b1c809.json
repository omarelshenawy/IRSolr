			"previous": " Since the end of production most 757s have remained in service mainly in the U S 50 80 From 2004 to 2008 the average fuel cost for typical mid range U S domestic 757 flights tripled putting pressure on airlines to improve the fuel efficiency of their fleets 81 In May 2005 the FAA granted regulatory approval for manufacturer sanctioned blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated as a retrofit on the 757 200 82 The winglets improve fuel efficiency by five percent and increase range by 200 nautical miles 370 km through the reduction of lift induced drag 83 84 Continental Airlines was the first carrier to order winglets for the 757 200 and in February 2009 became the first operator of 757 300s with winglets 85 ",
			"after": " In the 2010s the 757 has remained the only narrow body aircraft in use by the large fleets of all three U S legacy carriers American Airlines Delta Air Lines and United Airlines 4 68 During this period the 757 s capacity and range capabilities have remained largely unequaled among narrow body airliners 86 when selecting replacement aircraft airlines have had to either downsize to smaller single aisle aircraft in production with fewer seats and less range such as the 737 900ER and A321 or upsize to the larger longer range 787 Dreamliner and A330 200 wide body jets 68 87 The Tupolev Tu 204 a narrow body twinjet introduced in 1989 with a design similar to the 757 s 88 is offered in a 200 seat version which has seen limited production for mainly Russian customers 89 90 Within Boeing the 215 seat 3 200 nautical mile 5 930 km range 737 900ER has been regarded as the closest aircraft in production to the 757 200 91 ",
