			"previous": " Later in the 18th century the French philosopher Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon one of the leading naturalists of the time suggested that what most people referred to as species were really just well marked varieties modified from an original form by environmental factors For example he believed that lions tigers leopards and house cats might all have a common ancestor He further speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original animal forms Buffon s evolutionary ideas were limited he believed each of the original forms had arisen through spontaneous generation and that each was shaped by internal moulds that limited the amount of change Buffon s works Histoire naturelle 1749 1789 and poques de la nature 1778 containing well developed theories about a completely materialistic origin for the Earth and his ideas questioning the fixity of species were extremely influential 40 41 Another French philosopher Denis Diderot also wrote that living things might have first arisen through spontaneous generation and that species were always changing through a constant process of experiment where new forms arose and survived or not based on trial and error an idea that can be considered a partial anticipation of natural selection 42 Between 1767 and 1792 James Burnett Lord Monboddo included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from primates but also that in response to the environment creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals 43 Charles Darwin s grandfather Erasmus Darwin published Zoonomia 1794 1796 which suggested that all warm blooded animals have arisen from one living filament 44 In his poem Temple of Nature 1803 he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in mud to all of its modern diversity 45 ",
