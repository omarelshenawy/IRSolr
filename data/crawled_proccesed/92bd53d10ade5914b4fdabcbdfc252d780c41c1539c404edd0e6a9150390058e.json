			"previous": " During the 1970s energy crisis the economic situation for both Flugf lag and Loftlei ir worsened The government of Iceland initiated a new attempt to merge the two airlines which could be realized in 1973 following lengthy and difficult negotiations 28 The staff of Loftlei ir complained that Flugf lag although smaller had gained the upper hand in the united company 29 A holding company called Fluglei ir was created which combined the two companies and began to streamline staff and operations 30 At the time of the merger two thirds of the passenger traffic of the airline were international transatlantic crossings and Flugf lag s fleet of DC 3s and 727s was enlarged by DC 8s of Loftlei ir In 1979 Flugf lag bought all of Loftlei ir s assets in Fluglei ir and the airline became known by today s Icelandair ",
			"after": " The aircraft fleet of Icelandair remained mainly unchanged until the Boeing 757 200 became the new backbone for transatlantic flights during the 1990s The domestic Fokker F 27s were replaced by F 50s and Boeing 737s deployed on European routes The European hub at Luxemburg Findel Airport had been taken over from Loftlei ir Passenger count topped one million in 1995 citation needed as the company s business grew on a reputation as a backpacker airline similar to Loftlei ir which had been referred to as Hippie Airline since the late 1960s In the same year it was begun to dismantle the Luxemburg hub in favor of today s decentralized European network linking the largest cities non stop to Reykjav k 31 ",
