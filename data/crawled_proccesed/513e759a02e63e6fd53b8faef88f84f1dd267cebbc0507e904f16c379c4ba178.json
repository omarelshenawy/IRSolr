			"after": " This species was first described by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1825 from a specimen collected on the Guinean coast 2 He published his description in the 2nd volume of Nouveau recueil de planches colori es d oiseaux and described it as Corvus gymnocephalus placing it in the crow genus Corvus 2 The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek words gymnos naked and kephal head 3 However only three years later the bird was removed from the genus Corvus by Ren Primev re Lesson and placed in its own genus Picathartes as it did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head 4 This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for magpie and cathartes for vulture 5 6 Since its initial description the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families including those of crows Corvidae starlings Sturnidae Old World flycatchers Muscicapidae babblers Timaliidae and Old World warblers Sylviidae 7 Today the white necked rockfowl and its close relative the grey necked rockfowl are believed to comprise a unique family Picathartidae 2 It has also been suggested though not generally accepted that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order 8 Recent DNA analysis has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives southern Africa s rockjumpers and southeast Asia s rail babbler form a clade The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44 million years ago 9 It is believed that the ancestor of this clade originated in Australia and spread to Africa 9 Though the white necked rockfowl has no subspecies it is believed to form a superspecies with the grey necked rockfowl with plumage and facial pattern being the primary differences between the two species 2 ",
