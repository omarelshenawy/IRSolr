			"previous": " Little is known about the longevity of frogs and toads in the wild but some can live for many years Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age Using this method the ages of mountain yellow legged frogs Rana muscosa were studied the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter The oldest frogs had ten bands so their age was believed to be 14 years including the four year tadpole stage 133 Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years an age achieved by a European common toad Bufo bufo The cane toad Bufo marinus has been known to survive 24 years in captivity and the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana 14 years 134 Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time including the wood frog Rana sylvatica 135 ",
			"after": " Although care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs up to an estimated 20 of amphibian species may care for their young in some way 136 The evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily by the size of the water body in which they breed Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour 137 Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies some frog species started to lay their eggs on land Once this happened the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival 138 The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care 137 ",
