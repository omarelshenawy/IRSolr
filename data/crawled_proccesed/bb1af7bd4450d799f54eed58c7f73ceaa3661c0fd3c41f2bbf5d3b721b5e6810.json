			"after": " The ability of the human eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the retina to light of different wavelengths Humans being trichromatic the retina contains three types of color receptor cells or cones One type relatively distinct from the other two is most responsive to light that we perceive as blue or blue violet with wavelengths around 450 nm cones of this type are sometimes called short wavelength cones S cones or blue cones The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically middle wavelength cones M cones or green cones are most sensitive to light perceived as green with wavelengths around 540 nm while the long wavelength cones L cones or red cones are most sensitive to light we perceive as greenish yellow with wavelengths around 570 nm ",
