			"previous": " Unlike many Banksia species B telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber so plants are killed by bushfire However it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire and so regenerates rapidly 17 This behaviour known as serotiny makes B telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration indeed excessive fire frequency may be one reason why B telmatiaea does not occur further south despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia 18 Unlike most serotinous Banksia species the seeds of B telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire The follicles open straight away but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator If moistened these wings close up and as they dry they open out again levering the seeds out of position making it possible for them to fall This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire 19 ",
