			"previous": " Molecular phylogenetic analyses have proven these three are all distinctive and separate species 37 other taxa formerly believed to be unique species or subspecies such as B betulicola B chippewaensis B persoonii B quercicola and B venturii are now known to be part of a B edulis species complex with a wide morphological ecological and geographic range 38 39 and that the genetic variability in this complex is low 40 Similar molecular technology has been developed to rapidly and accurately identify B edulis and other commercially important fungi 41 42 ",
			"after": " Western North America has a number of species closely related to B edulis The white king bolete Boletus barrowsii found in parts of Colorado New Mexico Arizona and California and possibly elsewhere is named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows 43 It is lighter in colour than B edulis having a cream coloured cap with pink tones 44 often mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall Some find its flavour as good as if not better than B edulis 45 The California king bolete Boletus edulis var grandedulis can reach massive proportions and is distinguished from B edulis by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish The cap colour appears to be affected by the amount of light received during its development and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy to dark brown red brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light 46 The queen bolete Boletus regineus formerly considered a variety of B aereus is also a choice edible It is generally smaller than B edulis and unlike that species is typically found in mixed forests 47 The spring king bolete Boletus rex veris formerly considered a variety of B edulis or B pinophilus is found throughout western North America In contrast to B edulis B rex veris tends to fruit in clusters and as its common name suggests appears in the spring 48 ",
