			"previous": " The KC 10 Extender first flew on 12 July 1980 but it was not until October the same year that the first aerial refuel sortie was performed 6 7 The design for the KC 10 involved modifications from the DC 10 30CF design Unnecessary airline features were replaced by an improved cargo handling system and military avionics 8 Meanwhile the KC 10 retains 88 commonality with its commercial counterparts giving it greater access to the worldwide commercial support system 4 Other changes from the DC 10 30CF include the removal of most windows and lower cargo doors 9 Early aircraft featured a distinctive light gray white and blue paint scheme but a gray green camouflage scheme was used on later tankers The paint scheme was switched to a medium gray color by the late 1990s 10 ",
			"after": " The most notable changes were the addition of the McDonnell Douglas Advanced Aerial Refueling Boom AARB and additional fuel tanks located in the baggage compartments below the main deck The extra tanks increase the KC 10 s fuel capacity to 356 000 lb 161 478 kg nearly doubling the KC 135 s capacity 6 The KC 10 has both a centerline refueling boom unique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the V tail design used on previous tankers and a drogue and hose system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage The KC 10 boom operator is located in the rear of the aircraft with wide window for monitoring refueling The operator controls refueling operations through a digital fly by wire system 1 10 11 Unlike the KC 135 the KC 10 s hose and drogue system allows refueling of Navy Marine Corps and most allied aircraft all in one mission 6 The final twenty KC 10s produced included wing mounted pods for added refueling locations 2 In addition to its tanking role the KC 10 can carry a complement 75 personnel with 146 000 lb 66 225 kg of cargo or 170 000 lb 77 110 kg in an all cargo configuration 6 The KC 10 has a side cargo door for loading and unloading cargo Handling equipment is required to raise and lower loads to the cargo opening ",
