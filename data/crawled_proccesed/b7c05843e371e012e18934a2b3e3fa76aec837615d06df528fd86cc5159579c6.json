			"after": " D rer s Rhinoceros is the name commonly given to a woodcut carved by Albrecht D rer in 1515 The image was based on a written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an Indian rhinoceros that had arrived in Lisbon earlier that year D rer never saw the actual rhinoceros which was the first living example seen in Europe since Roman times In late 1515 the King of Portugal Manuel I sent the animal as a gift for Pope Leo X but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516 A live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen arrived from India at the court of Phillip II in Spain in around 1579 Despite its anatomical inaccuracies D rer s woodcut became very popular in Europe and was copied many times in the following three centuries It was regarded as a true representation of a rhinoceros into the late 18th century Eventually it was supplanted by more realistic drawings and paintings particularly paintings and engravings of Clara the rhinoceros who toured Europe in the 1740s and 1750s It has been said of D rer s woodcut that probably no animal picture has exerted such a profound influence on the arts ",
