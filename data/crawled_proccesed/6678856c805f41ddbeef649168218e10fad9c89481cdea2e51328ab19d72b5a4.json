			"previous": " While the center may have been named because it was located in the Lincoln Square neighborhood it is unclear whether the area was named as a tribute to U S President Abraham Lincoln The name was bestowed on the area in 1906 by the New York City Board of Aldermen but records give no reason for choosing that name 4 There has long been speculation that the name came from a local landowner because the square was previously named Lincoln Square City records from the time show only the names Johannes van Bruch Thomas Hall Stephan de Lancey James de Lancey James de Lancey Jr and John Somerindyck as area property owners One speculation is that references to President Lincoln were omitted from the records because the mayor in 1906 was George B McClellan Jr son of General George B McClellan who was general in chief of the Union Army during the American Civil War and a bitter rival of Lincoln 5 ",
