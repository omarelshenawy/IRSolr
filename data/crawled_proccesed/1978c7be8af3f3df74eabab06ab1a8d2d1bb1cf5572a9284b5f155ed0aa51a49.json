			"previous": " After making a beachhead and consolidating their position the invaders next fought the Britons at the Battle of Natanleod the location of which has been placed at Netley Marsh 508 This year Cerdic and Cynric killed a British king named Natanleod and five thousand men with him After that the land was known as Natanleag up to Cerdicesford Cerdicesford has been placed at various locations in southern Hampshire including Chandler s Ford The historian Albany Major places the site at Charford at the crossing of the river Avon close to the border with Wiltshire ",
			"after": " The Chronicle appears to repeat itself with the annals for 514 and 519 514 The West Saxons came to Briton with 3 ships to a place called Cerdicesora and in the same year they fought the Britons and put them to flight and 519 Cerdic and Cynric received the West Saxon kingdom and the same year they fought with the Britons in a place now called Cerdicesford The royal line of Wessex ruled from that day Despite the repetition there may have been multiple landings along the part of the coast known to the Saxons as Cerdic s Shore It is likely that both Winchester and Silchester would have fallen to the West Saxons between the years 508 and 514 but this transition is only suggested by the absence of these important towns in the later annals of the British scribes A later thrust by the West Saxons up the Avon towards Old Sarum in 519 appears to have been checked by the Britons at Charford Albany Major in Early Wars of Wessex makes the case that the borders of Hampshire probably matched those of the first West Saxon kingdom established by Cerdic and his son Evidence of this comes from the border between Hampshire and Berkshire which generally follows the line of the Roman road that ran east and west through Silchester but is deflected in the north in a rough semicircle in such a way as to include the whole district around the town Major argues that the capture of Silchester of which no record has survived was not the work of Angles but of the West Saxons who probably struck north from Winchester possibly acting in concert with a separate force making its way up the Thames Valley towards Reading Silchester was desolated after its fall and it is most improbable that any regard would have been paid to its side of the border had the fixing of the county boundary been made at a later period 5 ",
