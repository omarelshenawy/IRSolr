			"after": " X ray crystallography is a technique in crystallography in which the pattern produced by the diffraction of X rays through the closely spaced lattice of atoms in a crystal is recorded and then analyzed to reveal the nature of that lattice This generally leads to an understanding of the material and molecular structure of a substance The spacing in the crystal lattice can be determined using Bragg s law The electrons that surround the atoms rather than the atomic nuclei themselves are the entities that physically interact with the incoming X ray photons This technique is widely used in chemistry and biochemistry to determine the structures of an immense variety of molecules including inorganic compounds DNA and proteins X ray diffraction is commonly carried out using single crystals of a material but if these are not available microcrystalline powdered samples may also be used although this requires different equipment gives less information and is much less straightforward ",
