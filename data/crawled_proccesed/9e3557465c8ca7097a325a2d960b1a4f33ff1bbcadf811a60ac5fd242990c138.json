			"previous": " Bilingual interaction can even take place without the speakers switching In certain areas it is not uncommon for speakers each to use a different language within the same conversation This phenomenon is found amongst other places in Scandinavia Most speakers of Swedish Norwegian and Danish can communicate with each other speaking their respective languages while few can speak both people used to these situations often adjust their language avoiding words that are not found in the other language or that can be misunderstood Using different languages is usually called non convergent discourse a term introduced by the Dutch linguist Reitze Jonkman To a certain extent this situation also exists between Dutch and Afrikaans although everyday contact is fairly rare because of the distance between the two respective communities The phenomenon is also found in Argentina where Spanish and Italian are both widely spoken even leading to cases where a child with a Spanish and an Italian parent grows up fully bilingual with both parents speaking only their own language yet knowing the other Another example is the former state of Czechoslovakia where two closely related and mutually intelligible languages Czech and Slovak were in common use Most Czechs and Slovaks understand both languages although they would use only one of them their respective mother tongue when speaking For example in Czechoslovakia it was common to hear two people talking on television each speaking a different language without any difficulty understanding each other This bilinguality still exists nowadays although it has started to deteriorate after Czechoslovakia split up citation needed ",
