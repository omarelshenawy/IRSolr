			"after": " For a study for the U S Air Force in the mid 1970s Boeing investigated replacing the engines changing to a new wing and other improvements to upgrade B 52G H aircraft as an alternative to the B 1A then in development 104 Boeing later suggested re engining the B 52H fleet with the Rolls Royce RB211 535E 4 105 This would involve replacing the eight Pratt Whitney TF33s total thrust 8 17 000 lb with four RB211s total thrust 4 37 400 lb which would increase range and reduce fuel consumption at a cost of approximately US 2 56 billion for the whole fleet 71 aircraft at 36 million each A Government Accountability Office study concluded that Boeing s estimated savings of US 4 7 billion would not be realized and that it would cost US 1 3 billion over keeping the existing engines citing significant up front procurement and re tooling expenditure as well as the RB211 s higher maintenance cost The GAO report was subsequently disputed in a Defense Sciences Board report in 2003 the Air Force was urged to re engine the aircraft without delay 106 Further the DSB report stated the program would have significant savings reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance in line with the conclusions of a separate Congress funded study conducted in 2003 107 In 2014 the U S Air Force was reviewing industry studies of engine replacement 108 The re engining has not been approved as of 2014 update In late 2014 it was reported that the DOD and unnamed private companies were exploring a leasing program where private lease companies would purchase new engines and lease them to the USAF DOD costs would be determined by depreciation and actual usage with no up front lump payments 109 ",
