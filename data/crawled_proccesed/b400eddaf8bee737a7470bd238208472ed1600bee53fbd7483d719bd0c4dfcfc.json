			"previous": " In February 1944 Hitler approved the creation of an Albanian Waffen SS division that was to serve only inside Kosovo 8 and was intended to protect ethnic Albania but remain under German control 16 It was meant to be one of three Muslim Waffen SS divisions serving in the Balkans the other two being the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar 1st Croatian and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama 2nd Croatian 17 18 Himmler s goal was to expand Waffen SS recruiting in the Balkans and form two corps of two divisions each with one corps to operate in the region of Bosnia in the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan Waffen SS mountain army of five divisions 19 ",
			"after": " In March 1944 Bedri Pejani the chairman of the Second League of Prizren an organization created after the Italian surrender to advance the interests of Kosovo Albanians proposed to Hitler that a force of 120 000 150 000 Kosovo Albanian volunteers be raised to fight the Yugoslav and Albanian partisans Pejani asked the German leadership to give the Albanians equipment and supplies to fight the communist insurgency and requested the expansion of the borders of the German puppet state of Albania at the expense of the German occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and the German occupied territory of Montenegro These requests were not fulfilled 12 but in April 1944 Himmler ordered the establishment of a new Albanian volunteer division 11 which was subsequently named after the medieval Albanian warrior George Kastrioti Skanderbeg 20 By this point the Germans and some members of the Albanian puppet government believed that about 50 000 men could be recruited from Albanian held territory to join the SS 21 The SS had initially envisioned a force of 10 000 12 000 men for an Albanian SS division 16 and Himmler saw the Muslim Albanians as a potential source of manpower in Germany s war against the Yugoslav Partisans 11 who faced significant difficulties in recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join their ranks 8 9 The Germans found that Kosovo Albanians were more cooperative than Albanians in Albania itself 12 mainly because they feared a return to Yugoslav rule 8 and many of the division s recruits were Albanians from Kosovo The quality of most of these recruits was poor with only 6 000 being considered suitable to receive training 11 Those that were accepted were a combination of about 1 500 former Royal Yugoslav Army prisoners of war elements of the failed Albanian army and gendarmerie volunteers from both pre war and expanded Albania and conscripts from families that had more than two sons 16 The enlistment of Albanian civilians was organized in close cooperation with the Albanian puppet government 22 ",
