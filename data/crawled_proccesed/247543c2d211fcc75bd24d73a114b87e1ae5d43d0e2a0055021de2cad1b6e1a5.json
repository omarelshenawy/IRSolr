			"previous": " Cooling air is airflow that is injected through small holes in the liner to generate a layer film of cool air to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures The implementation of cooling air has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process In some cases as much as 50 of the inlet air is used as cooling air There are several different methods of injecting this cooling air and the method can influence the temperature profile that the liner is exposed to see Liner above 21 ",
			"after": " Can combustors are self contained cylindrical combustion chambers Each can has its own fuel injector igniter liner and casing 22 The primary air from the compressor is guided into each individual can where it is decelerated mixed with fuel and then ignited The secondary air also comes from the compressor where it is fed outside of the liner inside of which is where the combustion is taking place The secondary air is then fed usually through slits in the liner into the combustion zone to cool the liner via thin film cooling 23 ",
