			"previous": " Edward became king in 1042 and given his upbringing might have been considered a Norman by those who lived across the English Channel Following Cnut s reforms excessive power was concentrated in the hands of the rival houses of Leofric of Mercia and Godwine of Wessex Problems also came for Edward from the resentment caused by the king s introduction of Norman friends A crisis arose in 1051 when Godwine defied the king s order to punish the men of Dover who had resisted an attempt by Eustace of Boulogne to quarter his men on them by force 104 The support of Earl Leofric and Earl Siward enabled Edward to secure the outlawry of Godwine and his sons and William of Normandy paid Edward a visit during which Edward may have promised William succession to the English throne although this Norman claim may have been mere propaganda Godwine and his sons came back the following year with a strong force and the magnates were not prepared to engage them in civil war but forced the king to make terms Some unpopular Normans were driven out including Archbishop Robert whose archbishopric was given to Stigand this act supplied an excuse for the Papal support of William s cause 104 ",
