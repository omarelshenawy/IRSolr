			"previous": " As a result of the new appointments the court backlog was significantly reduced the court processed 1 700 cases in 1846 49 compared to 959 in 1819 24 but it rose again after the death of Shadwell VC and retirement of Wigram VC Shadwell appointed under the 1831 Act of Parliament could be replaced but a principal in the 1841 Act under which Wigram had been appointed meant that it provided for two life appointments to the court not two open positions after the retirement or death of the judges no more could be appointed Again the backlog became a problem particularly since the Lord Chancellor was distracted with the appellate cases through the Court of Appeal in Chancery and the House of Lords leaving a maximum of three Chancery judges who were available to hear cases Further structural reforms were proposed Richard Bethell suggested three more Vice Chancellors and an Appellate Tribunal in Chancery formed of two of the Vice Chancellors taken in rotation but this came to nothing 58 ",
			"after": " The 1830s saw a reduction in the old corruption that had long plagued the court first through the Chancery Sinecures Act 1832 and then through the Chancery Regulation Act 1833 59 The 1832 Act abolished a number of sinecure offices within the court and provided a pension and pay rise for the Lord Chancellor in the hope that it would reduce the need for the Chancellor to make money by selling court offices The 1833 Act changed the appointments system so that Masters in Chancery would henceforth be appointed by The Crown not by the Lord Chancellor and that they would be paid wages 59 Through the abolition of sinecures taking into account the wages and pension this saved the Court 21 670 a year The government had initially intended the 1832 bill to go further and abolish the Six Clerks but the Clerks successfully lobbied to prevent this 59 This did not save them however in 1842 the nettle of the Six Clerks Office was grasped by Thomas Pemberton who attacked them in the House of Commons for doing effectively sinecure work for high fees that massively increased the expense involved in cases As a result the Court of Chancery Act 1842 was passed in the same year that abolished the office completely 60 ",
