			"previous": " Abu Rayhan Biruni 976 1048 first described a polar equi azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere 22 verification needed He was regarded as the most skilled when it came to mapping cities and measuring the distances between them which he did for many cities in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent He often combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations in order to develop methods of pin pointing locations by recording degrees of latitude and longitude He also developed similar techniques when it came to measuring the heights of mountains depths of the valleys and expanse of the horizon He also discussed human geography and the planetary habitability of the Earth He also calculated the latitude of Kath Khwarezm using the maximum altitude of the Sun and solved a complex geodesic equation in order to accurately compute the Earth s circumference which were close to modern values of the Earth s circumference 23 His estimate of 6 339 9 km for the Earth radius was only 16 8 km less than the modern value of 6 356 7 km In contrast to his predecessors who measured the Earth s circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations al Biruni developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth s circumference and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location 24 verification needed ",
			"after": " The European Age of Discovery during the 16th and the 17th centuries where many new lands were discovered and accounts by European explorers such as Christopher Columbus Marco Polo and James Cook revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail and more solid theoretical foundations in Europe The problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location The problem of latitude was solved long ago but that of longitude remained agreeing on what zero meridian should be was only part of the problem It was left to John Harrison to solve it by inventing the chronometer H 4 in 1760 and later in 1884 for the International Meridian Conference to adopt by convention the Greenwich meridian as zero meridian 25 ",
