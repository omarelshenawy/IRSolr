			"after": " The cyclol fabric was shown to be implausible for several reasons Hans Neurath and Henry Bull showed that the dense packing of side chains in the cyclol fabric was inconsistent with the experimental density observed in protein films 50 Maurice Huggins calculated that several non bonded atoms of the cyclol fabric would approach more closely than allowed by their van der Waals radii for example the inner H and C atoms of the lacunae would be separated by only 1 68 Figure 5 51 Haurowitz showed chemically that the outside of proteins could not have a large number of hydroxyl groups a key prediction of the cyclol model 52 whereas Meyer and Hohenemser showed that cyclol condensations of amino acids did not exist even in minute quantities as a transition state 53 More general chemical arguments against the cyclol model were given by Bergmann and Niemann 54 and by Neuberger 55 56 Infrared spectroscopic data showed that the number of carbonyl groups in a protein did not change upon hydrolysis 57 and that intact folded proteins have a full complement of amide carbonyl groups 58 both observations contradict the cyclol hypothesis that such carbonyls are converted to hydroxyl groups in folded proteins Finally proteins were known to contain proline in significant quantities typically 5 since proline lacks the amide hydrogen and its nitrogen already forms three covalent bonds proline seems incapable of the cyclol reaction and of being incorporated into a cyclol fabric An encyclopedic summary of the chemical and structural evidence against the cyclol model was given by Pauling and Niemann 59 Moreover a supporting piece of evidence the result that all proteins contain an integer multiple of 288 amino acid residues 4 was likewise shown to be incorrect in 1939 60 ",
