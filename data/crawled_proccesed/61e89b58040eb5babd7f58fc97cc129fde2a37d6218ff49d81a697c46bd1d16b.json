			"after": " Typeface superfamilies began to emerge when foundries began to include typefaces with significant structural differences but some design relationship under the same general family name Arguably the first superfamily was created when Morris Fuller Benton created Clearface Gothic for ATF in 1910 a sans serif companion to the existing serifed Clearface The superfamily label does not include quite different designs given the same family name for what would seem to be purely marketing rather than design considerations Caslon Antique Futura Black and Futura Display are structurally unrelated to the Caslon and Futura families respectively and are generally not considered part of those families by typographers despite their names ",
