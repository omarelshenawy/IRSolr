			"after": " Like all lemurs this genus is found only on the island of Madagascar off the southeastern coast of Africa Confined to the island s seasonal eastern tropical rainforests it is uncommon to rare throughout its range which historically ran from the Masoala Peninsula in the northeast to the Mananara River in the south 11 14 Today the black and white ruffed lemur has a much larger range than the red ruffed lemur although it is very patchy extending from slightly northwest of Maroantsetra on Antongil Bay in the north down the coast to the Mananara River near Vangaindrano in the south 11 15 Additionally a concentrated population of black and white ruffed lemurs of the subspecies Varecia variegata subcincta can also be found on the island reserve of Nosy Mangabe in Antongil Bay It is suspected that this population was introduced to the island in the 1930s 14 The red ruffed lemur on the other hand has a very restricted range on the Masoala Peninsula 18 ",
