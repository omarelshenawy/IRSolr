			"previous": " West of downtown across Van Ness Avenue lies the large Western Addition neighborhood which became established with a large African American population after World War II The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley the Fillmore and Japantown which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II The Western Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact including the famous Painted Ladies standing alongside Alamo Square To the south near the geographic center of the city is Haight Ashbury famously associated with 1960s hippie culture The Haight is now home to some expensive boutiques 82 and a few controversial chain stores 83 although it still retains some bohemian character North of the Western Addition is Pacific Heights a wealthy neighborhood that features the mansions built by the San Francisco business elite in the wake of the 1906 earthquake Directly north of Pacific Heights facing the waterfront is the Marina a neighborhood popular with young professionals that was largely built on reclaimed land from the Bay 84 ",
