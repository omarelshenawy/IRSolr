			"previous": " Dirac took this one step further 75 76 He treated the interaction between a charge and an electromagnetic field as a small perturbation that induces transitions in the photon states changing the numbers of photons in the modes while conserving energy and momentum overall Dirac was able to derive Einstein s and coefficients from first principles and showed that the Bose Einstein statistics of photons is a natural consequence of quantizing the electromagnetic field correctly Bose s reasoning went in the opposite direction he derived Planck s law of black body radiation by assuming B E statistics In Dirac s time it was not yet known that all bosons including photons must obey Bose Einstein statistics ",
			"after": " Other virtual particles may contribute to the summation as well for example two photons may interact indirectly through virtual electron positron pairs 85 In fact such photon photon scattering see two photon physics as well as electron photon scattering is meant to be one of the modes of operations of the planned particle accelerator the International Linear Collider 86 ",
