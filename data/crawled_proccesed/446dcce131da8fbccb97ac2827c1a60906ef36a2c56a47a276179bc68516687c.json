			"previous": " Brougham Castle is entered through a three storey double gatehouse 58 Originally the coat of arms of Roger Clifford and his wife was carved above the entrance to the gatehouse but in the 19th century this was replaced by the current inscription Thys Made Roger by Henry Tufton 11th Earl of Thanet The inscription was originally above the entrance of the great hall built by Roger Clifford 5th Baron Clifford 59 Erected on the slope inclining down to the river the gatehouse was constructed in the early 14th century by Robert de Clifford 1st Baron de Clifford The complex has three components the inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between The inner gatehouse survives to a height of 12 5 metres 41 ft in the east The ground floor passage through the building is vaulted and there was a portcullis at the east end A postern gate was hidden behind a buttress in the north side of the gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving the castle The floors above the passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to the keep allowing people to move between the two without having to go outside In the 17th century Lady Anne Clifford converted the top floor into her bedroom 60 Like the inner gatehouse the outer section had a square plan and the upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room The building survives to a height of 14 5 metres 48 ft in the east Below the outer gatehouse was a dungeon and at ground floor level on the north side the guardroom The large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences Although the very top of the gatehouse no longer survives it would have been crested by machicolations 61 ",
			"after": " Adjoined to the gatehouse is the 13th century keep 62 A keep contained the main domestic accommodation in a castle usually high status and also provided the last place of refuge if the surrounding enclosure fell during an assault 63 Brougham s keep has a square plan and is between 19 and 20 metres 62 and 66 ft high although originally would have stood taller Access to each floor was granted by a spiral staircase in the north east corner with each floor consisting of a single large room The garderobe was located in the north west corner It had long been assumed that the keep was built in the last quarter of the 12th century due to its simple design the square design use of narrow buttresses at each corner and entrance through a forebuilding are consistent with other keeps built in the late 12th century By the 13th century Brougham s keep would have been old fashioned compared to the polygonal structures introduced in the 13th century 62 However historian Henry Summerson who assessed the historic documents for the castle concluded that construction could not have begun earlier than the first quarter of the 13th century 8 The wooden floors no longer survive and the use of the rooms in the keep is mostly conjectural however it is likely that the ground floor would have served as a storage room with the first floor being used as a hall and accommodation for the guards and the second floor providing rooms for the lord 64 A final fourth storey was added in early 14th century 12 The keep would have been entered at first floor level through the east side where it was abutted by a forebuilding Despite the keep s importance to the castle structure little survives of the building today 65 ",
