			"previous": " The Duke of Bridgewater died on 8 March 1803 By his will the income from the canal was to be paid to his nephew George Leveson Gower the Marquess of Stafford later the 1st Duke of Sutherland On his death it was to go to Stafford s second son Francis provided he changed his name to Egerton and then to his heirs and successors The management of the company was placed in the hands of three trustees 54 These were Sir Archibald Macdonald who was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer Edward Venables Vernon Harcourt at the time the Bishop of Carlisle and later the Archbishop of York and as Superintendent Robert Haldane Bradshaw the Duke s agent Bradshaw managed the estate for which he received a salary of 2 000 a year and the use of the duke s mansions at Worsley and Runcorn The other two trustees had each married nieces of the duke and were dummy trustees 55 ",
			"after": " During the time the canal was administered by the Bridgewater Trustees it made a profit every year 56 Until his retirement in 1834 the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was of the order of 13 per cent and in 1824 the best year it was 23 per cent 57 Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate and complained of being over worked but he was also regarded as being a formidable bargainer 58 In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby Manchester Bolton Bury Canal to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner but his response was delayed 37 In 1810 there was a general agreement with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company M IN to simultaneously raise freight charges However any cooperation between the two companies was short lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal in 1824 the traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time However in time more profit came from tonnage traffic that carried by private companies than from the Bridgewater s own carriage of freight 59 Bradshaw s administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal the locks docks and warehouses The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke s will 60 There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself 61 ",
