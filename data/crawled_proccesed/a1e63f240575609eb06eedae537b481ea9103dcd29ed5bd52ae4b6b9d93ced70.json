			"previous": " Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts Examples include the Jewish Halakha and Islamic Sharia both of which translate as the path to follow while Christian canon law also survives in some church communities Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments citation needed However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration For instance the Quran has some law and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation 87 Qiyas reasoning by analogy Ijma consensus and precedent This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as Sharia and Fiqh respectively Another example is the Torah or Old Testament in the Pentateuch or Five Books of Moses This contains the basic code of Jewish law which some Israeli communities choose to use The Halakha is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud s interpretations Nevertheless Israeli law allows litigants to use religious laws only if they choose Canon law is only in use by members of the Catholic Church 88 the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion ",
