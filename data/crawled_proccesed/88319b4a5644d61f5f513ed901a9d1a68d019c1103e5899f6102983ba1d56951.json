			"previous": " Darwin s speculations on the origin of species convinced him that cross fertilisation played an important role in keeping specific forms consistent He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes often deleterious He thought that natural outbreeding through cross fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous Cross fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self fertilising and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross pollination of flowers 3 4 ",
			"after": " In the summer of 1841 Charles and Emma Darwin moved from the turmoil of London to the countryside to Down House a quiet former parsonage in the village of Downe He wrote The flowers are here very beautiful 5 Darwin followed the recommendation of his friend the leading botanist Robert Brown and read Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered 6 3 The little known book published in 1793 by Christian Konrad Sprengel but never translated into English introduced the idea that flowers were created by God to fulfill a teleological purpose insects would act as living brushes to cross fertilise plants in a symbiotic relationship This functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty and were generally self fertilising For Darwin the concept of evolution gave new meaning to Sprengel s research into the mechanisms for cross fertilisation He welcomed its support for his supposition that cross fertilisation in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from self fertilisation 7 and by 1845 he had verified many of Sprengel s observations 8 ",
