			"after": " The blackcap s main breeding habitat is mature deciduous woodland with good scrub cover below the trees Other habitats such as parks large gardens and overgrown hedges are used as long as they meet the essential requirements of tall trees for songposts and an established understory Where other Sylvia warblers also breed blackcaps tend to use taller trees than their relatives preferably those with a good canopy such as pedunculate oak In prime habitat breeding densities reach 100 200 pairs per square kilometre 250 500 pairs per square mile in northern Europe and 500 900 pairs per square kilometre 1 250 2 250 pairs per square mile in Italy Densities are much lower in poorer habitats such as conifer forests 31 Breeding occurs in Europe at altitudes up to 2 200 m 7 200 ft 12 ",
