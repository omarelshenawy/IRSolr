			"previous": " While the largest species the capybara can weigh as much as 66 kg 146 lb most rodents weigh less than 100 g 3 5 oz The smallest rodent is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa which averages only 4 4 cm 1 7 in in head and body length with adult females weighing only 3 75 g 0 132 oz Rodents have wide ranging morphologies but typically have squat bodies and short limbs 1 The forelimbs usually have five digits including an opposable thumb while the hind limbs have three to five digits The elbow gives the fore arms great flexibility 3 7 The majority of species are plantigrade walking on both the palms and soles of their feet and have claw like nails The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong while arboreal rodents have shorter sharper nails 7 Rodent species use a wide variety of methods of locomotion including quadrupedal walking running burrowing and climbing bipedal hopping kangaroo rat and hopping mouse swimming and even gliding Scaly tailed squirrels and flying squirrels although not closely related can both glide from tree to tree using parachute like membranes that stretch from the fore limbs to the hind limbs 8 The agouti is fleet footed and antelope like being digitigrade and having hoof like nails The majority of rodents have tails which can be of many shapes and sizes Some tails are prehensile as in the Eurasian harvest mouse and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald The tail is sometimes used for communication as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all 1 In some species the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off 3 ",
			"after": " Rodents generally have well developed senses of smell hearing and vision Nocturnal species often have enlarged eyes and some are sensitive to ultraviolet light Many species have long sensitive whiskers or vibrissae for touch or whisking Some rodents have cheek pouches which may be lined with fur These can be turned inside out for cleaning In many species the tongue cannot reach past the incisors Rodents have efficient digestive systems absorbing nearly 80 percent of ingested energy When eating cellulose the food is softened in the stomach and passed to the cecum where bacteria reduce it to its carbohydrate elements The rodent then practices coprophagy eating its own fecal pellets so that the nutrients can be absorbed by the gut Rodents therefore often produce a hard and dry fecal pellet 1 In many species the penis contains a bone the baculum the testes can be located either abdominally or at the groin 3 ",
