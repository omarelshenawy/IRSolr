			"after": " Standard Danish rigsdansk is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital Copenhagen Unlike Swedish and Norwegian Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm More than 25 of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital and most government agencies institutions and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen something that has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm In contrast though Oslo Norway and Stockholm Sweden are quite dominant in terms of speech standards cities like Bergen Gothenburg and the Malm Lund region are large and influential enough to create secondary regional norms making the standard language more varied than is the case with Danish The general agreement is that Standard Danish is based on a form of Copenhagen dialect but the specific norm as with most language norms is difficult to pinpoint for both laypeople and scholars Historically Standard Danish emerged as a compromise between the dialect of Zealand and Scania The first layers of it can be seen in east Danish provincial law texts such as Sk nske Lov just as we can recognize west Danish in laws from the same ages in Jyske Lov ",
