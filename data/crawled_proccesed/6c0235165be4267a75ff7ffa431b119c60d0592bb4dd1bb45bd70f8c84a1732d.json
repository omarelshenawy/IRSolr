			"previous": " In the United States and Canada a townhouse has two connotations The older predates the automobile and denotes a house on a small footprint in a city but because of its multiple floors sometimes six or more it has a large living space often with servants quarters The small footprint of the townhouse allows it to be within walking or mass transit distance of business and industrial areas of the city yet luxurious enough for wealthy residents of the city 2 ",
			"after": " Townhouses are expensive where detached single family houses are uncommon such as in New York City Chicago Boston Philadelphia Toronto Washington D C and San Francisco   Rowhouses are similar and consist of several adjacent next to uniform units originally found in older pre automobile urban areas such as Baltimore Charleston South Carolina Savannah and New Orleans but now found in lower cost housing developments in suburbs as well A townhouse is where there is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses but some have a double wall with inches wide air space in between on a common foundation A rowhouse will generally be smaller and less luxurious than a dwelling called a townhouse ",
