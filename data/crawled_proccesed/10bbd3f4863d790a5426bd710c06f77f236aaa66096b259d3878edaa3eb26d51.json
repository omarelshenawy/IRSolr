			"after": " Ramjets are the most basic type of ram powered jet engines They consist of three sections an inlet to compress incoming air a combustor to inject and combust fuel and a nozzle to expel the hot gases and produce thrust Ramjets require a relatively high speed to efficiently compress the incoming air so ramjets cannot operate at a standstill and they are most efficient at supersonic speeds A key trait of ramjet engines is that combustion is done at subsonic speeds The supersonic incoming air is dramatically slowed through the inlet where it is then combusted at the much slower subsonic speeds 17 The faster the incoming air is however the less efficient it becomes to slow it to subsonic speeds Therefore ramjet engines are limited to approximately Mach 5 19 ",
