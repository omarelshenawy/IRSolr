			"after": " Carpenter Gothic houses and small churches became common in North America and other places in the late 19th century 34 These structures adapted Gothic elements such as pointed arches steep gables and towers to traditional American light frame construction The invention of the scroll saw and mass produced wood moldings allowed a few of these structures to mimic the florid fenestration of the High Gothic But in most cases Carpenter Gothic buildings were relatively unadorned retaining only the basic elements of pointed arch windows and steep gables Probably the best known example of Carpenter Gothic is a house in Eldon Iowa that Grant Wood used for the background of his famous painting American Gothic 35 ",
