			"after": " Eagle Scout requirements have evolved since the award was conceived A requirement to earn 11 specific merit badges was added in 1914 which underwent minor changes in 1915 15 The Life Star order was reversed in 1924 apparently because the five pointed star of the Star Scout insignia could be associated with the five merit badges required to earn the rank immediately following First Class Scout In 1927 Eagle Scout began the transition from being a super merit badge to a rank 4 As a result the first requirements for tenure were created and Scouts were required to be an active First Class Scout for one year The initial requirements for what became the service project appeared with a requirement to show satisfactory service and the number of required merit badges increased to 12 In 1936 the ranks of Star and Life became mandatory and the number of required merit badges rose to 13 It was at this time that Eagle Scout became a full fledged rank In 1952 age limits were set so that adults over 18 years of age could no longer earn Eagle Scout and the service project requirement was slightly expanded to do your best to help in your home school church or synagogue and community 4 Some councils resisted the change limiting the Eagle Scout rank to youth so the addition of the requirement to hold a youth troop officer position was added in 1965 16 In 1958 the number of required merit badges increased again to 16 of the 21 total merit badges needed to obtain Eagle along with the first requirements for service and leadership citation needed ",
