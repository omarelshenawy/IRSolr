			"after": " D rer s woodcut is not an accurate representation of a rhinoceros He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of armour with a gorget at the throat a solid looking breastplate and rivets along the seams He places a small twisted horn on its back and gives it scaly legs and saw like rear quarters None of these features is present in a real rhinoceros 4 5 It is possible that a suit of armour was forged for the rhinoceros s fight against the elephant in Portugal and that these features depicted by D rer are parts of the armour 27 Alternatively D rer s armour may represent the heavy folds of thick skin of an Indian rhinoceros or as with the other inaccuracies may simply be misunderstandings or creative additions by D rer 28 D rer also draws a scaly texture over the body of the animal including the armour This may be D rer s attempt to reflect the rough and almost hairless hide of the Indian rhinoceros which has wart like bumps covering its upper legs and shoulders On the other hand his depiction of the texture may represent dermatitis induced by the rhinoceros close confinement during the four month journey by ship from India to Portugal 29 ",
