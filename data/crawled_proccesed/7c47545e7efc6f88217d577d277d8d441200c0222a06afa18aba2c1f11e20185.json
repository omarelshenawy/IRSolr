			"previous": " The Earth s crust or lithosphere is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying mantle It has been generated greatly by igneous processes in which magma cools and solidifies to form solid rock Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the decay of radioactive elements The mantle though solid is in a state of rheic convection This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move albeit slowly The resulting process is known as plate tectonics Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material or of rising mantle at mid ocean ridges and mantle plumes ",
