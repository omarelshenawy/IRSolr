			"after": " Pelicans are very large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook at the end of the upper mandible and the attachment of a huge gular pouch to the lower The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and sometimes rainwater 18 though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish the tongue itself is tiny 43 They have a long neck and short stout legs with large fully webbed feet Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds 44 they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water 18 The tail is short and square The wings are long and broad suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers 45 ",
