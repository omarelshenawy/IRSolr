			"previous": " Metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities such as synthesis gas and other high CO environments The corrosion manifests itself as a break up of bulk metal to metal powder The suspected mechanism is firstly the deposition of a graphite layer on the surface of the metal usually from carbon monoxide CO in the vapour phase This graphite layer is then thought to form metastable M3C species where M is the metal which migrate away from the metal surface However in some regimes no M3C species is observed indicating a direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer ",
