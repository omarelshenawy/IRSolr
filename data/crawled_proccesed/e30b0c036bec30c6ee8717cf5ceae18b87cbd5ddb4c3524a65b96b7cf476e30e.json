			"previous": " During the first publications of Leaves of Grass Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again specifically with Brooklyn s Daily Times starting in May 1857 59 As an editor he oversaw the paper s contents contributed book reviews and wrote editorials 60 He left the job in 1859 though it is unclear if he was fired or chose to leave 61 Whitman who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals left very little information about himself in the late 1850s 62 ",
			"after": " As the American Civil War was beginning Whitman published his poem Beat Beat Drums as a patriotic rally call for the North 63 Whitman s brother George had joined the Union army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front 64 On December 16 1862 a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the New York Tribune included First Lieutenant G W Whitmore which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George 65 He made his way south immediately to find him though his wallet was stolen on the way 66 Walking all day and night unable to ride trying to get information trying to get access to big people Whitman later wrote 67 he eventually found George alive with only a superficial wound on his cheek 65 Whitman profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs left for Washington on December 28 1862 with the intention of never returning to New York 66 ",
