			"previous": " The term outer space was used as early as 1842 by the English poet Lady Emmeline Stuart Wortley in her poem The Maiden of Moscow 28 The expression outer space was used as an astronomical term by Alexander von Humboldt in 1845 29 It was later popularized in the writings of H G Wells in 1901 30 The shorter term space is actually older first used to mean the region beyond Earth s sky in John Milton s Paradise Lost in 1667 31 ",
			"after": " According to the Big Bang theory the Universe originated in an extremely hot and dense state about 13 8 billion years ago 32 and began expanding rapidly About 380 000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen the so called recombination epoch When this happened matter and energy became decoupled allowing photons to travel freely through space 33 The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars galaxies and other astronomical objects leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space 34 As light has a finite velocity this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable Universe 33 This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite ",
