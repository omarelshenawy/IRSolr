			"previous": " It is evident how much he learned from Arcangelo Corelli about writing for instruments and from Alessandro Scarlatti about writing for the solo voice but there is no single composer who taught him how to write for chorus 60 Handel tended more and more to replace Italian soloists by English ones The most significant reason for this change was the dwindling financial returns from his operas 61 Thus a tradition was created for oratorios which was to govern their future performance The performances were given without costumes and action the singers appeared in their own clothes 62 ",
			"after": " In 1736 Handel produced Alexander s Feast John Beard appeared for the first time as one of Handel s principal singers and became Handel s permanent tenor soloist for the rest of Handel s life 63 The piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works In Saul Handel was collaborating with Charles Jennens and experimenting with three trombones a carillon and extra large military kettledrums from the Tower of London to be sure it will be most excessive noisy 64 Saul and Israel in Egypt both from 1739 head the list of great mature oratorios in which the da capo aria became the exception and not the rule 65 Israel in Egypt consists of little else but choruses borrowing from the Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline In his next works Handel changed his course In these works he laid greater stress on the effects of orchestra and soloists the chorus retired into the background 66 L Allegro il Penseroso ed il Moderato has a rather diverting character the work is light and fresh ",
