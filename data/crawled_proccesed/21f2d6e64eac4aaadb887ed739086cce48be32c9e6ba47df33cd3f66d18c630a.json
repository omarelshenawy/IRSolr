			"previous": " Debates ensued over the fate of the Marysvale branch line The mines at the end of the line had long closed the last train to traverse the entire length of the line passed through in 1970 Still farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years However this line was severely damaged with several washed out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line 38 ",
			"after": " The residents of Richfield pressured the Rio Grande to use the portion of the line that was still intact and build a connection to an existing Union Pacific line near Nephi roughly parallel to State Route 28 However the railroad determined that including land acquisition the cost would be comparable to rebuilding the old route In addition the Rio Grande would have to pay trackage rights to the Union Pacific for the connection from Nephi which would further erode profits on a line that was barely profitable In the end the Rio Grande sold the line to a scrap dealer who dismantled it 38 A 2002 study placed the cost of rebuilding the modified routing of the Marysvale branch line at 80 million equivalent to 105 million in 2015 37 ",
