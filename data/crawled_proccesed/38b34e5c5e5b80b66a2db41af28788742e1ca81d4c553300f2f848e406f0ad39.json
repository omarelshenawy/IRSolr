			"after": " Color tubes use three different phosphors which emit red green and blue light respectively They are packed together in stripes as in aperture grille designs or clusters called triads as in shadow mask CRTs 18 Color CRTs have three electron guns one for each primary color arranged either in a straight line or in an equilateral triangular configuration the guns are usually constructed as a single unit The triangular configuration is often called delta gun based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor 19 A shadow mask tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube 18 the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back if they are not absorbed e g due to local charge accumulation instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random wrong spot on the screen Another type of color CRT uses an aperture grille of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result 19 ",
