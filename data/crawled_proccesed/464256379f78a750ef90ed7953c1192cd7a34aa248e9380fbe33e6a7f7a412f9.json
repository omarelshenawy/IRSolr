			"after": " A dimmer is a device used to vary the average voltage applied to an instrument s lamp The brightness of a lamp is proportional to its electric current which in turn is proportional to the applied lamp voltage When the applied voltage is decreased a lamp s electric current will also decrease thus reducing the light output from the lamp dimming it Conversely a higher voltage will cause higher lamp current and increased brighter light output Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called racks or dimmer racks that draw significant three phase power They are often removable modules that range from 20 ampere 2 4 kilowatt to 100 ampere units ",
