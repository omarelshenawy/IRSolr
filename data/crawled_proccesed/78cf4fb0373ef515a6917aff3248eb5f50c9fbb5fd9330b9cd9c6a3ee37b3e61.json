			"previous": " The first provincial production of The Mikado opened on 27 July 1885 in Brighton with several members of that company leaving in August to present the first authorised American production in New York From then on The Mikado was a constant presence on tour From 1885 until the Company s closure in 1982 there was no year in which a D Oyly Carte company or several of them was not presenting it ",
			"after": " In America as had happened with H M S Pinafore the first productions were unauthorised but once D Oyly Carte s American production opened in August 1885 it was a success earning record profits and Carte formed several companies to tour the show in North America 25 Burlesque and parody productions including political parodies were mounted 26 About 150 unauthorised versions cropped up and as had been the case with Pinafore there was nothing that Carte or Gilbert and Sullivan could do about it since there was no copyright treaty at the time 2 27 In Australia The Mikado s first authorised performance was on 14 November 1885 at the Theatre Royal Sydney produced by J C Williamson During 1886 Carte was touring five Mikado companies in North America 28 ",
