			"previous": " A mean sidereal day is about 23 h 56 m 4 1 s in length However due to variations in the rotation rate of the Earth the rate of an ideal sidereal clock deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock In practice the difference is kept track of by the difference UTC UT1 which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and available to the public at the IERS and at the United States Naval Observatory ",
