			"previous": " The Combat Talon was initially developed between December 1964 and January 1967 by Lockheed Air Services LAS at Ontario California as the result of a study by Big Safari the USAF s program office responsible for modification and sustainment of special mission aircraft From it two highly classified test bed aircraft originally serial no 64 0506 and 0507 but with all numbers sanitized from the aircraft were assigned to Project Thin Slice to develop a low level clandestine penetration aircraft suitable for Special Forces operations in Southeast Asia 9 In 1964 Lockheed had modified six C 123B Providers for unconventional warfare under Project Duck Hook and then been tasked with adapting the C 130E when the Duck Hook aircraft proved inadequate for the newly launched MACV SOG 10 The modifications under Thin Slice and its August 1966 successor Heavy Chain were code named Rivet Yard and the four C 130Es came to be known as Yards 9 Discrete modification tests were conducted by the 1198th Operational Evaluation and Training Squadron out of Area II of Norton AFB at San Bernardino California 30 miles east of Ontario 11 12 ",
			"after": " As the Thin Slice aircraft were being developed SOG requirements resulted in the procurement of 14 C 130Es in 1965 for similar modification The first aircraft were production C 130Es without specialized equipment that were produced at Lockheed s facility in Marietta Georgia Production airplanes were modified with the installation of the Fulton STARS then ARS system at the rate of three aircraft per month 10 While awaiting installation of the ARS equipment the C 130s were ferried to Greenville South Carolina for painting by Ling Temco Vought Electrosystems with a low radar reflective paint that added 370 pounds to their weight The velvet black and green scheme resulted in the aircraft being nicknamed Blackbirds 13 As installation was completed the Blackbirds were returned to Ontario for installation of the electronics package code named Rivet Clamp The aircraft modified became known as Clamps two of the original 14 64 0564 and 0565 were diverted to Heavy Chain in August 1966 10 The aircraft collectively were assigned the designation Combat Talon in 1967 14 ",
