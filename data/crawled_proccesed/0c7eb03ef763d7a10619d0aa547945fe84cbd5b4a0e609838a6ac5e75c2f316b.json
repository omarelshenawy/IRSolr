			"previous": " By the afternoon of October 9 only six of the brigade s tanks remained in action defending a clear path into northern Israel After the brigade s tanks were down to their last few rounds they began to pull back However right then a force of some 15 tanks which had been scrambled by Lt Col Yossi Ben Hanan arrived Although the group was in fact an improptu force of repaired tanks which had injured men among their crews the Syrians who had been exhausted by three days of continuous fighting believed that the Israeli reserves were now arriving and began to retreat 219 ",
			"after": " To the south the Israeli Barak Armored Brigade was bereft of any natural defenses The Syrians were initially slowed down by a minefield The Barak Brigade s gunners inflicted severe losses on the Syrians with accurate cannon fire but Syrians continued pushing and the Barak Brigade began to take heavy casualties The Israelis continued to fight desperately hoping to buy time for reserve forces to reach the front lines In several instances some tank crews sacrificed themselves rather than voluntarily give ground 221 ",
