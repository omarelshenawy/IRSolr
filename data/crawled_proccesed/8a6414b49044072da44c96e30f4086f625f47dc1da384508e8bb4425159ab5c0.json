			"previous": " The country is home to some of the world s rarest plants and animals but human habitation and the introduction of non native species have threatened its indigenous flora and fauna 42 Due to its volcanic origin age isolation and its unique terrain Mauritius is home to a diversity of flora and fauna not usually found in such a small area Before its discovery by the Portuguese in 1507 there were no terrestrial mammals on the island This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species The arrival of man saw the introduction of invasive alien species and the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna Less than 2 of the native forest that once stretched from the mountain tops of the central plateau to the shore now remains concentrated in the Black River Gorges National Park in the southwest the Bamboo Mountain Range in the southeast and the Moka Port Louis Ranges in the northwest There are also some isolated mountains Corps de Garde Le Morne Brabant and several offshore islands with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened Conservation activities began in the 1980s with the implementation of programmes for the reproduction of threatened bird and plant species as well as habitat restoration in the national parks and nature reserves 53 ",
			"after": " When it was discovered the island of Mauritius was the home of a previously unknown species of bird the dodo Dodos were descendents of a type of pigeon which settled in Mauritius over four million years ago With no predators to attack them they lost their need and ability to fly In 1505 the Portuguese became the first humans to set foot on Mauritius The island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade Weighing up to 50 pounds the dodo was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors Large numbers of dodos were killed for food Later when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony new species were introduced to the island Rats pigs and monkeys ate dodo eggs in the ground nests The combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced the dodo population Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius the once abundant dodo became a rare bird The last one was killed in 1681 54 The dodo is prominently featured as a heraldic supporter of the national Coat of arms of Mauritius ",
