			"after": " In 2004 Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership TCO of Windows Server 2003 to Linux the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company i e lower TCO 126 This spurred a wave of related studies a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products 127 Another study released by the Open Source Development Labs claimed that the Microsoft studies were simply outdated and one sided and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons 128 ",
