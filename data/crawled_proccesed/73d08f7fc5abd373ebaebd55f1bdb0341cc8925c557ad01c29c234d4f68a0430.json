			"previous": " Rockne was not the first coach to use the forward pass but he helped popularize it nationally Most football historians agree that a few schools notably St Louis University under coach Eddie Cochems Michigan Carlisle and Minnesota had passing attacks in place before Rockne arrived at Notre Dame The great majority of passing attacks however consisted solely of short pitches and shovel passes to stationary receivers Additionally few of the major eastern teams that constituted the power center of college football at the time used the pass In the summer of 1913 while he was a lifeguard on the beach at Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio Rockne and his college teammate and roommate Gus Dorais worked on passing techniques These were employed in games by the 1913 Notre Dame squad and subsequent Harper and Rockne coached teams and included many features common in modern passing including having the passer throw the ball overhand and having the receiver run under a football and catch the ball in stride That fall Notre Dame upset heavily favored Army 35 13 at West Point thanks to a barrage of Dorais to Rockne long downfield passes The game played an important role in displaying the potency of the forward pass and open offense and convinced many coaches to add pass plays to their play books The game is dramatized in the movies Knute Rockne All American and The Long Gray Line ",
