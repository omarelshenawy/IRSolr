			"previous": " Senators face reelection every six years and representatives every two Reelections encourage candidates to focus their publicity efforts at their home states or districts 54 Running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing according to some critics 123 123 although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of Congress in touch with voters ",
			"after": " Nevertheless incumbent members of Congress running for reelection have strong advantages over challengers 42 They raise more money 47 because donors expect incumbents to win they give their funds to them rather than challengers 45 124 And donations are vital for winning elections 125 One critic compared being elected to Congress to receiving life tenure at a university 124 Another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering 126 127 After each ten year census states are allocated representatives based on population and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party As a result reelection rates of members of Congress hover around 90 percent 6 causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class 5 Academics such as Princeton s Stephen Macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering Both senators and representatives enjoy free mailing privileges called franking privileges ",
