			"previous": " As with almost every part of life at the time a medieval meal was generally a communal affair The entire household including servants would ideally dine together To sneak off to enjoy private company was considered a haughty and inefficient egotism in a world where people depended very much on each other In the 13th century English bishop Robert Grosseteste advised the Countess of Lincoln forbid dinners and suppers out of hall in secret and in private rooms for from this arises waste and no honour to the lord and lady He also recommended to watch that the servants not make off with leftovers to make merry at rere suppers rather than giving it as alms 27 Towards the end of the Middle Ages the wealthy increasingly sought to escape this regime of stern collectivism When possible rich hosts retired with their consorts to private chambers where the meal could be enjoyed in greater exclusivity and privacy Being invited to a lord s chambers was a great privilege and could be used as a way to reward friends and allies and to awe subordinates It allowed lords to distance themselves further from the household and to enjoy more luxurious treats while serving inferior food to the rest of the household that still dined in the great hall At major occasions and banquets however the host and hostess generally dined in the great hall with the other diners 29 Although there are descriptions of dining etiquette on special occasions less is known about the details of day to day meals of the elite or about the table manners of the common people and the destitute However it can be assumed there were no such extravagant luxuries as multiple courses luxurious spices or hand washing in scented water in everyday meals 30 ",
			"after": " Things were different for the wealthy Before the meal and between courses shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests so they could wash their hands as cleanliness was emphasized Social codes made it difficult for women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done Overall fine dining was a predominantly male affair and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies in waiting The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher the younger to assist the elder and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one s fellow diners 31 ",
