			"after": " Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal EM basidiomycete that forms symbiotic relationships almost exclusively with Monterey pine Pinus radiata and bishop pine Pinus muricata some collections have been made under knobcone pine Pinus attenuata 1 and ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa but only within the range of Monterey pine 5 All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to California 11 An EM symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily scattered or in groups in humus They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus vinicolor 7 and Helvella lacunosa 5 Suillus pungens is often the most abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter 5 it is one of the few species of Suillus that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year 1 especially in wet weather 5 It has also been identified in the southeastern Sierra Nevada 12 and on Santa Cruz Island 13 ",
