			"previous": " Banksia spinulosa var cunninghamii is found in 3 disjunct regions the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne East Gippsland between Lakes Entrance and Eden and in the Great Dividing Range in a band from Jervis Bay to Glen Davis in Central New South Wales while there have been collections northwards in the Dividing Range up into southeast Queensland 33 It can be an understorey plant under dense as well as open forest cover 34 ",
			"after": " Like other banksias Banksia spinulosa plays host to a wide variety of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn when other flowers are scarce Banksias have been the subject of many studies about their pollination B spinulosa is no exception A 1998 study in Bungawalbin National Park in Northern New South Wales found that B spinulosa var collina inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals including marsupials such as Antechinus flavipes Yellow footed Antechinus which carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectar eating birds making them effective pollinators 35 The same study noted that unlike other banksias studied B spinulosa var collina was visited predominantly by native bees rather than the introduced Apis mellifera European Honeybee 35 ",
