			"previous": " While military fighters require very high speeds many civil airplanes do not Yet civil aircraft designers wanted to benefit from the high power and low maintenance that a gas turbine engine offered Thus was born the idea to mate a turbine engine to a traditional propeller Because gas turbines optimally spin at high speed a turboprop features a gearbox to lower the speed of the shaft so that the propeller tips don t reach supersonic speeds Often the turbines that drive the propeller are separate from the rest of the rotating components so that they can rotate at their own best speed referred to as a free turbine engine A turboprop is very efficient when operated within the realm of cruise speeds it was designed for which is typically 200 to 400 mph 320 to 640 km h ",
			"after": " Turboshaft engines are used primarily for helicopters and auxiliary power units A turboshaft engine is similar in principle but in a turboprop the propeller is supported by the engine and the engine is bolted to the airframe in a turboshaft the engine does not provide any direct physical support to the helicopter s rotors The rotor is connected to a transmission which is bolted to the airframe and the turboshaft engine drives the transmission The distinction is seen by some as slim as in some cases aircraft companies make both turboprop and turboshaft engines based on the same design ",
