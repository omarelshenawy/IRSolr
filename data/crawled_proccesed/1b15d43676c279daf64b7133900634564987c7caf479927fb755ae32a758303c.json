			"after": " Like many plants in south west Western Australia B prionotes is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire reseeders are killed by fire but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank thus promoting recruitment of the next generation resprouters survive fire resprouting from a lignotuber or more rarely epicormic buds protected by thick bark B prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark and so cannot be considered a resprouter yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height the sparseness of its foliage and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier On the other hand it is not a typical reseeder either because of its relatively low fire mortality rates and because it is only weakly serotinous although fire promotes seed release seed release still occurs in the absence of fire 46 ",
