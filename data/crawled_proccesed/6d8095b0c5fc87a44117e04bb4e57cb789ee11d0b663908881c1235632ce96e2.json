			"after": " Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter The geothermal energy of the Earth s crust originates from the original formation of the planet 20 and from radioactive decay of minerals 80 136 The geothermal gradient which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots ge meaning earth and thermos meaning hot ",
