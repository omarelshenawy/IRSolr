			"previous": " Although the rocks in Banff Park were laid down as sediments between 600 Ma to 175 Ma the main period of mountain building occurred between 80 120 million years ago as a result of the shortening and deformation of the ancient continental shelf as exotic island terranes collided and were accreted onto the continent s margin The shortening was accommodated by thrust faults and associated folds 23 ",
			"after": " Erosion accompanied and outlasted the uplift of the Canadian Rockies with a probable rejuvenation and acceleration of erosion rates since Pliocene time as the Earth entered a period of extensive glaciation Glacial landforms overwhelmingly dominate Banff s geomorphology with examples of all classic glacial forms cirques ar tes hanging valleys moraines U shaped valleys et al The pre existing structure left over from mountain building has strongly guided glacial erosion mountains in Banff include complex irregular anticlinal synclinal castellate dogtooth and sawback mountains 24 and many of the mountain ranges trend North Northeast with sedimentary layering dipping down to the West at 40 60 degrees This leads to dip slope landforms with generally steeper East and North faces and trellis drainage where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the geological succession 23 ",
