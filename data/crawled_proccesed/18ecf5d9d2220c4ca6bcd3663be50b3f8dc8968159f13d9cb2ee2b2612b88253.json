			"after": " Higher order logics allow for quantification not only of elements of the domain of discourse but subsets of the domain of discourse sets of such subsets and other objects of higher type The semantics are defined so that rather than having a separate domain for each higher type quantifier to range over the quantifiers instead range over all objects of the appropriate type The logics studied before the development of first order logic for example Frege s logic had similar set theoretic aspects Although higher order logics are more expressive allowing complete axiomatizations of structures such as the natural numbers they do not satisfy analogues of the completeness and compactness theorems from first order logic and are thus less amenable to proof theoretic analysis ",
