			"after": " A sprint finish is a racing tactic where a competitor accelerates towards top speed in the final stages of a race This tactic is mostly associated with long distance forms of running and cycling which often feature large groups of competitors racing at a slower pace for much of the race this slower aerobic racing allows for the subsequent anaerobic activity required for sprinting 3 The tactic relies upon keeping greater energy reserves than your opponent until the last part of the race in order to be able to reach the finish point first It is the opposing tactic to keeping a steady optimal pace throughout a race to maximise your energy efficiency see running economy 4 ",
