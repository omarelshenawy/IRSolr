			"previous": " Initially the new capital thrived But Lamar s political enemy Sam Houston used two Mexican army incursions to San Antonio as an excuse to move the government Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar s decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well By 1840 the population had risen to 856 of whom nearly half fled from Austin when Congress recessed 32 The resident Black population listed in January of this same year was 176 33 The fear of Austin s proximity to the Indians and Mexico which still considered Texas a part of their land created an immense motive for Sam Houston the first and third President of the Republic of Texas to relocate the capital once again in 1841 Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the Archive War but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed The documents stayed but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to Washington on the Brazos Without the governmental body Austin s population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s The voting by the fourth President of the Republic Anson Jones and Congress who reconvened in Austin in 1845 settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States ",
