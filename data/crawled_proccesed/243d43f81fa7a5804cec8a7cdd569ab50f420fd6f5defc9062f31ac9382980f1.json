			"previous": " The rings are more visible in temperate zones where the seasons differ more markedly The inner portion of a growth ring is formed early in the growing season when growth is comparatively rapid hence the wood is less dense and is known as early wood or spring wood or late spring wood 16 the outer portion is the late wood and has sometimes been termed summer wood often being produced in the summer though sometimes in the autumn and is denser 17 ",
			"after": " Many trees in temperate zones make one growth ring each year with the newest adjacent to the bark Hence for these for the entire period of a tree s life a year by year record or ring pattern is formed that reflects the age of the tree and the climatic conditions in which the tree grew Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring while a drought year may result in a very narrow one ",
