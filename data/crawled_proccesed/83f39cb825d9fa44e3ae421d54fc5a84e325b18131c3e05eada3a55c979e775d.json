			"previous": " The strength of the fleets of the Kingdom of England was an important element in the kingdom s power in the 10th century 7 At one point Aethelred II had an especially large fleet built by a national levy of one ship for every 310 hides of land but it is uncertain whether this was a standard or exceptional model for raising fleets 8 During the period of Danish rule in the 11th century the authorities maintained a standing fleet by taxation and this continued for a time under the restored English regime of Edward the Confessor reigned 1042 1066 who frequently commanded fleets in person 9 ",
			"after": " English naval power seems to have declined as a result of the Norman conquest 10 Medieval fleets in England as elsewhere were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war From time to time a few king s ships owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes but unlike some European states England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime England s naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilisation of fleets when war broke out was slow 11 ",
