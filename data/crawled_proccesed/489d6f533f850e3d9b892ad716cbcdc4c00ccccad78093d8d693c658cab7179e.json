			"after": " Scramjets are mechanically very similar to ramjets Like a ramjet they consist of an inlet a combustor and a nozzle The primary difference between ramjets and scramjets is that scramjets do not slow the oncoming airflow to subsonic speeds for combustion they use supersonic combustion instead The name scramjet comes from supersonic combusting ramjet Since scramjets use supersonic combustion they can operate at speeds above Mach 6 where traditional ramjets are too inefficient Another difference between ramjets and scramjets comes from how each type of engine compresses the oncoming airflow while the inlet provides most of the compression for ramjets the high speeds at which scramjets operate allow them to take advantage of the compression generated by shock waves primarily oblique shocks 20 ",
