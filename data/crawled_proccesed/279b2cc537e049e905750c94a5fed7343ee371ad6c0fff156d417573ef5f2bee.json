			"after": " Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells To the immune system these antigens appear foreign and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources 85 some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus which causes cervical cancer 86 while others are the organism s own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that when expressed at high levels transforms certain skin cells e g melanocytes into tumors called melanomas 87 88 A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes 85 89 90 ",
