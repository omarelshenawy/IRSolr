			"previous": " The slavery issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with Republicanism in the United States or a state based property system compatible with and protected by the Constitution as had been the case in the Roman Republic 15 The strategy of the anti slavery forces was containment to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction 16 To slave holding interests in the South this strategy was perceived as infringing upon their Constitutional rights 17 Slavery was being phased out of existence in the North where Coloured men had in some cases been granted the franchise or even served as representatives it was fading in the border states and urban areas but was expanding in highly profitable cotton districts of the south ",
			"after": " Despite compromises in 1820 and 1850 the slavery issues exploded in the 1850s Causes include controversy over admitting Missouri as a slave state in 1820 the acquisition of Texas as a slave state in 1845 and the status of slavery in western territories won as a result of the Mexican American War and the resulting Compromise of 1850 19 Following the U S victory over Mexico Northerners attempted to exclude slavery from conquered territories in the Wilmot Proviso although it passed the House it failed in the Senate Northern and British readers recoiled in anger at the horrors of slavery as described in the novel and play Uncle Tom s Cabin 1852 by abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe 20 21 Irreconcilable disagreements over slavery ended the Whig and Know Nothing political parties and later split the Democratic Party between North and South while the new Republican Party angered slavery interests by demanding a definite end to its expansion Most observers believed that without expansion slavery would eventually die out Lincoln argued this in 1845 and 1858 22 23 ",
