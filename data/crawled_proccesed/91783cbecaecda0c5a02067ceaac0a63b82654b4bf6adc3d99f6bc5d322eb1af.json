			"previous": " Magpie attacks can cause injuries typically wounds to the head and particularly the eyes with potential detached retinas and bacterial infections from a beak used to fossick in the ground 89 A 13 year old boy died from tetanus apparently from a magpie injury in northern New South Wales in 1946 89 Being unexpectedly swooped while cycling is not uncommon and can result in loss of control of the bicycle which may cause injury 90 91 In Ipswich a 12 year old boy was killed in traffic while trying to evade a swooping magpie on 16 August 2010 92 ",
			"after": " If it is necessary to walk near the nest wearing a broad brimmed or legionnaire s hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the head and neck 93 Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists 94 Attaching a long pole with a flag to a bike is an effective deterrent 95 As of 2008 the use of cable ties on helmets has become common and appears to be effective 96 Magpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head therefore keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird Using a basic disguise to fool the magpie as to where a person is looking such as painting eyes on a hat or wearing sunglasses on the back of the head can also prove effective In some cases magpies may become extremely aggressive and attack people s faces it may become very difficult to deter these birds from swooping Once attacked shouting aggressively and waving one s arms at the bird should deter a second attack If a bird presents a serious nuisance the local authorities may arrange for that bird to be legally destroyed or more commonly to be caught and relocated to an unpopulated area 97 Magpies have to be moved some distance as almost all are able to find their way home from distances of less than 25 km 15 mi 98 Removing the nest is of no use as birds will breed again and possibly be more aggressive the second time around 99 ",
