			"after": " U S President Nixon dispatched more bombers to provide air support for ARVN when it seemed that South Vietnam was about to be overrun In desperation President Nguy n V n Thi u fired the incompetent General Ho ng Xu n L m and replaced him with ARVN s best commander General Ng Quang Tr ng He gave the order that all deserters would be executed and pulled enough forces together so that the North Vietnamese army failed to take Hu Finally largely as a result of U S air and naval support as well as determination by ARVN soldiers the Easter Offensive was halted ",
