			"previous": " French philosophe Voltaire 1694 1778 had an enormous influence on the art of history writing His best known histories are The Age of Louis XIV 1751 and Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations 1756 My chief object he wrote in 1739 is not political or military history it is the history of the arts of commerce of civilization in a word of the human mind 12 He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events and emphasized customs social history and achievements in the arts and sciences He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world eliminating theological frameworks and emphasizing economics culture and political history ",
