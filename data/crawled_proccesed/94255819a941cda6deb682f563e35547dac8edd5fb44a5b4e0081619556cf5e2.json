			"previous": " At some point in February 1692 likely after the afflictions began but before specific names were mentioned a neighbor of Rev Parris Mary Sibly or Sibley aunt of the afflicted Mary Walcott instructed John Indian one of the minister s slaves to make a witch cake using traditional English white magic to discover the identity of the witch who was afflicting the girls The cake made from rye meal and urine from the afflicted girls was fed to a dog According to English folk understanding of how witches accomplished affliction when the dog ate the cake the witch herself would be hurt because invisible particles she had sent to afflict the girls remained in the girls urine and her cries of pain when the dog ate the cake would identify her as the witch This superstition was based on the Cartesian Doctrine of Effluvia which posited that witches afflicted by the use of venomous and malignant particles that were ejected from the eye according to the October 8 1692 letter of Thomas Brattle a contemporary critic of the trials 60 ",
			"after": " According to the Records of the Salem Village Church Parris spoke with Sibly or Sibley privately on March 25 1692 about her grand error and accepted her sorrowful confession During his Sunday sermon on March 27 he addressed his congregation on the subject of the calamities that had begun in his own household but stated it never brake forth to any considerable light until diabolical means were used by the making of a cake by my Indian man who had his direction from this our sister Mary Sibly going on to admonish all against the use of any kind of magic even white magic because it was essentially going to the Devil for help against the Devil Mary Sibly or Sibley publicly acknowledged the error of her actions before the congregation who voted by a show of hands that they were satisfied with her admission of error 61 Other instances appear in the records of the episode that demonstrated a continued belief by members of the community in this effluvia as legitimate evidence including accounts in two statements against Elizabeth Howe that people had suggested cutting off and burning an ear of two different animals Howe was thought to have afflicted to prove she was the one who had bewitched them to death 62 ",
