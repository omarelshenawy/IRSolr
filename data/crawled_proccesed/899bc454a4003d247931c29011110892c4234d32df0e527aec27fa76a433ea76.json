			"after": " In Japanese folklore the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories those who employ snakes as familiars and those who employ foxes 121  The fox witch is by far the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types the kitsune mochi and the tsukimono suji The first of these the kitsune mochi is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods The kitsune mochi then strikes up a deal with the fox typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox s magical services The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself imbued with powers of shape changing possession and illusion These creatures can be either nefarious disguising themselves as women in order to trap men or they can be benign forces as in the story of The Grateful foxes 122 However once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master s enemies The most feared power of the kitsune mochi is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans This process of possession is called Kitsunetsuki ",
