			"after": " Because it is lighter than air airships and balloons are inflated with helium for lift While hydrogen gas is also buoyant helium has the advantage of being non flammable in addition to being fire retardant Another minor use is in rocketry where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles For example the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370 000 m3 13 million cubic feet of helium to launch 48 ",
