			"previous": " A male greater crested tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory If the intruder is another male it retaliates in kind and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male s aggression enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display including head raising and bowing this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak calling loudly its partner may also fly but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged 25 ",
			"after": " The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open flat or occasionally sloping ground It is often unlined but sometimes includes stones or cuttlefish bones One sometimes two eggs are laid and incubated by both parents for 25 to 30 days prior to hatching 14 The eggs are cream with blackish streaks 26 Egg laying is synchronised within a breeding colony 27 and more tightly so within sub colonies 28 Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched chicks but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two days old shortly before they begin to wander from the nest 29 The precocial chicks which are very pale with black speckling are brooded and fed by both parents but may gather in cr ches when older The young terns fledge after 38 to 40 days but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until they are about four months old 14 ",
