			"previous": " In the late 1970s operating cost replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases 6 As a result the 767 s design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset 5 Boeing targeted a 20 to 30 percent cost saving over earlier aircraft mainly through new engine and wing technology 6 As development progressed engineers used computer aided design for over one third of the 767 s design drawings 6 and performed 26 000 hours of wind tunnel tests 16 Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost 10 12 Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features including avionics flight management systems instruments and handling characteristics 17 Combined development costs were estimated at 3 5 to 4 billion 6 ",
			"after": " Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner 18 Both jet engine models had a maximum output of 48 000 pounds force 210 kN of thrust 9 The engines were mounted approximately one third the length of the wing from the fuselage similar to previous wide body trijets 6 The larger wings were designed using an aft loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer s previous aircraft 6 19 The wings provided higher altitude cruise performance added fuel capacity and expansion room for future stretched variants 16 The initial 767 200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic 20 and would be capable of operating routes up to 3 850 nautical miles 7 130 km 21 ",
