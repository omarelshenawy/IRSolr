			"previous": " Gilbert was much hurt but Sullivan insisted that he could not set the lozenge plot In addition to the improbability of it it was too similar to the plot of their 1877 opera The Sorcerer Sullivan returned to London and as April wore on Gilbert tried to rewrite his plot but he could not satisfy Sullivan The parties were at a stalemate and Gilbert wrote And so ends a musical literary association of seven years standing an association of exceptional reputation an association unequaled in its monetary results and hitherto undisturbed by a single jarring or discordant element 8 However by 8 May 1884 Gilbert was ready to back down writing am I to understand that if I construct another plot in which no supernatural element occurs you will undertake to set it a consistent plot free from anachronisms constructed in perfect good faith to the best of my ability 9 The stalemate was broken and on 20 May Gilbert sent Sullivan a sketch of the plot to The Mikado 9 It would take another ten months for The Mikado to reach the stage A revised version of their 1877 work The Sorcerer coupled with their one act piece Trial by Jury 1875 played at the Savoy while Carte and their audiences awaited their next work Gilbert eventually found a place for his lozenge plot in The Mountebanks written with Alfred Cellier in 1892 ",
