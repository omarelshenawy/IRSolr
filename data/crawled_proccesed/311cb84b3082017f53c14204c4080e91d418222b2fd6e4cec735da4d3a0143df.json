			"previous": " Belgium continued to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II with a mandate to oversee independence 32 33 Tension escalated between the Tutsi who favoured early independence and the Hutu emancipation movement culminating in the 1959 Rwandan Revolution Hutu activists began killing Tutsi forcing more than 100 000 to seek refuge in neighbouring countries 34 35 In 1961 the now pro Hutu Belgians held a referendum in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence in 1962 36 Cycles of violence followed with exiled Tutsi attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu retaliating with large scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi 37 In 1973 Juv nal Habyarimana took power in a military coup Pro Hutu discrimination continued but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount of violence against Tutsi 38 The Twa remained marginalised and by 1990 were almost entirely forced out of the forests by the government many became beggars 39 Rwanda s population had increased from 1 6 million people in 1934 to 7 1 million in 1989 leading to competition for land 40 ",
