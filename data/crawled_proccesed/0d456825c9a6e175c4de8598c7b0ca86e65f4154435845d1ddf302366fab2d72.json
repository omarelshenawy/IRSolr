			"previous": " Figural sculpture on friezes and panels changed during the period The heroes from the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata depicted often in early temples become fewer limited to only a few narrow friezes there is a corresponding increase in the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses in later temples 57 Depiction of deities above miniature towers in the recesses with a decorative lintel above is common in 12th century temples but not in later ones 41 Figures of holy men and dancing girls were normally sculpted for deep niches and recesses The use of bracket figures depicting dancing girls became common on pillars under beams and cornices Among animal sculptures the elephant appears more often than the horse its broad volumes offered fields for ornamentation 57 Erotic sculptures are rarely seen in Chalukyan temples the Tripurantakesvara Temple at Balligavi is an exception Here erotic sculpture is limited to a narrow band of friezes that run around the exterior of the temple 58 ",
