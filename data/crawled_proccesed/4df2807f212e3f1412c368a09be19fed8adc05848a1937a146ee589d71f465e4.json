			"previous": " Judaism does not generally allow multiple bodies in a grave An exception to this is a grave in the military cemetery in Jerusalem where there is a kever achim Hebrew grave of brothers where two soldiers were killed together in a tank and are buried in one grave As the bodies were so fused together with the metal of the tank that they could not be separately identified they were buried in one grave along with parts of the tank ",
			"after": " There are several common alternatives to burial In cremation the body of the deceased is burned in a special oven Most of the body is burnt during the cremation process leaving only a few pounds of bone fragments Bodies of small children and infants often produce very little in the way of ashes as ashes are composed of bone and young people have softer bones largely cartilage Often these fragments are processed ground into a fine powder which has led to cremated remains being called ashes In recent times cremation has become a popular option in the western world ",
