			"after": " Galileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering as distinct from pure physics This is not the same distinction as made by Aristotle who would have considered all Galileo s physics as techne or useful knowledge as opposed to episteme or philosophical investigation into the causes of things Between 1595 and 1598 Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and Military Compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccol Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte For gunners it offered in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials As a geometric instrument it enabled the construction of any regular polygon computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector and a variety of other calculations Under Galileo s direction instrument maker Marc Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses which Galileo sold along with an instruction manual he wrote for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire 112 ",
