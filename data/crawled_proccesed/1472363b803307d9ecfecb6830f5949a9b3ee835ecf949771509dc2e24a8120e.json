			"after": " In 1714 the British government offered a longitude prize for a method of determining longitude at sea with the awards ranging from 10 000 to 20 000 2 million to 4 million in 2015 terms depending on accuracy John Harrison a Yorkshire carpenter submitted a project in 1730 and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 completed in 1741 used this system but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea Construction of his third machine designated H3 in 1759 included novel circular balances and the invention of the bi metallic strip and caged roller bearings inventions which are still widely used However H3 s circular balances still proved too inaccurate and he eventually abandoned the large machines 7 ",
