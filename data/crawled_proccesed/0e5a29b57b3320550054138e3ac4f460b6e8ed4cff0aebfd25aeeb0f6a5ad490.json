			"previous": " In the Early Dynastic Period c 3100 2686 BC the first pharaohs built funerary complexes in the religious center of Abydos following a single general pattern with a rectangular mud brick enclosure 39 In the Old Kingdom c 2686 2181 BC that followed the Early Dynastic Period royal funerary monuments greatly expanded while most divine temples remained comparatively small suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized the cult of the divine king more than the direct worship of deities 40 Deities closely connected with the king such as the sun god Ra and the goddess Hathor received more royal contributions than other deities 41 Ra s temple at Heliopolis was one of the great religious centers of the age and several Old Kingdom pharaohs built large sun temples in his honor near their pyramids 42 Meanwhile the small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from Predynastic times unaffected by the royal cult sites 43 ",
			"after": " The expansion of funerary monuments began in the reign of Djoser who built his complex entirely of stone and placed in the enclosure a step pyramid under which he was buried the Pyramid of Djoser For the rest of the Old Kingdom tomb and temple were joined in elaborate stone pyramid complexes 44 Near each pyramid complex was a town that supplied its needs as towns would support temples throughout Egyptian history Other changes came in the reign of Sneferu who beginning with his first pyramid at Meidum built pyramid complexes symmetrically along an east west axis with a valley temple on the banks of the Nile linked to a pyramid temple at the foot of the pyramid Sneferu s immediate successors followed this pattern but beginning in the late Old Kingdom pyramid complexes combined different elements from the axial plan and from the rectangular plan of Djoser 45 To supply the massive pyramid complexes kings founded new towns and farming estates on undeveloped lands across Egypt The flow of goods from these lands to the central government and its temples helped unify the kingdom 46 ",
