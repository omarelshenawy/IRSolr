			"previous": " Van der Weyden developed the conventions of northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters Rather than merely follow van Eyck s meticulous attention to detail van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations He was highly sought after as a portraitist yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings which met common ideals of rank and piety These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter 152 ",
			"after": " Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden who in his emphasis on sculptural figures utilised very shallow pictorial spaces 154 In his 1462 Portrait of a Man Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape 155 while in the 1500s the full length portrait became popular in the north The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts 156 Full length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society and were associated with princely displays of power 157 Of the second generation of northern painters Hans Memling became the leading portraitist taking commissions from as far as Italy He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo s positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view 158 Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff 159 and Martin Schongauer among others 160 ",
