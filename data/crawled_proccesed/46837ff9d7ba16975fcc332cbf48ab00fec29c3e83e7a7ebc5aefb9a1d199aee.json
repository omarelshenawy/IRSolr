			"previous": " Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth where the gills curve up to join the stipe but then close to the stipe the margin turns down again and initially narrow but broaden when old They are pallid to grayish olive with bright orange edges 13 Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens because the pigment rather than being encrusted on the walls of the cystidia is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible 16 The gills are spaced close together with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe 14 and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe 15 The cylindrical stipe is 3 6 cm 1 2 2 4 in long by 0 1 0 2 cm 0 04 0 08 in thick hollow and stiff but flexible 13 it is somewhat thicker at the base 17 It has a brownish to grayish olive color that is sometimes tinged with shades of orange The surface is smooth except for orange powder near the top while the base is covered with stiff orange hairs Smith reports the mushroom tissue to have no distinctive taste or odor 13 while Aronsen says the odor is very conspicuous sweet fruity often experienced as farinaceous or faintly of anise 14 Like many small Mycena species the edibility of the mushroom is unknown as it is too insubstantial to consider collecting for the table 16 ",
