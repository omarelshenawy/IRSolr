			"previous": " In the early 10th century Ab Zayd al Balkh a Persian originally from Balkh founded the Balkh school of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples products and customs of areas in the Muslim world with little interest in the non Muslim realms 45 Suhr b a late 10th century Persian geographer accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map with equirectangular projection or cylindrical equidistant projection 45 In the early 11th century Avicenna hypothesized on the geological causes of mountains in The Book of Healing 1027 ",
			"after": " In mathematical geography Persian Ab Rayh n al B r n around 1025 was the first to describe a polar equi azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere 46 He was also regarded as the most skilled when it came to mapping cities and measuring the distances between them which he did for many cities in the Middle East and western Indian subcontinent He combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations to record degrees of latitude and longitude and to measure the heights of mountains and depths of valleys recorded in The Chronology of the Ancient Nations He discussed human geography and the planetary habitability of the Earth suggesting that roughly a quarter of the Earth s surface is habitable by humans He solved a complex geodesic equation in order to accurately compute the Earth s circumference 47 His estimate of 6 339 9 km for the Earth radius was only 16 8 km less than the modern value of 6 356 7 km ",
