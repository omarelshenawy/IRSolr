			"after": " After the Lord Chamberlain s Men were renamed the King s Men in 1603 they entered a special relationship with the new King James Although the performance records are patchy the King s Men performed seven of Shakespeare s plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605 including two performances of The Merchant of Venice 118 After 1608 they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer 119 The indoor setting combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices In Cymbeline for example Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt The ghosts fall on their knees 120 ",
