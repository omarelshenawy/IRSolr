			"after": " A strategy game is a game in which the player s decision making influences the outcome significantly They are usually board games computer or video games card games or another type of game Several games include strategy extensively while others to a lesser degree complicating demarcation It is sometimes more accurate to say that some games have strategic elements rather than being a strategy game however this depends on the game The deciding factor separating strategy game from other genres is that there is either no or relatively less chance involved Usually the only physical element is the interaction with the game pieces although there are exceptions Players have similar starting positions or sitiuations but use strategy to gain advantages over others Strategy as well as tactics is dissimilar to luck in that chance based games rely more heavily on probability The word strategy is used by the military and refers to high level planning Strategy games often deal with small scale situations Tactical games a type of strategy game deal with military planning though also on a smaller scale than the military ",
