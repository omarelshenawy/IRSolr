			"previous": " In his smaller poetic works Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy which possibly influenced Housman s poetic style 179 In London his first imitation of Juvenal Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and as befits a young writer approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner 180 However his second imitation The Vanity of Human Wishes is completely different the language remains simple but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics 181 These Christian values are not unique to the poem but contain views expressed in most of Johnson s works In particular Johnson emphasises God s infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action 182 ",
			"after": " When it came to biography Johnson disagreed with Plutarch s use of biography to praise and to teach morality Instead Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation this became the subject of Rambler 60 183 Furthermore Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals too were significant 184 thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects 185 Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries including his own as one having the most significance in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life 186 ",
