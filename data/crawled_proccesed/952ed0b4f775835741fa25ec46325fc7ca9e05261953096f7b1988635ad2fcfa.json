			"previous": " At one point in its production plans to license and build the type in New Zealand were proposed The remaining tooling was purchased by Viking Air of Victoria Canada which manufactures replacement parts for most of the early de Havilland line On 24 February 2006 Viking purchased the type certificates from Bombardier Aerospace for all the original de Havilland designs 3 The ownership of the certificates gives Viking the exclusive right to manufacture new Beavers Viking now sells a remanufactured and rebuilt DHC 2T Turbo Beaver upgraded with a Pratt Whitney Canada PT6A 34 680 hp 507 kW turboprop engine With a maximum gross takeoff weight increased to 6 000 lb 2 700 kg it can carry 2 450 lb 1 110 kg of freight 4 However Viking Turbo Beavers are only rebuilt from existing air frames and are not new builds unlike Viking s own DHC 6 Series 400 Twin Otter which is manufactured from a completely new airframe ",
			"after": " Despite the fact that production ceased in 1967 hundreds of Beavers are still flying many of them heavily modified to adapt to changes in technology and needs Kenmore Air of Kenmore Washington provides Beaver and Otter airframes with zero hour fatigue life ratings and owns dozens of supplemental type certificates STCs for aircraft modifications These modifications are so well known and desirable in the aviation community rebuilt Beavers are often called Kenmore Beavers or listed as having Kenmore mods installed 5 ",
