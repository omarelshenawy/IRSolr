			"previous": " In December 1761 Brindley undertook a survey of the route at Runcorn His initial plan was to make the terminus at Hempstones east of Runcorn Gap but following a study of the tides and depth of water there he decided instead to build the terminus west of Runcorn Gap 24 This change was designed to accommodate Mersey flats although the low fixed bridges required that traffic on the canal be able to lower or unship their masts 25 Runcorn basin was almost 90 feet 27 m above the Mersey 26 so a flight of ten locks described as the wonder of their time 27 was built to connect the two Nine locks had a fall of 2 metres 7 ft with a fall at the river lock of more than 6 metres 20 ft at low water It allowed vessels to enter and leave the canal on any tide The connection to the Mersey was made on 1 January 1773 28 The river s tidal action tended to deposit silt around the lower entrance to the locks so to counteract this a channel equipped with gates at each end and known as the Duke s Gut was cut through the marshes upriver from the locks At high tide the gates were closed and with the ebb of the tide were opened to release water which scoured the silt from the entrance to the locks The cut created an island known as Runcorn Island crossed by Castle Bridge 29 30 31 ",
