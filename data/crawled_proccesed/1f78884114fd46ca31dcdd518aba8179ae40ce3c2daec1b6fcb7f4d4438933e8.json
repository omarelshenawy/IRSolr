			"previous": " Computed tomography also known as CT scanning of a complete Majungasaurus skull FMNH PR 2100 allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure Overall the brain was very small relative to body size but otherwise similar to many other non coelurosaurian theropods with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus a region of the cerebellum that helps to coordinate movements of the eye with movements of the head This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus which also had a small flocculus did not rely on quick head movements to sight and capture prey 2 ",
			"after": " Inferences about behavior can also be drawn from examination of the inner ear The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance and the lateral semicircular canal is usually parallel to the ground when the animal holds its head in an alert posture When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground the entire skull is nearly horizontal This contrasts with many other theropods where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus indicating a greater sensitivity to side to side motions of the head 2 ",
