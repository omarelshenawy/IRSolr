			"previous": " Articles make up the bulk of Wikipedia s mainspace Each article is on one topic rather than a word and its definition which belong if at all in Wikimedia s dictionary project called Wiktionary The goal of a Wikipedia article is to create a comprehensive and neutrally written summary of existing mainstream knowledge about a topic Accordingly Wikipedia does not publish original research An encyclopedia is by its nature a tertiary source that provides a survey of information already the subject of publication in the wider world Accordingly and because Wikipedia is open to editing by anyone we require that information be verifiable in reliable sources Ideally all information should be actually cited to reliable sources to evidence it is verifiable However we only mandate citations for quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged Sourcing requirements are significantly stricter in articles on living persons Please note though that we strongly discourage people from writing about themselves their friends bands websites companies or organizations pet projects personal vendettas campaigns and any other topic in which they have a conflict of interest ",
