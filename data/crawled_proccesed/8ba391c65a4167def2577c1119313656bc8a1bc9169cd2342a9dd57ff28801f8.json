			"previous": " Pitting results when a small hole or cavity forms in the metal usually as a result of de passivation of a small area This area becomes anodic while part of the remaining metal becomes cathodic producing a localized galvanic reaction The deterioration of this small area penetrates the metal and can lead to failure This form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion produced compounds ",
