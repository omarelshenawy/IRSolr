			"after": " During the early twentieth century a three way system of social segregation emerged in Austin with Anglos African Americans and Mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life including housing health care and education Many of the municipal improvement programs initiated during this period such as the construction of new roads schools and hospitals were deliberately designed to institutionalize this system of segregation Racial segregation actually increased in Austin during the first half of the twentieth century with African Americans and Mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization 44 ",
