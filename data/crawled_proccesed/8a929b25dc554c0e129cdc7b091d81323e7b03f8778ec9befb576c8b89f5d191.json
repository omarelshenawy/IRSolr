			"after": " Energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store energy to perform useful processes at a later time A device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator  Many forms of energy produce useful work heating or cooling to meet societal needs These energy forms include chemical energy gravitational potential energy electrical potential electricity temperature differences latent heat and kinetic energy Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store electricity kinetic energy etc to more conveniently or economically storable forms Some technologies provide only short term energy storage and others can be very long term such as power to gas using hydrogen or methane and the storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons in deep aquifers or bedrock A wind up clock stores potential energy in this case mechanical in the spring tension a rechargeable battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone and a hydroelectric dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy Ice storage tanks store ice thermal energy in the form of latent heat at night to meet peak demand for cooling Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels Even food which is made by the same process as fossil fuels is a form of energy stored in chemical form ",
