			"previous": " The main threat to crocodilians around the world is human activity including hunting and habitat destruction Early in the 1970s more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded driving down the majority of crocodilian populations in some cases almost to extinction Starting in 1973 CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals such as the skins of crocodiles This proved to be problematic in the 1980s as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa and it was legal to hunt them At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983 it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell the lawfully hunted skins In the late 1970s crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries started from eggs taken from the wild By the 1980s farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians By 2000 skins from twelve crocodilian species whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed were traded by thirty countries and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished 118 ",
			"after": " The gharial has undergone a chronic long term decline combined with a rapid short term decline leading the IUCN to list the species as Critically Endangered In 1946 the gharial population had been widespread numbering around 5 000 to 10 000 by 2006 however it had declined 96 98 reduced to a small number of widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals This long term decline had a number of causes including egg collection and hunting such as for indigenous medicine The rapid decline of about 58 between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat 119 The gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites 120 but as of 2013 numbers are rising due to the protection of nests against egg predators 121 The Chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds In 1972 the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the maximum amount of legal protection Since 1979 captive breeding programs were established in China and North America creating a healthy captive population 122 In 2008 alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island 123 The Philippine crocodile is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be Critically Endangered Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009 In the same year 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population Support from local people is crucial for the species survival 124 ",
