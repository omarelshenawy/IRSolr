			"after": " According to Larousse Gastronomique the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack 41 However the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground whereas most cultivars of D zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour For some people in northern Thailand the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic In Malaysia and Singapore most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open In this state the flesh becomes richly creamy slightly alcoholic 34 the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex ",
