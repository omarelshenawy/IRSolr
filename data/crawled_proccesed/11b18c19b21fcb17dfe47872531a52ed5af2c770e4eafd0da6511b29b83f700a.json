			"after": " In this method the exterior surface of the fuselage is also the primary structure A typical early form of this see the Lockheed Vega was built using molded plywood where the layers of plywood are formed over a plug or within a mold A later form of this structure uses fiberglass cloth impregnated with polyester or epoxy resin instead of plywood as the skin A simple form of this used in some amateur built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core with a fiberglass covering eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds but requiring more effort in finishing see the Rutan VariEze An example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito fighter light bomber of World War II No plywood skin fuselage is truly monocoque since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin The use of molded fiberglass using negative female molds which give a nearly finished product is prevalent in the series production of many modern sailplanes The use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner using pressure molding on female molds ",
