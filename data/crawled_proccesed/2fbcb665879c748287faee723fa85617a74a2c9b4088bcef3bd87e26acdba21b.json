			"previous": " Tabitha and Napoleon received their best reviews on SYTYCD during season seven after a performance they choreographed to the song Outta Your Mind by Lil Jon Creators com called the routine brilliantly imaginative 141 Pioneer Local called it powerful It s been so long since Tabitha and Napoleon have had a showstopping hip hop number on SYTYCD Not since Season 4 when they had Katee Joshua tWitch Mark and Chelsie have they pulled out hip hop this good 142 The routine was performed by ballet dancer Alex Wong and All Star hip hop dancer Stephen tWitch Boss from season four The concept is about a psychologist tWitch who teaches a dancer Alex to let go of his technique and inhibitions and just dance After the performance tWitch and Alex received a standing ovation from the crowd and all three judges Nigel Lythgoe Mia Michaels and Adam Shankman Host Cat Deeley commented I have never never in So You Think You Can Dance history heard a roar from a crowd like this ever 143 Lythgoe called the concept brilliant This is about a ballet dancer doing the most incredible hip hop If this routine and you are not up for an Emmy with Napoleon and Tabitha next year I don t know why not It s probably one of the funnest best hip hop routines we ve ever had on this show 144 In slight disagreement the Wall Street Journal noted that Outta Your Mind may in fact be nominated for an Emmy but it is unlikely to win because past winners have all been lyrical very emotional routines 145 ",
			"after": " On a later episode Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed a lyrical hip hop routine to Alicia Keys debut single Fallin Of the dance judge Mia Michaels stated That to me felt more real than any contemporary piece honestly because it came from such a raw raw space and place That was absolutely unbelievable and it was like watching a dance film 146 Lythgoe stated that the dance reminded him of Bleeding Love and No Air from season four and added Somehow Napoleon and Tabitha have this ability to put emotion into hip hop routines and it really is a real talent 146 ",
