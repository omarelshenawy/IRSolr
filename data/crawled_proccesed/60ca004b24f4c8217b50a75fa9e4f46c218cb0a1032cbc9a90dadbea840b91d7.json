			"previous": " The Circus consists of three long curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games The games give a clue to the design the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome 86 Like the Colosseum the three fa ades have a different order of architecture on each floor Doric on the ground level then Ionic on the piano nobile and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor the style of the building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises 86 Wood never lived to see his unique example of town planning completed as he died five days after personally laying the foundation stone on 18 May 1754 86 ",
			"after": " The most spectacular of Bath s terraces is the Royal Crescent built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood 87 But all is not what it seems while Wood designed the great curved fa ade of what appears to be about 30 houses with Ionic columns on a rusticated ground floor that was the extent of his input Each purchaser bought a certain length of the fa ade and then employed their own architect to build a house to their own specifications behind it hence what appears to be two houses is sometimes one This system of town planning is betrayed at the rear of the crescent while the front is completely uniform and symmetrical the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights juxtapositions and fenestration This Queen Anne fronts and Mary Anne backs architecture occurs repeatedly in Bath 88 Other fine terraces elsewhere in the city include Lansdown Crescent 89 and Somerset Place on the northern hill 90 ",
