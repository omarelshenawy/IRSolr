			"previous": " Aoki ultimately produced Chrono Trigger while director credits were attributed to Akihiko Matsui Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita Toriyama designed the game s aesthetic including characters monsters vehicles and the look of each era 2 Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs 3 Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him but he was cut early in development 38 The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style 39 Sakaguchi and Horii supervised Sakaguchi was responsible for the game s overall system and contributed several monster ideas 2 39 Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi the graphic director and Yasuyuki Honne Tetsuya Nomura and Yusuke Naora who worked as field graphic artists 40 Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics and cited Ridley Scott s visual work in the film Alien as an inspiration for the game s lighting 41 Kamata made the game s luminosity and color choice lay between that of Secret of Mana and the Final Fantasy series 41 ",
			"after": " Yuji Horii a fan of time travel fiction such as the TV series The Time Tunnel fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama 42 43 Horii liked the scenario of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle 39 Concerning story planning Horii commented If there s a fairground I just write that there s a fairground I don t write down any of the details Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in 39 Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements including the character Gato he liked Marle s drama and reconciliation with her father 39 Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game s story including all the events of the 12 000 B C era 4 He took pains to avoid what he described as a long string of errands such as do this take this defeat these monsters or plant this flag 3 Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity usually attended by around 30 personnel 41 Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono s death though they intended he stay dead the party would have retrieved an earlier living version of him to complete the quest 3 Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story 3 Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths 44 Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots 4 Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development and they would collaborate on several future projects 4 Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done 41 Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow downs or a brief black loading screen 41 The game s use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games which used static enemy graphics 41 ",
