			"after": " Fossil resin colloquially called amber is a natural polymer found in many types of strata throughout the world even the Arctic The oldest fossil resin dates to the Triassic though most dates to the Cenozoic The excretion of the resin by certain plants is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation for protection from insects and to seal wounds Fossil resin often contains other fossils called inclusions that were captured by the sticky resin These include bacteria fungi other plants and animals Animal inclusions are usually small invertebrates predominantly arthropods such as insects and spiders and only extremely rarely a vertebrate such as a small lizard Preservation of inclusions can be exquisite including small fragments of DNA ",
