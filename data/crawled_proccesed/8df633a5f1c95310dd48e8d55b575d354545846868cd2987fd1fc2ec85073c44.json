			"previous": " The importance of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham s economy was recognised as early as 1538 and grew rapidly as the century progressed 36 Equally significant was the town s emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry s products 37 By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub of a network of forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire 38 and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the West Indies 39 These trading links gave Birmingham s metalworkers access to much wider markets allowing them to diversify away from lower skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale towards a broader range of specialist higher skilled and more lucrative activities 40 ",
			"after": " By the time of the English Civil War Birmingham s booming economy its expanding population and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas 41 Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak 41 The town s reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643 42 and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s 41 and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s 43 ",
