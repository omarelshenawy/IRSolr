			"previous": "  If we imagine regular time as a horizontal line running between past in one direction and future in the other then imaginary time would run perpendicular to this line as the imaginary numbers run perpendicular to the real numbers in the complex plane Imaginary time is not imaginary in the sense that it is unreal or made up it simply runs in a direction different from the type of time we experience In essence imaginary time is a way of looking at the time dimension as if it were a dimension of space you can move forward and backward along imaginary time just like you can move right and left in space ",
			"after": " Imaginary time is also used in cosmology It is used to describe models of the universe in physical cosmology Stephen Hawking popularized the concept of imaginary time in his book A Brief History of Time ",
