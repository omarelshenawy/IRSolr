			"previous": " Bartlett s initial plan had been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on together to the Siberian coast However because three men Mamen Malloch and Maurer were injured and others were weak and frostbitten Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik 76 The pair started off on 18 March with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days 30 days for the dogs 77 and took an extended route round the island s southern shores to look for signs of Anderson s or Mackay s parties 78 After finding nothing they headed across the ice towards Siberia but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow As they drew nearer to the mainland Kataktovik became nervous he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people and feared for his life Bartlett did his best to reassure him as they moved slowly forward 79 ",
			"after": " On 4 April the pair reached land near Cape Jakan west of Cape North on the northern Siberian coast The presence of sledge marks in the snow showed they had landed in an inhabited area 80 They followed these tracks for a day before arriving at a small Chukchi village Here contrary to Kataktovik s fears they were received hospitably and given shelter and food 81 On 7 April they set out for East Cape and the villages on the Bering coast Bartlett had not previously experienced such relentlessly cold weather with blizzards hurricane force winds and temperatures often below 50 C 58 F On the way they passed through other Chukchi villages where Bartlett traded goods for necessary supplies he exchanged his Colt revolver for a young strong dog 82 Bartlett was touched by the kindness and generosity shown by many of those they encountered on the way typical of the true humanity of these kindly people 81 On 24 April they arrived at Emma Town a settlement a few miles west of East Cape Bartlett calculated that in the 37 days since leaving Wrangel Island he and Kataktovik had travelled about 700 miles 1 100 km all but the last stage on foot 83 ",
