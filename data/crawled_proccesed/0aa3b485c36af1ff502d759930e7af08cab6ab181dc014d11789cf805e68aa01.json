			"after": " Before the hill fort was built a Neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site Dating from around 4000 BC it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches 3 It is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps 4 These gaps and the bank being only 17 centimetres 6 7 in high indicate the site would not have been defensive Instead the ditches may have been symbolic separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside 5 Archaeologist Niall Sharples who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure s position 3 Situated on the side of the hill it would have been visible from several miles away and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming The site does not appear to have been inhabited although a grave containing the remains of two children aged 6 7 has been discovered 6 The enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site 6 ",
