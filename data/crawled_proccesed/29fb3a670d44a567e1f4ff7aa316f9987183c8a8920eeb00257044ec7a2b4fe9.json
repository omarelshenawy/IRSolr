			"previous": " Starting with the first floor and continuing to the third black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone The exception is the floor of the rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time The present doorknobs and hinges locked for protection display the state coat of arms Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork the wood is actually Michigan white pine that has been wood grained to give the appearance of walnut ",
			"after": " The first floor gives visitors their first view of the interior of the rotunda Below the cast iron dome the ceiling displays eight muses painted in 1886 For more than a century the muses artist remained anonymous it is now known that it was Tommaso Juglaris who created them in his Boston studio and never came to Michigan In the east wing of the first floor is a large clock called a long drop clock It was once the building s master clock and is at least as old as the Capitol The clock was restored in 1990 and is currently in working condition ",
