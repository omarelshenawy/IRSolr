			"after": " The standard approach 16 is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true statistical significance and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn t belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false ",
