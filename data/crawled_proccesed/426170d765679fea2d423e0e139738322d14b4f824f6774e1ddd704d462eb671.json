			"after": " An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump followed in 1768 the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery The painting which measures 72 by 94 inches 183 by 244 cm shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic as the air is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump The witnesses display various emotions one of the girls worriedly watches the fate of the bird while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father two gentlemen one of them dispassionately timing the experiment and a boy look on with interest while the young lovers to the left of the painting are absorbed only in each other 19 The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue killing the bird or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved 20 Aside from that of the children little sympathy is directed toward the bird David Solkin suggests the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society Individuals are concerned for each other the father for his children the young man for the girl but the distress of the cockatoo elicits only careful study 21 To one side of the boy at the rear the cockatoo s empty cage can be seen on the wall and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up certain of its former occupant s death It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains to block out the light from the full moon ",
