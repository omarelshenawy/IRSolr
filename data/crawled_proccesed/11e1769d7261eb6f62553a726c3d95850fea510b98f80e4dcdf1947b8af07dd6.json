			"previous": " In addition to evolutionary development of mental and physical traits Darwin and other evolutionary theorists emphasize the influence of the types of environment upon behaviour 28 First of all there are ancestral environments that are typically long term and stable forms of situations that influence mental development of individuals or groups gained either biologically through birth or learned from family or relatives which cause the emphasis of certain mental behaviours that are developed due to the requirements of the ancestral environment 28 In national group settings these ancestral environments can result in psychological triggers in the minds of individuals within a group such as responding positively to patriotic cues 28 There are immediate environments that are those situations that confront an individual or group at a given point and activate certain mental responses 28 In the case of a national group the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation s borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response 28 There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions 29 As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations 29 In the context of the politics of nations and nationalism a political leader may adopt an international treaty not out of a benevolent stance but in the belief that such a treaty will either benefit their nation or will increase the prestige of their nation 29 The proximate environment plays a role in the politics of nations that are angry with their circumstances in much the same way that an individual or group s anger in response to feelings that they are being exploited usually results in efforts to accommodate them while being passive results in them being ignored 29 Nations that are angry with circumstances imposed on them by others are affected by the proximate environment that shapes the nationalism of such nations 29 ",
			"after": "  This is evident in many cases such as the French and American Revolutions The fear of loss of identity traditions and economic disparity lead to the banning together of citizens to achieve what was once theirs Whatever the nation state may have done that it shouldn t have the citizens of the state still knew that it was theirs or at least that they were its They knew what the state could require of them and they accepted their duties as a condition of the rights that came with them They recognized therefore the principal grounds of rights and duties them selves In short there prevailed a sense of collective interest and purpose that gave substance to individual aspirations as well as to those of the group The loss of this sense is a serious loss in a society such as ours that has found nothing to replace it 30 ",
