			"after": " The great influx of bullion from the California Gold Rush and other finds caused the price of silver relative to gold to increase starting in 1848 and silver coins were hoarded or exported for melting In 1851 a bill for a three cent piece in 75 silver and 25 copper was introduced in Congress by New York Senator Daniel S Dickinson who wanted to lower postage rates from five to three cents This percentage of silver was less than the normal 90 so that the coins would circulate at a time of hoarding The copper large cent did not circulate in the Pacific Coast region or South due to prejudice against coins that did not contain precious metal and some means of allowing the purchase of a postage stamp without the use of copper cents was necessary 2 Dickinson s bill passed on March 3 1851 and in addition to authorizing the new three cent silver lowered rates for most domestic mails 3 By 1854 the imbalance had abated and Congress increased the silver content of the three cent piece to the standard 90 for silver coins though its weight was reduced 4 ",
