			"after": " The rocks in Glacier National Park are the best preserved Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world with some of the world s most fruitful sources for records of early life Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe 46 The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter scale lamination ripple marks mud cracks salt crystal casts raindrop impressions oolites and other sedimentary bedding characteristics Six fossilized species of Stromatolites which were early organisms consisting primarily blue green algae have been documented and dated at about 1 billion years 43 The discovery of the Appekunny Formation a well preserved rock stratum in the park pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan animal life on Earth 42 ",
