			"after": " Complex analysis is one of the classical branches in mathematics with roots in the 19th century and just prior Important mathematicians associated with complex analysis include Euler Gauss Riemann Cauchy Weierstrass and many more in the 20th century Complex analysis in particular the theory of conformal mappings has many physical applications and is also used throughout analytic number theory In modern times it has become very popular through a new boost from complex dynamics and the pictures of fractals produced by iterating holomorphic functions Another important application of complex analysis is in string theory which studies conformal invariants in quantum field theory ",
