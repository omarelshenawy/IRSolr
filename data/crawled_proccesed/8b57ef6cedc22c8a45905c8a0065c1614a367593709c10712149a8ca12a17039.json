			"previous": " A more general expression for the potential energy of a membrane is among all functions that satisfy and W can be made arbitrarily small by choosing piecewise linear functions that make a transition between 1 and 1 in a small neighborhood of the origin However there is no function that makes W 0 The resulting controversy over the validity of Dirichlet s principle is explained in http turnbull mcs st and ac uk history Biographies Riemann html Eventually it was shown that Dirichlet s principle is valid but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations see Jost and Li Jost 1998 ",
