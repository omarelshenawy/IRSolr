			"after": " Religious images came under close scrutiny as actually or potentially idolatrous from the start of the Protestant Reformation in the 1520s Martin Luther accepted some imagery but few Early Netherlandish paintings met his criteria Andreas Karlstadt Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin were wholly opposed to public religious images above all in churches and Calvinism soon became the dominant force in Netherlandish Protestantism From 1520 outbursts of reformist iconoclasm broke out across much of Northern Europe 186 These might be official and peaceable as in England under the Tudors and the English Commonwealth or unofficial and often violent as in the Beeldenstorm or Iconoclastic Fury in 1566 in the Netherlands On 19 August 1566 this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent where Marcus van Vaernewijck 1518 69 chronicled the events He wrote of the Ghent Altarpiece being taken to pieces and lifted panel by panel into the tower to preserve it from the rioters 187 Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566 188 followed by more losses in the Spanish Sack of Antwerp in 1576 and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581 which now included city and guild buildings when Calvinists controlled the city council 189 ",
