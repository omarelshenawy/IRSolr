			"previous": " Iolanthe 1882 was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes The critics felt that Sullivan s work in Iolanthe had taken a step forward The Daily Telegraph wrote The composer has risen to his opportunity and we are disposed to account Iolanthe his best effort in all the Gilbertian series 48 Similarly the Theatre asserted that the music of Iolanthe is Dr Sullivan s chef d oeuvre The quality throughout is more even and maintained at a higher standard than in any of his earlier works 49 ",
			"after": " Iolanthe is one of a number of Gilbert s works including The Wicked World 1873 Broken Hearts 1875 Princess Ida 1884 and Fallen Fairies 1909 where the introduction of men and mortal love into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo 50 Gilbert had created several fairy comedies at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s These plays influenced by the fairy work of James Planch are founded upon the idea of self revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference 51 ",
