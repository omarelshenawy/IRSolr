			"previous": " Swimming behavior in mantas differs across habitats when travelling over deep water they swim at a constant rate in a straight line while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50 They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals 19 Mantas sometimes breach leaping partially or entirely out of the water Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other 11 These leaps come in three forms forward leaps where the fish lands head first similar jumps with a tail first re entry or somersaults 11 The reason for breaching is not known possible explanations include mating rituals birthing communication or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras suckerfish 21 15",
			"after": " As filter feeders manta rays consume large quantities of zooplankton in the form of shrimp krill and planktonic crabs An individual manta eats about 13 of its body weight each week When foraging it slowly swims around its prey herding it into a tight ball and then speeds through the bunched organisms with a wide open mouth 19 If a ball is particularly dense a manta may somersault through it 21 13 While feeding mantas flatten their cephalic fins to channel food into their mouths and the small particles are collected by the tissue between the gill arches 11 As many as fifty individual fish may gather at a single plankton rich feeding site 11 Mantas are themselves preyed upon by large sharks and by killer whales They may also be bitten by cookiecutter sharks 21 17 and harbor parasitic copepods 21 14",
