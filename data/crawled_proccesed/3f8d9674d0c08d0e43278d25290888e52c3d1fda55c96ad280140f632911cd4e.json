			"previous": " Since its signing the State of Florida reports that it has spent more than 2 billion on the various projects More than 36 000 acres 150 km2 of Stormwater Treatment Areas have been constructed to filter 2 500 short tons 2 300 t of phosphorus from Everglades waters An STA spanning 17 000 acres 69 km2 was constructed in 2004 making it the largest manmade wetland in the world Fifty five percent of the land necessary to acquire for restoration has been purchased by the State of Florida totaling 210 167 acres 850 52 km2 A plan to hasten the construction and funding of projects was put into place named Acceler8 spurring the start of six of eight large construction projects including that of three large reservoirs 165 However federal funds have not been forthcoming CERP was signed when the U S government had a budget surplus but since then deficits have renewed and two of CERP s major supporters in Congress retired According to a story in The New York Times state officials say the restoration is lost in a maze of federal bureaucracy a victim of analysis paralysis 166 CERP still remains controversial as the projects slated for Acceler8 environmental activists note are those that benefit urban areas and regions in the Everglades in desperate need of water are still being neglected suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment 167 ",
			"after": " A series of biennial reports from the U S National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP The fourth report in the series released in 2012 found that little progress has been made in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem instead most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery 168 The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem 169 To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes including phosphorus loads peat depth and populations of snail kites birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida Most attributes received grades ranging from C degraded to D significantly degraded but the snail kite received a grade of F near irreversible damage The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios improved water quality improved hydrology and improvements to both water quality and hydrology which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction 169 Overall the report concluded that substantial near term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late ",
