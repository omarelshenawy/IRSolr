			"after": " Woodcarving is a common art form in the Cook Islands The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but which had special developments in each island Rarotonga is known for its fisherman s gods and staff gods Atiu for its wooden seats Mitiaro Mauke and Atiu for mace and slab gods and Mangaia for its ceremonial adzes Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionaries Today carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand However there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers Atiu in particular has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive idiosyncratic style with the so called double k design Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves ",
