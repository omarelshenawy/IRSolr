			"after": " Ruskin wrote over 250 works which started from art criticism and history but expanded to cover topics ranging over science geology ornithology literary criticism the environmental effects of pollution mythology travel political economy and social reform After his death Ruskin s works were collected in the 39 volume Library Edition completed in 1912 by his friends Edward Tyas Cook and Alexander Wedderburn 186 The range and quantity of Ruskin s writing and its complex allusive and associative method of expression causes certain difficulties In 1898 John A Hobson observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin s thought and by extracting passages from across his work the spell of his eloquence is broken 187 Clive Wilmer has written further that the anthologizing of short purple passages removed from their intended contexts is something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start 188 Nevertheless some aspects of Ruskin s theory and criticism require further consideration ",
