			"previous": " Soon after Berry s death in 1416 the bulk of his treasures were seized and melted down by the English who were occupying much of northern France after their victory at the Battle of Agincourt the previous year That the reliquary escaped this fate suggests it may have been given away by Berry perhaps to his Burgundian cousins in whose family it is next recorded the Burgundian heiress Mary of Burgundy married the Habsburg Maximilian I Holy Roman Emperor in 1477 48 A reliquary that was donated to the church had a better chance of surviving than the similar secular works that are now only known from their descriptions in inventories where scenes of courtly pleasure were depicted with portrait figures of the princes and their friends A work belonging to Berry s elder brother Anjou showed the romance of Tristan and Isolde with King Mark spying on the lovers from a tree above them giving himself away when they see the enamelled reflection of his face in the enamelled brook 49 ",
			"after": " One work that survived long enough to be recorded in an 18th century painting had a very similar gold castle as its base with a paradisal garden within the walls in this case with trees bearing pearls and red gems However the rest of the piece was very different in scale with a single large white enamel figure of the Archangel Michael impaling Satan with a lance like jewelled cross completely out of scale with the garden in which he stands This is the St Michael and the Devil Group which can be reliably dated to before 1397 when it was given to King Charles VI of France Berry s nephew as a New Year s gift by another uncle Philip the Bold Duke of Burgundy It later passed to a church at Ingolstadt in Bavaria where it remained until it was destroyed in 1801 50 ",
