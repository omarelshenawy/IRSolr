			"previous": " By 1946 Dunlop had 70 000 employees and sales outlets in nearly every country in the world 17 In 1948 Dunlop invented the self sealing tyre which reduced the risk from blowouts 18 In the early 1950s Dunlop developed Maxaret the first anti lock braking system 19 By 1955 Dunlop had almost half of the UK tyre market 20 A report by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission in that year found that Dunlop and the four other main sellers in the UK market Goodyear Avon Firestone and Michelin companies had arrangements which resulted in fixed prices 20 These arrangements were forced to change and Dunlop s market share decreased 12 ",
			"after": " A further factor in Dunlop s decline was the decision during the early 1960s to develop cheaper textile radial tyres rather than the more durable steel belted radial tyres 12 Dunlop lost market share to the Michelin company and other manufacturers marketing steel belted tyres 21 ",
