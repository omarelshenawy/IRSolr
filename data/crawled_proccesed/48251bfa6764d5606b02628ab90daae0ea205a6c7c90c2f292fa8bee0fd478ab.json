			"after": " Incoybe saliceticola produces mushrooms with caps of between 7 and 40 millimetres 0 28 and 1 57 in in diameter The shape of the cap varies depending on the age of the mushroom In younger specimens they are conical or nearly so but as the mushroom matures the caps flatten into a more convex or flat shape As such the height of the cap varies from 4 to 11 millimetres 0 16 to 0 43 in The cap features an umbo that is usually very prominent Around the umbo the cap surface is smooth but towards the cap margin the surface is defined by fibrils running from the margin towards the umbo The cap sometimes splits along these The cap s colour varies from yellow brown to pale brown and is palest at the margins The umbo contrasts to this somewhat being a grey brown or red brown The slender stem measures from 0 7 to 6 2 centimetres 0 3 to 2 4 in long by 1 5 to 6 5 millimetres 0 059 to 0 256 in thick It thickens slightly towards the base where it joins a large well defined bulb that can be up to 11 millimetres 0 43 in across Shallow grooves run up the surface of the stem which is covered in a fine white powder 4 In one case however an atypical specimen was recovered with an almost completely smooth stem free of striations or powder 5 The stem varies in colour with whitish pale yellow brown pale red brown pale brown and grey brown all observed while the base is white No veil or ring is visible 4 ",
