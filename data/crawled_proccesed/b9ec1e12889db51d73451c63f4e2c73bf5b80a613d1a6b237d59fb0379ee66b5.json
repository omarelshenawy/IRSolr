			"previous": " The scholar Amerigo Vespucci who sailed to America in the years following Columbus first voyage was the first to speculate that the land was not part of Asia but in fact constituted some wholly new continent previously unknown to Eurasians His travel journals published 1502 04 convinced German cartographer Martin Waldseem ller to reach the same conclusion and in 1507 a year after Columbus death Waldseem ller published a world map calling the new continent America from Vespucci s Latinized name Americus According to Paul Lunde The preoccupation of European courts with the rise of the Ottoman Turks in the East partly explains their relative lack of interest in Columbus discoveries in the West 97 ",
