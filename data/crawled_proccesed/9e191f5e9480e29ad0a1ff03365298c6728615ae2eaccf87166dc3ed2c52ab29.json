			"previous": " Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks Originally developed by the Royal Navy it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers A ski jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight Without a ski jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea ",
			"after": " Although STOVL aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight As catapults are unnecessary carriers with this arrangement reduce weight complexity and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware Russian Chinese and future Indian carriers include a ski jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft ",
