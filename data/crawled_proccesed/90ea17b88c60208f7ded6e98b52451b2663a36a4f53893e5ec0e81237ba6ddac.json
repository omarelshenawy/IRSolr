			"after": " Sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies The dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species 46 Furthermore in contrast to the red deer and gazelle two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges 47 All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock although this behavior varies with breed 13 and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members 1 During flocking sheep have a strong tendency to follow and a leader may simply be the first individual to move Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep in mixed breed flocks subgroups of the same breed tend to form and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks 7 Sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture heft so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals 1 48 ",
