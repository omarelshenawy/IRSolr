			"previous": " All international arrivals at O Hare except for flights from destinations with Customs preclearance arrive at Terminal 5 as the other terminals do not have Customs facilities Since a number of carriers that have international flights from O Hare like United and American are based in Terminal 1 or Terminal 3 those airlines will have their aircraft offloaded at Terminal 5 and then after passengers are offloaded the plane is towed empty back to a gate at the airline s assigned terminal for boarding This is done in part to make connections for passengers transferring from domestic flights to international flights easier since while Terminals 1 2 and 3 are connected by an airside corridor Terminal 5 is not requiring passengers to exit security ride the Airport Transit System then reclear security in either direction ",
