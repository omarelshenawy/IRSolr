			"previous": " Sea otters are a classic example of a keystone species their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest They keep the population of certain benthic sea floor herbivores particularly sea urchins in check Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp causing the kelp to drift away and die Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest 9 ",
			"after": " Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems 136 and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California 137 However some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors 137 The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries 137 ",
