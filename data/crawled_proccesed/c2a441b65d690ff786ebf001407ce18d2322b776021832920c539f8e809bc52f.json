			"previous": " Wilfred Burchett was the first journalist to visit Hiroshima after the atom bomb was dropped arriving alone by train from Tokyo on September 2 the day of the formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri His Morse code dispatch was printed by the Daily Express newspaper in London on September 5 1945 entitled The Atomic Plague the first public report to mention the effects of radiation and nuclear fallout 227 Burchett s reporting was unpopular with the U S military The U S censors suppressed a supporting story submitted by George Weller of the Chicago Daily News and accused Burchett of being under the sway of Japanese propaganda Laurence dismissed the reports on radiation sickness as Japanese efforts to undermine American morale ignoring his own account of Hiroshima s radiation sickness published one week earlier 228 ",
			"after": " A member of the U S Strategic Bombing Survey Lieutenant Daniel McGovern used a film crew to document the results in early 1946 229 The film crew s work resulted in a three hour documentary entitled The Effects of the Atomic Bombs Against Hiroshima and Nagasaki The documentary included images from hospitals showing the human effects of the bomb it showed burned out buildings and cars and rows of skulls and bones on the ground It was classified secret for the next 22 years 230 During this time in America it was a common practice for editors to keep graphic images of death out of films magazines and newspapers 231 The total of 90 000 ft 27 000 m of film shot by McGovern s cameramen had not been fully aired as of 2009 According to Greg Mitchell with the 2004 documentary film Original Child Bomb a small part of that footage managed to reach part of the American public in the unflinching and powerful form its creators intended 229 ",
