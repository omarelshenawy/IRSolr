			"after": " The South Koreans were holding positions at the northern end of the Kapyong Valley having advanced 10 kilometres 6 2 mi since relieving the 27th Brigade 12 However anticipating a Chinese attack the divisional commander General Chang Do Yong had halted his advance at 16 00 and ordered his two forward regiments the 19th and the 2nd Infantry Regiments to tie in and develop defensive positions Meanwhile the 7th Infantry Regiment occupied reserve positions immediately behind the forward regiments 32 33 Suffering a reputation for unreliability in defence the South Koreans had been bolstered by the attachment of the New Zealand guns and a battery of 105 millimetre 4 1 in M101 howitzers from the US 213th Field Artillery Battalion 34 35 Regardless left with only one hour to halt its advance and step up defences the forward South Korean units were only able to occupy a series of hill top positions while leaving the valleys and flanks exposed 33 Two Chinese divisions the 118th and the 60th Division struck at 17 00 easily infiltrating through numerous gaps between the badly organised defensive positions 33 Under pressure all along the front the defenders gave ground almost immediately and soon broke Abandoning their weapons equipment and vehicles they disintegrated and began to stream south out of the mountains and through the valley and by 23 00 Chang was forced to admit that he had lost all communication with his units 36 At 04 00 the decision was made to withdraw the New Zealanders to prevent their loss however following reports that the South Koreans were making a stand they were ordered back up the valley the next morning with the Middlesex accompanying them as protection By dusk it was clear that the South Koreans had in fact collapsed and the guns were withdrawn again 34 36 ",
