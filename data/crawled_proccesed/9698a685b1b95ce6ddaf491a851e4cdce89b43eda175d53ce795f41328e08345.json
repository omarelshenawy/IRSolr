			"previous": " Within two years of Pan Am s introduction of jet equipment on the bulk of its internal German services from to West Berlin its market share rose from 58 to 68 while BEA s declined from 38 at the beginning of this period to 27 at its end The lower seat density in BEA s re configured Viscounts combined with higher flight frequencies superior catering and increased promotion proved insufficient to counter the appeal of Pan Am s new jets despite these being laid out in a comparatively tight 34 in 86 cm pitch seating configuration On the other hand BEA s reduced capacity in the domestic air travel market between West Berlin and West Germany enabled it to attain higher load factors than its competitors 136 154 155 ",
			"after": " From August 1968 BEA supplemented its Tempelhof based Viscount fleet with de Havilland Comet 4B series jetliners 136 143 Although these aircraft could operate from Tempelhof s short runways without payload restrictions they were not suited to the airline s ultra short haul operation from Berlin average stage length 230 mi 370 km given the high fuel consumption of the Comet especially when operating at the mandatory 10 000 ft 3 000 m altitude inside the Allied air corridors 132 133 153 156 This measure was therefore only a stopgap until most of BEA s Berlin fleet was equipped with 97 seat single class BAC One Eleven 500s nb 23 136 BEA s re equipment of its Berlin fleet with brand new One Eleven 500 jets was central to the airline s competitive strategy to regain ground lost to Pan Am s 727s The new One Eleven 500 which BEA called the Super One Eleven operated its first scheduled service from Berlin on 1 September 1968 11 136 143 156 157 It began replacing the airline s Berlin based Viscounts from 17 November 1968 91 ",
