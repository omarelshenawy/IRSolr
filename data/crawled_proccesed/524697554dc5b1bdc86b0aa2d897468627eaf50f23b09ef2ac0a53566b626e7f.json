			"previous": " In some instances the colour combinations look garish this is particularly the case with the Prophet Daniel A comparison of the restored and unrestored figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black and that the technique was preplanned 22 The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not on its own create effective shadows In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black as they still are on the Cumaean Sibyl This use of bright contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes but it is commonly employed in both oil painting and tempera Like Daniel the Libyan Sibyl s yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now d ",
			"after": " There is absolutely no doubt that before the restoration the whole ceiling was dirtier more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions described by Beck and Arguimbau 18 19 still make their presence known giving mass and bulk to the forms ",
