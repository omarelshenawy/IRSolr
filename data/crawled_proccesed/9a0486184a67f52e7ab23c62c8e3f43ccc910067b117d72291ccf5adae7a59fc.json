			"previous": " The north wall has a window with two lights sections of window separated by mullions topped with trefoils a pattern of three overlapping circles The two arched east windows one in each aisle are decorated with tracery the southern window reuses some tracery from the 15th century 3 The demolished southern chapel had a two light window similar to that at St Peter s Newborough which Jones considered to be of very rude workmanship and three light square headed windows in the east and west walls 1 Jones also noted the loss of the original window at the end of the northern aisle which was from the 14th century in his view and some windows in the north wall of excellent workmanship 1 The southern aisle he said had had a small circular headed window filled up from a pointed one at the eastern end the east window was of a design more remarkable for its singularity than its beauty 1 ",
			"after": " Two of the six arches in the arcade are inside the church the other four project beyond the east wall which has been built around one of the octagonal piers that support the arches The roof dates from the 15th century although the visible beams are not original the roof s exposed wooden trusses rest on sandstone corbels 3 A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted 20 memorials from the 17th and 18th centuries It also recorded the presence of a sundial on a pedestal dated 1768 and some stone shields that were not attached to the building bearing dates of 1561 and 1563 16 Most of the fittings now in St Nidan s are not original and come from other churches in north west Wales the granite altar is modern 3 ",
