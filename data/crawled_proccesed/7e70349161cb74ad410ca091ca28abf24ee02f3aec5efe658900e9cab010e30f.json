			"previous": " In 2005 the total population grew by 13 000 1 8 similar to the Israeli national average but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting While 31 of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen the figure for the Arab population is 42 260 This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades In 1967 Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent 264 Possible factors are the high cost of housing fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city although proportionally young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers citation needed The percentage of secular Jews or those who wear their faith lightly is dropping with some 20 000 leaving the city over the past seven years 2012 They now number 31 of the population the same percentage as the rising ultra orthodox population 265 Many move to the suburbs and coastal cities in search of cheaper housing and a more secular lifestyle 266 In 2009 the percentage of Haredim in the city was increasing As of 2009 out of 150 100 schoolchildren 59 900 or 40 are in state run secular and National Religious schools while 90 200 or 60 are in Haredi schools This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families 267 268 ",
