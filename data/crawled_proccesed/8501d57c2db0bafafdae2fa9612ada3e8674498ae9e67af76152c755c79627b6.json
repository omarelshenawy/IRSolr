			"previous": " The demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime 167 as well as the appearance of singularities where curvature length scales become microscopic indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity for an adequate description of the interior of black holes and of the very early universe a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics 168 Despite major efforts no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known even though a number of promising candidates exist 169 ",
			"after": " Attempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions so as to include gravity have led to serious problems At low energies this approach proves successful in that it results in an acceptable effective quantum field theory of gravity 170 At very high energies however the result are models devoid of all predictive power non renormalizability 171 ",
