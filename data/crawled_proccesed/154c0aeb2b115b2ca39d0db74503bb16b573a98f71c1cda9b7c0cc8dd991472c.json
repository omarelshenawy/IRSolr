			"previous": " Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422 a position he held for the next 33 years 4 His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the H tel Dieu in Beaune 5 It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440 6 Furthermore when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from corcheurs marauding bands who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s 7 The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441 8 and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452 In conjunction Rolin established the religious order of Les s urs hospitali res de Beaune 6 Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages 9 ",
			"after": " In the hospice s founding charter signed in August 1443 Rolin wrote that disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal in gratitude for the goods which the Lord source of all wealth has heaped upon me from now on and for always I found a hospital 10 11 In the late 1450s only a few years before he died he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily 12 Rolin s wife Guigone de Salins A played a major role in the foundation as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470 4 ",
