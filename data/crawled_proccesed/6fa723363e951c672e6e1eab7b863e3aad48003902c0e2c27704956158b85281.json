			"previous": " The user segment is composed of hundreds of thousands of U S and allied military users of the secure GPS Precise Positioning Service and tens of millions of civil commercial and scientific users of the Standard Positioning Service In general GPS receivers are composed of an antenna tuned to the frequencies transmitted by the satellites receiver processors and a highly stable clock often a crystal oscillator They may also include a display for providing location and speed information to the user A receiver is often described by its number of channels this signifies how many satellites it can monitor simultaneously Originally limited to four or five this has progressively increased over the years so that as of 2007 update receivers typically have between 12 and 20 channels a ",
			"after": " GPS receivers may include an input for differential corrections using the RTCM SC 104 format This is typically in the form of an RS 232 port at 4 800 bit s speed Data is actually sent at a much lower rate which limits the accuracy of the signal sent using RTCM citation needed Receivers with internal DGPS receivers can outperform those using external RTCM data citation needed As of 2006 update even low cost units commonly include Wide Area Augmentation System WAAS receivers ",
