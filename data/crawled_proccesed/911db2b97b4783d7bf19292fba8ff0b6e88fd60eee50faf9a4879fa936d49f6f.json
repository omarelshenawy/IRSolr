			"after": " Interstate Highways and US Highways are assigned at the national level Interstate Highways are numbered in a grid even numbered routes are east west routes the lowest numbers are along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico and odd numbered routes are north south routes with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean US Highways are also numbered in a grid even numbered for east west routes with the lowest numbers along Canada and odd numbered for north south routes with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean For this reason mainline two digit Interstate Highways in Maryland all have numbers between 81 and 97 for north south routes and between 68 and 70 for east west routes In addition mainline US Highways all have numbers between 1 and 29 for north south routes and between 40 and 50 for east west routes Three digit Interstate and U S Highways also known as child routes are branches off their main one or two digit parents The Interstate and US Highways are generally maintained by the SHA with some toll roads maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority MdTA and some roads maintained by municipalities including most roads in the city of Baltimore Interstate 95 I 95 and U S Route 40 US 40 are the longest examples in the state ",
