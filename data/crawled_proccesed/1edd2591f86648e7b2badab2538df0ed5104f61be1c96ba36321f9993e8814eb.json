			"previous": " The solid rocket boosters underwent improvements as well Design engineers added a third O ring seal to the joints between the segments after the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster ",
			"after": " Several other SRB improvements were planned to improve performance and safety but never came to be These culminated in the considerably simpler lower cost probably safer and better performing Advanced Solid Rocket Booster These rockets entered production in the early to mid 1990s to support the Space Station but were later canceled to save money after the expenditure of 2 2 billion 59 The loss of the ASRB program resulted in the development of the Super LightWeight external Tank SLWT which provided some of the increased payload capability while not providing any of the safety improvements In addition the US Air Force developed their own much lighter single piece SRB design using a filament wound system but this too was canceled ",
