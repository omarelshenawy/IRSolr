			"previous": " The B 52 shared many technological similarities with the preceding Boeing B 47 Stratojet strategic bomber The two aircraft used the same basic design such as swept wings and podded jet engines 74 and the cabin included the crew ejection systems 75 On the B 52D the pilots and electronic countermeasures EDM operator ejected upwards while the lower deck crew ejected downwards until the B 52G the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out 76 ",
			"after": " Structural fatigue was accelerated by at least a factor of eight in a low altitude flight profile over that of high altitude flying requiring costly repairs to extend service life In the early 1960s the three phase High Stress program was launched to counter structural fatigue enrolling aircraft at 2 000 flying hours 78 79 Follow up programs were conducted such as a 2 000 hour service life extension to select airframes in 1966 1968 and the extensive Pacer Plank reskinning completed in 1977 72 80 The wet wing introduced on G and H models was even more susceptible to fatigue experiencing 60 more stress during flight than the old wing The wings were modified by 1964 under ECP 1050 81 This was followed by a fuselage skin and longeron replacement ECP 1185 in 1966 and the B 52 Stability Augmentation and Flight Control program ECP 1195 in 1967 81 Fuel leaks due to deteriorating Marman clamps continued to plague all variants of the B 52 To this end the aircraft were subjected to Blue Band 1957 Hard Shell 1958 and finally QuickClip 1958 programs The latter fitted safety straps that prevented catastrophic loss of fuel in case of clamp failure 82 ",
