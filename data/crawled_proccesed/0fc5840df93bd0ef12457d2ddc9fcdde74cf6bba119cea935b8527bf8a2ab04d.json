			"previous": " Entering the presidency Garfield had little foreign policy experience so he leaned heavily on Blaine Blaine a former protectionist now agreed with Garfield on the need to promote freer trade especially within the Western Hemisphere 154 Their reasons were twofold firstly Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with Latin America would be the best way to keep Great Britain from dominating the region 154 Secondly by encouraging exports they believed they could increase American prosperity and by doing so position the Republican party as the author of that prosperity ensuring continued electoral success 154 Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade 155 At the same time they hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia Chile and Peru 155 Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory but Chile which had by 1881 occupied the Peruvian capital Lima rejected any settlement that restored the previous status quo 156 Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas calling for renegotiation of the Clayton Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii 157 Garfield s and Blaine s plans for the United States involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar 158 Garfield also considered enhancing the United States military strength abroad asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization 159 In the end these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan American conference but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur Garfield s successor cancelled the conference 160 e Naval reform continued under Arthur if on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned ultimately ending in the construction of the Squadron of Evolution 161 ",
