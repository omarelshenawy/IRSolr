			"after": " A block stroke is usually a purely defensive stroke designed to stop the ball from hitting the wicket or the batsman s body This shot has no strength behind it and is usually played with a light or soft bottom hand grip and merely stops the ball moving towards the wicket A block played on the front foot is known as a forward defensive while that played on the back foot is known as a backward defensive The application of these strokes may be used to score runs by manipulating the block to move the ball into vacant portions of the infield in which case a block becomes a push Pushing the ball is one of the more common ways batsmen manipulate the strike ",
