			"after": " A fairy tale is a story featuring folkloric characters such as fairies goblins elves trolls giants and talking animals and usually enchantments In cultures where demons and witches are perceived as real fairy tales may merge into legendary narratives where the context is perceived by teller and hearers as having historical actuality However unlike legends and epics they usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and actual places persons and events they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times Fairy tales are found in oral folktales and in literary form The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because only the literary forms can survive Still the evidence of literary works at least indicates that fairy tales have existed for thousands of years although not perhaps recognized as a genre the name fairy tale was first ascribed to them by Madame d Aulnoy Literary fairy tales are found over the centuries all over the world and when they collected them folklorists found fairy tales in every culture Fairy tales and works derived from fairy tales are still written today ",
