			"previous": " A study on the development of publishing of open access journals from 1993 to 2009 168 published in 2011 suggests that measured both by the number of journals as well as by the increases in total article output direct gold open access journal publishing has seen rapid growth particularly between the years 2000 and 2009 It was estimated that there were around 19 500 articles published open access in 2000 while the number has grown to 191 850 articles in 2009 The journal count for the year 2000 is estimated to have been 740 and 4769 for 2009 numbers which show considerable growth albeit at a more moderate pace than the article level growth These findings support the notion that open access journals have increased both in numbers and in average annual output over time ",
