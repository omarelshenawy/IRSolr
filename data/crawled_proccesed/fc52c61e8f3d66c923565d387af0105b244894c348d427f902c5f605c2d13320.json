			"previous": " In Office at Night 1940 another couple painting Hopper creates a psychological puzzle The painting shows a man focusing on his work papers while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman s appeal or that he is working hard to ignore her Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources 68 from a desk lamp through a window and indirect light from above Hopper went on to make several office pictures but none with a sensual undercurrent ",
			"after": " The best known of Hopper s paintings Nighthawks 1942 is one of his paintings of groups It shows customers sitting at the counter of an all night diner The shapes and diagonals are carefully constructed The viewpoint is cinematic from the sidewalk as if the viewer were approaching the restaurant The diner s harsh electric light sets it apart from the dark night outside enhancing the mood and subtle emotion 70 As in many Hopper paintings the interaction is minimal The restaurant depicted was inspired by one in Greenwich Village Both Hopper and his wife posed for the figures and Jo Hopper gave the painting its title The inspiration for the picture may have come from Ernest Hemingway s short story The Killers which Hopper greatly admired or from the more philosophical A Clean Well Lighted Place 71 In keeping with the title of his painting Hopper later said Nighthawks has more to do with the possibility of predators in the night than with loneliness 72 ",
