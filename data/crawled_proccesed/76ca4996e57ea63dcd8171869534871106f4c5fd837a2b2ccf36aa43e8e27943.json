			"previous": " The WSPU s approval of property destruction led to the departure of several important members The first were Emmeline Pethick Lawrence and her husband Frederick They had long been integral members of the group s leadership but found themselves in conflict with Christabel about the wisdom of such volatile tactics After returning from a vacation in Canada they found that Pankhurst had expelled them from the WSPU The pair found the decision appalling but to avoid a schism in the movement they continued to praise Pankhurst and the organisation in public Around the same time Emmeline s daughter Adela left the group She disapproved of WSPU endorsement of property destruction and felt that a heavier emphasis on socialism was necessary Adela s relationship with her family especially Christabel was also strained as a result 87 ",
			"after": " The deepest rift in the Pankhurst family came in November 1913 when Sylvia spoke at a meeting of socialists and trade unionists in support of labour organiser Jim Larkin She had been working with the East London Federation of Suffragettes ELFS a local branch of the WSPU which had a close relationship with socialists and organised labour The close connection to labour groups and Sylvia s appearance on stage with Frederick Pethick Lawrence who also addressed the crowd convinced Christabel that her sister was organising a group that might challenge the WSPU in the suffrage movement The dispute became public and members of groups including the WSPU ILP and ELFS braced themselves for a showdown 89 ",
