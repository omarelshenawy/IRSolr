			"previous": " Sometimes ships are launched using a series of inflated tubes underneath the hull which deflate to cause a downward slope into the water This procedure has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure risk and cost The airbags provide support to the hull of the ship and aids its launching motion into the water thus it is arguably safer than other options like sideways launching 4 These airbags are usually cylindrical in shape with hemispherical heads at both ends The Xiao Qinghe shipyard launched a tank barge with marine airbags on January 20 1981 and it is known as the first use of marine airbags ",
			"after": " A Babylonian narrative dating from the 3rd millennium BC describes the completion of a ship  Egyptians Greeks and Romans called on their gods to protect seamen The favor of the monarch of the seas Poseidon in Greek mythology the Roman Neptune was evoked Ship launching participants in ancient Greece wreathed their heads with olive branches drank wine to honor the gods and poured water on the new vessel as a symbol of blessing Shrines were carried on board Greek and Roman ships and this practice extended into the Middle Ages The shrine was usually placed at the quarterdeck an area which continues to have special ceremonial significance ",
