			"previous": " The first known fossil remains of Deinocheirus were discovered by Polish palaeontologist Zofia Kielan Jaworowska on July 9 1965 at the Altan Ula III site coordinates 43 33 987 N 100 28 959 E 43 566450 N 100 482650 E 43 566450 100 482650 in the Nemegt Basin of the Gobi Desert She was part of a Polish group accompanied by Mongolian palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold during the 1963 1965 Polish Mongolian palaeontological expeditions which were organised by the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences The crew spent July 9 11 excavating the specimen and loading it onto a vehicle A 1968 report by Kielan Jaworowska and Naydin Dovchin which summarised the accomplishments of the expeditions announced that the remains represented a new family of theropod dinosaur 1 10 The specimen was discovered on a small hill in sandstone and consists of a partial disarticulated skeleton most parts of which had probably eroded away at the time of discovery The specimen consisted of both forelimbs excluding the claws of the right hand the complete shoulder girdle centra of three dorsal vertebrae five ribs gastralia belly ribs and two ceratobranchialia The specimen was made the holotype of Deinocheirus mirificus named by Halszka Osm lska and Ewa Roniewicz in 1970 The generic name is derived from Greek deinos meaning horrible and cheir meaning hand due to the size and strong claws of the forelimbs The specific name comes from Latin and means unusual or peculiar chosen for the unusual structure of the forelimbs 6 The Polish Mongolian expeditions were notable for being led by women among the first to name new dinosaurs 11 The original specimen number of the holotype was ZPal MgD I 6 but it has since been re catalogued as MPC D 100 18 1 ",
			"after": " The paucity of known Deinocheirus remains inhibited a thorough understanding of the animal for almost half a century onwards and the scientific literature often described it as among the most enigmatic mysterious and bizarre of dinosaurs 1 12 13 The holotype arms went on to become part of a traveling exhibit of Mongolian dinosaur fossils touring various countries 14 In 2012 Phil R Bell Philip J Currie and Yuong Nam Lee announced the discovery of additional elements of the holotype specimen including fragments of gastralia found by a Korean Mongolian team which re located the original quarry in 2008 Bite marks on two gastralia were identified as belonging to Tarbosaurus and it was proposed that this accounted for the scattered disassociated state of the holotype specimen 13 ",
