			"previous": " D Eyncourt probably avoided proposing any design with 16 inch guns when he saw the political situation In meetings with Le o designs of only ten 12 inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected even though their broadside was as strong as that of the Minas Geraes class but a design with no less than fourteen 12 inch guns emerged as the frontrunner Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class with larger guns ruled out the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns 109 ",
			"after": " After numerous requests for design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12 inch guns on 3 June 1911 for 2 675 000 and Rio de Janeiro s keel was laid for the fourth time on 14 September It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again 110 by mid 1912 battleships with 14 inch guns were under construction and suddenly it seemed that Rio de Janeiro would be outclassed upon completion 111 Making matters worse a European depression after the end of the Second Balkan War in August 1913 reduced Brazil s ability to obtain foreign loans This coincided with a collapse in Brazil s coffee and rubber exports the latter due to the loss of the Brazilian rubber monopoly to British plantations in the Far East The price of coffee declined by 20 percent and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12 5 percent between 1912 and 1913 rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36 6 percent respectively 112 The Brazilian Navy later claimed that selling Rio de Janeiro was a tactical decision so they could have two divisions of battleships two with 12 inch guns the Minas Geraes class and two with 15 inch guns 113 ",
