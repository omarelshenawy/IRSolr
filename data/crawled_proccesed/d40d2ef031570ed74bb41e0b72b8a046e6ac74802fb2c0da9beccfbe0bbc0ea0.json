			"after": " Edward Drinker Cope was an American paleontologist and comparative anatomist as well as a noted herpetologist and ichthyologist Born to a wealthy Quaker family Cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science he published his first scientific paper at the age of nineteen Cope had little formal scientific training and eschewed a teaching position for field work He made regular trips to the American West prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s often as part of United States Geological Survey teams A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil finding competition now known as the Bone Wars Cope s scientific pursuits nearly bankrupted him but his contributions helped define the field of American paleontology He was a prodigious writer with 1 400 papers published over his lifetime although his rivals would debate the accuracy of his rapidly published works Cope discovered described and named more than 1 000 vertebrate species including hundreds of fishes and dozens of dinosaurs His theories on the origin of mammalian molars and Cope s Law on the gradual enlargement of mammalian species are among his theoretical contributions ",
