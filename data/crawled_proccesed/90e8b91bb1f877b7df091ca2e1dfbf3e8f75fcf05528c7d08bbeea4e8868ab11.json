			"previous": " The environment of the German Reeds intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production including set costumes direction and stage management 26 These works were a success 30 with Gilbert s first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration Ages Ago opening in 1869 Ages Ago was also the beginning of a collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works 31 It was at a rehearsal for Ages Ago that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend Arthur Sullivan 31 32 The Bab Ballads and Gilbert s many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan ",
			"after": " Many of the plot elements of the German Reed Entertainments as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads would be reused by Gilbert later in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas These elements include paintings coming to life Ages Ago used again in Ruddigore a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man s son to a pirate instead of to a pilot by mistake Our Island Home 1870 reused in The Pirates of Penzance and the forceful mature lady who is an acquired taste Eyes and No Eyes 1875 reused in The Mikado 33 During this time Gilbert perfected the topsy turvy style that he had been developing in his Bab Ballads where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences however absurd 34 Mike Leigh describes the Gilbertian style as follows With great fluidity and freedom Gilbert continually challenges our natural expectations First within the framework of the story he makes bizarre things happen and turns the world on its head Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes and so on and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand to blend the surreal with the real and the caricature with the natural In other words to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way 35 ",
