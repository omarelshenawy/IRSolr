			"previous": " Muhammad was born about the year 570 8 and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi al awwal 50 He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan one of Mecca s prominent families although it appears less prosperous during Muhammad s early lifetime 14 51 The Banu Hashim clan was part of the Quraysh tribe Tradition places the year of Muhammad s birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca that year by the Aksumite king Abraha who supplemented his army with elephants An outbreak of smallpox among the Aksumites may explain the failure of the invading army 52 20th century scholarship has suggested alternative dates for this event such as 568 or 569 53 ",
			"after": " His father Abdullah died almost six months before Muhammad was born 55 According to Islamic tradition soon after Muhammad s birth he was sent to live with a Bedouin family in the desert as desert life was considered healthier for infants 56 Muhammad stayed with his foster mother Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb and her husband until he was two years old 10 Some western scholars of Islam have rejected the historicity of this tradition 56 At the age of six Muhammad lost his biological mother Amina to illness and he became orphaned 10 57 For the next two years he was under the guardianship of his paternal grandfather Abd al Muttalib of the Banu Hashim clan but when Muhammad was eight his grandfather also died He then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib the new leader of Banu Hashim 10 53 According to Islamic historian William Montgomery Watt there was a general disregard by guardians in taking care of weaker members of the tribes in Mecca during the 6th century Muhammad s guardians saw that he did not starve to death but it was hard for them to do more for him especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time 58 ",
