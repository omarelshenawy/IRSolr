			"previous": " Brown s paper was approved for printing in May 1809 but did not appear in print until March the following year In the meantime Joseph Knight published On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae which appeared to draw heavily on Brown s unpublished material without permission and in most cases without attribution 15 It contained the first publication of Brown s Josephia for which two species were listed The first Josephia sessilis was based on one of Menzies specimens This species discovered by Mr A Menzies on the West coast of New Holland is not unlike some varieties of Ilex Aquifolium and now in his Majesty s collection at Kew 16 The etymology of the specific epithet was not explicitly stated but it is universally accepted that it comes from the Latin sessilis sessile stalkless in reference to the sessile leaves of this species 1 Blame for the alleged plagiarism largely fell on Richard Salisbury who had been present at Brown s readings and is thought to have provided much of the material for Knight s book Salisbury was ostracized by the botanical community which undertook to ignore his work as much as possible 15 By the time Brown s monograph appeared in print Brown had exchanged the generic name Josephia for Dryandra giving the name Dryandra floribunda to Knight s Josephia sessilis 17 As there were then no firm rules pertaining to priority of publication 18 Brown s name was accepted and remained the current name for over a century 19 ",
			"after": " Another significant early collection was the apparent discovery of the species at the Swan River in 1827 In that year the colonial botanist of New South Wales Charles Fraser visited the area as part of an exploring expedition under James Stirling Among the plants that Fraser found growing on the south side of the river entrance was a beautiful species of Dryandra 20 which was probably this species 21 ",
