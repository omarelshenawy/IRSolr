			"previous": "  The tentacle covered leaves can capture large prey such as beetles moths and butterflies The tentacles of all Drosera species are specialised stalked glands on the leaf s upper surface that produce a sticky mucilage The leaves are considered active flypaper traps that respond to captured prey by bending to surround it In its native fynbos habitat the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs Of the two known populations of D regia the higher altitude site appears to be overgrown and is essentially extirpated The lower altitude site is estimated to have about 50 mature plants making it the most endangered Drosera species since it is threatened with extinction in the wild It is often cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts and a single cultivar has been registered ",
			"after": " Drosera regia plants are fairly large herbs that produce horizontal woody rhizomes and a crown of large linear leaves up to 70 cm 28 in long and 2 cm 0 8 in wide The leaves possess stalked glands tentacles on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly the entire length of the leaf The leaves lack petioles and stipules emerging by circinate vernation uncurling and tapering to a filiform point The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects In its native habitat D regia has been known to capture large beetles moths and butterflies Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud consisting of a tight cluster of short immature leaves Plants begin to break dormancy in mid July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April though this is variable and plants can continue growing year round without dormancy 1 2 3 Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years 4 ",
