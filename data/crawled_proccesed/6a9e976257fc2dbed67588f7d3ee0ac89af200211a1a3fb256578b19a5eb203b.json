			"previous": " The noisy miner engages in most activities in a group Roosting foraging preening bathing and dust bathing or anting are communal activities Dawn song is a communal chorus particularly during the breeding season The communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays postural displays and facial displays In long flight displays initiated by either male or female birds groups of up to twenty birds from more than one coterie fly about 40 metres 130 ft above the canopy for distances of up to 1 5 kilometres 0 93 mi from the colony constantly calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes As they return the remaining birds show signs of agitation and sometimes fly up to join them The short flight display is performed by the male and may be analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds In a ritualised movement the noisy miner flies out from a perch across an open area in a rhythmic undulating pattern usually calling in flight At the end of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near the starting point The head up flight is performed by the female during the nesting period and may function to attract male helpers In its most intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically with legs dangling and the head held up and back It is performed by the female when she is selecting the nest site and when carrying nest building material and probably has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group members 43 ",
			"after": " Postural displays include tall and low poses pointing open bill and wing waving The tall posture is used when in close contact with another bird and is a mild threat The bird holds itself upright with neck and legs stretched and it faces the other bird The low posture is a submissive gesture the bird sits low on the perch with legs obscured by fluffed feathers and often faces away from the other bird Fledglings threatened by adult birds will adopt a low posture and open their bill widely Pointing is a threat display where the bird stretches out horizontally with feathers sleeked and the bill pointed at the target of the aggression A bill snap will sometimes accompany pointing An open bill display is used by subordinates in encounters between two birds and by a female on the nest when other birds approach The trident bill display involves a fully open bill with the tongue raised and protruding and is a higher intensity submissive display Wing waving is often performed at the same time as an open bill display The wings are flexed and held slightly away from the body and flapped out and up around three to six times Wing waving may be accompanied by a yammer call Eagle displays involve holding the wings and tail spread out in either a vertical or horizontal position 43 ",
