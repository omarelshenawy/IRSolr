			"previous": " In the brain zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons 170 and can modulate brain excitability 6 It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning 171 However it has been called the brain s dark horse 170 because it also can be a neurotoxin suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system 170 ",
			"after": " Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions 163 The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions 172 Two examples of zinc containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide CO 2 regulation and digestion of proteins respectively 173 ",
