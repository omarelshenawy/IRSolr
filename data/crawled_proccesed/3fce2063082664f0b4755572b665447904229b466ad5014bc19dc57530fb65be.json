			"previous": " While physics aims to discover universal laws its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability Loosely speaking the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light Outside of this domain observations do not match their predictions Albert Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light Max Planck Erwin Schr dinger and others introduced quantum mechanics a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales Later quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity General relativity allowed for a dynamical curved spacetime with which highly massive systems and the large scale structure of the universe can be well described General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed ",
			"after": " Mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature especially the laws of physics This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras 37 Plato 38 Galileo 39 and Newton ",
