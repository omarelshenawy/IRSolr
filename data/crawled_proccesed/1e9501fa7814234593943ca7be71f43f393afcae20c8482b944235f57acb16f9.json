			"previous": " The CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days many of the old guard veterans had died retired or simply left the network 62 No change was greater than that in Paley himself he had become difficult to work for and had gradually shifted from leader to despot 62 He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits his hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself 62 His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties 63 ",
			"after": " As Paley grew more remote he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS first Ed Klauber then Paul Kesten and finally Frank Stanton Second only to Paley as the author of CBS s style and ambitions in its first half century Stanton was a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent spokesman and image maker 64 He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph D thesis A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer 65 He scored an early hit with his study Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs Orally which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors 65 In 1946 Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman Stanton s colorful but impeccable wardrobe slate blue pinstripe suit ecru shirt robin s egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron made him in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice president the greatest argument we have for color television 66 ",
