			"previous": " Hawker Siddeley Aviation which absorbed de Havilland needed additional customers for the Trident so entered into discussions with American Airlines AA in 1960 They demanded an aircraft with a longer range which meant that the original DH121 design would have fulfilled American s requirements almost perfectly To fill AA s needs design began on a new Trident 1A powered with uprated Rolls Royce Spey 510s of 10 700 lbf 47 6 kN thrust and a larger wing with more fuel raising gross weight to 120 000 lb 54 000 kg and range to 1 800 miles 2 900 kilometres American Airlines eventually declined the aircraft in favour of the Boeing 727 an aircraft which filled the original DH121 specifications almost exactly ",
			"after": " Some of these changes were nevertheless added into the original prototype and it was renamed the Trident 1C The main difference was a larger fuel tank in the centre section of the wing raising weights to 115 000 lb 52 000 kg and range to 1 400 miles 2 300 kilometres The first Trident 1 G ARPA made its maiden flight on 9 January 1962 from Hatfield Aerodrome 27 and entered service on 1 April 1964 27 By 1965 there were 15 Tridents in BEA s fleet and by March 1966 the fleet had increased to 21 ",
