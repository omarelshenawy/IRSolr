			"after": " Over most of geologic time the sea level has been higher than it is today 6 p74 The main factor affecting sea level over time is the result of changes in the oceanic crust with a downward trend expected to continue in the very long term 80 At the last glacial maximum some 20 000 years ago the sea level was 120 meters 390 ft below its present day level For at least the last 100 years the sea level has been rising at an average rate of about 1 8 mm 0 071 in per year 81 Most of this rise can be attributed to an increase in the temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper 500 m 1 600 ft of water Additional contributions as much as one quarter of the total come from water sources on land such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs 82 The rising trend from global warming is expected to continue until at least the end of the 21st century 83 ",
