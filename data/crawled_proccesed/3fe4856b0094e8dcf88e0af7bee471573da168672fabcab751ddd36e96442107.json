			"previous": " In October 1991 former Douglas Aircraft executive Russell Ray Jr was hired as Pan Am s new president and CEO 114 As part of this restructuring Pan Am relocated its headquarters from the Pan Am Building in New York City to new offices in the Miami area in preparation for the airline s relaunch from both Miami and New York on November 1 1991 115 The new airline would have operated approximately 60 aircraft and generate about 1 2 billion in annual revenues with 7 500 employees 108 Following the relaunch Pan Am continued to sustain heavy losses Revenue throughout October and November 1991 fell short of what had been anticipated in the reorganization plan with Delta claiming that Pan Am was losing 3 million a day This undermined Delta s Wall Street s and the traveling public s confidence in the viability of the reorganized Pan Am 109 112 ",
			"after": " Pan Am s senior executives outlined a projected shortfall of between 100 million and possibly 200 million with the airline requiring a 25 million installment just to fly through the following week On the evening of December 3 Pan Am s Creditors Committee advised U S Bankruptcy Judge Cornelius Blackshear that it was close to convincing an airline TWA to invest 15 million to keep Pan Am operating A deal with TWA owner Carl Icahn could not be struck Pan Am opened for business at 9 00 am and within the hour Ray was forced to withdraw Pan Am s plan of reorganization and execute an immediate shutdown plan for Pan Am Over 9 000 employees lost their jobs As a result of this action Delta was sued for more than 2 5 billion on December 9 1991 by the Pan Am Creditors Committee 116 Shortly thereafter a large group of former Pan Am employees sued Delta 112 In December 1994 a federal judge ruled in favor of Delta concluding that it was not liable for Pan Am s demise 117 ",
