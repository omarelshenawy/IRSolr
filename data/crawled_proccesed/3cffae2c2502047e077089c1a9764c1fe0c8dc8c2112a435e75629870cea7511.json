			"previous": " American paddlefish have small undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally Unlike most fishes American paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination Electroreception appears to have largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey 14 23 However the rostrum is not their only means of food detection Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise 18 23 As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum American paddlefish have sensory pores covering nearly half of the skin surface extending from the rostrum to the top of the head down to the tips of the operculum flaps Studies have indicated that American paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health 18 23 ",
			"after": " American paddlefish are long lived sexually late maturing pelagic fish Females do not begin spawning until they are seven to ten years old some as late as sixteen to eighteen years old Females do not spawn every year rather they spawn every second or third year Males spawn more frequently usually every year or every other year beginning around age seven some as late as nine or ten years of age 23 25 ",
