			"previous": " Depending on the aircraft s design a stall can expose extremely adverse properties of balance and control in particular in a prototype citation needed  Any yaw of the aircraft as it enters the stall regime can result in autorotation which is also sometimes referred to as a spin Because air no longer flows smoothly over the wings during a stall aileron control of roll becomes less effective whilst simultaneously the tendency for the ailerons to generate adverse yaw increases This increases the lift from the advancing wing and accentuates the probability of the aircraft to enter into a spin citation needed ",
			"after": " The graph shows that the greatest amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached which in early 20th century aviation was called the burble point This angle is 17 5 degrees in this case but changes from airfoil to airfoil In particular for aerodynamically thick airfoils thickness to chord ratios of around 10 the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same camber Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles but also work efficiently in inverted flight The graph shows that as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle the lift produced by the airfoil decreases ",
