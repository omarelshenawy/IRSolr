			"after": " The 1950s was a period of rapid growth for IAM The production of jet engines during the war led IAM to expand to the aircraft industry By 1958 IAM had more than 900 000 members This was due to the fact that IAM took steps to begin to move away from its racist past In 1955 under the leadership of President Al Hayes IAM became more of an industrial union it began to shift from railroad to metal fabrication IAM had more union members as well as workers in the aircraft industry Thus Aerospace workers were attracted to join IAM In 1964 IAM changed its name to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAMAW began to strike against five major airlines including Eastern National Northwest Trans World and United Airlines 35 400 IAMAW members in 231 cities grounded the airlines for 43 days finally winning 5 raises in three successive years 16 IAM membership nearly doubled in the 1950s in large part due to the burgeoning airline industry from 501 000 members in 1949 to 903 000 members in 1958 As a result of the influx of members from the airlines and the new American space program the delegates voted to change the name to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the 1964 convention 17 In 1982 due to individual and corporate bankruptcies IAM membership dropped to 820 211 from a high of 927 000 in 1973 18 Also in 1982 boycott was initiated by the IAM against Brown Sharpe a machine precision measuring and cutting tool manufacturer headquartered in Rhode Island The boycott was called after the firm refused to bargain in good faith withdrawing previously negotiated clauses in the contract and forced the union into a strike during which police sprayed pepper gas on some 800 picketers at the company s North Kingston plant in early 1982 Three weeks later a machinist narrowly escaped serious injury when a shot fired into the picket line hit his belt buckle ",
