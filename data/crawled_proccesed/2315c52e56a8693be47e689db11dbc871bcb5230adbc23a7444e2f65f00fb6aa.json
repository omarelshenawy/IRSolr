			"previous": " Other methods include shrinkage stope mining which is mining upward creating a sloping underground room long wall mining which is grinding a long ore surface underground and room and pillar mining which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat allowing the room to cave in thereby loosening more ore Additional sub surface mining methods include hard rock mining which is mining of hard rock igneous metamorphic or sedimentary materials bore hole mining drift and fill mining long hole slope mining sub level caving and block caving ",
			"after": " Heavy machinery is used in mining to explore and develop sites to remove and stockpile overburden to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness to process the ore and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed Bulldozers drills explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land In the case of placer mining unconsolidated gravel or alluvium is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or trommel which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel The minerals are then concentrated using sluices or jigs ",
