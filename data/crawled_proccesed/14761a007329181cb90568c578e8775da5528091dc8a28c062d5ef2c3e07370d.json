			"previous": " The formal study of calculus brought together Cavalieri s infinitesimals with the calculus of finite differences developed in Europe at around the same time Pierre de Fermat claiming that he borrowed from Diophantus introduced the concept of adequality which represented equality up to an infinitesimal error term 11 The combination was achieved by John Wallis Isaac Barrow and James Gregory the latter two proving the second fundamental theorem of calculus around 1670 ",
			"after": " The product rule and chain rule the notion of higher derivatives Taylor series and analytical functions were introduced by Isaac Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of mathematical physics 12 In his works Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach He used the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid the oblateness of the earth the motion of a weight sliding on a cycloid and many other problems discussed in his Principia Mathematica 1687 In other work he developed series expansions for functions including fractional and irrational powers and it was clear that he understood the principles of the Taylor series He did not publish all these discoveries and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable ",
