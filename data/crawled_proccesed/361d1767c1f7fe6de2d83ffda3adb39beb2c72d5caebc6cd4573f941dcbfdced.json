			"previous": " The International Spy Museum in Washington D C has a small room dedicated to carrier pigeons and pigeon photography in the First World War 23  Instead under the novel conditions of attrition warfare war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance Neubronner s mobile dovecote found its way to the Battle of Verdun where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle of the Somme 11 After the war the War Ministry responded to Neubronner s inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified 14 ",
			"after": " Despite the War Ministry s position immediately after the First World War in 1932 it was reported that the German army was training pigeons for photography and that the German pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures per flight 24 In the same year the French claimed that they had developed film cameras for pigeons as well as a method for having the birds released behind enemy lines by trained dogs 25 ",
