			"previous": " Whitman claimed that after years of competing for the usual rewards he determined to become a poet 37 He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period 38 As early as 1850 he began writing what would become Leaves of Grass 39 a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death 40 Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic 41 and used free verse with a cadence based on the Bible 42 At the end of June 1855 Whitman surprised his brothers with the already printed first edition of Leaves of Grass George didn t think it worth reading 43 ",
			"after": " Whitman paid for the publication of the first edition of Leaves of Grass himself 43 and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs 44 A total of 795 copies were printed 45 No name is given as author instead facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer 46 but 500 lines into the body of the text he calls himself Walt Whitman an American one of the roughs a kosmos disorderly fleshly and sensual no sentimentalist no stander above men or women or apart from them no more modest than immodest 47 The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines 1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem later called Song of Myself The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote a flattering five page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends 48 The first edition of Leaves of Grass was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest 49 in part due to Emerson s approval 50 but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly obscene nature of the poetry 51 Geologist John Peter Lesley wrote to Emerson calling the book trashy profane obscene and the author a pretentious ass 52 On July 11 1855 a few days after Leaves of Grass was published Whitman s father died at the age of 65 53 ",
