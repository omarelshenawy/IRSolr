			"after": " If the speed is constant only multiplication is needed but if the speed changes a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval and then taking the sum a Riemann sum of the approximate distance traveled in each interval The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses then the speed will stay more or less the same However a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled ",
