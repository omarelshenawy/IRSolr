			"previous": " The Trident was a jet airliner of all metal construction with a T tail and a low mounted wing with a quarter chord sweepback of 35 degrees It had three rear mounted engines two in side fuselage pods and the third in the fuselage tailcone aspirating through an S shaped duct One version the 3B had a fourth boost engine aspirated through a separate intake duct above the main S duct All versions were powered by versions of the Rolls Royce Spey while the boost engine was also by Rolls Royce the RB 162 originally intended as a lift engine for VTOL applications ",
			"after": " The Trident was one of the fastest subsonic commercial airliners regularly cruising at over 610 mph 980 km h At introduction into service its standard cruise Mach Number was 0 88 380kts IAS probably the highest of any of its contemporaries Designed for high speed with a critical Mach number of 0 93 23 the wing produced relatively limited lift at lower speeds This and the aircraft s low power to weight ratio called for prolonged takeoff runs Nevertheless the Trident fulfilled BEA s 6 000 ft 1 800 m field length criterion and its relatively staid airfield performance was deemed adequate before the arrival into service of the Boeing 727 and later jet airliners built to 4 500 ft 1 400 m field length criteria 24 ",
