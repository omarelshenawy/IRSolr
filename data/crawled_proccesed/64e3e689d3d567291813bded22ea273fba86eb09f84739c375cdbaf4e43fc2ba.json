			"previous": " During the 20th century the Doom Bar was regularly dredged to improve access to Padstow By the 1930s when Commander H E Turner surveyed the estuary there were two channels round the Doom Bar 30 and it is thought that the main channel may have moved to the east side in 1929 31 By 2010 the original channel had disappeared The estuary is regularly dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission s dredgers Sandsnipe and Mannin 32 ",
			"after": " The Doom Bar has accounted for more than 600 beachings capsizes and wrecks since records began early in the 19th century 33 the majority of which are wrecks 34  Larger boats entering Padstow were offered assistance generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled it would be entering If a boat was foundering salvors would step in and help There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court so as to extort more money from the owners This happened to the brig The Towan which floundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger Although it did not need assistance salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner 35 ",
