			"previous": " A structural keel is a beam around which the hull of a ship is built The keel runs in the middle of the ship from the bow to the stern and serves as a basic foundation or spine of the structure providing the major source of structural strength of the hull The keel is generally the first part of a ship s hull to be constructed and laying the keel or placing the keel in the cradle in which the ship will be built is often a momentous event in a ship s construction so much so that the event is often marked with a ceremony and the term lay the keel has entered the language as a phrase meaning the beginning of any significant undertaking Modern ships are now largely built in a series of pre fabricated complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel so the start of the shipbuilding process is now considered to be when the first sheet of steel is cut ",
			"after": " The keel contributes substantially to the longitudinal strength and effectively local loading caused when docking the ship The most common type of keel is the flat plate keel and this is fitted in the majority of ocean going ships and other vessels A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the bar keel which may be fitted in trawlers tugs and smaller ferries Where grounding is possible this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity If a double bottom is fitted the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type bar keels often being associated with open floors where the plate keel may also be fitted ",
