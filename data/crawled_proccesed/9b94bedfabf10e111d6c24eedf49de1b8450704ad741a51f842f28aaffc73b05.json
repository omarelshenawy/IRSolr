			"previous": " An azimuthing propeller is a propeller that turns around the vertical axis The individual airfoil shaped blades turn as the propeller moves so that they are always generating lift in the vessel s direction of movement This type of propeller can reverse or change its direction of thrust very quickly ",
			"after": " Cavitation is the formation of vapor bubbles in water near a moving propeller blade in regions of low pressure due to Bernoulli s principle It can occur if an attempt is made to transmit too much power through the screw or if the propeller is operating at a very high speed Cavitation can waste power create vibration and wear and cause damage to the propeller It can occur in many ways on a propeller The two most common types of propeller cavitation are suction side surface cavitation and tip vortex cavitation ",
