			"previous": " It was long believed that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time Although pitting holes lesions and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat a 2006 study found no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage for example there is no evidence of infection or healing Instead non pathological bone resorption or unknown bone diseases are suggested as causes 41 ",
			"after": " However a newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions in Triceratops and Centrosaurus and showed that these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head 42 as Centrosaurus was more closely related to Styracosaurus and both genera had long nasal horns the results for this genus would be more applicable for Styracosaurus The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease 43 ",
