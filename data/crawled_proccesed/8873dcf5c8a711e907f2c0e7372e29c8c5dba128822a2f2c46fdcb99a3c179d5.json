			"after": " The Vandals an ancient Germanic people are associated with senseless destruction as a result of their sack of Rome under King Genseric in 455 During the Enlightenment Rome was idealized while the Goths and Vandals were blamed for its destruction The Vandals may not have been any more destructive than other invaders of ancient times but they did inspire British poet John Dryden to write Till Goths and Vandals a rude Northern race Did all the matchless Monuments deface 1694 However the Vandals did intentionally damage statues which may be why their name is associated with the vandalism of art The term Vandalisme was coined in 1794 by Henri Gr goire bishop of Blois to describe the destruction of artwork following the French Revolution The term was quickly adopted across Europe This new use of the term was important in colouring the perception of the Vandals from later Late Antiquity popularising the pre existing idea that they were a barbaric group with a taste for destruction 2 ",
