			"after": " In 2006 OpenBSD started the first campaign against the use of binary blobs in kernels Blobs are usually freely distributable device drivers for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers This restricts the users freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions Also since the blobs are undocumented and may have bugs they pose a security risk to any operating system whose kernel includes them The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob free ",
