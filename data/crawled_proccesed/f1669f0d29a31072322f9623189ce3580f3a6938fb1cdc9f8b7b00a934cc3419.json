			"previous": " According to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward Black Sabbath and the numerous metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music They take as an example Sabbath s second album Paranoid 1970 which included songs dealing with personal trauma Paranoid and Fairies Wear Boots which described the unsavoury side effects of drug taking as well as those confronting wider issues such as the self explanatory War Pigs and Hand of Doom 35 Deriving from the genre s roots in blues music sex is another important topic a thread running from Led Zeppelin s suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam and nu metal bands 36 ",
			"after": " The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism According to Jon Pareles Heavy metal s main subject matter is simple and virtually universal With grunts moans and subliterary lyrics it celebrates a party without limits T he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic 6 Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal and others who have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult During the 1980s the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U S Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics particularly those in heavy metal songs 37 Music critic Robert Christgau called metal an expressive mode it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary whiteboys fear girls pity themselves and are permitted to rage against a world they ll never beat 38 ",
