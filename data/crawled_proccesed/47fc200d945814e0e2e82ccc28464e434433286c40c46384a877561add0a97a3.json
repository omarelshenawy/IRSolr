			"after": " Although it is not widely cultivated Alloxylon flammeum has proven to be by far the most hardy and adaptable as well as the showiest member of the genus Alloxylon 6 and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria 4 It does best in a well drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young 6 Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial 4 Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used 18 Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate 18 Its flowers attract birds to gardens A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney 6 It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild 5 ",
