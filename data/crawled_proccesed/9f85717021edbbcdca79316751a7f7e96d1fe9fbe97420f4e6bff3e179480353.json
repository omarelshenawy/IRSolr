			"previous": " Various companies attempted to lease the mine from Roncor but in the meantime two local couples Lanny and Joy Perry and Chuck and Marie Ridgeway discovered a new site at Yogo Gulch in January 1984 by following a trail to an unused section of the dike that had previously been deemed unsuitable They began mining the site and named it the Vortex Mine forming a company named Vortex Mining The mine shaft was 280 feet 85 m deep and contained two Yogo ore bearing veins 84 The portion of the dike they had mined was an extension of the main dike 85 The Vortex Mine renamed Yogo Creek Mining 18 was successful for years but eventually declined and closed in 2004 85 ",
