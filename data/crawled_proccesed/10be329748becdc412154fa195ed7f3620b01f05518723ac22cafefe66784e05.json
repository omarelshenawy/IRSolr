			"previous": " The tide in the Golan began to turn as the arriving Israeli reserve forces were able to contain the Syrian advance Beginning on October 8 the Israelis began pushing the Syrians back towards the pre war ceasefire lines inflicting heavy tank losses Another Syrian attack north of Quneitra was repulsed The tiny Golan Heights were too small to act as an effective territorial buffer unlike the Sinai Peninsula in the south but it proved to be a strategic geographical stronghold and was a crucial key in preventing the Syrians from bombarding the cities below The Israelis who had suffered heavy casualties during the first three days of fighting also began relying more heavily on artillery to dislodge the Syrians at long range ",
			"after": " On October 9 Syrian FROG 7 surface to surface missiles struck the Israeli Air Force base of Ramat David killing a pilot and injuring several soldiers Additional missiles struck civilian settlements In retaliation seven Israeli F 4 Phantoms flew into Syria and struck the Syrian General Staff Headquarters in Damascus The jets attacked from Lebanese airspace to avoid the heavily defended regions around the Golan Heights attacking a Lebanese radar station along the way The upper floors of the Syrian GHQ and the Air Force Command were badly damaged A Soviet cultural center a television station and other nearby structures were also mistakenly hit One Israeli Phantom was shot down 224 The strike prompted the Syrians to transfer air defense units from the Golan Heights to the home front allowing the Israeli Air Force greater freedom of action 219 ",
