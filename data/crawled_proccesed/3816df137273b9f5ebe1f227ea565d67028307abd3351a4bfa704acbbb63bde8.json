			"previous": " The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi They show a Christian iconography emerging initially from Roman popular decorative art but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs Initially Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and later narrative religious scenes 99 The Early Christians habit after the end of their persecution of building churches most famously St Peter s Rome over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art the church monument or tomb inside a church 100 The beliefs of many cultures including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries though see above for Moche and below for Islamic culture 101 ",
			"after": " Christians believed in a bodily resurrection of the dead at the Second Coming of Christ and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963 102 Although mass ossuaries have also been used burial has always been the preferred Christian tradition at least until recent times Burial was for as long as there was room usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church with a gravestone or horizontal slab or for the wealthy or important clergy inside it Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself often in a sarcophagus while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor with a monument on the wall Persons of importance especially monarchs might be buried in a free standing sarcophagus perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture grandest of all were the shrines of saints which became the destinations of pilgrimages The monument to Maximilian I Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche Innsbruck took decades to complete 103 while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form 104 ",
