			"after": " A voltage doubler is an electronic circuit which charges capacitors from the input voltage and switches these charges in such a way that in the ideal case exactly twice the voltage is produced at the output as at its input The simplest of these circuits are a form of rectifier which take an AC voltage as input and output a doubled DC voltage The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the alternating voltage of the input DC to DC voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching They frequently also require a switching element that can be controlled directly such as a transistor rather than relying on the voltage across the switch as in the simple AC to DC case Voltage doublers are a variety of voltage multiplier circuit Many but not all voltage doubler circuits can be viewed as a single stage of a higher order multiplier cascading identical stages together achieves a greater voltage multiplication ",
