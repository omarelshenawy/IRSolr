			"after": " Nupedia was an English language Web based encyclopedia whose articles were written by volunteer contributors with appropriate subject matter expertise reviewed by expert editors before publication and licensed as free content It was founded by Jimmy Wales and underwritten by Bomis with Larry Sanger as editor in chief Nupedia lasted from March 2000 1 until September 2003 It is mostly known now as the predecessor of Wikipedia but Nupedia had a seven step approval process to control content of articles before being posted rather than live wiki based updating Nupedia was designed by committee with experts to predefine the rules and it approved only 21 articles in its first year compared to Wikipedia posting 200 articles in the first month and 18 000 in the first year 2 Unlike Wikipedia Nupedia was not a wiki it was instead characterized by an extensive peer review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias Nupedia wanted scholars to volunteer content Before it ceased operating Nupedia produced 25 approved articles 3 that had completed its review process three articles also existed in two versions of different lengths and 74 more articles were in progress citation needed Jimmy Wales preferred Wikipedia s easier posting of articles but Larry Sanger wanted to control content at Nupedia 2 and founded Citizendium instead ",
