			"after": " The African elephant was first named by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797 as Elephas africana 17 The genus Loxodonta was commonly believed to have been named by Georges Cuvier in 1825 Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte and an anonymous author romanised the spelling to Loxodonta the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises this as the proper authority 18 In 1942 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by Henry Fairfield Osborn but further morphological data has reduced the number of classified subspecies 19 and by the 1990s only two were recognised the savannah or bush elephant L a africana and the forest elephant L a cyclotis 20 the latter has smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks and is limited to the forested areas of western and Central Africa 21 A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species L africana and L cyclotis respectively based on differences in skull morphology 22 DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species 23 24 while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species 25 26 Further studies 2010 and 2011 have supported African savannah and forest elephants status as separate species 27 28 As of 2011 the taxonomic designations of African elephants were still debated 28 The third edition of Mammal Species of the World lists the two forms as full species 18 and does not list any subspecies in its entry for Loxodonta africana 18 This approach is not taken by the United Nations Environment Programme s World Conservation Monitoring Centre nor by the IUCN both of which list L cyclotis as a synonym of L africana 29 30 Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species 31 although this is disputed 26 28 The pygmy elephants of the Congo Basin which have been suggested to be a separate species Loxodonta pumilio are probably forest elephants whose small size and or early maturity are due to environmental conditions 32 ",
