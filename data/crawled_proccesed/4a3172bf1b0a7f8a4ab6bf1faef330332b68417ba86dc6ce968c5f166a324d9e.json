			"previous": " Saavedra increased his resistance to Moreno s proposals after the victory at the Battle of Suipacha considering that the revolution had defeated its enemies and should relax its severity in consequence 100 The Regiment of Patricians hosted a banquet celebration at the barracks restricting attendance to the military and supporters of Saavedra Moreno was not allowed to pass by the guards at the door which generated a small incident 101 That same night Officer Atanasio Duarte who was drunk gave a crown of sugar to Saavedra s wife and saluted Saavedra as if he was the new king or emperor of the Americas 102 The next day when Moreno heard about the incident he wrote the Honours Suppression decree which suppressed the ceremony usually reserved for the president of the Junta and inherited privileges of the office of viceroy 102 Duarte was exiled and Moreno s act was justified by stating that An inhabitant of Buenos Aires neither drunk nor asleep should be expressed against the freedom of his country 103 Saavedra signed the decree without complaint but Gregorio Funes felt that the Patricians resented Moreno because of this 104 ",
