			"previous": " The DA36 E Star an aircraft designed by Siemens Diamond Aircraft and EADS employs a series hybrid powertrain with the propeller being turned by a Siemens 70 kW 94 hp electric motor The aim is to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25 percent An onboard 40 hp 30 kW Austro Engines Wankel rotary engine and generator provides the electricity A propeller speed reduction unit is eliminated The electric motor uses electricity stored in batteries with the engines off to take off and climb reducing sound emissions The series hybrid powertrain using the Wankel engine reduces the weight of the plane by 100 kilograms from its predecessor The DA36 E Star first flew in June 2013 making this the first ever flight of a series hybrid powertrain Diamond Aircraft state that the technology using Wankel engines is scalable to a 100 seat aircraft 91 92 ",
			"after": " Due to the compact size and the high power to weight ratio of a Wankel engine a number have been proposed for electric vehicles as range extenders with a number of concept cars displaying a series hybrid powertrain arrangement A Wankel engine used only as a generator has packaging and weight distribution advantages maximizing interior passenger and luggage space when used in a vehicle The engine generator may be at one end of the vehicle with the electric driving motors at the other connected only by thin light cables In 2010 Audi revealed a prototype series hybrid electric car the A1 e tron that incorporated a small 250 cc Wankel engine running at 5 000 rpm recharging the car s batteries as needed and providing electricity directly to the electric driving motor 93 94 In 2010 FEV Inc revealed that in their prototype electric version of the Fiat 500 a Wankel engine would also be used as a range extender 95 Valmet Automotive of Finland in 2013 revealed a prototype incorporating a Wankel powered series hybrid powertrain car named the EVA utilizing an engine manufactured by the German company Wankel SuperTec 96 ",
