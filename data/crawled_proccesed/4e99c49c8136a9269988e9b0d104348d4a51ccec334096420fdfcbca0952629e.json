			"after": " Peake s portrait of Lady Elizabeth Pope may have been commissioned by her husband Sir William Pope to commemorate their marriage in 1615 Lady Elizabeth is portrayed with her hair loose a symbol of bridal virginity 49 She wears a draped mantle embroidered with seed pearls in a pattern of ostrich plumes and a matching turban The mantle knotted on one shoulder was worn in Jacobean court masques as the costume designs of Inigo Jones indicate The painting s near nudity however makes the depiction of an actual masque costume unlikely 50 Loose hair and the classical draped mantle also figure in contemporary personifications of abstract concepts in masques and paintings Yale art historian Ellen Chirelstein argues that Peake is portraying Lady Elizabeth as a personification of America since her father Sir Thomas Watson was a major shareholder in the Virginia Company 51 50 ",
