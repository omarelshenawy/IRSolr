			"after": " Glutathione is a cysteine containing peptide found in most forms of aerobic life 82 It is not required in the diet and is instead synthesized in cells from its constituent amino acids 83 Glutathione has antioxidant properties since the thiol group in its cysteine moiety is a reducing agent and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced In cells glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by the enzyme glutathione reductase and in turn reduces other metabolites and enzyme systems such as ascorbate in the glutathione ascorbate cycle glutathione peroxidases and glutaredoxins as well as reacting directly with oxidants 77 Due to its high concentration and its central role in maintaining the cell s redox state glutathione is one of the most important cellular antioxidants 82 In some organisms glutathione is replaced by other thiols such as by mycothiol in the Actinomycetes bacillithiol in some Gram positive bacteria 84 85 or by trypanothione in the Kinetoplastids 86 87 ",
