			"previous": " In the 18th century Adam Smith presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics 54 The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U S antitrust law The most influential proponents such as Richard Posner and Oliver Williamson and the so called Chicago School of economists and lawyers including Milton Friedman and Gary Becker are generally advocates of deregulation and privatisation and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of free markets 55 ",
			"after": " The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase whose first major article The Nature of the Firm 1937 argued that the reason for the existence of firms companies partnerships etc is the existence of transaction costs 57 Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost effective His second major article The Problem of Social Cost 1960 argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes 58 Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move 59 Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery or that the doctor had to put up with it they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this 60 So the law ought to pre empt what would happen and be guided by the most efficient solution The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe 61 Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market by analysing the costs of action 62 ",
