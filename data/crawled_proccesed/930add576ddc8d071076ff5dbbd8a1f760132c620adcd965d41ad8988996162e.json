			"previous": " The camas pocket gopher is a mostly solitary herbivore which is active throughout the year and does not hibernate 48 The gopher spends most of its time excavating tunnels in search of food 49 and the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley pose a challenge 10 Although the gopher s front claws are too weak to dig through the clay particularly during dry seasons its large incisors and strongly protuberant orientation are well adapted for this purpose Tunnel systems constructed by the camas pocket gopher can be complex with some tunnels exceeding 240 m 260 yd in length About 90 mm 3 5 in in diameter the tunnels are up to 0 91 m 3 0 ft deep 10 When soils are damp the gopher constructs ventilation ducts or chimney mounds possibly unique to the species 49 to increase ventilation 10 The chimney mounds rise vertically 15 25 cm 6 10 in are open at the top and are thought to ventilate the burrows in accordance with Bernoulli s principle 49 It is not known if adjacent gopher burrowing systems interconnect 49 Reports differ about whether or not the ranges of the camas pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher overlap if so this refutes the previous belief that Oregon gopher ranges do not overlap 10 ",
			"after": " Although the species is primarily fossorial it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel 10 Dandelions seem to be its favorite food and are also used as nesting material 50 During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females and males and females may make purring or cooing sounds when they are together 51 Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing 51 with the young twittering in response 28 ",
