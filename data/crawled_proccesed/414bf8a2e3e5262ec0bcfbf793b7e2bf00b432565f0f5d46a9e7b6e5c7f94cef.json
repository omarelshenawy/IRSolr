			"after": " Compressor axially symmetric stalls or compressor surges are immediately identifiable because they produce one or more extremely loud bangs from the engine Reports of jets of flame emanating from the engine are common during this type of compressor stall These stalls may be accompanied by an increased exhaust gas temperature an increase in rotor speed due to the large reduction in work done by the stalled compressor and in the case of multi engine aircraft yawing in the direction of the affected engine due to the loss of thrust Severe stresses occur within the engine and aircraft particularly from the intense aerodynamic buffeting within the compressor ",
