			"previous": " Some authors allow to be the zero vector in the definition of eigenvector 20 This is reasonable as long as we define eigenvalues and eigenvectors carefully If we would like the zero vector to be an eigenvector then we must first define an eigenvalue of as a scalar in such that there is a nonzero vector in with We then define an eigenvector to be a vector in such that there is an eigenvalue in with This way we ensure that it is not the case that every scalar is an eigenvalue corresponding to the zero vector ",
			"after": " If is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue then any scalar multiple of with nonzero is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue since Moreover if and are eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue and then is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue Therefore the set of all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue together with the zero vector is a linear subspace of called the eigenspace of associated to 21 22 23 If that subspace has dimension 1 it is sometimes called an eigenline 24 ",
