			"after": " In general polymeric mixtures are far less miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials This effect results from the fact that the driving force for mixing is usually entropy not interaction energy In other words miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self interaction but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles or moles being mixed Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume The energetics of mixing on the other hand is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thus make solvation less favorable Thus concentrated solutions of polymers are far rarer than those of small molecules ",
