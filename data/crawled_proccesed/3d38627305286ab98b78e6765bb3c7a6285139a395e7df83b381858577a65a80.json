			"after": " Welcome to Wikipedia s portal for Radio  Radio is the wireless transmission of signals by modulation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies below those of visible light  Electromagnetic radiation travels by means of oscillating electromagnetic fields that pass through the air and the vacuum of space It does not require a medium of transport Information is carried by systematically changing modulating some property of the radiated waves such as their amplitude or their frequency When radio waves pass an electrical conductor the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor ",
