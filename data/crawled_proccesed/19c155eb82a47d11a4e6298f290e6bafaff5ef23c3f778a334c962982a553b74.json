			"previous": " The 19S regulatory particle has been observed in three strongly differing conformational states to date 26 Realization of all these three conformational states is likely necessary for accomplishing substrate recognition and degradation see below A hallmark of the AAA ATPase configuration in this predominant low energy state is a staircase or lockwasher like arrangement of the AAA domains 23 24 Also in the presence of ATP but absence of substrate an alternative less abundant conformation of the 19S is adopted primarily differing in the positioning of the lid with respect to the AAA ATPase module 26 In the presence of ATP gammaS or a substrate stabilized in a 26S mutant with defective Rpn11 a third conformation has been observed displaying a dramatic structural change of the AAA ATPase module 27 28 ",
