			"previous": " On 22 May 1883 Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria 104 Although the operas with Gilbert had earned him the broadest fame the honour was conferred for his services to serious music 105 The musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera 90 Having just signed the five year agreement Sullivan suddenly felt trapped 106 In mid December he bade farewell to his sister in law Charlotte Fred s widow who emigrated with her young family to America Sullivan s oldest nephew Herbert stayed behind in England as his uncle s ward 107 The next opera Princess Ida 1884 the duo s only three act blank verse work had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors although Sullivan s score was praised With box office receipts lagging in March 1884 Carte gave the six months notice under the partnership contract requiring a new opera 108 Sullivan s close friend the composer Frederic Clay had suffered a serious stroke in early December 1883 that effectively ended his career at the age of 45 Sullivan reflecting on this on his own longstanding kidney problems and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music replied to Carte I t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself 109 ",
			"after": " Gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge The composer wrote on 1 April 1884 that he had come to the end of my tether with the operas I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one syllable should be lost I should like to set a story of human interest probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous not serious situation where if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character 110 In a lengthy exchange of correspondence Sullivan pronounced Gilbert s plot sketch particularly the lozenge element unacceptably mechanical and too similar in both its grotesque elements of topsyturveydom and in actual plot to their earlier work especially The Sorcerer n 16 and repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject 111 The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device The result was Gilbert and Sullivan s most successful work The Mikado 1885 112 The piece ran for 672 performances which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time n 17 ",
