			"previous": " This gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line If the graph of the function is not a straight line however then the change in y divided by the change in x varies Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output with respect to change in input To be concrete let f be a function and fix a point a in the domain of f a f a is a point on the graph of the function If h is a number close to zero then a h is a number close to a Therefore a h f a h is close to a f a The slope between these two points is",
			"after": " This expression is called a difference quotient A line through two points on a curve is called a secant line so m is the slope of the secant line between a f a and a h f a h The secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point a because it does not account for what happens between a and a h It is not possible to discover the behavior at a by setting h to zero because this would require dividing by zero which is undefined The derivative is defined by taking the limit as h tends to zero meaning that it considers the behavior of f for all small values of h and extracts a consistent value for the case when h equals zero ",
