			"previous": " The principle of inclusions and components states that with sedimentary rocks if inclusions or clasts are found in a formation then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them For example in sedimentary rocks it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows and are incorporated later to cool in the matrix As a result xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them ",
