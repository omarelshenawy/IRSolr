			"previous": " Because they were unable to be used by orchestras music makers began to build smaller gong drums that would not carry a definite pitch This smaller version of the gong drum is today called orchestral bass drum and it is the prototype with which people are most familiar today The modern bass drum is used primarily in orchestras The drum similar to the davul and long drum is double headed rod tensioned and measures roughly 40 inches in diameter and 20 inches in width 3 Most orchestral bass drums are situated within a frame which allows them to be positioned at any angle 3 ",
			"after": " Bass drums are also highly visible in modern drum kits In 1909 William Ludwig created a workable bass drum pedal which would strike a two headed bass drum in much the same way as a drumstick 10 During the 1960s many rock n roll drummers began incorporating more than one bass drum in their drum kit including The Who s Keith Moon and Cream s Ginger Baker 3 10 ",
