			"previous": " Liquid helium below its lambda point begins to exhibit very unusual characteristics in a state called helium II When helium II boils due to its high thermal conductivity it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface Helium 3 also has a superfluid phase but only at much lower temperatures as a result less is known about such properties in the isotope 10 ",
			"after": " Helium II is a superfluid a quantum mechanical state see macroscopic quantum phenomena of matter with strange properties For example when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10 7 to 10 8 m it has no measurable viscosity 9 However when measurements were done between two moving discs a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed Current theory explains this using the two fluid model for helium II In this model liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state which behave more like an ordinary fluid 52 ",
