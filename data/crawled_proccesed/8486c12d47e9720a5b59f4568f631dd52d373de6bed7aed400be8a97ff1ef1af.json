			"previous": " After the Kansas campaign ended in disarray in November 1867 the AERA increasingly divided into two wings both advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches One wing whose leading figure was Lucy Stone was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement The other whose leading figures were Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony insisted that women and black men should be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a politically independent women s movement that would no longer be dependent on abolitionists 62 Stanton and Anthony expressed their views in a newspaper called The Revolution which began publishing in January 1868 with initial funding from the controversial George Francis Train 63 ",
			"after": " Disagreement was especially sharp over the proposed Fifteenth Amendment which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race In practice it would theoretically at least guarantee suffrage for virtually all males 64 Anthony and Stanton opposed passage of the amendment unless it was accompanied by a Sixteenth Amendment that would guarantee suffrage for women Otherwise they said it would create an aristocracy of sex by giving constitutional authority to the belief that men were superior to women 65 Male power and privilege was at the root of society s ills Stanton argued and nothing should be done to strengthen it 66 Anthony and Stanton also warned that black men who would have voting power under the amendment were overwhelmingly opposed to women s suffrage 67 They were not alone in being unsure of black male support for women s suffrage Frederick Douglass a strong supporter of women s suffrage said The race to which I belong have not generally taken the right ground on this question 68 ",
