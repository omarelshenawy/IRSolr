			"previous": " Most of the complexity of the clock lies in this adjustment process The adjustment tries to correct for unwanted side effects such as frequencies from other electron transitions temperature changes and the spreading in frequencies caused by ensemble effects clarification needed One way of doing this is to sweep the microwave oscillator s frequency across a narrow range to generate a modulated signal at the detector The detector s signal can then be demodulated to apply feedback to control long term drift in the radio frequency In this way the quantum mechanical properties of the atomic transition frequency of the caesium can be used to tune the microwave oscillator to the same frequency except for a small amount of experimental error When a clock is first turned on it takes a while for the oscillator to stabilize In practice the feedback and monitoring mechanism is much more complex than described above ",
			"after": " A number of other atomic clock schemes are in use for other purposes Rubidium standard clocks are prized for their low cost small size commercial standards are as small as 17 cm3 13 and short term stability They are used in many commercial portable and aerospace applications Hydrogen masers often manufactured in Russia have superior short term stability compared to other standards but lower long term accuracy ",
