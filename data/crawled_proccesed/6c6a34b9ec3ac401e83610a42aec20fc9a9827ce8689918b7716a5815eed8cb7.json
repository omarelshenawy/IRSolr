			"previous": " The simplest structure that can be implemented is a step in the characteristic impedance of the line which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line Figure 4 a shows a step up in impedance narrower lines have higher impedance A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4 a The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor or more exactly as a low pass T circuit as shown in figure 4 a 34 Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order These impedance transformers can be just a short often 4 length of transmission line These composite structures can implement any of the filter families Butterworth Chebyshev etc by approximating the rational function of the corresponding lumped element filter This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters the so called semi lumped structures 35 ",
			"after": " Another very common component of distributed element filters is the stub Over a narrow range of frequencies a stub can be used as a capacitor or an inductor its impedance is determined by its length but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator Short circuit nominally quarter wavelength stubs figure 3 a behave as shunt LC antiresonators and an open circuit nominally quarter wavelength stub figure 3 b behaves as a series LC resonator Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and as would be expected from their resonant nature are most useful in band pass applications 38 While open circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit see figure 4 b often leading to a preference for short circuit stubs one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting 4 to or from the length 34 ",
