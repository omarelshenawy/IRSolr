			"previous": " The F 14 s problems did not afflict TF30 engines in the F 111 to nearly the same extent as the USAF and RAAF F 111 The F 111 while technically designated as a fighter was actually used as a strike aircraft against ground targets representing the frequent dichotomy between USAF and USN USMC in defining what is a fighter aircraft with the former utilizing the term for many of its ground attack strike aircraft while the latter reserving the term only for those aircraft which can engage in air to air combat and referring to its strike aircraft as attack aircraft The strike mission is characterized by discrete phases so less abrupt changes in throttle angle of attack and altitude are required than in air to air combat against a peer or near peer adversary aircraft Though the F 14A entered service with the Navy powered by Pratt Whitney TF30 by the end of the decade following numerous problems with the original engine the Department of Defense began procuring F110 GE 400 engines and installed them in the F 14A Plus later redesignated to F 14B in 1991 which entered service with the fleet in 1988 These engines solved the reliability problems and provided nearly 30 more thrust achieving a 1 1 dry thrust to weight ratio The subsequent F 14D a combination of both remanufactured upgraded F 14As and new manufacture F 14Ds also used F110 GE 400 engines ",
