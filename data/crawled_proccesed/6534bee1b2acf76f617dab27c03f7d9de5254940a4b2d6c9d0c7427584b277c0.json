			"previous": " By March 1970 1970 03 Aerol neas Argentinas had a fleet of six Boeing 707s that served routes to Europe and the United States three Caravelles 6Rs and four Comet 4s that flew regional services and 12 HS 748s that flew domestically whereas six Boeing 737 200s were on order 29 During the decade the fleet saw the arrival of three different aircraft types from Boeing the 727 the first example entered the fleet in December 1979 1979 12 on lease from Hughes AirWest and three more were ordered directly from Boeing 30 31 the 737 32 and the 747 33 The incorporation of the Fokker F 28 into the fleet in the mid 1970s prompted the withdrawal of the last HS 748s making the company to be the first South American airline in operating an all jet aircraft park 34 Frankfurt Madrid and Rome became the first destinations to be served with the brand new 747s starting January 1977 1977 01 35 Another milestone for the company took place in June 1980 1980 06 with the first south polar scheduled service linking Buenos Aires with Hong Kong via Auckland 36 Late that year a second hand Boeing 747SP was acquired from Braniff for US 51 000 000 145 976 171 in 2015 37 ",
			"after": " The airline was assigned by law the monopoly of international operations from Argentina in 1971 38 This meant no other Argentine airline was able to operate international flights let alone the already created Austral The carrier therefore became the flag carrier of the country The same law also assigned Aerol neas Argentinas a 50 of the domestic market share 38 Following the acquisition of Austral by the Argentine government in 1980 both Aerol neas Argentinas and Austral became government owned to the extent that some routes were simultaneously operated even using similar equipment However there existed a state of continuous tension over salary differences between both companies that eventually led the Aerol neas Argentinas pilots to a three week long strike that started on 1 July 1986 39 During this strike the government leased pilots from the Argentine Air Force to operate some aircraft Other companies took advantage from this situation and gained the market share Aerol neas Argentinas lost as domestic routes were operated by Austral LADE and LAPA and the government temporarily authorised foreign carriers to exploit the company s international routes 40 ",
