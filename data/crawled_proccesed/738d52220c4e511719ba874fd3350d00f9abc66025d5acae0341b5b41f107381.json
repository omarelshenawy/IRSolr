			"previous": " The search engine then analyzes the contents of each page to determine how it should be indexed for example words can be extracted from the titles page content headings or special fields called meta tags Data about web pages are stored in an index database for use in later queries A query from a user can be a single word The index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible 12 Some search engines such as Google store all or part of the source page referred to as a cache as well as information about the web pages whereas others such as AltaVista store every word of every page they find citation needed This cached page always holds the actual search text since it is the one that was actually indexed so it can be very useful when the content of the current page has been updated and the search terms are no longer in it 12 This problem might be considered a mild form of linkrot and Google s handling of it increases usability by satisfying user expectations that the search terms will be on the returned webpage This satisfies the principle of least astonishment since the user normally expects that the search terms will be on the returned pages Increased search relevance makes these cached pages very useful as they may contain data that may no longer be available elsewhere citation needed ",
