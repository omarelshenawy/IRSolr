			"previous": " As an example of viral classification the chicken pox virus varicella zoster VZV belongs to the order Herpesvirales family Herpesviridae subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and genus Varicellovirus VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use reverse transcriptase ",
			"after": " Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold influenza chickenpox and cold sores Many serious diseases such as Ebola virus disease AIDS avian influenza and SARS are caused by viruses The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 HHV6 and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome 133 There is controversy over whether the bornavirus previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans 134 ",
