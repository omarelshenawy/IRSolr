			"previous": " Sue Hendrickson amateur paleontologist discovered the most complete approximately 85 and largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith South Dakota on August 12 1990 This Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Sue in her honor was the object of a legal battle over its ownership In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams the original land owner The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for USD 7 6 million making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History preparators spent over 25 000 man hours taking the rock off each of the bones 164 The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made The finished mount was then taken apart and along with the bones shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17 2000 in the great hall Stanley Field Hall at the Field Museum of Natural History A study of this specimen s fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at age 28 the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived 165 Early speculation that Sue may have died from a bite to the back of the head was not confirmed Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton no bite marks were found 166 Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post mortem trampling Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat ultimately leading Sue to starve because she could no longer swallow food This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern day birds that contract the same parasite 167 ",
			"after": " Another Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Stan in honor of amateur paleontologist Stan Sacrison was found in the Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo South Dakota in the spring of 1987 It was not collected until 1992 as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton Stan is 63 complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City South Dakota after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996 35 This tyrannosaur too was found to have many bone pathologies including broken and healed ribs a broken and healed neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head about the size of a Tyrannosaurus tooth 168 ",
