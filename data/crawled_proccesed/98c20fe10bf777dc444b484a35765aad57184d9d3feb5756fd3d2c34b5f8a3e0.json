			"after": " By the early 1950s the bare metal finish on most BEA aircraft had evolved to incorporate a burgundy cheatline separated by two thin white lines above the cabin windows on each side of the fuselage This cheatline was in turn separated by upper case burgundy British European Airways titles in the middle The bottom burgundy part of this cheatline extended below the flightdeck windows to converge on the nose with the space in between painted black matte finish to reduce glare for the pilots and shield sensitive navigational equipment housed in the nose from radiation There was a contemporary BEA logo on each side of the forward fuselage featuring a stylised wing and BEA in capital letters on each side of the nose In addition to the aircraft registration there was also a coat of arms on each side of the rear fuselage and a small Union flag each side of the lower part of the tail The letters BEA appeared in bold upper case on the upper left and lower right wing while the aircraft registration appeared in bold upper case on the upper right and lower left wing 209 Later adaptations of this livery used on DC 3s Pionairs featured an unbroken cheatline with large upper case British European Airways titles on a white upper fuselage and a larger Union flag as well as the aircraft registration each side of a white tail and the aircraft s name prominently displayed in a white field on the left side of the nose and a coat of arms on its right side 210 When applied to BEA s Elizabethans this lacked British European Airways titles due to the aircraft s high wing configuration that left insufficient space on the upper fuselage 211 ",
