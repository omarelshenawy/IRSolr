			"previous": " The Lockheed C 5 Galaxy was considered for the shuttle carrier role by NASA but rejected in favor of the 747 in part due to the 747 s low wing design in comparison to the C 5 s high wing design and also because the U S Air Force would have retained ownership of the C 5 while NASA could own the 747s outright ",
			"after": " The first aircraft a Boeing 747 100 registered N905NA was originally manufactured for American Airlines and still carried visible American cheatlines while testing Enterprise in the 1970s It was acquired in 1974 and initially used for trailing wake vortex research as part of a broader study by NASA Dryden as well as Shuttle tests involving an F 104 flying in close formation and simulating a release from the 747 The aircraft appears in the background of a scene from The Six Million Dollar Man s second season episode The Deadly Replay filmed in 1974 at Edwards AFB ",
