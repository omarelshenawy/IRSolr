			"previous": " Although the modern county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974 the history of its constituent settlements and parts goes back centuries There is evidence of Iron Age habitation particularly at Mellor 5 and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion believed to have been an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes 6 Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey 7 The remains of 1st century forts at Castlefield in Manchester 8 and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth 9 are evidence of Roman occupation Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086 Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken rather than sparsity of population 10 ",
			"after": " During the Middle Ages much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire an ancient division of the county of Lancashire Salfordshire encompassed several parishes and townships some of which like Rochdale were important market towns and centres of England s woollen trade The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic flannel and fustian cloth production which encouraged a system of cross regional trade 11 12 13 In the late 18th century the Industrial Revolution transformed the local domestic system mechanisation enabled the industrialisation of the region s textile trade triggering rapid growth in the cotton industry and expansion in ancillary trades 14 Infrastructure such as rows of terraced housing factories and roads were constructed to house labour transport goods and produce cotton goods on an industrial scale for a global market 14 13 The townships in and around Manchester began expanding at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in industrial textile production and processing 15 This population increase resulted in the vigourous concentric growth of a conurbation between Manchester and an arc of surrounding mill towns formed from a steady acretion of houses factories and transport infrastructure 16 Places such as Bury Oldham and Bolton played a central economic role nationally and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive cotton producing towns in the world 17 However it was Manchester that was the most populous settlement a major city the world s largest marketplace for cotton goods 18 19 and the natural centre of its region 20 By 1835 Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world 19 and by 1848 urban sprawl had fused the city to its surrounding towns and hinterland to form a single continuous conurbation 16 In the 1910s local government reforms to administer this conurbation as a single entity were proposed 21 ",
