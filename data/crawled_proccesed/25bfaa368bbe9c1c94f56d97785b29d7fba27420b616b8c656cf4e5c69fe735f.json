			"after": " Manual gas tungsten arc welding is often considered who the most difficult of all the welding processes commonly used in industry Because the welder must maintain a short arc length great care and skill are required to prevent contact between the electrode and the workpiece Similar to torch welding GTAW normally requires two hands since most applications require that the welder manually feed a filler metal into the weld area with one hand while manipulating the welding torch in the other However some welds combining thin materials known as autogenous or fusion welds can be accomplished without filler metal most notably edge corner and butt joints ",
