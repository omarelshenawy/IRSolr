			"after": " Glaciers erode terrain through two principal processes abrasion and plucking  As glaciers flow over bedrock they soften and lift blocks of rock into the ice This process called plucking is caused by subglacial water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands This expansion causes the ice to act as a lever that loosens the rock by lifting it Thus sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier s load If a retreating glacier gains enough debris it may become a rock glacier like the Timpanogos Glacier in Utah ",
