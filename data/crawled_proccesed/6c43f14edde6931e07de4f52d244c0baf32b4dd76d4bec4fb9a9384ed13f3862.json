			"previous": " In the days of metal type when each size was cut individually display types were often cut that were adjusted for display use These modifications continued to be made after fonts became made by scaling using a pantograph but began to fade away with the advent of phototypesetting and then digital fonts which can both be printed at any size Premium digital fonts used for magazines books and newspapers do often include display variants but they are often not included with typefaces bundled with operating systems and desktop publishing software 23 24 ",
			"after": " Decades into the desktop publishing revolution few typographers with metal foundry type experience are still working and few digital typefaces are optimized specifically for different sizes so the misuse of the term display typeface as a synonym for ornamental type has become widespread properly speaking ornamental typefaces are a subcategory of display typefaces At the same time with new printing techniques typefaces have largely replaced hand lettering for very large signs and notices that would once have been painted or carved by hand 25 ",
