			"previous": " In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer Gerald Hawkins who proposed that Stonehenge was a Neolithic computer 19 inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed 20 but this was not the case for Alexander Thom s work whose survey results of megalithic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles 21 Euan MacKie recognizing that Thom s theories needed to be tested excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter s prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom s long alignment hypothesis Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site led him to check Thom s geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay also with a positive result MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom s conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain 22 In contrast a re evaluation of Thom s fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom s claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence 23 Nevertheless Thom s legacy remains strong Krupp 24 wrote in 1979 Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo astronomical fieldwork and interpretation and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy 25 26 ",
			"after": " The approach in the New World where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in Amerindian civilizations was markedly different They had access to sources that the prehistory of Europe lacks such as ethnographies 27 28 and the historical records of the early colonizers Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni 29 30 this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe 31 ",
