			"after": " Coonley died in 1958 46 ACS had looked to Coonley for her leadership over the years but even more so for her philanthropy ACS began charging tuition in 1929 but still relied on Coonley s financial support and her death caused serious financial hardship Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach a summer program was launched in 1960 open to all children from the surrounding area to increase revenues and visibility A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program Enrollment had declined over the years and Malach marketed the program aggressively personally interviewing prospective students In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability 47 ",
