			"after": " A rocket powered aircraft or rocket plane is an aircraft that uses a rocket engine for propulsion sometimes in addition to airbreathing jet engines Rocket planes can achieve much higher speeds than similarly sized jet aircraft but typically for at most a few minutes of powered operation followed by a glide Unhindered by the need for oxygen from the atmosphere they are suitable for very high altitude flight They are also capable of delivering much higher acceleration and shorter takeoffs ",
