			"previous": " Although the platypus eyes are small and not used under water several features indicate that vision played an important role in its ancestors The corneal surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea lions A temporal ear side concentration of retinal ganglion cells important for binocular vision indicates a role in predation while the accompanying visual acuity is insufficient for such activities Furthermore this limited acuity is matched by a low cortical magnification a small lateral geniculate nucleus and a large optic tectum suggesting that the visual midbrain plays a more important role than the visual cortex like in some rodents These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system an evolutionary process paralleled by the small number of electroreceptors in the short beaked echidna who dwells in dry environments whilst the long beaked echidna who lives in moist environments is intermediate between the other two monotremes 34 ",
			"after": " The platypus is semiaquatic inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of Tasmania and the Australian Alps to the tropical rainforests of coastal Queensland as far north as the base of the Cape York Peninsula 40 Inland its distribution is not well known it is extinct in South Australia apart from an introduced population on Kangaroo Island 41 and is no longer found in the main part of the Murray Darling Basin possibly due to the declining water quality brought about by extensive land clearing and irrigation schemes 42 Along the coastal river systems its distribution is unpredictable it appears to be absent from some relatively healthy rivers and yet maintains a presence in others that are quite degraded the lower Maribyrnong for example 43 ",
