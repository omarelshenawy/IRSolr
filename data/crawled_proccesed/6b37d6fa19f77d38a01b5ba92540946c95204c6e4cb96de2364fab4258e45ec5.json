			"after": " The manufacture of textiles in Crompton can be traced back to 1474 when a lease dated from that year outlines that the occupant of Crompton Park had spinning wheels cards and looms all of which suggest that cloth was being produced in large quantities 21 The upland geography of the area constrained the output of crop growing and so prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade Wills and inventories from the 15th and 16th centuries suggest most families were involved with small scale pasture but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens in the domestic system and selling cloth linen and fustians to travelling chapmen for the markets in Manchester and Rochdale 21 Despite its remoteness by the Pennines by the Early Modern period the domestic system in Crompton had produced relatively wealthy inhabitants 22 The most affluent were those involved in cloth and linen and their wealth was comparable to that of the merchants of Manchester and Salford 22 ",
