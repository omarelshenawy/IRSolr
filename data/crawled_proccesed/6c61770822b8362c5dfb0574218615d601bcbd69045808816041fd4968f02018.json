			"after": " The frequency of the sounds that the source emits does not actually change To understand what happens consider the following analogy Someone throws one ball every second in a man s direction Assume that balls travel with constant velocity If the thrower is stationary the man will receive one ball every second However if the thrower is moving towards the man he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out The inverse is true if the thrower is moving away from the man So it is actually the wavelength which is affected as a consequence the received frequency is also affected It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes hence frequency also changes ",
