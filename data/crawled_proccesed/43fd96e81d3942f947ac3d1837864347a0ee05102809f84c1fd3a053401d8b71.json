			"previous": " By the mid to late 19th century efforts were being made to standardize electrical measurement Lord Kelvin was an important figure in this process introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity In 1857 he introduced a series of effective instruments including the quadrant electrometer which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement He invented the current balance also known as the Kelvin balance or Ampere balance SiC for the precise specification of the ampere the standard unit of electric current 7 ",
			"after": " Another important figure was R E B Crompton who became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century Many companies had entered the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for voltage frequency current and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams Adjacent buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because they had been fitted out by different companies Crompton could see the lack of efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international standard for electric engineering 8 ",
