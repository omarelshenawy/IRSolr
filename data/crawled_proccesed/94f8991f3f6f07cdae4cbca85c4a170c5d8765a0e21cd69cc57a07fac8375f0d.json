			"previous": " The bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals 43 However other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage 44 With the Canadian lynx however the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative 6 ",
			"after": " Bobcats typically live to six or eight years of age with a few reaching beyond ten The longest they have been known to live is 16 years in the wild and 32 years in captivity 34  They generally begin breeding by their second summer though females may start as early as their first year Sperm production begins each year by September or October and the male will be fertile into the summer A dominant male will travel with a female and mate with her several times generally from winter until early spring this varies by location but most mating takes place during February and March The pair may undertake a number of different behaviors including bumping chasing and ambushing Other males may be in attendance but remain uninvolved Once the male recognizes the female is receptive he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her The female may later go on to mate with other males 28 and males will generally mate with several females 45 During courtship the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams hisses or other sounds 46 Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring 30 The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days with the estrus lasting five to ten days Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives 14 45 ",
