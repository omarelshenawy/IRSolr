			"previous": " Much information about the bird s appearance comes from a painting attributed to Jacob Hoefnagel based on a bird in the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II around 1610 13 It is the only coloured depiction of the species showing the plumage as reddish brown but it is unknown whether it was based on a stuffed or living specimen 9 The bird had most likely been brought alive to Europe as it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens Most tropical specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet It had probably lived in the emperor s zoo for a while together with the other animals painted for the same series 4 The painting was discovered in the emperor s collection and published in 1868 by Georg von Frauenfeld along with a painting of a dodo from the same collection and artist 5 This specimen is thought to have been the only red rail that ever reached Europe 14 ",
			"after": " The travel journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland 1601 1603 rediscovered in the 1860s contains good sketches of several now extinct Mauritian birds attributed to the artist Joris Laerle including an unlabelled red rail The bird appears to have been stunned or killed and the sketch is the earliest record of the species but was only rediscovered in the 1860s The image was sketched with pencil and finished in ink but details such as a deeper beak and the shoulder of the wing are only seen in the underlying sketch 15 In addition there are three rather crude black and white sketches but differences in them were enough for some authors to suggest that each image depicted a distinct species leading to the creation of several scientific names which are now synonymous with Aphanapteryx bonasia 11 ",
