			"after": " The site of Brougham Castle has been fortified since the Romans erected the fort of Brocavum at the intersection of three Roman roads With the rivers Eamont and Lowther flowing nearby and meeting to the west the site had natural defences and the area was fertile and easy to cultivate A civilian settlement grew around the fort When Angles arrived in the area they named the place Brougham meaning the village by the fort 2 Between the end of Roman rule in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century Cumbria was a turbulent area Although the site was a defendable position there is no evidence that Brougham was refortified during this time In 1092 William II also known as William Rufus captured Cumbria south of the Solway Firth and established a new border far north of Brougham The site at Brougham remained unfortified Carlisle Castle secured the border and castles at Appleby and Brough both south east of Brougham protected the line of communication from Carlisle to Yorkshire 3 In 1203 the barony of Westmorland containing Appleby Brough and Brougham was granted to Robert de Vieuxpont by King John A favourite of John s Vieuxpont was one of only a few lords loyal to him in northern England whose inhabitants became so discontented with the king s rule that they eventually rebelled Around 1214 Vieuxpont asserted control over more land including half the manor of Brougham It was in this atmosphere of unrest that Brougham Castle was founded 4 ",
