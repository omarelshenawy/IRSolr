			"previous": " Command of A Company was temporarily handed over to the second in command Captain Bob Murdoch Present at Pakchon in November 1950 O Dowd understood first hand the dangers of withdrawing while in contact The challenge was to protect the forward platoons as they withdrew from being followed up by the Chinese occupying the old B Company positions and from D Company s position after they broke contact The Australians would also have to clear the withdrawal route of any blocking forces while at the same time the evacuation of a large number of wounded and Chinese prisoners would hamper their movement 86 As such the timing of the withdrawal would be critical to its success Consequently the lead company would not move until mid afternoon so that the rearguard would be able to use the protection of darkness to break contact while at the same time offering good observation and fields of fire during the daylight to support the initial moves 74 86 Orders were delivered at 14 30 B Company would lead the withdrawal down the ridge line carrying any wounded that still required evacuation as well as clearing the route and securing the ford near the Middlesex position C Company would wait for the artillery to neutralise the Chinese on the old B Company position before moving to establish a blocking position behind D Company A Company would then withdraw to a blocking position behind C Company in order to allow Gravener and Saunders to establish a clean break Finally D Company would withdraw through both C and A Company and set up a blocking position to delay any follow up and allow those companies to withdraw 87 ",
			"after": " After 15 00 an airstrike was called in to dislodge the surviving Chinese in front of D Company However the attack by two US Marine Corps F4U Corsairs was mistakenly directed at the Australians themselves after their positions were wrongly marked by the spotter plane Two men were killed and several badly burnt by napalm before the attack was broken off after the company second in command Captain Michael Ryan ran out under Chinese fire waving a marker panel 65 The company medical orderly Private Ronald Dunque was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his efforts assisting the wounded despite his own injuries 52 88 The Chinese quickly attempted to exploit the chaos moving against D Company s long exposed eastern flank 11 Platoon on the main ridge forward of the summit was subjected to a frontal assault however unaffected by the napalm they broke up the Chinese attack and inflicted heavy casualties on them Regardless further Chinese attempts to infiltrate the Australian positions continued into the afternoon 89 note 5 ",
