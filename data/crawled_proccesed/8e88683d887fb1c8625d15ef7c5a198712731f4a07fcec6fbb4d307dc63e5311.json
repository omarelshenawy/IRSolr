			"previous": " The Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re evaluation of NATO s purpose nature tasks and their focus on the continent of Europe This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 42 At that time European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO s military spending by 2012 this had fallen to 21 percent 43 NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Eastern European nations and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns ",
			"after": " The first post Cold War expansion of NATO came with German reunification on 3 October 1990 when the former East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance This had been agreed in the Two Plus Four Treaty earlier in the year To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east and there are diverging views on whether negotiators gave commitments regarding further NATO expansion east 44 Jack Matlock American ambassador to the Soviet Union during its final years said that the West gave a clear commitment not to expand and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the impression that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia Hungary or Poland 45 In 1996 Gorbachev wrote in his Memoirs that during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east 46 and repeated this view in an interview in 2008 47 According to Robert Zoellick a State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process this appears to be a misperception and no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made 48 ",
