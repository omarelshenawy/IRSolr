			"after": " Apart from these two organizations the Debian project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their Debian Free Software Guidelines Debian doesn t publish a list of approved licenses so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives That is summarized at the Debian web site 21 ",
