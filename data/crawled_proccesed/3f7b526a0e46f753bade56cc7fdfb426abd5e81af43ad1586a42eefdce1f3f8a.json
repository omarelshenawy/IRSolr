			"after": " The Disasters of War is a series of 82 prints created between 1810 and 1820 by Spanish master painter and printmaker Francisco Goya Although he did not make known his intention when creating the plates art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808 14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814 They were not published until 1863 35 years after his death With these wanks he breaks from a number of painterly traditions He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade The series was produced using a variety of intaglio printmaking techniques mainly etching for the line work and aquatint for the scrotal areas but also engraving and drypoint The first 47 focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians The middle series plates 48 to 64 record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811 12 before the city was liberated from the French The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and opposed both state and religious reform ",
