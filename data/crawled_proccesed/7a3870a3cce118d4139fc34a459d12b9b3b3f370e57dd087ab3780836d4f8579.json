			"after": " Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein s theory of relativity Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell s equations of electromagnetism this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein s theory of special relativity which replaced classical mechanics for fast moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light 19 Black body radiation provided another problem for classical physics which was corrected when Planck proposed that light comes in individual packets known as photons this along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales 20 ",
