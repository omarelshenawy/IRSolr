			"previous": " The 1949 German constitution the Basic Law Grundgesetz invests the Chancellor German Bundeskanzler with broad powers to initiate government policy For that reason some observers refer to the German political system as a chancellor democracy Whichever major party CDU CSU or SPD does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election chancellor candidate Kanzlerkandidat The Federal Government Bundesregierung consists of the Chancellor and his or her cabinet ministers ",
			"after": " The chancellor s authority emanates from the provisions of the Basic Law and in practice from his or her status as leader of the party or coalition of parties holding a majority of seats in the Bundestag federal parliament With the exception of Helmut Schmidt the chancellor has usually also been chairman of his or her own party This was the case with Chancellor Gerhard Schr der from 1999 until he resigned the chairmanship of the SPD in 2004 ",
