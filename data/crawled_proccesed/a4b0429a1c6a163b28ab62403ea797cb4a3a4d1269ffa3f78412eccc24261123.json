			"previous": " Gilbert built the Garrick Theatre in 1889 76 The Gilberts moved to Grim s Dyke in Harrow in 1890 which he purchased from Robert Heriot to whom the artist Frederick Goodall had sold the property in 1880 77 In 1891 Gilbert was appointed Justice of the Peace for Middlesex 78 After casting Nancy McIntosh in Utopia Limited he and Lady Gilbert developed an affection for her and she eventually gained the status of an unofficially adopted daughter moving to Grim s Dyke to live with them She continued living there even after Gilbert s death until Lady Gilbert s death in 1936 79 A statue of Charles II carved by Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber in 1681 was moved in 1875 from Soho Square to an island in the lake at Grim s Dyke where it remained when Gilbert purchased the property 80 On Lady Gilbert s direction it was restored to Soho Square in 1938 81 ",
			"after": " Although Gilbert announced a retirement from the theatre after the poor initial run of his last work with Sullivan The Grand Duke 1896 and the poor reception of his 1897 play The Fortune Hunter he produced at least three more plays over the last dozen years of his life including an unsuccessful opera Fallen Fairies 1909 with Edward German 82 Gilbert also continued to supervise the various revivals of his works by the D Oyly Carte Opera Company including its London Repertory seasons in 1906 09 83 His last play The Hooligan produced just four months before his death is a study of a young condemned thug in a prison cell Gilbert shows sympathy for his protagonist the son of a thief who brought up among thieves kills his girlfriend As in some earlier work the playwright displays his conviction that nurture rather than nature often accounted for criminal behaviour 84 The grim and powerful piece became one of Gilbert s most successful serious dramas and experts conclude that in those last months of Gilbert s life he was developing a new style a mixture of irony of social theme and of grubby realism 85 to replace the old Gilbertianism of which he had grown weary 86 In these last years Gilbert also wrote children s book versions of H M S Pinafore and The Mikado giving in some cases backstory that is not found in the librettos 87 88 89 ",
