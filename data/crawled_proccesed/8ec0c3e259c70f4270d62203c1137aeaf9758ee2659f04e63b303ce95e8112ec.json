			"after": " A surface burst generates large amounts of particulate matter composed of particles from less than 100 nm to several millimeters in diameter in addition to very fine particles that contribute to worldwide fallout The larger particles spill out of the stem and cascade down the outside of the fireball in a downdraft even as the cloud rises so fallout begins to arrive near ground zero within an hour More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local fallout Chemical properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground Less volatile elements deposit first ",
