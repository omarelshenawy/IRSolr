			"previous": " where  The equation for viscous resistance or linear drag is appropriate for objects or particles moving through a fluid at relatively slow speeds where there is no turbulence i e low Reynolds number 17 Note that purely laminar flow only exists up to Re 0 1 under this definition In this case the force of drag is approximately proportional to velocity but opposite in direction The equation for viscous resistance is 18 ",
			"after": " The resulting expression for the drag is known as Stokes drag 19  For example consider a small sphere with radius 0 5 micrometre diameter 1 0 m moving through water at a velocity of 10 m s Using 10 3 Pa s as the dynamic viscosity of water in SI units we find a drag force of 0 09 pN This is about the drag force that a bacterium experiences as it swims through water ",
