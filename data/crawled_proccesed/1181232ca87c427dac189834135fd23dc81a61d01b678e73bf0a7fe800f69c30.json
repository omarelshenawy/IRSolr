			"previous": " After Houston received word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend the Alamo from the expected attack He arrived with 30 men on January 19 83 where they found a force of 104 men with a few weapons and a few cannons but not many supplies and little gunpowder 84 Houston knew that there were not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification Bowie and the Alamo commander James C Neill decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery and they did not want to destroy the fortress On January 26 one of Bowie s men James Bonham organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo Bonham signed the resolution first with Bowie s signature second 85 ",
			"after": " Through Bowie s connections because of his marriage and his fluency in Spanish the predominantly Mexican population of San Antonio often furnished him with information about the movements of the Mexican army After learning that Santa Anna had 4 500 troops and was heading for the city 85 Bowie wrote several letters to the provisional government asking for help in defending the Alamo especially men money rifles and cannon powder 86 In another letter to Governor Smith he reiterated his view that the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping B xar out of the hands of the enemy It serves as the frontier picquet guard and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march toward the Sabine 86 The letter to Smith ended Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy 86 ",
