			"previous": " Foals are born after a gestation period of approximately 11 months Birth takes place quickly consistent with the status of a horse as a prey animal and more often at night than during the day Foals are born with an ability to quickly escape from predators normally a foal will stand up and nurse within the first hour after it is born can trot and canter within hours and most can gallop by the next day A newborn foal s legs are almost as long 90 as those of an adult horse ",
			"after": " Healthy foals grow quickly and can put on up to three pounds or over a kilo a day A sound diet improves growth and leads to a healthier adult animal although genetics also plays a part In the first weeks of life the foal gets everything it needs from the mare s milk Like a human infant it receives nourishment and antibodies from the colostrum in milk that is produced within the first few hours or days following parturition The mare needs additional water to help her produce milk for the foal and may benefit from supplementary nutrition ",
