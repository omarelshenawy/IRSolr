			"previous": " The coefficient of friction COF often symbolized by the Greek letter is a dimensionless scalar value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used for example ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one ",
			"after": " For surfaces in relative motion where is the coefficient of kinetic friction The Coulomb friction is equal to and the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its motion relative to the other surface ",
