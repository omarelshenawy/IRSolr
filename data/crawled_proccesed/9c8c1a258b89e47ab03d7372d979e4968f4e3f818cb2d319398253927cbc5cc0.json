			"previous": " The normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces together and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces In the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity where In this case the magnitude of the friction force is the product of the mass of the object the acceleration due to gravity and the coefficient of friction However the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume it depends only on the material For instance a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block However the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force and hence on the mass of the block ",
