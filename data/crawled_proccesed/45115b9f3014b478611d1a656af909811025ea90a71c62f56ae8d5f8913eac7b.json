			"after": " Much of Volubilis was excavated by the French during their rule over French Morocco between 1912 and 1956 but the excavations at the site began decades earlier From 1830 when the French conquest of Algeria began the process of extending French rule over much of northern western and central Africa archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism The French army undertook scientific explorations as early as the 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover north west Africa s pre Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites 22 The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims As the historian Gwendolyn Wright puts it the Islamic sense of history and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign which gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could fully appreciate the Moroccan past and its beauty Emile Pauty of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Marocaines criticised the Muslims for taking the view that the passage of time is nothing and charged them with let ting their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them 23 ",
