			"previous": " Despite the scare over his back complaint Miller returned from New Zealand to play in the 1946 season which turned out to be his last season in the VFL St Kilda s finished second last 214 Miller played with more aggression than during his pre war years and his high leaping marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia 215 Miller thus became one of the few players to play at the highest levels of both cricket and Australian rules football 215 ",
			"after": " Miller was discharged from the RAAF on 26 June 1946 215 and returned to his job at Vacuum Oil Miller resented the fact that many of his colleagues had avoided the hazards of war and moved steadily up the ladder and regarded his job as demeaning 216 217 Under such circumstances Miller contemplated quitting Australian cricket and accepting a professional contract with Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League valued at 1 000 per year 218 for three seasons With advertising and commercial commitments likely to triple this figure playing in England would have been approximately ten times more lucrative than continuing in Australia 216 However Miller was worried that his impulsive style would be curtailed by the pressures of professionalism At that time the Board of Control s policy stipulated that any player that signed with a professional league in England could not represent Australia 219 Miller s contract would see him in England until he was 30 effectively ending his career for Australia Furthermore it would have prevented him from playing Australian football during the winter 220 Miller weighed it up and opted to sign the contract that tied him to Rawtenstall with his duties to start with the onset of the English season in April 1947 221 ",
