			"after": " Compsognathus is known from two almost complete skeletons one from Germany that is 89 cm long 35 in and another from France that is 125 cm 49 in 16 The physician and fossil collector Joseph Oberndorfer acquired the German specimen BSP AS I 563 in 1859 discovered about the same year in the lithographic limestone deposits in the Riedenburg Kelheim region of Bavaria in the Jurassic part of a lagoonal region known as the Solnhofen archipelago 17 The limestone of this area has also yielded such well preserved fossils as Archaeopteryx with feather impressions and some pterosaurs with imprints of their wing membranes The German Compsognathus fossil itself most likely came from the Painten Formation of the Kapfelberg locality specifically dated to the uppermost Kimmeridgian stage 150 8 million years ago 8 however alternative possibilities include quarries near Jachenhausen 18 or Goldberg both from the Tithonian to which stage Compsognathus has traditionally been dated 8 Johann A Wagner discussed the specimen briefly in 1859 when he coined the name Compsognathus longipes 19 and described it in detail in 1861 20 In early 1868 Thomas Huxley compared the two species and following earlier suggestions by Karl Gegenbaur 21 and Edward Drinker Cope 22 concluded that apart from its arms and feathers the Archaeopteryx skeleton was closely similar to Compsognathus and that the proto bird was related to the dinosaurs 23 24 In 1896 Othniel Marsh recognized the fossil as a true member of the Dinosauria 25 John Ostrom thoroughly redescribed the species in 1978 making it one of the best known small theropods at that time 12 The German specimen is on display at the Bayerische Staatsammlung f r Pal ontologie und historische Geologie Bavarian State Institute for Paleontology and Historical Geology in Munich Germany which bought the fossil from Oberndorfer in 1865 17 ",
