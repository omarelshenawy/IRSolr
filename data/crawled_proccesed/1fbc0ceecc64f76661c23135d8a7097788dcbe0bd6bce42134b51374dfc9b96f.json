			"after": " The drag coefficient depends on the shape of the object and on the Reynolds number  where is some characteristic diameter or linear dimension and is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid equal to the viscosity divided by the density At low Reynolds number the drag coefficient is asymptotically proportional to the inverse of the Reynolds number which means that the drag is proportional to the speed At high Reynolds number the drag coefficient is more or less constant The graph to the right shows how the drag coefficient varies with Reynolds number for the case of a sphere ",
