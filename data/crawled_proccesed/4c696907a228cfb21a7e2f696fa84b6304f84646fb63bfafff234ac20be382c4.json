			"after": " In 1976 a clutch of seven 190 million year old Massospondylus eggs was found in Golden Gate Highlands National Park in South Africa by James Kitching who identified them as most likely belonging to Massospondylus 63 It was nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15 centimetre 6 in long embryos They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found 54 By early 2012 at least 10 egg clutches from at least four fossiliferous horizons had been found with up to 34 eggs per clutch This indicates that this nesting site may have been used repeatedly site fidelity by groups of animals colonial nesting in both cases these represent the oldest evidence of this behaviour 64 Sedimentary structures indicate that the nesting area was in the vicinity of a lake 64 The eggshells were very thin about 0 1 mm allowing gas exchange even in a low oxygen and carbon dioxide rich environment which indicates that the eggs were at least partly buried in the substrate 64 There are no hints that Massospondylus constructed nests however the arrangement of the eggs in tight rows indicates that the eggs were pushed in this position by the adults 64 ",
