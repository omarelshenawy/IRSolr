			"previous": " In the 2000s as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer 347 This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet 348 and new forms of performance such as laptronica 347 and live coding 349 These techniques also began to be used by existing bands as with industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero 2007 350 and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds including indie electronic electroclash dance punk and new rave ",
			"after": " Indie electronic which had begun in the early 1990s with bands like Stereolab and Disco Inferno took off in the new millennium as the new digital technology developed with acts including Broadcast from the UK Justice from France Lali Puna from Germany and The Postal Service and Ratatat from the US mixing a variety of indie sounds with electronic music largely produced on small independent labels 351 352 The electroclash subgenre began in New York at the end of the 1990s combining synth pop techno punk and performance art It was pioneered by I F with their track Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass 1998 353 and pursued by artists including Felix da Housecat 354 Peaches Chicks on Speed 355 and Ladytron 356 It gained international attention at the beginning of the new millennium and spread to scenes in London and Berlin but rapidly faded as a recognisable genre 357 Dance punk mixing post punk sounds with disco and funk had developed in the 1980s but it was revived among some bands of the garage rock post punk revival in the early years of the new millennium particularly among New York acts such as Liars The Rapture and Radio 4 joined by dance oriented acts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud 358 In Britain the combination of indie with dance punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands 359 including Trash Fashion 360 New Young Pony Club 361 Hadouken Late of the Pier Test Icicles 362 and Shitdisco 359 forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier rave music 359 363 ",
