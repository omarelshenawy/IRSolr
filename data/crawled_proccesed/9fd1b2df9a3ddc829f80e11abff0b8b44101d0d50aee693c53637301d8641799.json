			"previous": " After graduating from Yale Law School Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas In 1974 he ran for the House of Representatives Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt Clinton s campaign was bolstered by the anti Republican and anti incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal Hammerschmidt who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972 defeated Clinton by only a 52 percent to 48 percent margin In 1976 Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election 27 Clinton was elected 6 ",
			"after": " Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978 having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe a farmer from Texarkana He became the youngest governor in the country at 32 Due to his youthful appearance Clinton was often called the Boy Governor 28 29 30 He worked on educational reform and Arkansas s roads with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform However his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens anger over the escape of Cuban refugees from the Mariel boatlift detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980 Monroe Schwarzlose of Kingsland in Cleveland County polled 31 percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980 Some suggested Schwarzlose s unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton s defeat in the general election that year by Republican challenger Frank D White As Clinton once joked he was the youngest ex governor in the nation s history 6 ",
