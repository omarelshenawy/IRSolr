			"after": " The above equation applies only for air breathing jet engines It does not apply to rocket engines Most types of jet engine have an air intake which provides the bulk of the fluid exiting the exhaust Conventional rocket engines however do not have an intake the oxidizer and fuel both being carried within the vehicle Therefore rocket engines do not have ram drag and the gross thrust of the rocket engine nozzle is the net thrust of the engine Consequently the thrust characteristics of a rocket motor are different from that of an air breathing jet engine and thrust is independent of velocity ",
