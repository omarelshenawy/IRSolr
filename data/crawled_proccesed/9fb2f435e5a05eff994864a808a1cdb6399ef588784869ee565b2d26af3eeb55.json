			"after": " Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa reducing biodiversity The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point Because a species potential range may be very large determining this moment is difficult and is usually done retrospectively This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa where species presumed extinct abruptly reappear typically in the fossil record after a period of apparent absence New species arise through the process of speciation an aspect of evolution New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition ",
