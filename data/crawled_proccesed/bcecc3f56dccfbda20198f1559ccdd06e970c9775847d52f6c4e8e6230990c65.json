			"after": " Most of Sweden has a temperate climate despite its northern latitude with four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year The country can be divided into three types of climate the southernmost part has an oceanic climate the central part has a humid continental climate and the northernmost part has a subarctic climate However Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude and even somewhat farther south mainly because of the Gulf Stream 71 72 For example central and southern Sweden has much milder winters than many parts of Russia Canada and the northern United States 73 Because of its high latitude the length of daylight varies greatly North of the Arctic Circle the sun never sets for part of each summer and it never rises for part of each winter In the capital Stockholm daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December Sweden receives between 1 100 and 1 900 hours of sunshine annually 74 ",
