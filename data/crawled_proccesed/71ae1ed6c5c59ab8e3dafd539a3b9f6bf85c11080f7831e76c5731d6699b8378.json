			"previous": " The noble gases have weak interatomic force and consequently have very low melting and boiling points They are all monatomic gases under standard conditions including the elements with larger atomic masses than many normally solid elements 11 Helium has several unique qualities when compared with other elements its boiling and melting points are lower than those of any other known substance it is the only element known to exhibit superfluidity it is the only element that cannot be solidified by cooling under standard conditions a pressure of 25 standard atmospheres 2 500 kPa 370 psi must be applied at a temperature of 0 95 K 272 200 C 457 960 F to convert it to a solid 26 The noble gases up to xenon have multiple stable isotopes Radon has no stable isotopes its longest lived isotope 222Rn has a half life of 3 8 days and decays to form helium and polonium which ultimately decays to lead 11 Melting and boiling points generally increase going down the group ",
			"after": " The noble gas atoms like atoms in most groups increase steadily in atomic radius from one period to the next due to the increasing number of electrons The size of the atom is related to several properties For example the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity 24 Some of the heavier noble gases however have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential similar to that of the oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen 15 Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions that is they have a negative electron affinity 27 ",
