			"after": " The album features vocal appearances by Justin Timberlake Timbaland Pharrell Williams and Kanye West It features production by Madonna Timbaland Timberlake The Neptunes and Nate Danja Hills 7 Previously Madonna had worked with relatively unknown producers like William Orbit Mirwais Ahmadza and Stuart Price However for Hard Candy Madonna decided to collaborate with producers and artists who were already well known Talking to MTV Madonna explained her decision to collaborate with well known producers Because they re good and I like their shit I mean I don t like to repeat myself and I was sitting around thinking What music do I love right now And it was actually Timberlake s record FutureSex LoveSounds I was listening to it obsessively 8 Madonna had already started work on the album with Pharrell and during one of her breaks from recording her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake suggesting that it would be cool if he recorded some songs with her 8 Timberlake commented That would be awesome but I thought That ll never happen But it s a testament to Pharrell He had already laid the groundwork where she was going with it She played Candy Shop for me and a couple of other songs and I thought What a cool direction I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to and I asked Tim How do we fit in And it basically came down to how we did my record co producing and just throwing Madonna in the mix 8 The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was Devil Wouldn t Recognize You Timberlake felt that the song which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project was comparable to Frozen 1998 He wanted to turn the line The devil wouldn t recognize you but I do into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept 8 ",
