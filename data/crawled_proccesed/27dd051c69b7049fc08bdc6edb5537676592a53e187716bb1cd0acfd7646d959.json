			"previous": " Diane had carried out major works at Chenonceau such as de l Orme s bridge over the Cher River Now Catherine set out to efface or outdo her former rival s work 78 She lavished vast sums on the house and built two galleries on the extension over the bridge The architect was almost certainly Bullant The decorations show the fantasy of his late style 80 ",
			"after": " Catherine loved gardens and often conducted business in them 81 At Chenonceau she added waterfalls menageries and aviaries laid out three parks and planted mulberry trees for silkworms 63 Jacques Androuet du Cerceau made drawings of a grandiose scheme for Chenonceau A trapezoidal lower court leads to a forecourt of semicircular atria joined to two halls that flank the original house 82 These drawings may not be a reliable record of Bullant s plans Du Cerceau sometimes inserted in his book designs embodying ideas which he himself would have liked to see carried out rather than those of the actual designer of the building in question 83 ",
