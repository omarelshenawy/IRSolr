			"previous": " Australia had one of the strongest batting line ups ever in the early 1930s with Bradman Archie Jackson Stan McCabe Bill Woodfull and Bill Ponsford It was the prospect of bowling at this line up that caused England s 1932 33 captain Douglas Jardine to adopt the tactic of fast leg theory better known as Bodyline ",
			"after": " Jardine instructed his fast bowlers most notably Harold Larwood and Bill Voce to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats thus providing easy catches to a stacked leg side field Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it leg theory but it was widely disparaged by its opponents who dubbed it Bodyline from on the line of the body Although England decisively won the Ashes 4 1 Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo Australian relations and the MCC eventually changed the Laws of cricket to curtail the number of leg side fielders ",
