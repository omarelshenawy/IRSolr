			"after": " Most functional genomics applications of RNAi in animals have used C elegans 99 and Drosophila 100 as these are the common model organisms in which RNAi is most effective C elegans is particularly useful for RNAi research for two reasons firstly the effects of gene silencing are generally heritable and secondly because delivery of the dsRNA is extremely simple Through a mechanism whose details are poorly understood bacteria such as E coli that carry the desired dsRNA can be fed to the worms and will transfer their RNA payload to the worm via the intestinal tract This delivery by feeding is just as effective at inducing gene silencing as more costly and time consuming delivery methods such as soaking the worms in dsRNA solution and injecting dsRNA into the gonads 101 Although delivery is more difficult in most other organisms efforts are also underway to undertake large scale genomic screening applications in cell culture with mammalian cells 102 ",
