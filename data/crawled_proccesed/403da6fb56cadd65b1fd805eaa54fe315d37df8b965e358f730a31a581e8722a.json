			"previous": " Communication is not a tool used only by humans plants and animals but it is also used by microorganisms like bacteria The process is called quorum sensing Through quorum sensing bacteria are able to sense the density of cells and regulate gene expression accordingly This can be seen in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria This was first observed by Fuqua et al in marine microorganisms like V harveyi and V fischeri 13 ",
			"after": " The first major model for communication was introduced by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver for Bell Laboratories in 1949 14 The original model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies Their initial model consisted of three primary parts sender channel and receiver The sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into the channel was the telephone itself and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could hear the other person Shannon and Weaver also recognized that often there is static that interferes with one listening to a telephone conversation which they deemed noise ",
