			"after": " Flaps may be fully extended for landing to give the aircraft a lower stall speed so the approach to landing can be flown more slowly which also allows the aircraft to land in a shorter distance The higher lift and drag associated with fully extended flaps allows a steeper and slower approach to the landing site but imposes handling difficulties in aircraft with very low wing loading the ratio between the wing area and the weight of the aircraft Winds across the line of flight known as crosswinds cause the windward side of the aircraft to generate more lift and drag causing the aircraft to roll yaw and pitch off its intended flight path and as a result many light aircraft land with reduced flap settings in crosswinds Furthermore once the aircraft is on the ground the flaps may decrease the effectiveness of the brakes since the wing is still generating lift and preventing the entire weight of the aircraft from resting on the tires thus increasing stopping distance particularly in wet or icy conditions Usually the pilot will raise the flaps as soon as possible to prevent this from occurring 2 ",
