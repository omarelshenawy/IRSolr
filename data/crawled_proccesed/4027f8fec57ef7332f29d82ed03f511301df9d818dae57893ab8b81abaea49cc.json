			"previous": " The city lay within the kingdom of Mauretania which became a Roman client state following the fall of Carthage in 146 BC 2 The Punic influence lasted for a considerable time afterwards as the city s magistrates retained the Carthaginian title of suffete long after the end of Punic rule 4 Juba II of Numidia was placed on the Mauretanian throne by Augustus in 25 BC and turned his attention to building a royal capital at Volubilis 5 Educated in Rome and married to Cleopatra Selene II the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra Juba and his son Ptolemy were thoroughly Romanised kings although of Berber ancestry their preference for Roman art and architecture was clearly reflected in the city s design 2 ",
			"after": " After Claudius annexed Mauretania in 44 AD the city grew substantially due to its wealth and prosperity derived from the fertile lands of the province which produced valuable export commodities such as grain olive oil and wild animals for gladiatorial spectacles At its peak in the late 2nd century Volubilis had around 20 000 inhabitants a very substantial population for a Roman provincial town 6 and the surrounding region was also well inhabited to judge from over 50 villas discovered in the area 7 It was mentioned by the 1st century AD geographer Pomponius Mela who described it in his work De situ orbis libri III as one of the wealthiest cities albeit the wealthiest among small ones in Mauretania 8 It is also mentioned by Pliny the Elder and the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary refers to its location and names it as Volubilis Colonia 9 Its population was dominated by Romanised Berbers 10 ",
