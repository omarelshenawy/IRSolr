			"previous": " The Head Wall was built in 1834 when the medieval village was abandoned and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some 700 feet 200 m down the slope This came about as the result of a visit by Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland the MP for Devon Appalled by the primitive conditions he made a donation that led to the construction of a completely new settlement of 30 new blackhouses These houses were made of dry stone had thick walls and were roofed with turf Each typically had only one tiny window and a small aperture for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room As a result the interiors were blackened by soot The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground 133 Several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale in October 1860 and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as byres According to Alasdair MacGregor s analysis of the settlement the sixteen modern zinc roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new Factor s house seen in most photographs of the natives were constructed around 1862 134 ",
