			"previous": " Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest 170 It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean Though over half of Europe s original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest such as the taiga of Scandinavia and Russia mixed rainforests of the Caucasus and the Cork oak forests in the western Mediterranean During recent times deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted However in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest because these grow quicker The plantations now cover vast areas of land but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2 3 or less in European Russia 5 10 The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is Iceland 1 while the most forested country is Finland 77 171 ",
			"after": " In temperate Europe mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate The most important species in central and western Europe are beech and oak In the north the taiga is a mixed spruce pine birch forest further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached In the Mediterranean many olive trees have been planted which are very well adapted to its arid climate Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe The semi arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest A narrow east west tongue of Eurasian grassland the steppe extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north ",
