			"previous": " In build Lambeosaurus was like other hadrosaurids and could move on both two legs and all fours as shown by footprints of related animals It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping The hands had four fingers lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five fingered tetrapod hand while the second third and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support The fifth finger was free and could be used to manipulate objects Each foot had only the three central toes 4 ",
			"after": " The most distinctive feature the crest was different in the two well known species In L lambei it had a hatchet like shape when the dinosaur was full grown and was somewhat shorter and more rounded in specimens interpreted as females 2 The hatchet blade projected in front of the eyes and the handle was a solid bony rod that jutted out over the back of the skull The hatchet blade had two sections the uppermost portion was a thin bony coxcomb that grew out relatively late in life when an individual neared adulthood and the lower portion held hollow spaces that were continuations of the nasal passages 2 In L magnicristatus the handle was greatly reduced and the blade expanded 5 forming a tall exaggerated pompadour like crest This crest is damaged in the best overall specimen and only the front half remains 6 ",
