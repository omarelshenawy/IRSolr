			"previous": " After the fall of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland Australia was ill prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern aircraft and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy Additionally the Army although large contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility 91 In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia but Curtin refused to authorise this movement As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island s garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942 92 ",
			"after": " The perceived threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military By mid 1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions three armoured divisions and hundreds of other units 93 The RAAF and RAN were also greatly expanded though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths 94 Due to the increased need for manpower the restrictions which prohibited non Europeans from joining the military ceased to be enforced from late 1941 and about 3000 Indigenous Australians eventually enlisted Most of these personnel were integrated into existing formations but a small number of racially segregated units such as the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion were formed 95 Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively 96 Australia s population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 97 while only 53 of the 73 RAAF squadrons approved by the government were ever raised 98 ",
