			"after": " Electrical power stations use large steam turbines driving electric generators to produce most about 80 of the world s electricity The advent of large steam turbines made central station electricity generation practical since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky and operated at slow speeds Most central stations are fossil fuel power plants and nuclear power plants some installations use geothermal steam or use concentrated solar power CSP to create the steam Steam turbines can also be used directly to drive large centrifugal pumps such as feedwater pumps at a thermal power plant ",
