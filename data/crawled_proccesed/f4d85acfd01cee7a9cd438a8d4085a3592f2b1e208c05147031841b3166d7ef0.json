			"previous": " The language shift to English occurred much later in Cornwall than in other areas in most of Devon and beyond the Celtic language had probably died out before the Norman Conquest 6 although there are indications that in parts of Devon especially the South Hams and Tamar valley a Celtic language survived into the Middle Ages e g Tristram Risdon However the Celtic language survived much later in the westernmost areas of Cornwall where there were still speakers as late as the 18th century 7 For this reason there are important differences between the Anglo Cornish dialect and other West Country dialects ",
			"after": " Cornish was the most widely spoken language west of the River Tamar until around the mid 14th century when Middle English began to be adopted as a common language of the Cornish people 8 As late as 1542 Andrew Boorde an English traveller physician and writer wrote that in Cornwall were two languages Cornysshe and Englysshe but that there may be many men and women in Cornwall who could not understand English 9 Since the Norman language was the mother tongue of most of the English aristocracy Cornish was used as a lingua franca particularly in the far west of Cornwall 10 Many Cornish landed gentry chose mottos in the Cornish language for their coats of arms highlighting its high social status 11 The Carminow family used the motto Cala rag whethlow for example 12 However in 1549 and following the English Reformation King Edward VI of England commanded that the Book of Common Prayer an Anglican liturgical text in the English language should be introduced to all churches in his kingdom meaning that Latin and Celtic customs and services should be discontinued 8 The Prayer Book Rebellion was a militant revolt in Cornwall and parts of neighbouring Devon against the Act of Uniformity 1549 which outlawed all languages from church services apart from English 13 and is cited as a testament to the affection and loyalty the Cornish people held for the Cornish language 11 In the rebellion separate risings occurred simultaneously at Bodmin in Cornwall and Sampford Courtenay in Devon which would converge at Exeter laying siege to the region s largest Protestant city 14 However the rebellion was suppressed due largely to the aid of foreign mercenaries in a series of battles in which hundreds were killed 15 effectively ending Cornish as the common language of the Cornish people 9 The Anglicanism of the Reformation served as a vehicle for Anglicisation in Cornwall Protestantism had a lasting cultural effect upon the Cornish by way of linking Cornwall more closely with England while lessening political and linguistic ties with the Bretons of Brittany 16 ",
