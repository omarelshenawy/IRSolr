			"previous": " The western landscape mostly consists of rugged cliffs hills and mountains The central lowlands are extensively covered with glacial deposits of clay and sand as well as significant areas of bogland and several lakes The highest point is Carrauntoohil 1 038 m or 3 406 ft located in the Macgillycuddy s Reeks mountain range in the southwest The River Shannon which traverses the central lowlands is the longest river in Ireland at 386 kilometres or 240 miles in length The west coast is more rugged than the east with numerous islands peninsulas headlands and bays ",
			"after": " Before the arrival of the first settlers in Ireland about 9 000 years ago the land was largely covered by forests of oak ash elm hazel yew and other native trees 33 The growth of blanket bog and the extensive clearing of woodland to facilitate farming are believed to be the main causes of deforestation during the following centuries Today about 12 of Ireland is forested of which a significant majority is composed of mainly non native coniferous plantations for commercial use 34 Ideal soil conditions high rainfall and a mild climate give Ireland the highest growth rates for forests in Europe Hedgerows which are traditionally used to define land boundaries are an important substitute for woodland habitat providing refuge for native wild flora and a wide range of insect bird and mammal species 35 ",
