			"after": " Woolly mammoths had very long tusks which were more curved than those of modern elephants The largest known male tusk is 4 2 m 14 ft long and weighs 91 kg 201 lb but 2 4 2 7 m 7 9 8 9 ft and 45 kg 99 lb was a more typical size Female tusks were smaller and thinner averaging at 1 5 1 8 m 4 9 5 9 ft and weighing 9 kg 20 lb The sheaths of the tusks were parallel and spaced closely About a quarter of the length was inside the sockets The tusks grew spirally in opposite directions from the base and continued in a curve until the tips pointed towards each other sometimes crossing In this way most of the weight would have been close to the skull and there would be less torque than with straight tusks The tusks were usually asymmetrical and showed considerable variation with some tusks curving down instead of outwards and some being shorter due to breakage Calves developed small milk tusks a few centimetres long at six months old which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later Tusk growth continued throughout life but became slower as the animal reached adulthood The tusks grew by 2 5 15 cm 0 98 5 91 in each year Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths with small or no tusks but it is unknown whether this reflected reality or was artistic license Female Asian elephants have no tusks but there is no fossil evidence that any adult woolly mammoths lacked them 41 42 ",
