			"previous": " Archaea usually have a single circular chromosome 114 the size of which may be as great as 5 751 492 base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans 115 the largest known archaeal genome One tenth of this size is the tiny 490 885 base pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans the smallest archaeal genome known it is estimated to contain only 537 protein encoding genes 116 Smaller independent pieces of DNA called plasmids are also found in archaea Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation 117 118 ",
			"after": " Archaea can be infected by double stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated to any other form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes including bottles hooked rods or teardrops 120 These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales 121 Two groups of single stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 Pleolipoviridae infecting halophilic archaea 122 and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil shaped virus Spiraviridae infecting a hyperthermophilic optimal growth at 90 95 C host 123 Notably the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses 124 125 ",
