			"previous": " Many of Dublin s traditional industries such as food processing textile manufacturing brewing and distilling have gradually declined although Guinness has been brewed at the St James s Gate Brewery since 1759 Economic improvements in the 1990s have attracted a large number of global pharmaceutical information and communications technology companies to the city and Greater Dublin Area Companies such as Microsoft Google Amazon eBay PayPal Yahoo Facebook Twitter and Pfizer now have European headquarters and or operational bases in the city ",
			"after": " Financial services have also become important to the city since the establishment of Dublin s International Financial Services Centre in 1987 which is globally recognised as a leading location for a range of internationally traded financial services More than 500 operations are approved to trade in under the IFSC programme The centre is host to half of the world s top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies 46 Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city such as Citibank and Commerzbank The Irish Stock Exchange ISEQ Internet Neutral Exchange INEX and Irish Enterprise Exchange IEX are also located in Dublin The economic boom led to a sharp increase in construction with large redevelopment projects in the Dublin Docklands and Spencer Dock Completed projects include the Convention Centre the 3Arena and the Bord G is Energy Theatre ",
