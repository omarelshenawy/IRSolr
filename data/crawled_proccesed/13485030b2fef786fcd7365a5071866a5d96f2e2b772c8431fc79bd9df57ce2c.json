			"after": " Supersonic speed is a rate of travel of an object that exceeds the speed of sound Mach 1 For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20 C 68 F at sea level this speed is approximately 343 2 m s 1 125 ft s 768 mph 667 knots or 1 235 km h Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound Mach 5 are often referred to as hypersonic Flight during which only some parts of the air surrounding an object such as the ends of rotor blades reach supersonic speeds are called transonic This occurs typically somewhere between Mach 0 8 and Mach 1 23",
