			"previous": " Early canopies were made of numerous pieces of Flat glass held in position by a frame and muntins The muntins reduced visibility which was especially problematic for military aircraft Also glass canopies were much heavier than acrylic canopies which were first introduced shortly before World War II The acrylic bubble canopy was used on aircraft such as the Supermarine Spitfire and Westland Whirlwind which gave better all round visibility and reduced weight It is still being used today on most fighter aircraft ",
			"after": " In the 1970s US aviation artist Keith Ferris invented a false canopy to paint on the underside of military aircraft directly underneath the front of the plane the purpose of which was to confuse an enemy so they do not know in what direction the aircraft is headed This ruse was inspired by animals and fishes that have similar markings on the head and tail so they can confuse other creatures Pilots remain skeptical of this feature asserting that if the enemy is close enough to see the marking they are too close to be fooled by it citation needed ",
