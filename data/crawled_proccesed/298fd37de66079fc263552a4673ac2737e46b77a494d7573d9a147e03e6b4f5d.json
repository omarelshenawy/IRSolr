			"previous": " Basalts of the Columbia River Basalt Group from eruptions in eastern Oregon flowed across large parts of the northern half of the basin about 15 million years ago 19 They covered the Tualatin Mountains West Hills most of the Tualatin Valley and the slopes of hills further south with up to 1 000 feet 300 m of lava 21 Later depositions covered the basalt with up to 1 000 feet 300 m of silt in the Portland and Tualatin basins 22 During the Pleistocene beginning roughly 2 5 million years ago volcanic activity in the Cascades combined with a cool moist climate to produce further heavy sedimentation across the basin braided rivers created alluvial fans spreading down from the east 19 ",
