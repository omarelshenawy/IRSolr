			"previous": " The type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by Einstein was not new It had been pointed out previously by J J Thomson 9 in his series of lectures at Yale University in May 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a concentration gradient given by Fick s law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion gives us a method of determining Avogadro s Constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules or of the way in which they act upon each other 9 ",
			"after": " At first the predictions of Einstein s formula were seemingly refuted by a series of experiments by Svedberg in 1906 and 1907 which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the predicted value and by Henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than Einstein s formula predicted 13 But Einstein s predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909 The confirmation of Einstein s theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat In essence Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory s account of the second law of thermodynamics as being an essentially statistical law 14 ",
