			"previous": " The toothcomb of most lemuriforms includes six finely spaced teeth four incisors and two canine teeth that are procumbent tilt forward in the front of the mouth 4 15 The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them 15 but they are more robust and curve upward and inward more so than the incisors 13 In the permanent dentition the canines erupt after the incisors 16 The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt 15 and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side to side 17 The apical ridge following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth is V shaped in most lemuriforms tapering off from the midline 18 As a result of this dental reconfiguration the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely 15 ",
			"after": " The French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville first identified the two lateral teeth of the lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840 19 Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects 20 With modified lower canine teeth the first lower premolars following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth caniniform 4 21 and assume their function 15 These premolars are commonly confused with canines 22 Normally the true canines in the lower jaw sit in front of the upper canines and in toothcombed primates the caniniform premolars rest behind it 15 ",
