			"after": " Cooperation among a community of participants is key to the continued success of P2P systems aimed at casual human users these reach their full potential only when large numbers of nodes contribute resources But in current practice P2P networks often contain large numbers of users who utilize resources shared by other nodes but who do not share anything themselves often referred to as the freeloader problem Freeloading can have a profound impact on the network and in some cases can cause the community to collapse 45 In these types of networks users have natural disincentives to cooperate because cooperation consumes their own resources and may degrade their own performance 46 Studying the social attributes of P2P networks is challenging due to large populations of turnover asymmetry of interest and zero cost identity 46 A variety of incentive mechanisms have been implemented to encourage or even force nodes to contribute resources 47 ",
