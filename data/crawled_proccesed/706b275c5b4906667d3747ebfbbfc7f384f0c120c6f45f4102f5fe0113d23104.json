			"previous": " The pelage of the koala is thicker and longer on the back and shorter on the belly The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside 29 The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown 27 The belly fur is whitish on the rump it is dappled whitish and darker at the back 28 The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation 33 The koala s curved sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees The large forepaws have two opposable digits the first and second which are opposable to the other three that allow them to grasp small branches On the hindpaws the second and third digits are fused a typical condition for members of Diprotodontia and the attached claws which are still separate are used for grooming 34 As in humans and other primates koalas have friction ridges on their paws 35 The animal has a sturdy skeleton and a short muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that contribute to its climbing and grasping abilities Additional climbing strength is achieved with thigh muscles that attach to the shinbone lower than other animals 36 The koala has a cartilaginous pad at the end of the spine that may make it more comfortable when it perches in the fork of a tree 32 ",
			"after": " The koala has one of the smallest brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal 37 being 60 smaller than that of a typical diprotodont weighing only 19 2 grams 38 The brain s surface is fairly smooth typical for a primitive animal 39 It occupies only 61 of the cranial cavity 37 and is pressed against the inside surface by cerebrospinal fluid The function of this relatively large amount of fluid is not known although one possibility is that it acts as a shock absorber cushioning the brain if the animal falls from a tree 39 The koala s small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain 37 Because of its small brain the koala has a limited ability to perform complex unfamiliar behaviours For example when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves 40 The koala s olfactory senses are normal and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility 37 Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin Its round ears provide it with good hearing 32 and it has a well developed middle ear 14 A koala s vision is not well developed 32 and its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits 29 Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low pitched sounds see social spacing below Unlike typical mammalian vocal cords which are folds in the larynx these organs are placed in the velum soft palate and are called velar vocal cords 41 ",
