			"previous": " At its founding Intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors Its first product in 1969 was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64 bit static random access memory SRAM which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba Japan 24 25 In the same year Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024 bit read only memory ROM 26 and the first commercial metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET silicon gate SRAM chip the 256 bit 1101 18 27 28 Intel s business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products still dominated by various memory devices ",
			"after": " While Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor Intel 4004 in 1971 18 and one of the first microcomputers in 1972 27 29 by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random access memory chips However increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had by 1983 dramatically reduced the profitability of this market The growing success of the IBM personal computer based on an Intel microprocessor was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore CEO since 1975 to shift the company s focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model Moore s decision to sole source Intel s 386 chip played into the company s continuing success ",
