			"after": " Proteins are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells They often act as enzymes performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling molecular transportation and cellular regulation As structural elements some proteins act as a type of skeleton for cells and as antibodies while other proteins participate in the immune system Before a protein can take on these roles it must fold into a functional three dimensional structure a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein i e its native state Thus understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works and is considered a holy grail of computational biology 11 12 Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment it typically proceeds smoothly However due to a protein s chemical properties or other factors proteins may misfold that is fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen Unless cellular mechanisms are capable of destroying or refolding such misfolded proteins they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases 13 Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail leading scientists to use physics based computational models that when complementing experiments seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding misfolding and aggregation 14 15 ",
