			"previous": " The first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by Frenchman Maxime Guillaume 4 His engine was an axial flow turbojet Alan Arnold Griffith published An Aerodynamic Theory of Turbine Design in 1926 leading to experimental work at the RAE ",
			"after": " In 1928 RAF College Cranwell cadet 5 Frank Whittle formally submitted his ideas for a turbojet to his superiors In October 1929 he developed his ideas further 6 On 16 January 1930 in England Whittle submitted his first patent granted in 1932 7 The patent showed a two stage axial compressor feeding a single sided centrifugal compressor Practical axial compressors were made possible by ideas from A A Griffith in a seminal paper in 1926 An Aerodynamic Theory of Turbine Design Whittle would later concentrate on the simpler centrifugal compressor only for a variety of practical reasons Whittle had his first engine running in April 1937 It was liquid fuelled and included a self contained fuel pump Whittle s team experienced near panic when the engine would not stop accelerating even after the fuel was switched off It turned out that fuel had leaked into the engine and accumulated in pools so the engine would not stop until all the leaked fuel had burned off Whittle was unable to interest the government in his invention and development continued at a slow pace ",
