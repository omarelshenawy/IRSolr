			"previous": " Emperor Taizu of Song r 960 976 unified China by conquering other lands during his reign ending the upheaval of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period In Kaifeng he established a strong central government over the empire He ensured administrative stability by promoting the civil service examination system of drafting state bureaucrats by skill and merit instead of aristocratic or military position and promoted projects that ensured efficiency in communication throughout the empire In one such project cartographers created detailed maps of each province and city that were then collected in a large atlas 8 Emperor Taizu also promoted groundbreaking science and technological innovations by supporting such works as the astronomical clock tower designed and built by the engineer Zhang Sixun 9 ",
			"after": " The Song court maintained diplomatic relations with Chola India the Fatimid Caliphate Srivijaya the Kara Khanid Khanate of Central Asia and other countries that were also trade partners with Japan 10 11 12 13 However China s closest neighbouring states had the greatest impact on its domestic and foreign policy From its inception under Taizu the Song dynasty alternated between warfare and diplomacy with the ethnic Khitans of the Liao dynasty in the northeast and with the Tanguts of the Western Xia in the northwest The Song dynasty used military force in an attempt to quell the Liao dynasty and to recapture the Sixteen Prefectures a territory under Khitan control that was traditionally considered to be part of China proper 14 However Song forces were repulsed by the Liao forces who engaged in aggressive yearly campaigns into northern Song territory until 1005 when the signing of the Shanyuan Treaty ended these northern border clashes The Song were forced to provide tribute to the Khitans although paying this tribute did little damage to the overall Song economy since the Khitans were heavily dependent upon importing massive amounts of goods from the Song 15 More significantly the Song state recognized the Liao state as its diplomatic equal 16 The Song dynasty managed to win several military victories over the Tanguts in the early 11th century culminating in a campaign led by the polymath scientist general and statesman Shen Kuo 1031 1095 17 However this campaign was ultimately a failure due to a rival military officer of Shen disobeying direct orders and the territory gained from the Western Xia was eventually lost 18 There was also a significant war fought against the L dynasty of Vietnam from 1075 to 1077 over a border dispute and the Song s severing of commercial relations with the i Vi t kingdom 19 After L forces inflicted heavy damages in a raid on Guangxi the Song commander Guo Kui 1022 1088 penetrated as far as Th ng Long modern Hanoi 20 However heavy losses on both sides prompted the L commander Th ng Ki t 1019 1105 to make peace overtures allowing both sides to withdraw from the war effort captured territories held by both Song and L were mutually exchanged in 1082 along with prisoners of war 21 ",
