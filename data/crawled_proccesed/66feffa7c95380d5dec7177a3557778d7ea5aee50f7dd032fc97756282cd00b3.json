			"previous": " Martin Conway describes the portrayal of a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow 28 Conway believed the strength of the portrait is in part achieved through D rer s ability to convey this hardship while at the same time presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride and possessing a kind old face Noting the obvious affection between the father and son as well as the half smile of the older man he wonders if that grin might have been born of Albrecht the Elder s satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent who was now about to set out on the world for his wanderjahr 28 A contributing factor to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder trained his son in his own profession as a jeweller but at one point came to regret the choice of apprenticeship as the younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting However his son learned many skills during that period and it gave him a discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work especially in his ability as an engraver 29 ",
			"after": " Conway described the panel as indicating an astonishing depth of psychological insight for an artist not yet 20 years old 26 In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of and is a key precursor to D rer s mature work He portrayed his father again in 1497 when the older man would have been around 70 He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years his skin is saggier the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced In this later portrait D rer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing which are all too evident on his father s face 30 According to Brion his eyes have lost their distant mystic appearance and now seem less contented 25 Conway agrees seeing traces of haggardly agitation but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man 28 ",
