			"after": " Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic flowering species relying on post fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia it is one of the slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires taking at least two years 19 The species resprouts from a lignotuber a swollen woody base largely under the soil that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire but are later overtaken by the slower growing banksias Banksia and wattles Acacia Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests 20 Flowering may be prolific at this time 21 ",
