			"previous": " The dog conch lives on muddy sand bottoms among algae and seagrass beds on insular and continental shores It usually prefers major islands and continental coasts rather than the shores of small islands although this is not an absolute rule 1 30 L canarium prefers areas of mixed seagrasses with a predominance of Halophila and also prefers sediment with high levels of organic matter 31 This conch avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the Indo Pacific 31 32 The dog conch can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones from shallow water to a depth of 55 m 180 ft 1 It is normally found in large colonies 19 and is usually abundant wherever it occurs 33 ",
			"after": " During the 19th century strombid gastropods were believed to be carnivores This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails 34 Subsequent studies have refuted the concept proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals 34 In common with other Strombidae Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore 33 feeding on algae and occasionally detritus 1 ",
