			"previous": " In late 1944 the Australian Government committed twelve Australian Army brigades to replace six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville New Britain and the Aitape Wewak area in New Guinea While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy the remaining Japanese forces in these areas 153 The value of these campaigns was controversial at the time and remains so to this day The Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political reasons It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia s influence in its region 154 Critics of these campaigns argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective 153 ",
			"after": " The 5th Division replaced the US 40th Infantry Division on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the New Britain Campaign with the goals of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul In late November the 5th Division established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau 155 The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay at the base of the Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force s aggressive patrolling The 5th Division suffered 53 fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93 000 strong which was much higher than the 38 000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain 155 ",
