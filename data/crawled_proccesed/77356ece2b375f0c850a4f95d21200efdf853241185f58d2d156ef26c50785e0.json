			"after": " More specifically for example Nancy Folbre examines the role of children as public goods and how the non market labor of parents contributes to the development of human capital as a public service 18 In this sense children are positive externality which is under invested according to traditional analysis Folbre indicates that this oversight partially results from failing to properly examine non market activities ",
