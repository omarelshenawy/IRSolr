			"previous": " Monet Sisley Morisot and Pissarro may be considered the purest Impressionists in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity sunlight and colour Degas rejected much of this as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors 13 Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas douard Manet although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader 14 never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions He continued to submit his works to the Salon where his painting Spanish Singer had won a 2nd class medal in 1861 and he urged the others to do likewise arguing that the Salon is the real field of battle where a reputation could be made 15 ",
			"after": " Among the artists of the core group minus Bazille who had died in the Franco Prussian War in 1870 defections occurred as C zanne followed later by Renoir Sisley and Monet abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin s membership in the group championed by Pissarro and C zanne against opposition from Monet and Degas who thought him unworthy 16 Degas invited Mary Cassatt to display her work in the 1879 exhibition but also insisted on the inclusion of Jean Fran ois Raffa lli Ludovic Lepic and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of opening doors to first come daubers 17 The group divided over invitations to Paul Signac and Georges Seurat to exhibit with them in 1886 Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions ",
