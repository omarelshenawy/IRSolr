			"previous": " To accommodate additional facilities and housing the Navy needed to upgrade the island s infrastructure 94 Its sewage system was upgraded with the 2001 installation of a 6 000 foot 1 800 m 20 inch 510 mm sewage main from the island to Pearl Harbor and improvements to the sewage pumping station 95 Due to the bridge s unique design which includes a floating section it was impossible to use it to transit cable across the loch 94 In 2005 the Navy contracted drilling for primary and auxiliary conduits 20 feet 6 1 m apart and parallel to the bridge from Halawa Landing to the Ford Island golf course The contractor installed 5 045 foot 1 538 m long 24 inch 610 mm thick carbon steel high magnetic casing conduits 94 and fiber optic communications cables and 46kV power lines were fed through them 94 ",
			"after": " In June 2013 the Navy planned to install 60 000 photovoltaic panels over 28 acres 11 ha on the Ford Island runway 96 to comply with Congressional and Defense Department mandates to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and offset the cost of Hawaiian energy the highest in the United States 96 This plan deviated from a 2009 proposal using the panels to define the runway in favor of panels producing twice the power 97 The Navy offered the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor 250 000 toward renovation of the control tower s elevator in exchange for its support of the plan The museum declined 97 organizing an internet campaign opposing the plan based on the runway s historic significance and highlighting Ford Island s role in the attack on Pearl Harbor and Amelia Earhart s visit 96 In response the Navy decided to install the panels on existing structures around Pearl Harbor 96 ",
