			"previous": " Several of the larger Death Valley springs derive their water from a regional aquifer which extends as far east as southern Nevada and Utah Much of the water in this aquifer has been there for many thousands of years since the Pleistocene ice ages when the climate was cooler and wetter Today s drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn 12 ",
			"after": " The highest range within the park is the Panamint Range with Telescope Peak being its highest point at 11 049 feet 3 368 m 5 The Death Valley region is a transitional zone in the northernmost part of the Mojave Desert and consists of five mountain ranges removed from the Pacific Ocean Three of these are significant barriers the Sierra Nevada the Argus Range and the Panamint Range Air masses tend to lose moisture as they are forced up over mountain ranges in what climatologists call a rainshadow effect ",
