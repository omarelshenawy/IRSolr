			"after": " Thin airfoil theory is a simple theory of airfoils that relates angle of attack to lift for incompressible inviscid flows It was devised by German American mathematician Max Munk and further refined by British aerodynamicist Hermann Glauert and others 11 in the 1920s The theory idealizes the flow around an airfoil as two dimensional flow around a thin airfoil It can be imagined as addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite wingspan ",
