			"previous": " Although the American white ibis is predominantly monogamous and both sexes provide parental care to their young the male often flies off to engage in extra pair copulation with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner These extra pair copulations are usually done after the within pair copulations 35 and make up about 45 of all total matings although only about 15 of all extra pair copulations are successful 35 By not restricting the number of females it copulates with the male is able to increase its reproductive success considerably Although females are receptive towards extra pair copulations male mate guarding greatly reduces the rate of successful female involvement in attempted extra pair copulations by other males 33 ",
			"after": " The breeding success of the American white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility Water level reversals where levels rise in the breeding season disperse prey and impact on foraging success Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability 36 The success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70 of nests and varies greatly between nearby colonies 27 American white ibis parents have been known to supplement their chicks diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years when fish and crayfish are more scarce 37 Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted 38 This highlights the fact that American white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest site predation rates 39 The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American white ibis and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades 40 ",
