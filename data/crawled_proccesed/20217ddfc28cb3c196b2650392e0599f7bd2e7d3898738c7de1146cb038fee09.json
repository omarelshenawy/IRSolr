			"previous": " Game was regularly hunted and trapped in the forests including frogs snakes lizards hedgehogs and tenrecs tortoises wild boars insects larvae birds and lemurs 6 The first settlers encountered Madagascar s wealth of megafauna including giant lemurs elephant birds giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus Early Malagasy communities may have eaten the eggs and less commonly the meat of Aepyornis maximus the world s largest bird which remained widespread throughout Madagascar as recently as the 17th century 7 While several theories have been proposed to explain the decline and eventual extinction of Malagasy megafauna clear evidence suggests that hunting by humans and destruction of habitats through slash and burn agricultural practices were key factors 8 9 Although it has been illegal to hunt or trade any of the remaining species of lemur since 1964 these endangered animals continue to be hunted for immediate local consumption in rural areas or to supply the demand for exotic bush meat at some urban restaurants 10 ",
