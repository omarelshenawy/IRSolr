			"after": " In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began Vespasian s subsequent campaign to conquer the tribes of the Atrebates Dumnonii and Durotriges in the southwest of Britain took place in AD 43 47 58 Based on the discovery of a group of bodies in the Late Iron Age formal cemetery that had met a violent death archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler created a vivid story of the fall of Maiden Castle to Roman forces He believed a legion wreaked destruction on the site butchering men women and children before setting fire to the site and slighting its defences However there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events or even that the hill fort was attacked by the Romans Although there is a layer of charcoal it is associated with the iron works and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort Although 14 bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death there is no evidence that they died at Maiden Castle 59 The eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain Many 1st century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces This was a characteristic of Vespasian s campaign in the region there was military occupation at Cadbury Castle in Somerset Hembury in Devon and Hodd Hill in Dorset 60 ",
