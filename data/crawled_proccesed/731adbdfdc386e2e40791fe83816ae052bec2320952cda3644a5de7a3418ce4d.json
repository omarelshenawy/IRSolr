			"after": " This uses two parallel omnidirectional microphones some distance apart capturing time of arrival stereo information as well as some level amplitude difference information especially if employed in close proximity to the sound source s At a distance of about 60 cm 24 in the time delay time of arrival difference for a signal reaching the first microphone and then the other one from the side is approximately 1 5 ms 1 to 2 ms If you increase the distance between the microphones you effectively decrease the pickup angle At a 70 cm 28 in distance it is approximately equivalent to the pickup angle of the near coincident ORTF setup ",
