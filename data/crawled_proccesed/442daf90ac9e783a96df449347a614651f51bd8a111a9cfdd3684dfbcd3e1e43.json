			"previous": " Platinum has six naturally occurring isotopes 190Pt 192Pt 194Pt 195Pt 196Pt and 198Pt The most abundant of these is 195Pt comprising 33 83 of all platinum It is the only stable isotope with a non zero spin with a spin of 1 2 195Pt satellite peaks are often observed in 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy i e Pt phosphine and Pt alkyl complexes 190Pt is the least abundant at only 0 01 Of the naturally occurring isotopes only 190Pt is unstable though it decays with a half life of 6 5 1011 years causing an activity of 15 Bq kg of natural platinum 198Pt can undergo alpha decay but its decay had never been observed the half life is known to be longer than 3 2 1014 years therefore it is considered stable Platinum also has 31 synthetic isotopes ranging in atomic mass from 166 to 202 making the total number of known isotopes 37 The least stable of these is 166Pt with a half life of 300 s whereas the most stable is 193Pt with a half life of 50 years Most platinum isotopes decay by some combination of beta decay and alpha decay 188Pt 191Pt and 193Pt decay primarily by electron capture 190Pt and 198Pt have double beta decay paths 15 ",
