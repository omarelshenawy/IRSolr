			"previous": " The decision to found a national organization was likely the result of several factors First the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized Second the localists gained confidence from their involvement in the dock workers strike in Hamburg in late 1896 and early 1897 14 Third loss of membership for example the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897 convinced the localists of the need for action 15 ",
			"after": " The Representatives Centralization s relationship to the SPD was ambivalent The organization was allied with the SPD and supported the Erfurt Program 16 At the same time the party mostly opposed the founding of the Representatives Centralization and called upon its members to rejoin the centralized trade unions The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split would lead to a large loss of members The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG s organizational principles 14 ",
