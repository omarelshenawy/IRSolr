			"after": " Nowadays civil engines are usually flat rated on net thrust up to a kink point climate So at a given flight condition net thrust is held approximately constant over a very wide range of ambient temperature by increasing HP turbine rotor inlet temperature RIT or SOT However beyond the kink point SOT is held constant and net thrust starts to fall for further increases in ambient temperature 12 Consequently aircraft fuel load and or payload must be decreased ",
