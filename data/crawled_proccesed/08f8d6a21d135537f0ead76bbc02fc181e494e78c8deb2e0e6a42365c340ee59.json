			"previous": " Gilbert sometimes had a strained working relationship with Sullivan partly because each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other s and partly due to their opposing personalities Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin skinned though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness while Sullivan eschewed conflict 66 In addition Gilbert imbued his libretti with topsy turvy situations in which the social order was turned upside down After a time these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan s desire for realism and emotional content 67 In addition Gilbert s political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege while Sullivan was eager to socialise among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons 68 ",
			"after": " Throughout their collaboration Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore which were less successful than the seven other operas from H M S Pinafore to The Gondoliers Sullivan asked to leave the partnership saying that he found Gilbert s plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him While the two artists worked out their differences Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works On each occasion after a few months pause Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan s objections and the partnership continued successfully 66 ",
