			"previous": " The coenzyme NAD is also consumed in ADP ribose transfer reactions For example enzymes called ADP ribosyltransferases add the ADP ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins in a posttranslational modification called ADP ribosylation 51 ADP ribosylation involves either the addition of a single ADP ribose moiety in mono ADP ribosylation or the transferral of ADP ribose to proteins in long branched chains which is called poly ADP ribosyl ation 52 Mono ADP ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins notably cholera toxin but it is also involved in normal cell signaling 53 54 Poly ADP ribosyl ation is carried out by the poly ADP ribose polymerases 52 55 The poly ADP ribose structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance 55 In addition to these functions within the cell a group of extracellular ADP ribosyltransferases has recently been discovered but their functions remain obscure 56 NAD may also be added onto cellular RNA as a 5 terminal modification 57 ",
			"after": " Another function of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP ribose which is produced from NAD by ADP ribosyl cyclases as part of a second messenger system 58 This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores 59 It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors which are located in the membranes of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum 60 ",
