			"after": " Although the castrato or musico predates opera there is some evidence that castrati had parts in the earliest operas In the first performance of Monteverdi s Orfeo 1607 for example they played subsidiary roles including Speranza and possibly that of Euridice Although female roles were performed by castrati in some of the papal states this was increasingly rare by 1680 they had supplanted normal male voices in lead roles and retained their position as primo uomo for about a hundred years 5 an Italian opera not featuring at least one renowned castrato in a lead part would be doomed to fail Because of the popularity of Italian opera throughout 18th century Europe except France singers such as Ferri Farinelli Senesino and Pacchierotti became the first operatic superstars earning enormous fees and hysterical public adulation 6 The strictly hierarchical organisation of opera seria favoured their high voices as symbols of heroic virtue though they were frequently mocked for their strange appearance and bad acting In his 1755 Reflections upon theatrical expression in tragedy Roger Pickering wrote ",
