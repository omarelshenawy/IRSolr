			"previous": " Travis was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of the Legion of Cavalry and he became the chief recruiting officer for a new regular Texan army 18 Governor Henry Smith ordered Travis to raise a company of professional soldiers to reinforce the Texans who were then under the command of James C Neill at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio 21 Travis considered disobeying his orders writing to Smith I am willing nay anxious to go to the defense of Bexar but sir I am unwilling to risk my reputation by going off into the enemy s country with such little means so few men and with them so badly equipped 22 James Bowie arrived at the Alamo with 30 men on January 19 1836 21 On February 3 Travis arrived in San Antonio with eighteen regulars as reinforcements A compromise was reached between Bowie and Travis for command of the Alamo with Bowie in command of the volunteers and Travis in command of the regulars 20 When Bowie s health began to fail it became irrelevant and Travis then became the official commander of the Alamo garrison 21 On March 6 1836 following a thirteen day siege Santa Anna ordered the assault on the Alamo during the predawn hours Travis died fighting to the end and his remains were burned along with all the other Alamo defenders 21 ",
			"after": " On February 24 1836 during Santa Anna s siege of the Alamo Travis wrote a letter addressed To the People of Texas and All Americans in the World  He gave this letter to courier John William Smith to deliver The envelope that contained the letter was labeled VICTORY or DEATH 22 The letter while unable to bring aid to the garrison at the Alamo did much to motivate the Texian army and helped to rally support in America for the cause of Texan independence It also cemented Travis s status as a hero of the Texas Revolution ",
