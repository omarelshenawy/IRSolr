			"previous": " The Campbell Court recognized that the balance may not always be one sided as it was in Campbell itself and in Arriba Soft In the Perfect 10 case the interests were more evenly balanced for the first time in a derivative work case involving new information technology Both Google and Perfect 10 had legitimate interests at stake and support for their respective positions Thus there was a finding that Google s wide ranging use of thumbnails is highly transformative their creation and display is designed to and does display visual search results quickly and efficiently to users of Google Image Search But Google s use had some commercial aspects and was claimed to impair P10 s commercial interests Yet on balance the Ninth Circuit found that the transformativeness outweighed the other fair use factors because Google has provided a significant benefit to the public in facilitating image searches by means of thumbnail images This opinion provided a second instance of the beneficial transformative equation described in the preceding paragraph from the Arriba Soft case ",
