			"after": " Dry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems which display a stable behaviour in the absence of friction 37 These instabilities may be caused by the decrease of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding by material expansion due to heat generation during friction the thermo elastic instabilities or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials the Adams Martins instabilities The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G Adams and Jo o Arm nio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces 38 39 and were later found in periodic rough surfaces 40 In particular friction related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the song of a glass harp 41 42 phenomena which involve stick and slip modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity 43 ",
