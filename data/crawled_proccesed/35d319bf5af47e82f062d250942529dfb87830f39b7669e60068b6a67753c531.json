			"after": " Speech perception is the process by which the sounds of language are heard interpreted and understood Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language The sound of a word can vary widely according to words around it and the tempo of the speech as well as the physical characteristics accent and mood of the speaker Listeners manage to perceive words across this wide range of different conditions Another variation is that reverberation can make a large difference in sound between a word spoken from the far side of a room and the same word spoken up close Experiments have shown that people automatically compensate for this effect when hearing speech 16 48 ",
