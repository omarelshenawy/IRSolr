			"previous": " However Mao has many Chinese critics both those who live inside and outside China Opposition to Mao is subject to restriction and censorship in mainland China but is especially strong elsewhere where he is often reviled as a brutish ideologue In the West his name is generally associated with tyranny and his economic theories are widely discredited though to some political activists he remains a symbol against capitalism imperialism and western influence Even in China key pillars of his economic theory have been largely dismantled by market reformers like Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang who succeeded him as leaders of the Communist Party ",
			"after": " Though the Chinese Communist Party which Mao led to power has rejected in practice the economic fundamentals of much of Mao s ideology it retains for itself many of the powers established under Mao s reign it controls the Chinese army police courts and media and does not permit multi party elections at the national or local level except in Hong Kong Thus it is difficult to gauge the true extent of support for the Chinese Communist Party and Mao s legacy within mainland China For its part the Chinese government continues to officially regard Mao as a national hero In 2008 China opened the Mao Zedong Square to visitors in his home town of central Hunan Province to mark the 115th anniversary of his birth 224 ",
