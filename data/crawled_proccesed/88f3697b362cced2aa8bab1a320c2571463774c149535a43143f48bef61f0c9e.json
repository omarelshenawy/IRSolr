			"previous": " Western jackdaws practice active food sharing where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donor with a number of individuals regardless of sex or kinship They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food 76 The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species including chimpanzees The function of this behaviour is not fully understood though it has been found to be detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism reciprocity and harassment avoidance It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement 77 ",
