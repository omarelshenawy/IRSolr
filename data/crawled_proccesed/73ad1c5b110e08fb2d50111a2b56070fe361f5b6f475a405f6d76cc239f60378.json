			"previous": " The majority of commercially available synthetic diamonds are yellow and are produced by so called High Pressure High Temperature HPHT processes 101 The yellow color is caused by nitrogen impurities Other colors may also be reproduced such as blue green or pink which are a result of the addition of boron or from irradiation after synthesis 102 ",
			"after": " Another popular method of growing synthetic diamond is chemical vapor deposition CVD The growth occurs under low pressure below atmospheric pressure It involves feeding a mixture of gases typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves hot filament arc discharge welding torch or laser 103 This method is mostly used for coatings but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size see picture 85 ",
