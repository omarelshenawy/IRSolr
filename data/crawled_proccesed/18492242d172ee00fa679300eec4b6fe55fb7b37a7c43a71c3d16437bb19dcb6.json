			"previous": " A theory T is called model complete if every substructure of a model of T which is itself a model of T is an elementary substructure There is a useful criterion for testing whether a substructure is an elementary substructure called the Tarski Vaught test It follows from this criterion that a theory T is model complete if and only if every first order formula x1 xn over its signature is equivalent modulo T to an existential first order formula i e a formula of the following form ",
