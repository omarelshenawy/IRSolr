			"after": " Parsons testified to a closed federal court that the moral philosophy of Thelema was both anti fascist and anti communist emphasizing his belief in individualism This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the Industrial Employment Review Board which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City 136 Von K rm n put Parsons in touch with Herbert T Rosenfeld President of the Southern Californian chapter of the American Technion Society a Zionist group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel Rosenfeld offered Parsons a job with the Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them 137 In November 1950 as the Red Scare intensified Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld s offer but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society Parsons was immediately fired from Hughes the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated he insisted that his intentions were peaceful and had suffered an error of judgment in procurement of the documents Some of Parsons scientific colleagues rallied to his defense but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light In October 1951 the U S attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets Parsons was not guilty of espionage 138 139 ",
