			"previous": " The first director of STScI Riccardo Giacconi announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers 103 ",
			"after": " Proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit did not duplicate proposals made by professionals and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope Thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997 104 One such study was Transition Comets UV Search for OH The very first proposal A Hubble Space Telescope Study of Posteclipse Brightening and Albedo Changes on Io was published in Icarus 105 a journal devoted to solar system studies A second study from another group of amateurs was also published in Icarus 106 After that time however budget reductions at STScI made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable and no additional amateur programs have been carried out 104 107 ",
