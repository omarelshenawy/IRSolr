			"previous": " On 26 October 1952 the Comet suffered its first hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome s Ciampino airport failed to become airborne and ran into rough ground at the end of the runway Two passengers sustained minor injuries and the aircraft G ALYZ was a total loss On 3 March 1953 a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A registered CF CUN and named Empress of Hawaii failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi Pakistan on a delivery flight to Australia The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment killing all five crew and six passengers on board 85 86 The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash as well as the Comet s first accident to result in fatalities 81 In response Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in commercial service 81 ",
			"after": " Both early accidents were originally attributed to pilot error as over rotation had led to a loss of lift from the leading edge of the aircraft s wings It was later determined that the Comet s wing profile experienced a loss of lift at a high angle of attack and its engine inlets also suffered a lack of pressure recovery in the same conditions As a result de Havilland re profiled the wings leading edge with a pronounced droop 87 and wing fences were added to control spanwise flow 88 A fictionalised investigation into the Comet s takeoff accidents was the subject of the 1959 novel Cone of Silence by Arthur David Beaty a former BOAC captain Cone of Silence was made into a film in 1960 and Beaty also recounted the story of the Comet s takeoff accidents in a chapter of his 1984 non fiction work Strange Encounters Mysteries of the Air 89 ",
