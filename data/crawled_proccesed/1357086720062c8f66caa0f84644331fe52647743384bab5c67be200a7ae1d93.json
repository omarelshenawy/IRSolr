			"previous": " The Super Seventies were a great success roughly 70 quieter than the 60 Series and at the time of their introduction the world s quietest four engined airliner As well as being quieter and more powerful the CFM56 was roughly 20 more fuel efficient than the JT3D which reduced operating costs and extended the range citation needed ",
			"after": " By 2002 of the 1 032 707s and 720s manufactured for commercial use just 80 remained in service though many of those 707s were converted for USAF use either in service or for spare parts Of the 556 DC 8s made around 200 were still in commercial service in 2002 including about 25 50 Series 82 of the stretched 60 Series and 96 out of the 110 re engined 70 Series Most of the surviving DC 8s are now used as freighters In May 2009 97 DC 8s were in service following UPS s decision to retire their remaining fleet of 44 8 In January 2013 an estimated 36 DC 8s were in use worldwide 9 As a result of aging increasing operating costs and strict noise and emissions regulations the number of active DC 8s continues to decline ",
