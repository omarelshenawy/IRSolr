			"previous": " Rix Nicholas had met the farming family the Wrights in the early 1920s including Ned the subject of In Australia After returning to the district she married Edgar Wright on 2 June 1928 in Melbourne and the couple settled on a property called Knockalong near Delegate 102 She continued to exhibit under the name Rix Nicholas though she was also known as Rix Wright Her friend Dorothy Richmond with whom she had visited the region at the start of the decade married Edgar Wright s cousin Walter and settled in the same region 103 Then in 1930 Rix Nicholas and her husband had their only child a son whom they named Rix 103 notes 7 ",
			"after": " While Australian artists embraced modernism and addressed the city Rix Nicholas focussed on representing a pastoral ideal In France in the 1920s Rix Nicholas had entertained Roy de Maistre one of the first Australians to experiment with abstractionism and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his colour music theory 83 however when modernism confronted Australian art in the 1920s and 1930s Rix Nicholas sided against it 104 There was in any case as art historian Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed no market for post impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s 105 Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits 105 while her approach to her subject matter became more and more didactic 106 Women were frequently portrayed both as rural workers as in The Fair Musterer and in domestic or family scenes as in On The Hilltop Several images such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon Knockalong portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting Her most stereotypically feminine 107 work was The Summer House which shows two of Rix Nicholas s friends with some freshly cut flowers in a setting that unlike most of her works of the period screened out the surrounding landscape It was a picture about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed 107 Yet it has become one of her best known works its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles 108 ",
