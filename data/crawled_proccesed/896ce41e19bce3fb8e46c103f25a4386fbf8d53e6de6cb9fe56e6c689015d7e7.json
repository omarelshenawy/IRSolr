			"previous": " In engineering design is a component of the engineering process Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing Product design Industrial design and Engineering The American Heritage Dictionary defines design as To conceive or fashion in the mind invent and To formulate a plan and defines engineering as The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design manufacture and operation of efficient and economical structures machines processes and systems 34 35 Both are forms of problem solving with a defined distinction being the application of scientific and mathematical principles The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice however has raised the importance of new more human centered fields of design 36 How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered science Along with the question of what is considered science there is social science versus natural science Scientists at Xerox PARC made the distinction of design versus engineering at moving minds versus moving atoms probably in cotradiction to the origin of term engineering engineer from Latin in genio in meaning of a genius what assumes existence of a mind not of an atom ",
