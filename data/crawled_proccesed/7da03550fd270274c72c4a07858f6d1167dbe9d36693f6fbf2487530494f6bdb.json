			"previous": " The British Royal Navy was equivocal about which protection scheme to use until 1887 The large Imperieuse class begun in 1881 and finished in 1886 were built as armored cruisers but were often referred to as protected cruisers While they carried an armored belt some 10 in thick the belt only covered 140 ft of the 315 ft length of the ship and was submerged below the waterline at full load The real protection of the class came from the armored deck 4 in thick and the arrangement of coal bunkers to prevent flooding These ships were also the last armored cruisers to be designed with sails However on trials it became clear that the masts and sails did more harm than good they were removed and replaced by a single military mast with machine guns 14 ",
			"after": " The next class of small cruisers in the Royal Navy the Mersey class were protected cruisers but the Royal Navy then returned to the armored cruiser with the Orlando class begun in 1885 and completed in 1889 The navy judged the Orlandos inferior to protected cruisers and built exclusively protected cruisers immediately afterwards including some very large fast ships like the 14 000 ton Powerful class However the Orlandos were the first class of cruiser to use the triple expansion engine Because this type of reciprocating engine used the steam in three stages it was more fuel efficient than earlier compound engines It also used steam of higher pressure 60 poundforce per square inch as compared to the 25 to 30 poundforce in earlier engines With these engineering developments warships could now dispense with sails and be entirely steam driven 15 ",
