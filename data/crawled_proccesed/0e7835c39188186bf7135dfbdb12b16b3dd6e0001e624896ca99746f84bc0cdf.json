			"after": " Following the release of Like a Prayer on March 3 1989 17 it received widespread acclaim from critics and biographers 18 Taraborrelli commented that the track deserved every bit of the curiosity it generated While being devilishly danceable the song also shows Madonna s uncanny ability to inspire strong conflicting emotions during the course of a single song leaving the listener scratching his head for answers and craving for more 19 Stephen Holden from The New York Times while writing about Madonna s re invention of her image observed how Madonna s sound had changed from the simple blaring dance pop to the rich fully rounded pop of Like a Prayer 20 O Brien felt that the most remarkable aspect of Like a Prayer was Madonna s usage of liturgical words There is the surface meaning forging sexuality with pop lyrics that sound so sweet But underlying that is a rigorous mediation on prayer In shorter words Like a Prayer really takes you there she concluded 11 This view was shared by biographer Mary Cross who wrote in her biography of Madonna that the song is a mix of the sacred and the profane There in lies Madonna s triumph with Like a Prayer It still sounds catchy and danceable 21 ",
