			"previous": " The president was faced with the reawakening of labor management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years severe shortages in housing and consumer products and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation which at one point hit 6 in a single month 72 Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries Truman s response to them was generally seen as ineffective 72 A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of price controls on most items and labor sought wage increases A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800 000 workers the largest in the nation s history was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May The public was angry with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year s moratorium on labor actions Truman proposed legislation to draft striking workers into the Armed Forces and in a dramatic personal appearance before Congress was able to announce settlement of the rail strike His proposal passed the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate 73 74 For commodities where price controls remained producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased even though grain was desperately needed not only for domestic use but to stave off starvation in Europe 75 ",
			"after": " Although labor strife was muted after the settlement of the railway strike it continued through Truman s presidency The President s approval rating dropped from 82 in the polls in January 1946 to 52 by June 76 This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration s policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections when Republicans took control of Congress for the first time since 1930 The 80th Congress included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in the years to come including Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy and California Congressman Richard Nixon When Truman dropped to 32 in the polls Democratic Arkansas Senator William Fulbright suggested that Truman resign the President said that he did not care what Senator Halfbright said 77 78 ",
