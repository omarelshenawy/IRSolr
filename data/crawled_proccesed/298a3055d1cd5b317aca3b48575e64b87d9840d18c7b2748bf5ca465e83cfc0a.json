			"previous": " Survivability is an important feature of the Super Hornet design The U S Navy took a balanced approach to survivability in its design 56 This means that it does not rely on low observable technology such as stealth systems to the exclusion of other survivability factors Instead its design incorporates a combination of stealth advanced electronic warfare capabilities reduced ballistic vulnerability the use of standoff weapons and innovative tactics that cumulatively and collectively enhance the safety of the fighter and crew 57 ",
			"after": " The F A 18E F s radar cross section was reduced greatly from some aspects mainly the front and rear 6 The design of the engine inlets reduces the aircraft s frontal radar cross section The alignment of the leading edges of the engine inlets is designed to scatter radiation to the sides Fixed fanlike reflecting structures in the inlet tunnel divert radar energy away from the rotating fan blades 58 ",
