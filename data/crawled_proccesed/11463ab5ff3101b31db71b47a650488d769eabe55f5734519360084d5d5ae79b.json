			"previous": " The Fighter Teen Series F 15 F 16 F A 18 carried large external fuel tanks but to avoid negating its stealth characteristics the F 35 must fly most missions without them Unlike the F 16 and F A 18 the F 35 lacks leading edge extensions and instead uses stealth friendly chines for vortex lift in the same fashion as the SR 71 Blackbird 264 The small bumps just forward of the engine air intakes form part of the diverterless supersonic inlet DSI which is a simpler lighter means to ensure high quality airflow to the engine over a wide range of conditions These inlets also crucially improve the aircraft s very low observable characteristics by eliminating radar reflections between the diverter and the aircraft s skin 289 Additionally the bump surface reduces the engine s exposure to radar significantly reducing a strong source of radar reflection 290 because they provide an additional shielding of engine fans against radar waves The Y duct type air intake ramps also help in reducing RCS because the intakes run parallel and not directly into the engine fans ",
			"after": " The F 35 s radar absorbent materials are designed to be more durable and less maintenance intensive than those of its predecessors At optimal frequencies the F 35 compares favorably to the F 22 in stealth according to General Mike Hostage Commander of the Air Combat Command 291 292 Like other stealth fighters however the F 35 is more susceptible to detection by low frequency radars due to the Rayleigh scattering resulting from the aircraft s physical size However such radars are also conspicuous susceptible to clutter and have low precision 293 294 Because the aircraft s shape is important to the radar cross section RCS special care must be taken to match the boilerplate during production 295 Ground crews require Repair Verification Radar RVR test sets to verify the RCS after performing repairs which is not a concern for non stealth aircraft 296 297 ",
