			"after": " Montana sapphires were heavily mined during World War II for industrial abrasive and cutting purposes However because the Yogo mines were still owned by the English the United States government could not control those operations so the mines were little affected by the war even though industrial sapphires were critical to the war effort 68 The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation of Billings Montana was the next company to try to run the English Mine They made an initial offer in 1946 and reached a deal by 1949 However the purchase was not complete until 1956 because of legal issues The sale was finally completed for 65 000 cash and some stock considerations because the company s capital was exhausted similar to previous Yogo ventures The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation then changed its name to be the same as the former English firm s name New Mine Sapphire Syndicate It became informally known as the American Syndicate to distinguish it from the previous English Syndicate Production was poor and mining ceased in September 1959 71 From 1959 to 1963 the mine itself was left unattended and unsecured resulting in hobbyists picnickers and rockhounds coming from all over the US and Canada to gather loose rough sapphires The American Syndicate took action to stop this in 1963 with fences and threats of prosecution 72 The American Syndicate then tried leasing the mine to several operators One of these was Siskon Inc of Nevada which lost a significant amount of money 73 They sued and in May 1965 the Montana Supreme Court ruled in Siskon s favor 74 Siskon bought the mine at a sheriff s sale and in turn leased it to a group headed by Arnold Baron who had a background in gemcutting and jewelry Baron organized German and Thai gemcutters and had success in marketing Yogos in America the first such success in 50 years However owing to the difficulty in mining the hard rock site he did not exercise his option to buy the mine and Siskon sold it in August 1968 to Herman Yaras of Oxnard California for 585 000 73 ",
