			"previous": " Any oriented Riemannian or pseudo Riemannian manifold has a natural volume or pseudo volume form In local coordinates it can be expressed as In differential geometry a branch of mathematics a volume form on a differentiable manifold is a differential form of top degree i e whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold that is nowhere equal to zero A manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms since multiplying a volume form by a non vanishing function yields another volume form On non orientable manifolds one may instead define the weaker notion of a density Integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form ",
			"after": " In thermodynamics the volume of a system is an important extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state The specific volume an intensive property is the system s volume per unit of mass Volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature For example volume is related to the pressure and temperature of an ideal gas by the ideal gas law ",
