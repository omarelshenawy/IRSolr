			"previous": " When a maximum of P f occurs at xi then To prove this is true in general suppose P is a polynomial of degree N having the property described that is it gives rise to an error function that has N 2 extrema of alternating signs and equal magnitudes The red graph to the right shows what this error function might look like for N 4 Suppose Q x whose error function is shown in blue to the right is another N degree polynomial that is a better approximation to f than P In particular Q is closer to f than P for each value xi where an extreme of P f occurs so",
			"after": " And when a minimum of P f occurs at xi then So as can be seen in the graph P x f x Q x f x must alternate in sign for the N 2 values of xi But P x f x Q x f x reduces to P x Q x which is a polynomial of degree N This function changes sign at least N 1 times so by the Intermediate value theorem it has N 1 zeroes which is impossible for a polynomial of degree N ",
