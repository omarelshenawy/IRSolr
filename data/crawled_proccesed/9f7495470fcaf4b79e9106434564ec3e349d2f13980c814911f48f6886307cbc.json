			"previous": " Starfish and other echinoderms are sensitive to marine pollution 80 The common starfish is considered to be a bioindicator for marine ecosystems 81 A 2009 study found that P ochraceus is unlikely to be affected by ocean acidification as severely as other marine animals with calcareous skeletons In other groups structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution when the pH is lowered Researchers found that when P ochraceus were exposed to 21 C 70 F and 770 ppm carbon dioxide beyond rises expected in the next century they were relatively unaffected Their survival is likely due to the nodular nature of their skeletons which are able to compensate for a shortage of carbonate by growing more fleshy tissue 82 ",
			"after": " Echinoderms first appeared in the fossil record in the Cambrian The first known asterozoans were the Somasteroidea which exhibit characteristics of both groups Modern starfish and brittle stars probably had a common somasteroid ancestor 83 Starfish are infrequently found as fossils possibly because their hard skeletal components separate as the animal decays However although starfish fossils are uncommon there are a few places where accumulations of complete skeletal structures occur fossilized in place in Lagerst tten so called starfish beds 84 ",
