			"previous": " In later editions of the book Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle 5 the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles 6 Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account 7 organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious with monstrous births from union between species and spontaneous generation of life 8 ",
			"after": " The Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of Ren Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method After the turmoil of the English Civil War the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order in his taxonomy species were static and fixed their adaptation and complexity designed by God and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions In God s benevolent design carnivores caused mercifully swift death but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem The biological classification introduced by Carolus Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan In 1766 Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species such as horses and asses or lions tigers and leopards might be varieties descended from a common ancestor The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas but James Hutton proposed a self maintaining infinite cycle anticipating uniformitarianism 9 ",
