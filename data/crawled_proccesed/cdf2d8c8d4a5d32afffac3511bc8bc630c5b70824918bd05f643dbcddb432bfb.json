			"after": " Unlike most other Dutch municipalities Amsterdam is subdivided into eight boroughs called stadsdelen or districts a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance The boroughs are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city In 2010 the number of Amsterdam boroughs reached fifteen Fourteen of those had their own district council deelraad elected by a popular vote The fifteenth Westpoort covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents Therefore it was governed by the central municipal council Under the borough system municipal decisions are made at borough level except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities In 2010 the borough system was restructured in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs In 2014 under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act the Amsterdam boroughs lost much of their autonomous status as their district councils were abolished The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller but still directly elected district committees bestuurscommissies Under a municipal ordinance the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council ",
