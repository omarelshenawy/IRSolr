			"after": " It was natural for the young El Greco to pursue his career in Venice Crete having been a possession of the Republic of Venice since 1211 3 Though the exact year is not clear most scholars agree that El Greco went to Venice around 1567 f Knowledge of El Greco s years in Italy is limited He lived in Venice until 1570 and according to a letter written by his much older friend the greatest miniaturist of the age Giulio Clovio was a disciple of Titian who was by then in his eighties but still vigorous This may mean he worked in Titian s large studio or not Clovio characterized El Greco as a rare talent in painting 13 ",
