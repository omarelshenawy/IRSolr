			"previous": " The first step often trivial for applying the methods of model theory to a class of mathematical objects such as groups or trees in the sense of graph theory is to choose a signature and represent the objects as structures The next step is to show that the class is an elementary class i e axiomatizable in first order logic i e there is a theory T such that a structure is in the class if and only if it satisfies T E g this step fails for the trees since connectedness cannot be expressed in first order logic Axiomatizability ensures that model theory can speak about the right objects Quantifier elimination can be seen as a condition which ensures that model theory does not say too much about the objects ",
			"after": " A substructure of a structure is a subset of its domain closed under all functions in its signature which is regarded as a structure by restricting all functions and relations in to the subset An embedding of a structure into another structure is a map f A B between the domains which can be written as an isomorphism of with a substructure of Every embedding is an injective homomorphism but the converse holds only if the signature contains no relation symbols ",
