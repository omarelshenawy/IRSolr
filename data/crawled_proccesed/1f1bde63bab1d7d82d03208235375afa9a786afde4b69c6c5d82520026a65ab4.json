			"after": " Lemur taxonomy has changed significantly since the first taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 One of the greatest challenges has been the classification of the aye aye which has been a topic of debate up until very recently 12 Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866 early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye aye genus Daubentonia was a primate rodent or marsupial 52 53 54 However the placement of the aye aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently Based on its anatomy researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid a sister group to all strepsirrhines and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates 21 Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes 21 55 and in 2008 Russell Mittermeier Colin Groves and others ignored addressing higher level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families including Daubentoniidae 47 ",
