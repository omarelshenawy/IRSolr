			"previous": " It was not enough to just develop a mechanical analogy This could be applied to problems that were entirely in the mechanical domain but for mechanical filters with an electrical application it is necessary to include the transducer in the analogy as well Poincar in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of linear algebraic equations relating electrical variables voltage and current to mechanical variables force and velocity 13 These equations can be expressed as a matrix relationship in much the same way as the z parameters of a two port network in electrical theory to which this is entirely analogous ",
