			"after": " The passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially which can influence subsequent cyclone development This cooling is primarily caused by wind driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters This effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening Additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days 37 ",
