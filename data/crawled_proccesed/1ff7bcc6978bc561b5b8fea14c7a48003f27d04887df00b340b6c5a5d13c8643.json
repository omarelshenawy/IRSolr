			"previous": " The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its terms when the polynomial is expressed in its canonical form consisting of a linear combination of monomials The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of the variables that appear in it The term order has been used as a synonym of degree but nowadays refers to different but related concepts ",
			"after": " To determine the degree of a polynomial that is not in standard form for example one has to put it first in standard form by expanding the products by distributivity and combining the like terms for example and its degree is 1 although each summand has degree 2 However this is not needed when the polynomial is expressed as a product of polynomials in standard form because the degree of a product is the sum of the degrees of the factors ",
