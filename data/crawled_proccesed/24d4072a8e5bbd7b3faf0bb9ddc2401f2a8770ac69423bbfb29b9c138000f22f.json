			"previous": " A second woodcut was executed by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg around the same time as D rer s in Nuremberg Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg but it is not clear whether he had access to a letter or sketch as D rer did perhaps even D rer s sources or saw the animal himself in Portugal 30 His image is truer to life omitting D rer s more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros 30 however D rer s woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair s in popularity Only one impression example of Burgkmair s image has survived 31 whereas D rer s print survives in many impressions D rer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515 in the first state which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading 10 and many further printings followed after D rer s death in 1528 including two printings in the 1540s and a further two in the late 16th century 32 Later printings have six lines of descriptive text 10 A tone block was created around 1620 to create a chiaroscuro woodcut in two tones seen in the printing by Willem Janssen in Amsterdam 32 33 The original woodblock continued to be used even though later printings are marred by woodworm holes and a crack through the rhino s legs 34 ",
			"after": " Despite its errors the image remained very popular 5 and was taken to be an accurate representation of a rhinoceros until the late 18th century D rer may have anticipated this and deliberately chosen to create a woodcut rather than a more refined and detailed engraving as this was cheaper to produce and more copies could be printed 34 Images derived from it were included in naturalist texts including Sebastian M nster s Cosmographiae 1544 Conrad Gessner s Historiae Animalium 1551 Edward Topsell s Histoire of Foure footed Beastes 1607 and many others A rhinoceros that was clearly based on D rer s woodcut was chosen by Alessandro de Medici as his emblem in June 1536 with the motto Non vuelvo sin vencer old Spanish for I shall not return without victory 35 A sculpture of a rhinoceros based on D rer s image was placed at the base of a 70 foot 21 m high obelisk designed by Jean Goujon and erected in front of the Church of the Sepulchre in the rue Saint Denis in Paris in 1549 for the royal entry welcoming the arrival of the new King of France Henry II 36 A similar rhinoceros in relief decorates a panel in one of the bronze west doors of Pisa Cathedral The rhinoceros was depicted in numerous other paintings and sculptures and became a popular decoration for porcelain The popularity of the inaccurate D rer image remained undiminished despite an Indian rhinoceros spending eight years in Madrid from 1580 to 1588 although a few examples of a print of the Madrid rhinoceros sketched by Philippe Galle in Antwerp in 1586 and derivative works have survived and the exhibition of a live rhinoceros in London a century later from 1684 86 and of a second individual after 1739 37 ",
