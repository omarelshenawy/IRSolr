			"after": " Near the beginning of his career Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field This led to the development of his special theory of relativity He realized however that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916 he published a paper on the general theory of relativity He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light In 1917 Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole He was a great scientist Read more ",
