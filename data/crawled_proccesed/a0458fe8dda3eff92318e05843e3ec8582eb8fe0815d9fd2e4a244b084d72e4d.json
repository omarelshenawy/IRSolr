			"after": " The albatrosses are a group of large to very large birds they are the largest of the procellariiformes The bill is large strong and sharp edged the upper mandible terminating in a large hook This bill is composed of several horny plates and along the sides are the two tubes long nostrils that give the order its former name The tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill unlike the rest of the Procellariiformes where the tubes run along the top of the bill These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern aircraft The albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring The main food locating sense is eyesight although like other Procellariiformes they use their olfactory ability while foraging to locate potential food sources 13 The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed The legs are strong for Procellariiformes in fact almost uniquely amongst the order in that they and the giant petrels are able to walk well on land 14 ",
