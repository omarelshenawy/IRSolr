			"previous": " After Stanton s death her unorthodox ideas about religion and emphasis on female employment and other women s issues led many suffragists to focus on Anthony rather than Stanton as the founder of the women s suffrage movement Stanton s controversial publishing of The Woman s Bible in 1895 had alienated more religiously traditional suffragists and had cemented Anthony s place as the more readily recognized leader of the female suffrage movement 94 Anthony continued to work with NAWSA and became more familiar to many of the younger members of the movement 84 By 1923 in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention only Harriot Stanton Blatch paid tribute to the role her mother had played in instigating the women s rights movement 95 Even as late as 1977 Anthony received the most attention as the founder of the movement while Stanton was not mentioned 95 ",
			"after": " Over time however Stanton received more attention Stanton was commemorated along with Lucretia Mott and Susan B Anthony in a sculpture by Adelaide Johnson at the United States Capitol unveiled in 1921 Originally kept on display in the crypt of the US Capitol the sculpture was moved to its current location and more prominently displayed in the rotunda in 1997 96 The Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Seneca Falls was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965 Her house in Tenafly New Jersey was declared a landmark in 1975 Years later 37 Park Row the site of the original office of Stanton and Anthony s newspaper The Revolution was included in the map of Manhattan historical sites related or dedicated to important women created by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President in March 2008 97 She is commemorated together with Amelia Bloomer Sojourner Truth and Harriet Ross Tubman in the calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church on July 20 In 1999 interest in Stanton was popularly rekindled when Ken Burns and others produced the documentary Not for Ourselves Alone The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton Susan B Anthony 98 99 Once again attention was drawn to her central founding role in shaping not only the woman s suffrage movement but a broad women s rights movement in the United States that included women s suffrage women s legal reform and women s roles in society as a whole 100 ",
