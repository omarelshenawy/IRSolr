			"previous": " Shear mappings must not be confused with rotations Applying a shear map to a set of points of the plane will change all angles between them except straight angles and the length of any line segment that is not parallel to the direction of displacement Therefore it will usually distort the shape of a geometric figure for example turning squares into non square parallelograms and circles into ellipses However a shearing does preserve the area of geometric figures the alignment and relative distances of collinear points A shear mapping is the main difference between the upright and slanted or italic styles of letters ",
			"after": " The same definition is used in three dimensional geometry except that the distance is measured from a fixed plane A three dimensional shearing transformation preserves the volume of solid figures but changes areas of plane figures except those that are parallel to the displacement This transformation is used to describe laminar flow of a fluid between plates one moving in a plane above and parallel to the first ",
