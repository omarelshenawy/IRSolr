			"previous": " One of the defining events of Hong Taiji s reign was the official adoption of the name Manchu for the united Jurchen people in November 1635 The next year when he is said to be presented with the imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty after the defeat of the last Khagan of the Mongols Hong Taiji renamed his state from Great Jin to Great Qing and elevated his position from Khan to Emperor suggesting imperial ambitions beyond unifying the Manchu territories ",
			"after": " Hong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643 without a designated heir As the Jurchens had traditionally elected their leader through a council of nobles the Qing state did not have in place a clear succession system until the reign of the Kangxi Emperor The leading contenders for power at this time were Hong Taiji s oldest son Hooge and Hong Taiji half brother Dorgon A compromise candidate in the person of Hong Taiji s five year old son Fulin was installed as the Shunzhi Emperor with Dorgon as regent and de facto leader of the Manchu nation ",
