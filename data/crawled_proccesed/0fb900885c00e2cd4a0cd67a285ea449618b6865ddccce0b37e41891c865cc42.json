			"previous": " McCay was concerned with accurate timing and motion he timed his own breathing to determine the timing of Gertie s breathing and included subtle details such as the ground sagging beneath Gertie s great weight 29 McCay consulted with New York museum staff to ensure the accuracy of Gertie s movements the staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position so in a scene in which Gertie stood up McCay had a flying lizard come on screen to draw away viewers attention 32 When the drawings were finished they were photographed at Vitagraph Studios in early 1914 33 ",
			"after": " McCay pioneered the McCay Split System of keyframe animation in which major poses or positions were drawn first and the intervening frames drawn after This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film s actions 32 McCay was open about the techniques that he developed and refused to patent his system reportedly saying Any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club 34 During production of Gertie he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray 35 who sued McCay in 1914 36 after taking advantage of McCay s lapse to patent many of the techniques including the use of registration marks tracing paper and the Mutoscope action viewer and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action 37 The suit was unsuccessful and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued he received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques 38 ",
