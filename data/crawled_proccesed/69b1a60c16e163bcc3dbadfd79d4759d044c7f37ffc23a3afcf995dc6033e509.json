			"previous": " The B 1A s engine was modified slightly to produce the GE F101 102 for the B 1B with an emphasis on durability and increased efficiency 73 The core of this engine has since been re used in several other engine designs including the GE F110 which has seen use in the F 14 Tomcat F 15K SG variants and most recent versions of the General Dynamics F 16 Fighting Falcon 74 It is also the basis for the non afterburning GE F118 used in the B 2 Spirit and the U 2S 74 The F101 engine was the basis for the core of the extremely popular CFM56 civil engine which can be found on some versions of practically every small to medium sized airliner 75 The nose gear cover door has controls for the auxiliary power units APUs which allow for quick starts of the APUs upon order to scramble 76 77 ",
			"after": " The B 1 s main computer is the IBM AP 101 which is also used on the Space Shuttle orbiter and the B 52 bomber 78 The computer is programmed with the JOVIAL programming language 79 The Lancer s offensive avionics include the Westinghouse now Northrop Grumman AN APQ 164 forward looking offensive passive electronically scanned array radar set with electronic beam steering and a fixed antenna pointed downward for reduced radar observability synthetic aperture radar ground moving target indication GMTI and terrain following radar modes Doppler navigation radar altimeter and an inertial navigation suite 80 The B 1B Block D upgrade added a Global Positioning System GPS receiver beginning in 1995 81 ",
