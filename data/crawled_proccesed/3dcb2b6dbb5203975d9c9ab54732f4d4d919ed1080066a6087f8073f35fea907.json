			"previous": " At this point Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930 scoring 2 227 runs at an average of 131 55 He had played 18 innings scoring 10 centuries six of which had extended beyond 200 55 His overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour 56 with 856 or 38 5 of his tally scored in boundaries 55 Significantly he had not hit a six 55 which typified Bradman s attitude if he hit the ball along the ground then it could not be caught During this phase of his career his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a machine like approach to batting The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as heart breaking with his sort of cynical grin which rather reminds one of the Sphinx he never seems to perspire 57 ",
			"after": " Between these two seasons Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington a move that according to the rules of the day would have ended his Test career 19 A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative They devised a two year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son 19 However the contract increased Bradman s dependence on his public profile making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired 57 ",
