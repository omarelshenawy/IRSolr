			"previous": " Crosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the Jasper National Park Invitational Golf Tournament in September just when the new radio season was to start But golf was not the most important reason ",
			"after": " Though Crosby did want more time to tend to his other business and leisure activities he also sought better quality through recording including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the microphones his way the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows he preferred a hat He could also record short promotions for his latest investment the world s first frozen orange juice sold under the brand name Minute Maid This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn t tax him at a 77 rate 47 ",
