			"previous": " The flight control surfaces were controlled by a central management computer system Raising the wing flaps and ailerons on one side and lowering them on the other provided roll The V tail fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these V tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF 23 had superior high angle of attack AoA performance compared to legacy aircraft 23 Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking 24 To keep costs low despite the novel design a number of commercial off the shelf components were used including an F 15 nose wheel F A 18 main landing gear parts and the forward cockpit components of the F 15E Strike Eagle 11 16 ",
