			"previous": " Killer whales are apex predators meaning that they themselves have no natural predators They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea because they hunt in groups like wolf packs 109 Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish cephalopods mammals sea birds and sea turtles 110 However different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species 111 Those that feed on mammals may not even recognize fish as food This specialization in diet and hunting combined with small differences in markings suggest that they might be different species rather than populations Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations 59 ",
			"after": " Fish eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish Some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish s autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast Salmon account for 96 of northeast Pacific residents diet About 65 of them are large fatty Chinook 112 Chum salmon are also eaten but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item 113 Depletion of specific prey species in an area is therefore cause for concern for local populations despite the high diversity of prey On average a killer whale eats 227 kilograms 500 lb each day 114 While salmon are usually hunted by an individual or a small group of individuals herring are often caught using carousel feeding the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides They then slap the ball with their tail flukes either stunning or killing up to 10 15 fish at a time The herring are then eaten one at a time Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian killer whale population and with some oceanic dolphin species 115 ",
