			"previous": " The album That s the Way It Is produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings marked a stylistic shift As music historian John Robertson notes The authority of Presley s singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle of the road sound With country put on the back burner and soul and R B left in Memphis what was left was very classy very clean white pop perfect for the Las Vegas crowd but a definite retrograde step for Elvis 217 After the end of his International engagement on September 7 Presley embarked on a week long concert tour largely of the South his first since 1958 Another week long tour of the West Coast followed in November 218 ",
			"after": " On December 21 1970 Presley engineered a meeting with President Richard Nixon at the White House where he expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the hippies the growing drug culture and the counterculture in general 219 He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts Nixon who apparently found the encounter awkward expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was therefore important he retain his credibility Presley told Nixon that the Beatles whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era 220 exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti Americanism and drug abuse in popular culture 221 Presley and his friends had had a four hour get together with the Beatles five years earlier On hearing reports of the meeting Paul McCartney later said that he felt a bit betrayed The great joke was that we were taking illegal drugs and look what happened to him a reference to Presley s death hastened by prescription drug abuse 222 ",
