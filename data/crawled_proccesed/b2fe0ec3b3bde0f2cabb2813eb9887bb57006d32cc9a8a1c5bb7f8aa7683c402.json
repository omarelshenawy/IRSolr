			"previous": " Changes also took place among laymen as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces I Family ties within the elites were important as were the virtues of loyalty courage and honour These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation 66 Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul In Anglo Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative 67 ",
			"after": " Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes 68 Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy 69 Land settlement also varied greatly Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems 70 Unlike in the late Roman period there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat and it was possible for a free peasant s family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord 71 ",
