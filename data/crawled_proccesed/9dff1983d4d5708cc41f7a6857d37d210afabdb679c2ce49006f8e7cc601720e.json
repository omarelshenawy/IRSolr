			"previous": " Early discoveries of indricotheres were made through various colonial links to Asia 2 The first known indricothere fossils were collected from Balochistan in modern day Pakistan in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time 5 The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were discovered by the British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907 1908 His material consisted of an upper jaw lower teeth and the back of a jaw The fossils were collected in the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti where Pilgrim had previously been exploring In 1908 he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium A bugtiense Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros many of which have since been moved to other genera 1 6 Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species 7 ",
			"after": " In 1910 more partial fossils were discovered in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist Clive Forster Cooper Based on these remains Foster Cooper moved A bugtiense to the new genus Paraceratherium meaning near the hornless beast in reference to Aceratherium 1 8 His rationale for this reclassification was the species distinctly down turned lower tusks 7 In 1913 Forster Cooper named a new genus and species Thaumastotherium wonderful beast osborni based on larger fossils from the same excavations but he renamed the genus Baluchitherium later that year because the former name was preoccupied as it had already been used for a hemipteran insect 9 10 The fossils of Baluchitherium were so fragmentary that Foster Cooper was only able to identify it as a kind of odd toed ungulate but he mentioned the possibility of confusion with Paraceratherium 11 The American palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn which B osborni was named after suggested it may had been a titanothere 2 ",
