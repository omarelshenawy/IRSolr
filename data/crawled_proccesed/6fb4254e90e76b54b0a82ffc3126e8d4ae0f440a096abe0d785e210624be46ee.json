			"previous": " Bush undertook a number of educational priorities such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006 the first such cut in 36 years due to rising inflation 143 ",
			"after": " One of the administration s early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance provide options to parents with students in low performing schools and target more federal funding to low income schools This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts 144 It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002 145 Many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the U S have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed No Child Left Behind into law 146 Critics argue that it is underfunded 147 and that NCLBA s focus on high stakes testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive 148 ",
