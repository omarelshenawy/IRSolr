			"previous": " Water runoff often collects over watersheds flowing into rivers A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological transport model Some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce Through erosion runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers A flood occurs when an area of land usually low lying is covered with water It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation ",
			"after": " Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time for example in lakes At high altitude during winter and in the far north and south snow collects in ice caps snow pack and glaciers Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells This water storage is important since clean fresh water is essential to human and other land based life In many parts of the world it is in short supply ",
