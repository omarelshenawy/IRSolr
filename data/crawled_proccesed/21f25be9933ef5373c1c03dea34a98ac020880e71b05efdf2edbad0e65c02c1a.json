			"after": " Gothic art was a style of Medieval art that developed in Northern France out of Romanesque art in the 12th century AD led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture It spread to all of Western Europe never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy In the late 14th century the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed which continued to evolve until the late 15th century In many areas especially Germany Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century before being subsumed into Renaissance art Primary media in the Gothic period included sculpture panel painting stained glass fresco and illuminated manuscripts The easily recognizable shifts in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic and Gothic to Renaissance styles are typically used to define the periods in art in all media although in many ways figurative art developed at a different pace ",
