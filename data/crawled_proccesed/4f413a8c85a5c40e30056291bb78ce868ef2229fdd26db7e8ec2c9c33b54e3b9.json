			"after": " The field in which the hoard was discovered was shown by the 1994 excavation to probably have been cleared by the early Bronze Age when it began to be used for agriculture and settlement Some settlement activity occurred near the hoard findspot by the first half of the first millennium BC 22 but there is no evidence of Roman buildings in the immediate vicinity The field where the hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during the early phase of the Roman period but the apparent absence of fourth century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time 22 ",
