			"previous": " With the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends Similarly in addition to military and civil engineering the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering ",
			"after": " The early stages of electrical engineering included the experiments of Alessandro Volta in the 1800s the experiments of Michael Faraday Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric motor in 1872 The work of James Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of electronics The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty 3 ",
