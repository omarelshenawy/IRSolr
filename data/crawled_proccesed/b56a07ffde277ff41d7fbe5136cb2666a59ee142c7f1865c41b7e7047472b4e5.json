			"after": " Paul Kane was an Irish Canadian painter famous for his paintings of First Nations peoples in the Canadian West and other Native Americans in the Oregon Country Largely self educated Kane grew up in Toronto then known as York and trained himself by copying European masters on a study trip through Europe He undertook two voyages through the wild Canadian northwest in 1845 and from 1846 to 1848 The first trip took him from Toronto to Sault Ste Marie and back Having secured the support of the Hudson s Bay Company he set out on a second much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver and Fort Victoria in the Oregon Country and back again On both trips Kane sketched and painted Native Americans and documented their life Upon his return to Toronto he produced from these sketches more than one hundred oil paintings Kane s work particularly his field sketches are still a valuable resource for ethnologists The oil paintings he did in his studio are considered a part of the Canadian heritage although he often embellished these considerably departing from the accuracy of his field sketches in favour of more dramatic scenes ",
