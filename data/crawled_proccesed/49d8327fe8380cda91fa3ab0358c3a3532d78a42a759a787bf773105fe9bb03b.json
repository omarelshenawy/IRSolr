			"previous": " The music of Chad includes a number of unusual instruments such as the kinde a type of bow harp the kakaki a long tin horn and the hu hu a stringed instrument that uses calabashes as loudspeakers Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups the Sara prefer whistles balafones harps and kodjo drums and the Kanembu combine the sounds of drums with those of flute like instruments 106 ",
			"after": " The music group Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and initiated Chad s modern music scene Later more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai a traditional style of music from southern Chad The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music However in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry 106 107 ",
