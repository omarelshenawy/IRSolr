			"previous": " Initial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530 km 330 mi of wiring in each aircraft Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring 98 000 wires and 40 000 connectors its concurrent design and production the high degree of customisation for each airline and failures of configuration management and change control 54 55 The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4 while British and French sites migrated to version 5 56 This caused overall configuration management problems at least in part because wiring harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non standard dimensions and bend radii these were not easily transferred between versions of the software 57 ",
			"after": " Airbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months 56 This reduced the total number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90 100 On 13 June 2006 Airbus announced a second delay with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months 58 Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006 deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70 80 aircraft The announcement caused a 26 drop in the share price of Airbus parent EADS 59 and led to the departure of EADS CEO No l Forgeard Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert and A380 programme manager Charles Champion 56 60 On 3 October 2006 upon completion of a review of the A380 program Airbus CEO Christian Streiff announced a third delay 56 pushing the first delivery to October 2007 to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008 25 in 2009 and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010 61 The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to 4 8 billion 56 62 ",
