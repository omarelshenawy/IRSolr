			"after": " Like all cats the jaguar is an obligate carnivore feeding only on meat It is an opportunistic hunter and its diet encompasses at least 87 species 34 The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America with a preference for large prey The jaguar is more of a dietary generalist than its Old World cousins the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors 51 They regularly take adult caimans 52 deer capybaras tapirs peccaries dogs zorros and sometimes even anacondas 20 However the cat will eat any small species that can be caught including frogs mice birds mainly ground based species such as cracids fish sloths monkeys and turtles a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize for example revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas 46 Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock including adult cattle and horses 53 ",
