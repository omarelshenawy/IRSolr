			"previous": " In all the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly both through the revival of ideas from antiquity and through novel approaches to thought Some scholars such as Rodney Stark 20 play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city states in the High Middle Ages which married responsive government Christianity and the birth of capitalism This analysis argues that whereas the great European states France and Spain were absolutist monarchies and others were under direct Church control the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution which preceded and financed the Renaissance ",
			"after": " Many argue that the ideas that characterized the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th century Florence in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri 1265 1321 and Francesco Petrarca 1304 1374 as well as the paintings of Giotto di Bondone 1267 1337 21 Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely one proposed starting point is 1401 when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral Ghiberti won 22 Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi Ghiberti Donatello and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy and why it began when it did Accordingly several theories have been put forward to explain its origins ",
