			"after": " Symmetric key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message though a message or group of messages may have a different key than others A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely Each distinct pair of communicating parties must ideally share a different key and perhaps each ciphertext exchanged as well The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret The difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two communicating parties when a secure channel does not already exist between them also presents a chicken and egg problem which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world ",
