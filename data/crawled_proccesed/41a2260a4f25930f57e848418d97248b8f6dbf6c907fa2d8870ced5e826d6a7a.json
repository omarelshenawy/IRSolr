			"after": " To illustrate the significance of these formulae the annihilation of a particle with its antiparticle in free space must result in the creation of at least two photons for the following reason In the center of momentum frame the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum whereas a single photon always has momentum since it is determined as we have seen only by the photon s frequency or wavelength which cannot be zero Hence conservation of momentum or equivalently translational invariance requires that at least two photons are created with zero net momentum However it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or field for annihilation to produce one photon as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron it is possible for only one photon to be emitted as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational symmetry 19 64 65 The energy of the two photons or equivalently their frequency may be determined from conservation of four momentum Seen another way the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle The reverse process pair production is the dominant mechanism by which high energy photons such as gamma rays lose energy while passing through matter 20 That process is the reverse of annihilation to one photon allowed in the electric field of an atomic nucleus ",
