			"previous": " The major risks to the jaguar include deforestation across its habitat increasing competition for food with human beings 1 poaching hurricanes in northern parts of its range and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock When adapted to the prey the jaguar has been shown to take cattle as a large portion of its diet while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America as the animals took advantage of the new prey base This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full time jaguar hunters and the cat is often shot on sight 32 ",
