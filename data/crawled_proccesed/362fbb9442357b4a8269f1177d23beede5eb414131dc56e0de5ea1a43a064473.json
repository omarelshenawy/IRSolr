			"after": " Sweden has a rich musical tradition ranging from mediaeval folk ballads to hip hop music The music of the pre Christian Norse has been lost to history although historical re creations have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites The instruments used were the lur a sort of trumpet simple string instruments wooden flutes and drums It is possible that the Viking musical legacy lives on in some of the old Swedish folk music Sweden has a significant folk music scene both in the traditional style as well as more modern interpretations which often mix in elements of rock and jazz V sen is more of a traditionalist group using a unique traditional Swedish instrument called the nyckelharpa while Garmarna Nordman and Hedningarna have more modern elements There is also Sami music called the joik which is actually a type of chant which is part of the traditional Saami animistic spirituality but has gained recognition in the international world of folk music Sweden s most classic and notable composers includes Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald ",
