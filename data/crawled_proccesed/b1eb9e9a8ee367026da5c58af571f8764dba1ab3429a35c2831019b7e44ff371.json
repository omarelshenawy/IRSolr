			"after": " It is difficult to relate wetlands maps to rainfall amounts recorded at different points such as airports television stations and schools A GIS however can be used to depict two and three dimensional characteristics of the Earth s surface subsurface and atmosphere from information points For example a GIS can quickly generate a map with isopleth or contour lines that indicate differing amounts of rainfall Such a map can be thought of as a rainfall contour map Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements A two dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a GIS covering the same area This GIS derived map can then provide additional information such as the viability of water power potential as a renewable energy source Similarly GIS can be used compare other renewable energy resources to find the best geographic potential for a region 27 ",
