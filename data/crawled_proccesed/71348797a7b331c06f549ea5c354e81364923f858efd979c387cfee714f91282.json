			"previous": " Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form or political form natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar their family friends support network and culture They also need to liquidate their assets often at a large loss citation needed and they incur the expense of moving When they arrive in a new country this is often with many uncertainties including finding work where to live new laws new cultural norms language or accent issues possible racism and other exclusionary behavior towards them and their family These barriers act to limit international migration scenarios where populations move en masse to other continents creating huge population surges and their associated strain on infrastructure and services ignore these inherent limits on migration citation needed ",
			"after": " The politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other issues such as national security and terrorism especially in western Europe with the presence of Islam as a new major religion Those with security concerns cite the 2005 French riots and point to the Jyllands Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy as examples of the value conflicts arising from immigration of Muslims in Western Europe Because of all these associations immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations citation needed ",
