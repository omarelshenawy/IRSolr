			"after": " Enzyme assays are laboratory procedures that measure the rate of enzyme reactions Because enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the rate of reaction There are many methods of measurement Spectrophotometric assays observe change in the absorbance of light between products and reactants radiometric assays involve the incorporation or release of radioactivity to measure the amount of product made over time Spectrophotometric assays are most convenient since they allow the rate of the reaction to be measured continuously Although radiometric assays require the removal and counting of samples i e they are discontinuous assays they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of enzyme activity 2 An analogous approach is to use mass spectrometry to monitor the incorporation or release of stable isotopes as substrate is converted into product ",
