			"after": " Wildfires are a natural part of most terrestrial ecosystems In many ways nature has adapted to fire and the absence of fire can often be disadvantageous 39 Wildfire eliminates dead and decayed plant and tree matter enriching the soil and ensuring that healthier trees have less competition for limited nutrients Prescribed fire is currently part of the fire management plan and helps to eliminate exotic species of plants and allows a more fertile and natural ecosystem Fire is also used to protect prairie grasslands and to keep out forest encroachment ensuring sufficient rangeland for elk and deer The oak forest regions also benefit from controlled burns as Douglas fir would otherwise eventually take over and decrease biodiversity The use of fire in old growth redwood zones reduces dead and decaying material and lessens the mortality of larger redwoods by eliminating competing vegetation In the park a fire management plan monitors all fires weather patterns and the fuel load dead and decaying plant material This fuel load is removed from areas near structures and where fire poses high risk to the public and controlled burns are used elsewhere 40 The National Interagency Fire Center provides additional firefighters and equipment in the event of a large fire ",
