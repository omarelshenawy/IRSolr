			"previous": " Government policies to develop war related industries were successful in increasing the sophistication of Australia s industrial sector and self sufficiency in most categories of weapons In the decades leading up to the war successive Australian governments had provided subsidies tariffs and other incentives encourage the development of military related manufacturing sectors such as the production of aircraft automobiles electronics and chemicals 204 These secondary industries were integrated into a war economy during 1940 and 1941 and were able to meet most of the Army s needs by 1942 205 Government led efforts to develop and manufacture advanced technology enjoyed some notable successes including the development of lightweight radar sets optical devices for artillery and equipment adapted for use in the tropics 206 Australian industry also developed new weapons which were mass produced for the military including the Owen submachine gun and a shortened version of the Ordnance QF 25 pounder 207 In addition Australian scientists and pharmaceutical companies made important advances in the treatment of tropical diseases 208 Not all development projects were successful though efforts to develop an Australian tank the Sentinel did not cease until after it had been rendered obsolete and unnecessary 209 and the development of Australian designed advanced bomber and fighter aircraft the CAC Woomera and CAC CA 15 respectively were abandoned as the engines these aircraft required were not available and adequate US and British designs were produced under licence instead 210 ",
			"after": " The massive expansion of the military led to a critical shortage of male workers and increased female participation in the labour force The number of Australian women in paid employment increased from 644 000 in 1939 to 855 000 in 1944 While this was only a 5 percentage point increase in the proportion of all Australian women who were working large numbers of women moved from traditionally female roles such as domestic servants into male roles in industry Female branches of the armed forces were established in 1941 and by 1944 almost 50 000 women were serving in the Women s Royal Australian Naval Service Australian Women s Army Service and Women s Auxiliary Australian Air Force Thousands more served with the civilian Australian Women s Land Army or undertook voluntary war work Manpower shortages became an increasingly significant economic issue towards the end of the war and the Australian military was reduced in size from 1944 to free up personnel for war industries and the civilian economy 211 ",
