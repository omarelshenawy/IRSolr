			"previous": " The powers of the Senate concerning nominations are however subject to some constraints For instance the Constitution provides that the president may make an appointment during a congressional recess without the Senate s advice and consent The recess appointment remains valid only temporarily the office becomes vacant again at the end of the next congressional session Nevertheless presidents have frequently used recess appointments to circumvent the possibility that the Senate may reject the nominee Furthermore as the Supreme Court held in Myers v United States although the Senate s advice and consent is required for the appointment of certain executive branch officials it is not necessary for their removal 55 ",
			"after": " The Senate also has a role in ratifying treaties The Constitution provides that the president may only make Treaties provided two thirds of the Senators present concur However not all international agreements are considered treaties under US domestic law even if they are considered treaties under international law Congress has passed laws authorizing the president to conclude executive agreements without action by the Senate Similarly the president may make congressional executive agreements with the approval of a simple majority in each House of Congress rather than a two thirds majority in the Senate Neither executive agreements nor congressional executive agreements are mentioned in the Constitution leading some scholars such as Laurence Tribe and John Yoo 56 to suggest that they unconstitutionally circumvent the treaty ratification process However courts have upheld the validity of such agreements 57 ",
