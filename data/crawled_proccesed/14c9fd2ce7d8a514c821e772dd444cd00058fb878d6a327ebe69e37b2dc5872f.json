			"after": " Ponsford improved rapidly and by 1913 he was included in the Victorian schoolboys side for a tournament in Adelaide He was again selected in the following year now as a catcher representing his state at the first national schoolboys championship in Sydney 103 The tournament coincided with a visit to Australia by two professional major league teams from the United States the Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants The manager of the Giants John Mugsy McGraw watched part of the tournament the Ponsford family claim that McGraw was so impressed with Ponsford s skills that he later spoke to Ponsford s parents about the possibility of Bill playing in the United States 103 ",
