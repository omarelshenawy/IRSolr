			"previous": " As Boeing worked with its suppliers towards production the design proceeded through a series of test goals On August 23 2007 a crash test involving a vertical drop of a partial composite fuselage section from about 15 ft 4 6 m onto a 1 in 25 mm thick steel plate occurred in Mesa Arizona 74 75 the results matched predictions allowing modeling of various crash scenarios using computational analysis instead of further physical tests 76 77 While critics had expressed concerns that a composite fuselage could shatter and burn with toxic fumes during crash landings test data indicated no greater toxicity than conventional metal airframes 78 79 The crash test was the third in a series of demonstrations conducted to match FAA requirements including additional certification criteria due to the wide scale use of composite materials 75 The 787 meets the FAA s requirement that passengers have at least as good a chance of surviving a crash landing as they would with current metal airliners 80 ",
			"after": " On August 7 2007 on time certification of the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 engine by European and US regulators was received 81 The alternative GE GEnx 1B engine achieved certification on March 31 2008 82 On June 20 2008 the first aircraft was powered up for testing the electrical supply and distribution systems 83 A non flightworthy static test airframe was built on September 27 2008 the fuselage was successfully tested at 14 9 psi 102 7 kPa differential which is 150 percent of the maximum pressure expected in commercial service 84 In December 2008 the 787 s maintenance program was passed by the FAA 85 ",
