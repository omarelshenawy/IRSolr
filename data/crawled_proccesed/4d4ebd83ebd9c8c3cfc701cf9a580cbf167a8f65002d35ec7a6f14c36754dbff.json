			"previous": " In fact this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red portion of the excess area shown in the diagram So  There is another way to estimate the area of this same sliver As shown in the accompanying figure h is multiplied by f x to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this sliver So ",
			"after": " Rearranging terms  As h approaches 0 in the limit the last fraction can be shown to go to zero 5 This is true because the area of the red portion of excess region is less than or equal to the area of the tiny black bordered rectangle the area of that tiny rectangle divided by h is simply the height of the tiny rectangle which can be seen to go to zero as h goes to zero ",
