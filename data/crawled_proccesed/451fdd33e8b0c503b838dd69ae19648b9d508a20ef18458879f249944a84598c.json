			"previous": " The relocation of the livestock market had done little to resolve the problems of congestion in and around the market 39 Many of the mediaeval access routes to the market were too narrow for wheeled transport and the narrow alleys were also dark dangerous and mostly unpaved 40 Although the market had been resurfaced during the 18th century this had been with flint pebble cobblestones which were easily dislodged and trapped refuse 41 William Chase editor of the first Norwich Directory lobbied in the late 18th century for civic improvements and a rationalisation of the streets around the market However the economy of Norwich depended heavily on the textile industry which had suffered badly from the loss of export markets during the French Wars and funds for improvements were limited By the beginning of the 19th century the only significant improvement had been the paving of Gentleman s Walk 40 In 1805 a number of Improvement Commissions were established to propose solutions to the problems facing the area but little action was taken Local councils had no powers to levy rates to fund general civic improvements and as a consequence funds for improvement works had to be raised either through tolls and rents via public appeals or through long term borrowing and the city was initially unable to raise sufficient funds 39 ",
			"after": " In 1813 the yard of the King s Head coaching inn was widened to create Davey Place 35 a new street between the market and Back of the Inns at that time a narrow passageway which ran parallel to Gentleman s Walk behind the coaching inns 42 Although the inns no longer remain Back of the Inns survives as a street name 43 In 1820 the Gasolier Norwich s first gas lamp was installed in the market outside the entrance to Davey Place 39 Exchange Street a new road running north from the northeast corner of the market was completed in 1828 and a roadway was installed alongside the existing footpath 42 44 London Street the main road connecting the market with the older areas of the city around Tombland and the Cathedral was widened in 1856 42 In 1860 the decrepit fish market adjacent to the Guildhall by now over 700 years old was replaced with a new neoclassical building 45 In 1863 Gentleman s Walk was paved properly with York stone and in 1874 the cobbles of the marketplace were replaced by timber blocks 39 Although by this time the market operated on all working days Sunday trading laws meant it was closed on Sundays The market space on Sundays was used for public assemblies and gatherings 46 ",
