			"previous": " Traced back to the Christianization of Kievan Rus in the 10th century Russian Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in the country smaller Christian denominations such as Catholics Armenian Gregorians and various Protestant churches also exist The Russian Orthodox Church was the country s state religion prior to the Revolution and remains the largest religious body in the country An estimated 95 of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the Russian Orthodox Church while there are a number of smaller Orthodox Churches 261 However the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis Easter is the most popular religious holiday in Russia celebrated by a large segment of the Russian population including large numbers of those who are non religious More than three quarters of the Russian population celebrate Easter by making traditional Easter cakes coloured eggs and paskha 262 ",
