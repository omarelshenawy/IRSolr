			"previous": " The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes Saint Boniface declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un Christian The emperor Charlemagne decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the death penalty In 820 the Bishop of Lyon and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather fly in the night and change their shape This denial was accepted into Canon law until it was reversed in later centuries as the witch hunt gained force Other rulers such as King Coloman of Hungary declared that witch hunts should cease because witches more specifically strigas do not exist ",
			"after": " The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death This idea is commonplace in pre Christian religions According to the scholar Max Dashu the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity These can be found in Bacchanalias especially in the time when they were led by priestess Paculla Annia 188BC 186BC ",
