			"previous": " In NOR flash each cell has one end connected directly to ground and the other end connected directly to a bit line This arrangement is called NOR flash because it acts like a NOR gate when one of the word lines connected to the cell s CG is brought high the corresponding storage transistor acts to pull the output bit line low NOR flash continues to be the technology of choice for embedded applications requiring a discrete non volatile memory device The low read latencies characteristic of NOR devices allow for both direct code execution and data storage in a single memory product 20 ",
			"after": " A single level NOR flash cell in its default state is logically equivalent to a binary 1 value because current will flow through the channel under application of an appropriate voltage to the control gate so that the bitline voltage is pulled down A NOR flash cell can be programmed or set to a binary 0 value by the following procedure ",
