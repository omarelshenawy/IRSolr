			"previous": " From the 13th century on however the Duchy of Brabant extended its power As a consequence at first the western i e spoken until Genk and then also the eastern variants of Limburgish underwent great influence of Brabantian 4 When Standard Dutch was formed out of elements of different Low Franconian dialects in the 16th century the Limburgish dialects spoken in the Low Countries had little or no influence on this process As a result Limburgish although being essentially a variety of Low Franconian still has a considerable distance from Standard Dutch with regards to phonology morphology and lexicon today 5 Moreover being of East Low Franconian origin it also has many distinctive features in comparison with the West Low Franconian varieties such as Hollandic Brabantian and South Guelderish ",
			"after": " In German sources the dialects linguistically counting as Limburgish spoken to the east of the river Rhine are called Bergish named after the former Duchy of Berg West of the river Rhine the former Duchy of J lich they are called Low Rhenish which is considered a transitional zone between Low Franconian and Ripuarian Thus formerly German linguists tended to call these dialects Low German ",
