			"previous": " The Andean condor is the only accepted living species of its genus Vultur 13 Unlike the California condor Gymnogyps californianus which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of congeners the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is scant Presumed Plio Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department Bolivia may have been a smaller palaeosubspecies V gryphus patruus 14 ",
			"after": " Although it is on average about seven to eight cm shorter from beak to tail than the California condor the Andean condor is larger in wingspan which ranges from 270 to 320 cm 8 ft 10 in to 10 ft 6 in 3 It is also typically heavier reaching a weight of 11 to 15 kg 24 to 33 lb for males and 8 to 11 kg 18 to 24 lb for females 15 Overall length can range from 100 to 130 cm 3 ft 3 in to 4 ft 3 in 15 Among standard measurements the wing chord is 75 7 85 2 cm 29 8 33 5 in the tail is 33 38 cm 13 15 in and the tarsus is 11 5 12 5 cm 4 5 4 9 in 3 Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity 3 The mean weight is 11 3 kg 25 lb with the males averaging about a kilogram more at 12 5 kg 28 lb the females a kilogram less at 10 1 kg 22 lb According to a recently published manual of avian body masses the species possesses the heaviest average weight for any living flying bird or animal ahead of competitors such as trumpeter swans Cygnus buccinator and Dalmatian pelicans Pelecanus crispus 16 17 However another resources claims a mean species body mass of 10 3 kg 23 lb for the Andean condor 18 The Andean condor is the largest living land bird capable of flight if measured in terms of average weight and wingspan although male bustards of the largest species far more sexually dimorphic in size can weigh more at maximum 15 19 20 The mean wingspan is around 283 cm 9 ft 3 in and the wings have the largest surface area measured in square centimeters of any extant bird 20 Among living bird species only the great albatrosses and the two largest species of pelican exceed the Andean condor in average and maximal wingspan 20 21 ",
