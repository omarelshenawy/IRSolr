			"previous": " Industries associated with the sea developed throughout the East End including rope making and shipbuilding The former location of roperies can still be identified from their long straight narrow profile in the modern streets for instance Ropery Street near Mile End Shipbuilding was important from the time when Henry VIII caused ships to be built at Rotherhithe as a part of his expansion of the Royal Navy On 31 January 1858 the largest ship of that time the SS Great Eastern designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott Russell Co of Millwall The 692 foot 211 m vessel was too long to fit across the river and so the ship had to be launched sideways Due to the technical difficulties of the launch this was the last big ship to be built on the River and the industry fell into a long decline 48 Smaller ships including battleships continued to be built at the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company at Blackwall until the beginning of the 20th century ",
