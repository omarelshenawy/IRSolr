			"previous": " After the Great War there was a proposal for the League of Nations to accept Esperanto as their working language following a report by Nitobe Inaz an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against the French delegate Gabriel Hanotaux Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision However two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula For this reason many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement Anarchism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism as well as of the Esperanto language 21 ",
			"after": " Esperanto attracted the suspicion of many totalitarian states The situation was especially pronounced in Nazi Germany Francoist Spain and the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin  In Nazi Germany there was a motivation to persecute Esperanto because Zamenhof was Jewish In his work Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler specifically mentioned Esperanto as an example of a language that could be used by an international Jewish conspiracy once they achieved world domination 22 Esperantists were killed during the Holocaust with Zamenhof s family in particular singled out for murder 23 The efforts of some Esperantists to expel Jewish colleagues and align themselves with the Reich were finally futile and Esperanto was forbidden in 1936 Esperantists in German concentration camps taught the language to fellow prisoners 24 telling guards they were teaching Italian the language of one of Germany s Axis allies citation needed ",
