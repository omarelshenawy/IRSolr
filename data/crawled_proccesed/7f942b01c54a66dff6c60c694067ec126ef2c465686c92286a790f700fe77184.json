			"previous": " Through this period Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience 48 Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer Inc v Microsoft Corp 49 The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed At this time a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied Apple s reputation and Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler 50 ",
			"after": " By the early 1990s Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh such as the A UX The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware In addition Apple was facing competition from OS 2 and UNIX vendors such as Sun Microsystems The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware 51 ",
