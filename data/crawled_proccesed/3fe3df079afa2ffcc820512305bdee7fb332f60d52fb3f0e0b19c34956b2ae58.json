			"previous": " A leg glance is a delicate straight batted shot played at a ball aimed slightly on the leg side using the bat to flick the ball as it passes the batsman and requiring some wrist work as well deflecting towards the square leg or fine leg area The stroke involves deflecting the bat face towards the leg side at the last moment head and body moving inside the line of the ball This shot is played off the toes shins or hip It is played off the front foot if the ball is pitched up at the toes or shin of the batsman or off the back foot if the ball bounces at waist hip height to the batsman Although the equivalent term off glance is not employed within cricket the concept of angling the bat face towards the offside to deflect the ball away from the wicket for the purpose of scoring runs through the off side is a commonly used technique This would commonly be described instead as running or steering the ball down to third man ",
