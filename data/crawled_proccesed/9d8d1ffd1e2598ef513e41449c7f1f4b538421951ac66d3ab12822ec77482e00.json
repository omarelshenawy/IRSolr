			"after": " Given Envisat s orbit and its area to mass ratio it will take about 150 years for the satellite to be gradually pulled into the Earth s atmosphere 11 Envisat is currently operating in an environment where 2 catalogued objects can be expected to pass within about 200 m 660 ft of it every year which would likely trigger the need for a maneuver to avoid a possible collision 12 A drifting satellite as big as Envisat is more than just a huge space wreck in case of collision given its mass volume and shape it might generate a cloud of smaller debris large enough to populate the orbit initiating a self sustaining chain reaction of collisions and fragmentation with production of new debris This phenomenon known as the Kessler Syndrome would eventually make space operations difficult or even impossible and may prevent access to space to future human generations 12 ",
