			"previous": " A serious problem began to become evident during the 1880s This was a weakening of discipline within Brazil s military 86 The older generation of officers were loyal to the monarchy believed the military should be under civilian control and had a great aversion to the militaristic caudillism against which they had earlier fought 87 But these elders were no longer in control and many had since died including the Duke of Caxias the Count of Porto Alegre the Marquis of Erval and others 88 89 It was accepted that military officers could participate in politics while staying on active duty However most did so as members of the Conservative Party and Liberal Party This meant that their political careers were apt to come into conflict with their duty as officers to act in subordination to the civilian government which could be in the hands of their political opponents Earlier involvement in politics by members of the military had not threatened the stability of Brazil s institutions due to pervasive loyalty to the monarchy and constitution The conflict of interest in mixing military and political spheres became more obvious and threatening as support for the constitutional establishment eroded among some elements within the military although neither the Emperor or government seem to have grasped the extent and implications of the increasing involvement of members of the military as political dissidents 90 Until this point Brazilians both civilians and military shared a sense of pride in the nation s political stability and for having avoided the caudillos coups military dictatorships and rebellions that characterized neighboring countries 90 91 Their perception of the superiority of the Brazilian political system was attributed to an established tradition of civilian control over the military And the ministers who held the War and Navy portfolios in the cabinet were with rare exceptions civilians 90 ",
			"after": " 1882 saw the first signs of insubordination among the army corps when a group of officers assassinated a journalist in broad daylight He had published an article which they considered an offence to their honor However the participants were not subjected to punishment for this act 92 Records from 1884 show that out of a peacetime army of 13 500 men more than 7 526 had been jailed for insubordination 89 93 94 The military were badly paid inadequately equipped ill instructed and thinly spread across the vast Empire often in small garrisons of 20 10 5 and even 2 men 95 Most of the non officer corps consisted of men recruited from the poor sert o hinterland in the northeast and later from former slaves These were volunteers seeking some means of subsistence as there was no conscription They were completely unprepared for the military life had little education or concept of civic responsibility and government A poor Brazilian from the northeast viewed his military commanders in the same light as he viewed the henchmen of the political bosses at home An ex slave would saw his harsh superior officer as differing little from his former owner and taskmasters They had no means of understanding that they were being used to effect a coup that their orders put them in rebellion against the Emperor or that their actions would lead to a dictatorship The average recruit blindly followed orders and hoped to avoid punishment by his superiors for any mistake 96 ",
