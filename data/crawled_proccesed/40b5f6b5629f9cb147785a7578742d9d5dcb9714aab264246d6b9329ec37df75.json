			"previous": " One strand conformation polymorphism analysis OSCP on the major histocompatibility complex MHC class I domain taken from various locations across Tasmania showed 25 different types and showed a different pattern of MHC types in north western Tasmania to eastern Tasmania Those devils in the east of the state have less MHC diversity 30 are of the same type as the tumour type 1 and 24 are of type A 36 Seven of every ten devils in the east are of type A D G or 1 which are linked to DFTD whereas only 55 of the western devils fall into these MHC categories Of the 25 MHC types 40 are exclusive to the western devils Although the north west population is less genetically diverse overall it has higher MHC gene diversity which allows them to mount an immune response to DFTD According to this research mixing the devils may increase the chance of disease 36 Of the fifteen different regions in Tasmania surveyed in this research six were in the eastern half of the island In the eastern half Epping Forest had only two different types 75 being type O In the Buckland Nugent area only three types were present and there were an average of 5 33 different types per location In contrast in the west Cape Sorell yielded three types and Togari North Christmas Hills yielded six but the other seven sites all had at least eight MHC types and West Pencil Pine had 15 types There was an average of 10 11 MHC types per site in the west 36 ",
