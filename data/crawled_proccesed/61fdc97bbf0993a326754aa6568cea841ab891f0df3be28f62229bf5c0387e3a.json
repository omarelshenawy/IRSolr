			"previous": " The cent was the first official United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793 1 These pieces today known as large cents were made of pure copper and were about the size of a half dollar 2 They were struck every year except 1815 due to a shortage of metal but were slow to become established in commerce Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States 3 ",
			"after": " The Mint then struck silver or gold in response to deposits by those holding bullion and made little profit from those transactions By the 1840s profits or seignorage from monetizing copper into cents helped fund the Mint In 1849 copper prices rose sharply causing the Department of the Treasury to investigate possible alternatives to the large one cent pieces 4 The cent was unpopular in trade as it was not a legal tender nobody had to take it and banks and merchants often refused it 5 The cent was disliked for its large size as well In 1837 the eccentric New York chemist Lewis Feuchtwanger had experimented with a smaller cent size in making model coins as part of a plan to sell his alloy similar to base metal German silver to the government for use in coinage His pieces circulated as hard times tokens in the recession years of the late 1830s and early 1840s 5 ",
