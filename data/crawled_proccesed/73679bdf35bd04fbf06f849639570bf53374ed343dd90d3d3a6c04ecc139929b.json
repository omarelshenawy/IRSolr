			"previous": " About 300 acres 120 ha of wasteland known as Sale Moor was enclosed in 1807 to be divided between the landowners in Sale This was part of a nationwide initiative to begin cultivation of common land to lessen the food shortage caused by the Napoleonic Wars 21 Records of poor relief in the town start in 1808 a time when the region was in the grip of an economic depression 22 Poorhouses where paupers could stay rent free were built in the early 19th century reflecting the poor state of the local economy 23 In 1829 Samuel Brooks acquired 515 acres 208 ha of land in Sale about a quarter of the township from George Grey 6th Earl of Stamford 24 The area later became known as Brooklands after the land owner ",
			"after": " The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway opened in 1849 25 and led to the middle classes using Sale as a commuter town a residence away from their place of work 26 This resulted in Sale s population more than tripling by the end of the 19th century 27 The land in Sale Moor was the cheapest in the town because the soil was poor and difficult to cultivate which was part of the reason the area was common land until the early 19th century However when the railway opened Sale Moor was close to the station and became the most expensive area in Sale Villas were built in Sale Moor and a few in Ashton upon Mersey as the demand for land increased 28 They were often decorated with stained glass or different coloured bricks in an attempt to make them mansions in miniature for the aspiring middle class 29 ",
