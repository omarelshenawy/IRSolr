			"after": " The peregrine falcon is a highly admired falconry bird and has been used in falconry for more than 3 000 years beginning with nomads in central Asia 64 Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train 72 The peregrine falcon has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer waiting on for game to be flushed and then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving stoop to take the quarry The speed and energy of the stoop allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself 16 Additionally the versatility of the species with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird This size range evolved to fit various environments and prey species is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies approximately five to one approximately 1500 g to 300 g The males of smaller and medium sized subspecies and the females of the smaller subspecies excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove quail and smaller ducks The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species pheasant and grouse ",
