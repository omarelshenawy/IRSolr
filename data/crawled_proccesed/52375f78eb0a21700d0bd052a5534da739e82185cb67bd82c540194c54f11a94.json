			"previous": " Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in state travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737 400s from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel Nome Kotzebue Dillingham Kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities ",
			"after": " The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska PenAir and Frontier Flying Service The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities The program requires 70 of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities ",
