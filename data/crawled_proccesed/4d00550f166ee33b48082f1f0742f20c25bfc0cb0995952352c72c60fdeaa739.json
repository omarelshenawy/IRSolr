			"previous": " The Third of May references a number of earlier works of art but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas 25 Pictorial artifice gives way to the epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality Even the contemporary Romantic painters who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice war and death composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty as is evident in Th odore G ricault s Raft of the Medusa 1818 1819 and Eug ne Delacroix s 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People 32 ",
			"after": " The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of martyrdom in Christian art as exemplified in the dramatic use of chiaroscuro and the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution 34 However Goya s painting departs from this tradition Works that depicted violence such as those by Jusepe de Ribera feature an artful technique and harmonious composition which anticipate the crown of martyrdom for the victim 35 ",
