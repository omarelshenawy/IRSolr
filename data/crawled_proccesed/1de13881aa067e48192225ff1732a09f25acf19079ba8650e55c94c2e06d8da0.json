			"after": " The United Nations counter offensive between February and April 1951 had been largely successful with the US Eighth Army pushing the Chinese north of the Han River during Operation Killer while Seoul was recaptured in mid March during Operation Ripper and UN forces once again approached the 38th parallel 3 Regardless the strained relationship between General Douglas MacArthur and US President Harry S Truman led to MacArthur s dismissal as Commander in Chief and his replacement by General Matthew B Ridgway 4 Consequently on 14 April 1951 General James Van Fleet replaced Ridgway as commander of the US Eighth Army and the United Nations forces in Korea Ridgway flew to Tokyo the same day to replace MacArthur 5 Meanwhile the offensive continued with a series of short thrusts Operation Courageous in late March pushed forward to the Benton Line 8 kilometres 5 0 mi south of the 38th parallel while Operation Rugged in early April pushed just north of the 38th parallel to the Kansas Line Finally in mid April a further advance moved the US Eighth Army to the Utah Line 6 ",
