			"previous": " Externally Columbia was the first orbiter in the fleet whose surface was mostly covered with High Low Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation HRSI LRSI tiles as its main thermal protection system TPS with white silicone rubber painted Nomex known as Felt Reusable Surface Insulation FRSI blankets in some areas on the wings fuselage and payload bay doors FRSI once covered almost 25 of the orbiter the first upgrade resulted in its removal from many areas and in later flights it was only used on the upper section of the payload bay doors and inboard sections of the upper wing surfaces 9 The upgrade also involved replacing many of the white LRSI tiles on the upper surfaces with Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation AFRSI blankets also known as Fibrous Insulation Blankets or FIBs that had been used on Discovery and Atlantis Originally Columbia had 32 000 tiles the upgrade reduced this to 24 300 The AFRSI blankets consisted of layers of pure silica felt sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric on the outside and S Glass fabric on the inside stitched together using pure silica thread in a 1 inch grid then coated with a high purity silica coating The blankets were semi rigid and could be made as large as 30 by 30 Each blanket replaced as many as 25 tiles and was bonded directly to the orbiter 9 The direct application of the blankets to the orbiter resulted in weight reduction improved durability reduced fabrication and installation cost and reduced installation schedule time 10 All of this work was performed during Columbia s first retrofitting and the post Challenger stand down ",
			"after": " Despite refinements to the orbiter s thermal protection system and other enhancements Columbia would never weigh as little unloaded as the other orbiters in the fleet The next oldest shuttle Challenger was also relatively heavy although 2 200 lb 1 000 kg lighter than Columbia ",
