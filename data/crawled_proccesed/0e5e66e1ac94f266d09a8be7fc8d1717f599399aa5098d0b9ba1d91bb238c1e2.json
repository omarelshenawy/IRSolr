			"after": " Juvenile magpies begin foraging on their own three weeks after leaving the nest and mostly feeding themselves by six months old Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age but are usually ignored Birds reach adult size by their first year 82 The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex males are usually evicted at a younger age Many leave at around a year old but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years 83 ",
