			"previous": " Ballistic missile submarines have been of great strategic importance for the USA Russia and other nuclear powers since they entered service in the Cold War as they can hide from reconnaissance satellites and fire their nuclear weapons with virtual impunity This makes them immune to a first strike directed against nuclear forces allowing each side to maintain the capability to launch a devastating retaliatory strike even if all land based missiles have been destroyed This relieves each side of the necessity to adopt a launch on warning posture with its grave attendant risk of accidental nuclear war Additionally the deployment of highly accurate missiles on ultra quiet submarines allows an attacker to sneak up close to the enemy coast and launch a missile on a depressed trajectory a non optimal ballistic trajectory which trades off reduced throw weight for a faster and lower path effectively reducing the time between launch and impact thus opening the possibility of a decapitation strike citation needed ",
