			"previous": " The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by Thomas Newcomen before 1712 A number of Newcomen engines were successfully put to use in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines with the engine on the surface these were large machines requiring a lot of capital to build and produced about 5 hp 3 7 kW They were extremely inefficient by modern standards but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper Despite their disadvantages Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century By 1729 when Newcomen died his engines had spread first to Hungary in 1722 Germany Austria and Sweden A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired of which 14 were abroad In the 1770s the engineer John Smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements A total of 1 454 engines had been built by 1800 48 ",
			"after": " A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by Scotsman James Watt In close collaboration with Englishman Matthew Boulton he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine which incorporated a series of radical improvements notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder thereby making the low pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam Likewise the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder also improving efficiency These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton Watts engines used only 20 25 as much coal per horsepower hour as Newcomen s Boulton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry for the manufacture of such engines in 1795 ",
