			"previous": " Unlike interceptors of the previous eras most fourth generation air superiority fighters were designed to be agile dogfighters although the Mikoyan MiG 31 and Panavia Tornado ADV are notable exceptions The continually rising cost of fighters however continued to emphasize the value of multirole fighters The need for both types of fighters led to the high low mix concept which envisioned a high capability and high cost core of dedicated air superiority fighters like the F 15 and Su 27 supplemented by a larger contingent of lower cost multi role fighters such as the F 16 and MiG 29 ",
			"after": " Most fourth generation fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F A 18 Hornet and Dassault Mirage 2000 are true multirole warplanes designed as such from the start This was facilitated by multimode avionics that could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes The earlier approaches of adding on strike capabilities or designing separate models specialized for different roles generally became pass with the Panavia Tornado being an exception in this regard Attack roles were generally assigned to dedicated ground attack aircraft such as the Sukhoi Su 25 and the A 10 Thunderbolt II ",
