			"previous": " On September 30 1968 the first 747 was rolled out of the Everett assembly building before the world s press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the airliner 44 Over the following months preparations were made for the first flight which took place on February 9 1969 with test pilots Jack Waddell and Brien Wygle at the controls 45 46 and Jess Wallick at the flight engineer s station Despite a minor problem with one of the flaps the flight confirmed that the 747 handled extremely well The 747 was found to be largely immune to Dutch roll a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept wing jets 47 ",
			"after": " During later stages of the flight test program flutter testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components However a particularly severe high speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting depleted uranium counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine nacelles of the early 747s 48 This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed as did China Airlines Flight 358 at Wanli in 1991 and El Al Flight 1862 at Amsterdam in 1992 which had 282 kilograms 622 lb of uranium in the tailplane 49 50 ",
