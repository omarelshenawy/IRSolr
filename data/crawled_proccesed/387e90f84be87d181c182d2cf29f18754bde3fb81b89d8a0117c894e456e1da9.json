			"after": " The elements of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance elastance inverse capacitance and resistance respectively The mechanical counterparts of these properties are respectively mass stiffness and damping In most electronic filter designs only inductor and capacitor elements are used in the body of the filter although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements Likewise a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness but in reality some damping is present as well 1 ",
