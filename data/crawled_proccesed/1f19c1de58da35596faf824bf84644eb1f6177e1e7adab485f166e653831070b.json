			"previous": " Algebra from Arabic al jebr meaning reunion of broken parts 1 is one of the broad parts of mathematics together with number theory geometry and analysis In its most general form algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols 2 it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics 3 As such it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups rings and fields The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra Elementary algebra is essential for any study of mathematics science or engineering as well as such applications as medicine and economics Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics studied primarily by professional mathematicians Much early work in algebra as the Arabic origin of its name suggests was done in the Near East by such mathematicians as Omar Khayyam 1048 1131 4 5 ",
			"after": " The word algebra is also used in certain specialized ways A special kind of mathematical object in abstract algebra is called an algebra and the word is used for example in the phrases linear algebra and algebraic topology ",
