			"previous": " Muhammad adopted the practice of praying alone for several weeks every year in a cave on Mount Hira near Mecca 64 65 Islamic tradition holds that during one of his visits to Mount Hira the angel Gabriel appeared to him in the year 610 and commanded Muhammad to recite verses which would later be included in the Quran 66 There is a consensus that the first words of the Quran to be revealed were the beginning of Surah 96 1 67 Upon receiving his first revelations he was deeply distressed After returning home Muhammad was consoled and reassured by Khadijah and her Christian cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal 68 Waraqah is variously described as an Ebionite priest possibly of Mecca or Nestorian He also feared that others would dismiss his claims as being possessed 44 Shi a tradition maintains that Muhammad was neither surprised nor frightened at the appearance of Gabriel but rather Muhammad welcomed him as if he was expecting 69 The initial revelation was followed by a pause of three years a period known as fatra during which Muhammad felt depressed and further gave himself to prayers and spiritual practices 67 When the revelations resumed he was reassured and commanded to begin preaching Thy Guardian Lord hath not forsaken thee nor is He displeased 70 71 72 ",
			"after": " Sahih Bukhari narrates Muhammad describing his revelations as sometimes it is revealed like the ringing of a bell Aisha reported I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead as the Inspiration was over 73 According to Welch these descriptions may be considered genuine since they are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims 14 Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages 74 According to the Quran one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their eschatological punishment Quran 38 70 Quran 6 19 Occasionally the Quran did not explicitly refer to Judgment day but provided examples from the history of extinct communities and warns Muhammad s contemporaries of similar calamities Quran 41 13 16 26 Muhammad did not only warn those who rejected God s revelation but also dispensed good news for those who abandoned evil listening to the divine words and serving God 75 Muhammad s mission also involves preaching monotheism The Quran commands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of his Lord and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God 26 76 ",
