			"after": " The active components of an RNA induced silencing complex RISC are endonucleases called argonaute proteins which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA 4 As the fragments produced by dicer are double stranded they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA However only one of the two strands which is known as the guide strand binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing The other anti guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation 20 Although it was first believed that an ATP dependent helicase separated these two strands 21 the process proved to be ATP independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC 22 23 However an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis 24 The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5 end is less stably paired to its complement 25 but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation 26 Instead the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more stable 5 end of the passenger strand 27 ",
