			"previous": " In relativity proper time along a timelike or lightlike world line is defined as the time as measured by a clock following that line It is thus independent of coordinates and a Lorentz scalar 1 The proper time interval between two events on a world line is the change in proper time This is the quantity of interest since proper time itself is fixed only up to an arbitrary additive constant namely the setting of the clock at some event along the world line The proper time between two events depends not only on the events but also the world line connecting them and hence on the motion of the clock between the events It is expressed as an integral over the world line An accelerated clock will measure a smaller elapsed time between two events than that measured by a non accelerated inertial clock between the same two events The twin paradox is an example of this effect ",
			"after": " In terms of four dimensional spacetime proper time is analogous to arc length in three dimensional Euclidean space By convention proper time is usually represented by the Greek letter tau to distinguish it from coordinate time represented by t ",
