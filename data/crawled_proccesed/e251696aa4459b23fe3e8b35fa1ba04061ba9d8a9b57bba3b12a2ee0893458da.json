			"previous": " Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition repeated by Johnson that Shakespeare retired to Stratford some years before his death 51 52 He was still working as an actor in London in 1608 in an answer to the sharers petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans the King s Men placed men players there which were Heminges Condell Shakespeare etc 53 However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609 54 55 The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610 56 which meant there was often no acting work Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time 57 Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611 1614 51 In 1612 he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy s daughter Mary 58 In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory 59 and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son in law John Hall 60 After 1610 Shakespeare wrote fewer plays and none are attributed to him after 1613 61 His last three plays were collaborations probably with John Fletcher 62 who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King s Men 63 ",
