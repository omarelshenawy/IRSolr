			"after": " During the past ten years unusually warm Caribbean waters have been increasingly threatening Caribbean coral reefs Coral reefs support some of the most diverse marine habitats in the world but they are fragile ecosystems When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time microscopic plants called zooxanthellae which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues die off These plants provide food for the corals and give them their color The result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called coral bleaching and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef Over 42 of corals are completely bleached and 95 are experiencing some type of whitening 9 ",
