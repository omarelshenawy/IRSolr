			"previous": " Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity practical thinking about good living as something less lofty and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes In contrast to modern science Aristotle s influential emphasis was upon the theoretical steps of deducing universal rules from raw data and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself 14 ",
			"after": " During late antiquity and the early Middle Ages the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used Some ancient knowledge was lost or in some cases kept in obscurity during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles However the general fields of science or natural philosophy as it was called and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville Also in the Byzantine empire many Greek science texts were preserved in Syriac translations done by groups such as Nestorians and Monophysites 18 Many of these were translated later on into Arabic under the Caliphate during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon 18 19 The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid era Baghdad Iraq 20 It is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the Islamic Golden Age where Muslim scholars such as al Kindi and Ibn Sahl in Baghdad and Ibn al Haytham in Cairo flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries until the Mongol sack of Baghdad Ibn al Haytham known later to the West as Alhazen furthered the Aristotelian viewpoint 21 by emphasizing experimental data and the reproducibility of its results nb 2 In the later medieval period as demand for translations grew for example from the Toledo School of Translators Western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin but also Latin translations from Greek Arabic and Hebrew The texts of Aristotle Ptolemy 22 and Euclid preserved in the Houses of Wisdom were sought amongst Catholic scholars In Europe Alhazen s De Aspectibus directly influenced Roger Bacon 13th century in England who argued for more experimental science as demonstrated by Alhazen By the late Middle Ages a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism was flourishing in Western Europe which had become a new geographic center of science but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries ",
