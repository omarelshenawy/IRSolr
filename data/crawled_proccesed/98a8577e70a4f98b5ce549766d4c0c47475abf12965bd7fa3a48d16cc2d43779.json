			"previous": " Judas is the subject of philosophical writings including The Problem of Natural Evil by Bertrand Russell and Three Versions of Judas a short story by Jorge Luis Borges They allege various problematic ideological contradictions with the discrepancy between Judas actions and his eternal punishment Bruce Reichenbach argues that if Jesus foresees Judas betrayal then the betrayal is not an act of free will 54 and therefore should not be punishable Conversely it is argued that just because the betrayal was foretold it does not prevent Judas from exercising his own free will in this matter 55 Other scholars argue that Judas acted in obedience to God s will 56 The gospels suggest that Judas is apparently bound up with the fulfillment of God s purposes John 13 18 John 17 12 Matthew 26 23 25 Luke 22 21 22 Matt 27 9 10 Acts 1 16 Acts 1 20 49 yet woe is upon him and he would have been better unborn Matthew 26 23 25 The difficulty inherent in the saying is its paradoxicality if Judas had not been born the Son of Man would apparently no longer do as it is written of him The consequence of this apologetic approach is that Judas actions come to be seen as necessary and unavoidable yet leading to condemnation 57 ",
			"after": " Erasmus believed that Judas was free to change his intention but Martin Luther argued in rebuttal that Judas will was immutable John Calvin states that Judas was predestined to damnation but writes on the question of Judas guilt surely in Judas betrayal it will be no more right because God himself willed that his son be delivered up and delivered him up to death to ascribe the guilt of the crime to God than to transfer the credit for redemption to Judas 58 The Catholic Church has no view on his damnation The Vatican only proclaims individuals Eternal Salvation through the Canon of Saints There is no Canon of the Damned nor any official proclamation of the damnation of Judas ",
