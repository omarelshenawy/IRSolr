			"previous": " Chemical engineering like its counterpart mechanical engineering developed in the nineteenth century during the Industrial Revolution 3 Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants 3 The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes 3 ",
			"after": " Aeronautical engineering deals with aircraft design process design while aerospace engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including spacecraft design Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering 13 ",
