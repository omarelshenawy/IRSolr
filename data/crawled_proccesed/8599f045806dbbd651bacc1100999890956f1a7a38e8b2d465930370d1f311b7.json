			"previous": " In the 3rd century BC the premier center of mathematical education and research was the Musaeum of Alexandria 45 It was there that Euclid c 300 BC taught and wrote the Elements widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time 1 The Elements introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today that of definition axiom theorem and proof Although most of the contents of the Elements were already known Euclid arranged them into a single coherent logical framework 46 The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today 47 In addition to the familiar theorems of Euclidean geometry the Elements was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time such as number theory algebra and solid geometry 46 including proofs that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers Euclid also wrote extensively on other subjects such as conic sections optics spherical geometry and mechanics but only half of his writings survive 48 ",
			"after": " Archimedes c 287 212 BC of Syracuse widely considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity 49 used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus 50 He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of with as much precision as desired and obtained the most accurate value of then known 310 71 310 70 51 He also studied the spiral bearing his name obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution paraboloid ellipsoid hyperboloid 50 and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers 52 While he is also known for his contributions to physics and several advanced mechanical devices Archimedes himself placed far greater value on the products of his thought and general mathematical principles 53 He regarded as his greatest achievement his finding of the surface area and volume of a sphere which he obtained by proving these are 2 3 the surface area and volume of a cylinder circumscribing the sphere 54 ",
