			"after": " Phylogenetic trees composed with a nontrivial number of input sequences are constructed using computational phylogenetics methods Distance matrix methods such as neighbor joining or UPGMA which calculate genetic distance from multiple sequence alignments are simplest to implement but do not invoke an evolutionary model Many sequence alignment methods such as ClustalW also create trees by using the simpler algorithms i e those based on distance of tree construction Maximum parsimony is another simple method of estimating phylogenetic trees but implies an implicit model of evolution i e parsimony More advanced methods use the optimality criterion of maximum likelihood often within a Bayesian Framework and apply an explicit model of evolution to phylogenetic tree estimation 4 Identifying the optimal tree using many of these techniques is NP hard 4 so heuristic search and optimization methods are used in combination with tree scoring functions to identify a reasonably good tree that fits the data ",
