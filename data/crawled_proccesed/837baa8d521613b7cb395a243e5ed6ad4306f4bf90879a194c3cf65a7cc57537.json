			"previous": " While the legislation was being considered Mint Melter and Refiner James Curtis Booth was conducting experiments on alloys that might be appropriate for the new cent 8 In July 1856 Snowden wrote to Guthrie proposing an alloy of 88 copper and 12 nickel as ideal and suggesting amendments to the pending bill that would accomplish this Booth also wrote to Guthrie to boost the alloy 12 both men proposed a weight of 72 grains 4 7 g as convenient as 80 cents would equal a troy pound 373 g although the avoirdupois pound 454 g was more commonly used for base metals 13 ",
			"after": " The Mint s chief engraver James B Longacre was instructed to prepare designs for pattern coins 13 Initially Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared This occurred as Booth s experiments continued the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were about the size of a quarter 14 To promote the new alloy the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it and had them sent to Washington for Treasury officials to show to officials and congressmen 5 In early November 1856 Longacre prepared dies in what would prove to be the final design depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse in the size sought by Booth 14 ",
