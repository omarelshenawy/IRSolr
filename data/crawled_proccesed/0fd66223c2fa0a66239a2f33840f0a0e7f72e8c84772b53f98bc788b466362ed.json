			"previous": " The unpressurized rotodome is 30 feet 9 1 m in diameter six feet 1 8 m thick at the center and is held 11 feet 3 4 m above the fuselage by two struts 2 It is tilted down at the front to reduce its air drag during take offs and while flying endurance speed which is corrected electronically by both the radar and SSR antenna phase shifters The dome uses both bleed air and cooling doors to remove the heat generated by electronic and mechanical equipment The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation s AN APY 1 and AN APY 2 passive electronically scanned array radar system 18 to provide surveillance from the Earth s surface up into the stratosphere over land or water ",
			"after": " Other major subsystems in the E 3 Sentry are navigation communications and computers Consoles display computer processed data in graphic and tabular format on video screens Console operators perform surveillance identification weapons control battle management and communications functions 2 The radar and computer subsystems on the E 3 can gather and present broad and detailed battlefield information This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships and location and status of friendly aircraft and naval vessels The information can be sent to major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships In times of crisis data can be forwarded to the National Command Authority in the U S via RC 135 or naval aircraft carrier task forces 2 ",
