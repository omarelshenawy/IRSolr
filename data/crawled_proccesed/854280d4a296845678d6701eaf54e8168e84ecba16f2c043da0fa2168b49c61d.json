			"previous": " The Ringerike Style is a Scandinavian animal style from the late 10th century and the 11th century which evolved out of the earlier Mammen Style It has received its name from a group of runestones with animal and plant motifs in the Ringerike district north of Oslo The most common motifs are lions birds band shaped animals and spirals Some elements appear for the first time in Scandinavian art such as different types of crosses palmettes and pretzel shaped nooses that tie together two motifs 13 Most of the motifs have counterparts in Anglo Saxon art and Ottonian art ",
			"after": " The Urnes Style was the last phase of Scandinavian animal art during the second half of the 11th century and in the early 12th century 13 The Urnes Style is named after the northern gate of the Urnes stave church in Norway but most objects in the style are runestones in Uppland Sweden which is why some scholars prefer to call it the Runestone style 13 ",
