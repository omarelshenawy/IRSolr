			"after": " By September 1857 the volume of Spanish silver coming to the Mint had been so large that Snowden gave up the idea of being able to pay for it just with cents authorizing payment with gold and silver coins On March 3 1859 the redemption of the foreign pieces was extended for an additional two years As commerce was choked with the new cents Congress repealed this provision in July 1860 though Snowden continued the practice for more than a year without authorization from Congress Bankers Magazine for October 1861 reported the end of the exchange and quoted the Philadelphia Press the large issue of the new nickel cents has rendered them almost as much of a nuisance as the old Spanish currency 34 According to Breen the foreign silver coins had been legal tender receivable for all kinds of payments including postage stamps and some taxes the nickel cents were not They quickly filled shopkeepers cashboxes to the exclusion of almost everything else they began to be legally refused in trade 35 The glut was ended by the hoarding of all federal coinage in the wake of the economic upset caused by the Civil War 36 37 ",
