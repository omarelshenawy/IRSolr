			"previous": " The annunciation dominates any other theme on the outer wings of Northern 15th century polyptychs The tradition originates from Byzantine art with van Eyck largely responsible for re popularising the practice 36 Along with his Ghent Altarpiece the Dresden Triptych is one of the earliest surviving examples of the technique and on this basis he is usually credited as the innovator of a motif that became almost standard from the mid 15th century 37 As the annunciation marks the incarnation of Christ its representation on the outer wings gives symmetry to the scenes of his life typically detailed on the inner panels 38 ",
			"after": " The outer wings of 15th century diptychs and triptychs typically contained Annunciation scenes painted in grisaille Molly Teasdale Smith believes the practice echoes the tradition of covering religious imagery with grey cloth during the then 46 day lenten period leading up to Easter There is a symmetry with this in how polyptychs were typically kept closed except for Sundays or church holidays when they were opened to reveal the more colourful and expansive inner panels 39 ",
