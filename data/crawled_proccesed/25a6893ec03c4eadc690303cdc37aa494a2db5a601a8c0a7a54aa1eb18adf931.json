			"previous": " Fonts especially ones intended for professional use are commonly designed to be used at a specific size The art of designing fonts for a specific size is known as optical sizing Designs intended to be printed small may feature larger lower case letters chunkier stroke weights and thicker serifs while fonts intended for display may be more slender Typefaces may also be designed differently considering the type of paper on which they will be printed Designs to be printed on absorbent newsprint paper will be more slender as the ink will naturally spread out as it absorbs into the paper but this correction will not be needed for printing on high gloss cardboard or display on screen During the metal type era all type was cut in metal so could only be printed at a specific size ",
			"after": " Numbers can be typeset in two independent sets of ways lining and non lining figures and proportional and tabular styles making for four possible combinations  Most modern typefaces set numbers by default as lining figures the height of upper case letters Non lining figures styled to match lower case letters are often common in fonts intended for body text as they are thought to be less disruptive to the style of running text They are also called lower case numbers or text figures for the same reason ",
