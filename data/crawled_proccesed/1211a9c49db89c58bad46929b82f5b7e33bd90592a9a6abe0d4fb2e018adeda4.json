			"after": " Armillaria luteobubalina commonly known as the Australian honey fungus is a species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae Widely distributed in southern Australia the fungus is responsible for a disease known as Armillaria root rot a primary cause of Eucalyptus tree death and forest dieback It is the most pathogenic and widespread of the six Armillaria species found in Australia The fungus has also been collected in Argentina and Chile Fruit bodies have cream to tan coloured caps that grow up to 10 cm 4 in in diameter and stems that measure up to 20 cm 8 in long by 1 5 cm 1 in thick The fruit bodies which appear at the base of infected trees and other woody plants in autumn March April are edible but require cooking to remove the bitter taste The fungus is dispersed through spores produced on gills on the underside of the caps and also by growing vegetatively through the root systems of host trees The ability of the fungus to spread vegetatively is facilitated by an aerating system that allows it to efficiently diffuse oxygen through rhizomorphs rootlike structures made of dense masses of hyphae ",
