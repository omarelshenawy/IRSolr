			"previous": " During the Russian Civil War which initially started as a confrontation between the Communists and Monarchists on the territory of today s Ukraine a new force emerged namely the Anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno The Ukrainian Anarchist during the Russian Civil War also called the Black Army organized the Free Territory of Ukraine an anarchist society committed to resisting state authority whether capitalist or communist 59 60 This project was cut short by the consolidation of Bolshevik power Makhno was described by anarchist theorist Emma Goldman as an extraordinary figure leading a revolutionary peasants movement 61 During 1918 most of Ukraine was controlled by the forces of the Central Powers which were unpopular among the people In March 1918 the young anarchist Makhno s forces and allied anarchist and guerrilla groups won victories against German Austrian and Ukrainian nationalist the army of Symon Petlura forces and units of the White Army capturing a lot of German and Austro Hungarian arms These victories over much larger enemy forces established Makhno s reputation as a military tactician he became known as Batko Father to his admirers 62 ",
			"after": " At this point the emphasis on military campaigns that Makhno had adopted in the previous year shifted to political concerns The first Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups under the name of Nabat the Alarm Drum issued five main principles rejection of all political parties rejection of all forms of dictatorships including the dictatorship of the proletariat viewed by Makhnovists and many anarchists of the day as a term synonymous with the dictatorship of the Bolshevik communist party negation of any concept of a central state rejection of a so called transitional period necessitating a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat and self management of all workers through free local workers councils soviets While the Bolsheviks argued that their concept of dictatorship of the proletariat meant precisely rule by workers councils the Makhnovist platform opposed the temporary Bolshevik measure of party dictatorship The Nabat was by no means a puppet of Mahkno and his supporters from time to time criticizing the Black Army and its conduct in the war ",
