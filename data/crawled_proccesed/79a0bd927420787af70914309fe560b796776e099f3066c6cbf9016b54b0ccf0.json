			"previous": " The increasing number of raccoons in urban areas has resulted in diverse reactions in humans ranging from outrage at their presence to deliberate feeding 215 Some wildlife experts and most public authorities caution against feeding wild animals because they might become increasingly obtrusive and dependent on humans as a food source 216 Other experts challenge such arguments and give advice on feeding raccoons and other wildlife in their books 217 218 Raccoons without a fear of humans are a concern to those who attribute this trait to rabies but scientists point out this behavior is much more likely to be a behavioral adjustment to living in habitats with regular contact to humans for many generations 219 Raccoons usually do not prey on domestic cats and dogs but individual cases of killings have been reported 220 ",
			"after": " While overturned waste containers and raided fruit trees are just a nuisance to homeowners it can cost several thousand dollars to repair damage caused by the use of attic space as dens 221 Relocating or killing raccoons without a permit is forbidden in many urban areas on grounds of animal welfare These methods usually only solve problems with particularly wild or aggressive individuals since adequate dens are either known to several raccoons or will quickly be rediscovered 208 222 Loud noises flashing lights and unpleasant odors have proven particularly effective in driving away a mother and her kits before they would normally leave the nesting place when the kits are about eight weeks old 208 223 Typically though only precautionary measures to restrict access to food waste and den sites are effective in the long term 208 224 ",
