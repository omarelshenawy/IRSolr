			"previous": " A coefficient is a numerical value which multiplies a variable the operator is omitted A term is an addend or a summand a group of coefficients variables constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators 3 Letters represent variables and constants By convention letters at the beginning of the alphabet e g are typically used to represent constants and those toward the end of the alphabet e g and are used to represent variables 4 They are usually written in italics 5 ",
			"after": " Usually terms with the highest power exponent are written on the left for example is written to the left of When a coefficient is one it is usually omitted e g is written 9 Likewise when the exponent power is one e g is written 10 When the exponent is zero the result is always 1 e g is always rewritten to 11 However being undefined should not appear in an expression and care should be taken in simplifying expressions in which variables may appear in exponents ",
