			"previous": " In physics one separates the laws of motion called kinematics from the laws of force called dynamics Following the classical kinematics of Newton s laws of motion the kinematics of quantum mechanics is built in such a way that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics In other words if the dynamics are invariant then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant if the dynamics is not then the kinematics will also show this The structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer and we examine these next ",
