			"previous": " The book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis 190 but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English speaking world 191 192 ",
			"after": " Natural theology was not a unified doctrine and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful 190 In the Church of England some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God s design with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as just as noble a conception of Deity 194 195 In the second edition of January 1860 Darwin quoted Kingsley as a celebrated cleric and added the phrase by the Creator to the closing sentence which from then on read life with its several powers having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one 148 While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted 65 Darwin s view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature 196 197 and even in the first edition there are several references to creation 198 ",
