			"after": " The Talbot effect is a near field diffraction effect first observed in 1836 by Henry Fox Talbot When a plane wave is incident upon a periodic diffraction grating the image of the grating is repeated at regular distances away from the grating plane The regular distance is called the Talbot length and the repeated images are called self images or Talbot images Furthermore at half the Talbot length a self image also occurs but phase shifted by half a period the physical meaning of this is that it is laterally shifted by half the width of the grating period At smaller regular fractions of the Talbot length sub images can also be observed At one quarter of the Talbot length the self image is halved in size and appears with half the period of the grating thus twice as many images are seen At one eighth of the Talbot length the period and size of the images is halved again and so forth creating a fractal pattern of sub images with ever decreasing size often referred to as a Talbot carpet ",
