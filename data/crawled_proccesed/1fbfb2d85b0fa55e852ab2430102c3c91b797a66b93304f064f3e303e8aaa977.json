			"after": " Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic used for the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram positive bacteria that are resistant to several other antibiotics A member of the oxazolidinone class of drugs linezolid is active against most Gram positive bacteria that cause disease including streptococci vancomycin resistant enterococci and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus The main indications of linezolid are infections of the skin and soft tissues and pneumonia particularly hospital acquired pneumonia although off label use for a variety of other infections is becoming popular Discovered in the late 1980s and first approved for use in 2000 linezolid was the first commercially available oxazolidinone antibiotic As of 2009 it is the only marketed oxazolidinone although others are in development As a protein synthesis inhibitor it stops the growth of bacteria by disrupting their production of proteins Resistance to linezolid has remained very low since it was first detected in 1999 although it may be increasing When administered for short periods linezolid is a relatively safe drug it can be used in patients of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function more ",
