			"previous": " The Russian concept of Eurasia is very different from the European one It is a view that has older roots than the European one not surprisingly considering Russia s geographic position citation needed Russian politologists traditionally view Russia itself being both European and Asian as Eurasian The geopolitical area of the Russian concept of Eurasia corresponded initially more or less to the land area of Imperial Russia in 1914 including parts of Eastern Europe 10 There is undeniably an influence of Panslavism in this definition originally the idea of Eurasia was more romantically rooted in natural geography It was the idea that the people scattered across the land called Eurasia shared common spiritual values due to its geographic traits such as a flat land with few coastlines but important rivers a particular climate continental often harshly so and a certain landscape steppe taiga tundra This idea was more or less realised but with difficulty during the last phases of the Russian Empire and was then realised again with the Soviet Union after 1945 though not stably enough for enduring success Today though this Russian geopolitical interest still exists the physical area of the Russian Eurasia is now more realistically assessed The Russian view today is that Eurasia consists of the land lying between Europe and Asia proper namely those made up of Western and Central Russia Belarus Ukraine part of Caucasus Uzbekistan Kazakhstan Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan see Eurasian Economic Union Just as in the case of the European concept of Eurasia the Russian version of Eurasia is a geopolitical interest that underpins foreign policy in that part of the world Thus it is not surprising that today one of Russia s main geopolitical interests lies in ever closer integration with those countries that it considers part of Eurasia 11 ",
