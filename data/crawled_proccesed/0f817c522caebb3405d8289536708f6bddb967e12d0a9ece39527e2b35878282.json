			"previous": " The first commercial electrical telegraph was co developed by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone In May 1837 they patented the Cooke and Wheatstone system which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet The patent recommended a five needle system but any number of needles could be used depending on the number of characters it was required to code A four needle system was installed between Euston and Camden Town in London on a rail line being constructed by Robert Stephenson between London and Birmingham It was successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837 15 Euston needed to signal to an engine house at Camden Town to start hauling the locomotive up the incline As at Liverpool the electric telegraph was in the end rejected in favour of a pneumatic system with whistles 16 ",
			"after": " Cooke and Wheatstone had their first commercial success with a system installed on the Great Western Railway over the 13 miles 21 km from Paddington station to West Drayton in 1838 the first commercial telegraph in the world 17 This was a five needle six wire 16 system The cables were originally installed underground in a steel conduit However the cables soon began to fail as a result of deteriorating insulation and were replaced with uninsulated wires on poles 18 As an interim measure a two needle system was used with three of the remaining working underground wires which despite using only two needles had a greater number of codes 19 But when the line was extended to Slough in 1843 a one needle two wire system was installed 20 ",
