			"previous": " Extensive studies show that lionesses normally prey on mammals with an average weight of 126 kg 278 lb while kills made by male lions average 399 kg 880 lb 80 In Africa wildebeest rank at the top of preferred prey making nearly half of the lion prey in the Serengeti followed by zebra 81 Lions do not prey on fully grown adult elephants most adult hippopotamuses rhinoceroses and smaller gazelles impala and other agile antelopes are generally excluded However giraffes and buffaloes are often taken in certain regions For instance in Kruger National Park giraffes are regularly hunted 82 In Manyara Park Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62 of the lion s diet 83 due to the high number density of buffaloes Occasionally hippopotamus is also taken but adult rhinoceroses are generally avoided Warthogs are often taken depending on availability 84 The lions of Savuti Botswana have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years 85 In the Kalahari desert in South Africa black maned lions may chase baboons up a tree wait patiently then attack them when they try to escape ",
			"after": " Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet 56 Lions are capable of killing other predators such as leopards cheetahs hyenas and wild dogs though unlike most felids they seldom devour the competitors after killing them A lion may gorge itself and eat up to 30 kg 66 lb in one sitting 86 if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more On a hot day the pride may retreat to shade leaving a male or two to stand guard 87 An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg 11 lb of meat per day a male about 7 kg 15 lb 88 ",
