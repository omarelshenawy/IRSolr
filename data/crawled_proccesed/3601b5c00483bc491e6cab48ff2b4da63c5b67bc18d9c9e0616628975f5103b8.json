			"previous": " The presence of Paxillus involutus is related to much reduced numbers of bacteria associated with the roots of Pinus sylvestris Instead bacteria are found on the external mycelium 39 The types of bacteria change as well a Finnish study published in 1997 found that bacterial communities under P sylvestris without mycorrhizae metabolised organic and amino acids while communities among P involutus metabolised the sugar fructose 40 Paxillus involutus benefits from the presence of some species of bacteria in the soil it grows in As the fungus grows it excretes polyphenols waste products that are toxic to itself and impede its growth but these compounds are metabolised by some bacteria resulting in increased fungal growth Bacteria also produce certain compounds such as citric and malic acid which stimulate P involutus 41 ",
