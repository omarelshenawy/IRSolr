			"previous": " Given a differential equation For a system of the form some sources also require that the Jacobian matrix be non singular in order to call this an implicit ODE system an implicit ODE system satisfying this Jacobian non singularity condition can be transformed into an explicit ODE system In the same sources implicit ODE systems with a singular Jacobian are termed differential algebraic equations DAEs This distinction is not merely one of terminology DAEs have fundamentally different characteristics and are generally more involved to solve than nonsigular ODE systems 14 15 Presumably for additional derivatives the Hessian matrix and so forth are also assumed non singular according to this scheme citation needed although note that any ODE of order greater than one can and usually is rewritten as system of ODEs of first order 16 which makes the Jacobian singularity criterion sufficient for this taxonomy to be comprehensive at all orders ",
