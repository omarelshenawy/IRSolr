			"previous": " After World War I experienced fighter pilots were eager to show off their new skills Many American pilots became barnstormers flying into small towns across the country and showing off their flying abilities as well as taking paying passengers for rides Eventually the barnstormers grouped into more organized displays Air shows sprang up around the country with air races acrobatic stunts and feats of air superiority The air races drove engine and airframe development the Schneider Trophy for example led to a series of ever faster and sleeker monoplane designs culminating in the Supermarine S 6B With pilots competing for cash prizes there was an incentive to go faster Amelia Earhart was perhaps the most famous of those on the barnstorming air show circuit She was also the first female pilot to achieve records such as crossing of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans ",
