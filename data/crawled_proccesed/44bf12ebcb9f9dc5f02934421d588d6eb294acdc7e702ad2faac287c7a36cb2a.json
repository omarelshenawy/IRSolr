			"previous": " Besides these nine core exosome proteins two other proteins often associate with the complex in eukaryotic organisms One of these is Rrp44 a hydrolytic RNase which belongs to the RNase R family of hydrolytic exoribonucleases nucleases that use water to cleave the nucleotide bonds In addition to being an exoribonucleolytic enzyme Rrp44 also has endoribonucleolytic activity which resides in a separate domain of the protein 16 17 In yeast Rrp44 is associated with all exosome complexes and has a crucial role in the activity of the yeast exosome complex 18 While a human homologue of the protein exists no evidence was found for a long time that its human homologue was associated with the human exosome complex 7 In 2010 however it was discovered that humans have three Rrp44 homologues and two of these can be associated with the exosome complex These two proteins most likely degrade different RNA substrates due to their different cellular localization with one being localized in the cytoplasm Dis3L1 and the other in the nucleus Dis3 19 20 ",
			"after": " The second common associated protein is called Rrp6 in yeast or PM Scl 100 in human Like Rrp44 this protein is a hydrolytic exoribonuclease but in this case of the RNase D protein family 21 The protein PM Scl 100 is most commonly part of exosome complexes in the nucleus of cells but can form part of the cytoplasmic exosome complex as well 22 ",
