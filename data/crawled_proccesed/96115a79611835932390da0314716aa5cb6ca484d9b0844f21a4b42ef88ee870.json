			"after": " Lions and spotted hyenas occupy the same ecological niche meaning they compete for prey and carrion in the areas where they coexist A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58 6 92 Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas unless the lions are on a kill or are being harassed by the hyenas while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions whether there is food or not Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas in the Ngorongoro crater it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate 93 On the other hand in Northern Botswana s Chobe National Park the situation is reversed hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills they obtain food from 63 of all lion kills 94 When confronted on a kill by lions spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30 100 m 98 328 ft until the lions have finished 95 but they are also bold enough to feed alongside lions and even force the lions off a kill The two species may attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason 96 97 Lion predation can account for up to 71 of hyena deaths in Etosha Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories 98 Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them but will react fearfully to the scent 93 The size of male lions allows them occasionally to confront hyenas in otherwise evenly matched brawls and so to tip the balance in favour of the lions ",
