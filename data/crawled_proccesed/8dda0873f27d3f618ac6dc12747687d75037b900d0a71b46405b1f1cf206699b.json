			"previous": " The 2004 local election saw the party lose control of the two south Wales councils it gained in 1999 Rhondda Cynon Taff and Caerphilly while retaining its stronghold of Gwynedd in the north west The results enabled the party to claim a greater number of ethnic minority councillors than all the other political parties in Wales combined 32 along with gains in authorities such as Cardiff and Swansea where Plaid Cymru representation had been minimal In the European Parliament elections of the same year the party s vote share fell to 17 4 and the reduction in the number of Welsh MEPs saw its representation reduced to one ",
			"after": " In the general election of 5 May 2005 Plaid Cymru lost the Ceredigion seat to the Liberal Democrats this result was a disappointment to Plaid who had hoped to gain Ynys M n Overall therefore Plaid Cymru s Parliamentary representation fell to three seats the lowest number for the party since 1992 The party s share of the vote fell to 12 6 33 ",
