			"after": " Foot binding is the process in which the arch of a woman s feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch 18 These fists of flesh were seen as attractive and arousing for men and the practice was passed down as a prerequisite to marriage from mother to daughter across generations 18 Special shoes were made to accentuate the small size of the women s feet 18 This process was painful and often confined women to their rooms 18 Few lower class women were able to have their feet bound because they needed to be able to walk normally to accomplish house work 18 Bound feet came to be an indication of high class and wealth for women 18 Chinese male reformers during the imperialism period recognized the liberation of the Chinese women as something necessary for their own sake 19 The humiliation that China had gone through on an international level was turned on the Chinese women 19 Naturally the foot binding was recognized as national shame and people found it as a serious problem to be disappeared thus raging anti footbinding campaigns in the 1890s to the 1900s 19 Moreover the new government that came in after the 1911 revolution banned foot binding practice 19 Thus it started to disappear in the coastal areas in 1900 to 1920 19 However the practice was still popular within the interior areas of China till the 1930s and even in the 1950s 19 The practice has been outlawed multiple times since its inception in the 13th century 18 It was finally banned as the Communists came to power around 1949 18 ",
