			"after": " There is evidence to suggest that Wright went to France following his apprenticeship however his eventual destination was Italy 4 It is possible that he arrived in Rome as early as 1642 in the entourage of James Alban Gibbes a scholar of English descent but he was certainly resident there from 1647 Although details of his time there are sketchy his skills and reputation increased so much so that by 1648 he had become a member of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca 11 where he is recorded as Michele Rita pittore inglese 4 At that time the Accademia included numbers of established Italian painters as well as illustrious foreigners including the French Nicolas Poussin and Spaniard Diego Vel zquez On 10 February that year he was elected to the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon a charitable body promoting the Roman Catholic faith through art which hosted an annual exhibition in the Pantheon 6 check quotation syntax Wright was to spend more than ten years in Rome During that time became an accomplished linguist as well as an established art connoisseur 4 He also became prosperous enough to build up a substantial collection of books prints paintings gems and medals including works attributed to Mantegna Michelangelo Raphael Titian and Correggio 11 He acquired some forty paintings perhaps as much through dealing as collecting 6 Richard Symonds the amateur painter and royalist catalogued Wright s collection in the early 1650s and interestingly designated him as Scotus 6 ",
