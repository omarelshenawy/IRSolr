			"previous": " Smooth surfaces equipped with Riemannian metrics are of fundational importance in differential geometry A Riemannian metric endows a surface with notions of geodesic distance angle and area It also gives rise to Gaussian curvature which describes how curved or bent the surface is at each point Curvature is a rigid geometric property in that it is not preserved by general diffeomorphisms of the surface However the famous Gauss Bonnet theorem for closed surfaces states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over the entire surface S is determined by the Euler characteristic ",
			"after": " This result exemplifies the deep relationship between the geometry and topology of surfaces and to a lesser extent higher dimensional manifolds ",
