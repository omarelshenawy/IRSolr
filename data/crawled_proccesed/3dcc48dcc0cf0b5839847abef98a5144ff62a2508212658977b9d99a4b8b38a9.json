			"previous": " Interstate Highways have the highest speed limits and the highest traffic Interstates are numbered in a grid even numbered routes for east west routes with the lowest numbers along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico and odd numbered routes are north south routes with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean Three digit Interstates are generally either beltways or spurs of their parent Interstates for example Interstate 510 is a spur into the city of New Orleans Louisiana and is connected to Interstate 10 ",
