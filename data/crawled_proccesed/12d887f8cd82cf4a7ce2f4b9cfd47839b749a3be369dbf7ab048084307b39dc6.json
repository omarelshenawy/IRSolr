			"previous": "  In thermodynamics the thermal efficiency is a dimensionless performance measure of a device that uses thermal energy such as an internal combustion engine a steam turbine or a steam engine a boiler a furnace or a refrigerator for example In other words efficiency indicates how well an energy conversion or transfer process is accomplished ",
			"after": " From the first law of thermodynamics the energy output cannot exceed the input so When expressed as a percentage the thermal efficiency must be between 0 and 100 Efficiency is typically less than 100 because there are inefficiencies such as friction and heat loss that convert the energy into alternative forms For example a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25 efficiency and a large coal fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46 The largest diesel engine in the world peaks at 51 7 In a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching 60 2 Such a real world value may be used as a figure of merit for the device ",
