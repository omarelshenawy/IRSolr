			"previous": " Beginning with the intense protests over the Stamp Act of 1765 the Americans insisted on the principle of no taxation without representation representation being understood in the context of Parliament directly levying the duty or excise tax and thus by passing the colonial legislatures which had levied taxes on the colonies in the monarch s stead prior to 1763 25 They argued that as the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them Those other British colonies that had assemblies largely agreed with those in the Thirteen Colonies but they were thoroughly controlled by the British Empire and the Royal Navy so protests were hopeless 26 ",
			"after": " Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes Trouble escalated over the tea tax as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea and in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the Boston Tea Party in 1773 Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the Intolerable Acts which among other things greatly restricted self government in the colony of Massachusetts ",
