			"after": " When making observations scientists look through telescopes study images on electronic screens record meter readings and so on Generally on a basic level they can agree on what they see e g the thermometer shows 37 9 degrees C But if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations they may disagree about what they are observing For example before Albert Einstein s general theory of relativity observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space In light of that theory however astronomers will tell you that is actually only two objects one in the center and four different images of the same object around the sides Alternatively if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed they are operating under yet another theory Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory laden 14 ",
