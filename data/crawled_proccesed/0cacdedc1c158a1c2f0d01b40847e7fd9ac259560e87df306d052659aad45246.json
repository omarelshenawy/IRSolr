			"after": " Viruses undergo genetic change by several mechanisms These include a process called antigenic drift where individual bases in the DNA or RNA mutate to other bases Most of these point mutations are silent they do not change the protein that the gene encodes but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs 87 88 Antigenic shift occurs when there is a major change in the genome of the virus This can be a result of recombination or reassortment When this happens with influenza viruses pandemics might result 89 RNA viruses often exist as quasispecies or swarms of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside sequences Such quasispecies are a prime target for natural selection 90 ",
