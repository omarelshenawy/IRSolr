			"after": " The corn crake is a difficult bird to see in its breeding sites usually being hidden by vegetation but will sometimes emerge into the open Occasionally individuals may become very trusting for five consecutive summers an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps and in 1999 a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished 13 In Africa it is more secretive than the African crake and unlike its relative it is rarely seen in the open although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides The corn crake is most active early and late in the day after heavy rain and during light rain Its typical flight is weak and fluttering although less so than that of the African crake For longer flights such as migration it has a steadier stronger action with legs drawn up It walks with a high stepping action and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened It will swim if essential When flushed by a dog it will fly less than 50 m 150 ft frequently landing behind a bush or thicket and then crouch on landing If disturbed in the open this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance with its neck stretched forward then stand upright to watch the intruder When captured it may feign death recovering at once if it sees a way out 12 ",
