			"after": " At hatching a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water Pond type larvae often have a pair of balancers rod like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations The northwestern salamander Ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state a condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult 84 Both of these are able to breed 85 Neoteny occurs when the animal s growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine 86 Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics The tiger salamander Ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out There are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders including species of Necturus Proteus and Amphiuma and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances 87 ",
