			"previous": " In 1981 a Continental DC 10 10 registration number N68048 was leased to conduct more research particularly the effects the newly designed winglets would have on aircraft performance Different types of winglets were tested during that time in conjunction with NASA McDonnell Douglas was again planning new DC 10 versions that could incorporate winglets and more efficient engines developed at the time by Pratt Whitney PW2037 and Rolls Royce RB 211 535F4 The manufacturer finally rationalized all these studies under the MD EEE Ecology Economy Efficiency designation that was later modified to the MD 100 following some more changes The MD 100 was proposed in two versions the Series 10 having an airframe shorter by 6 ft 6 in 1 98 m compared to the DC 10 and seating up to 270 passengers in a mixed class configuration and the Series 20 incorporating a fuselage stretch of 20 ft 6 in 6 25 m over the DC 10 and able to seat up to 333 passengers in the same kind of configuration as the Series 10 Both versions could be powered by the same engine families as the actual MD 11 plus the RB 211 600 However the situation for the manufacturer and the airline industry in general did not look bright No new DC 10 orders were received and many among the observers and customers doubted that the manufacturer would be operating much longer Thus the Board of Directors decided in November 1983 to once again cease all work on the projected new trijet 2 ",
			"after": " The following year no new orders for the DC 10 were received The production line was kept active thanks to earlier orders from the U S Air Force for 60 KC 10A tankers McDonnell Douglas was still convinced that a new derivative for the DC 10 was needed as shown by the second hand market for their Series 30 and the heavier DC 10 30ER version Thus in 1984 a new derivative aircraft version of the DC 10 was designated MD 11 From the very beginning the MD 11X was conceived in two different versions The MD 11X 10 based on a DC 10 30 airframe offered a range of 6 500 nautical miles 12 000 km with passengers That first version would have had a maximum takeoff weight MTOW of 580 000 pounds 260 000 kg and would have used CF6 C2 or PW4000 engines The MD 11X 20 was to have a longer fuselage accommodating up to 331 passengers in a mixed class layout and a range of 6 000 nautical miles 11 000 km 2 ",
