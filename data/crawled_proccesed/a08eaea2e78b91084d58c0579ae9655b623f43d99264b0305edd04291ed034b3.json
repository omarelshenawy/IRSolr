			"previous": " The river and its drainage basin experienced some of the world s greatest known catastrophic floods toward the end of the last ice age The periodic rupturing of ice dams at Glacial Lake Missoula resulted in the Missoula Floods with discharges 10 times the combined flow of all the rivers of the world dozens of times over thousands of years 29 The exact number of floods is unknown but geologists have documented at least 40 evidence suggests that they occurred between about 19 000 and 13 000 years ago 30 ",
			"after": " The floodwaters rushed across eastern Washington creating the channeled scablands which are a complex network of dry canyon like channels or coulees that are often braided and sharply gouged into the basalt rock underlying the region s deep topsoil Numerous flat topped buttes with rich soil stand high above the chaotic scablands 28 31 Constrictions at several places caused the floodwaters to pool into large temporary lakes such as Lake Lewis in which sediments were deposited Water depths have been estimated at 1 250 feet 380 m at Wallula Gap 830 feet 250 m at Bonneville Dam and 400 feet 120 m over modern Portland Oregon 32 Sediments were also deposited when the floodwaters slowed in the broad flats of the Quincy Othello and Pasco Basins 31 The floods periodic inundation of the lower Columbia River Plateau deposited rich sediments 21st century farmers in the Willamette Valley plow fields of fertile Montana soil and clays from Washington s Palouse 33 ",
