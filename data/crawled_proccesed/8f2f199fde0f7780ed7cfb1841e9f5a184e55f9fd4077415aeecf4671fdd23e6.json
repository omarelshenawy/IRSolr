			"after": " The capacitive gap structure consists of sections of line about 2 in length which act as resonators and are coupled end on by gaps in the transmission line It is particularly suitable for planar formats is easily implemented with printed circuit technology and has the advantage of taking up no more space than a plain transmission line would The limitation of this topology is that performance particularly insertion loss deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth and acceptable results are not obtained with a Q less than about 5 A further difficulty with producing low Q designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths The minimum width of gaps like the minimum width of tracks is limited by the resolution of the printing technology 45 53 ",
