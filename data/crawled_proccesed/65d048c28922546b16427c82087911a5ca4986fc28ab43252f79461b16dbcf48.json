			"previous": " Because like Glazunov Shostakovich was still a teenager when he wrote his First Symphony it is only natural that some critics who compare it with Glazunov s First Symphony Just a comparison of both slow movements brings to light the full nature of Shostakovich s achievement The 15 year old Glazunov was immensely musical and articulate However while Shostakovich shows a considerable amount of inner resource Glazunov falls back on the musical procedures of the Nationalists such as Borodin and Rimsky Korsakov While Shostakovich reveals a large debt to the Russian symphonic tradition it is the vital spiritual experience clarification needed being conveyed that stands out not the formulative influences in his style Altogether he shows an imagination and degree of compassion far beyond youthful insight 8 ",
