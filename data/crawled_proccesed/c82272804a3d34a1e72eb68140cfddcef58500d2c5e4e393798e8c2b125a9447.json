			"after": " The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials Heads arms legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled 18 Eight face moulds were most likely used with clay added after assembly to provide individual facial features 19 It is believed that the warriors legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time This would classify the process as assembly line production with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it In those times of tight imperial control each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army Upon completion the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty ",
