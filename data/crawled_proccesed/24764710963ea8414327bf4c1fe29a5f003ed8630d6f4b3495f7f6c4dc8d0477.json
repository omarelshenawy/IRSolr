			"previous": " The F 22 had several design changes from the YF 22 The swept back angle on the wing s leading edge was decreased from 48 to 42 while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and their area decreased by 20 26 To improve pilot visibility the canopy was moved forward 7 inches 18 cm and the engine intakes moved rearward 14 inches 36 cm The shapes of the wing and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics strength and stealth characteristics 27 28 Due to increasing weight during development range and aerodynamic performance were slightly reduced 29 ",
			"after": " The first F 22 an engineering and manufacturing development EMD aircraft named Raptor 4001 was unveiled at Marietta Georgia on 9 April 1997 and first flew on 7 September 1997 30 In 2006 the Raptor s development team composed of over 1 000 contractors and the USAF won the Collier Trophy American aviation s most prestigious award 31 The F 22 was in production for 15 years at a rate of roughly two per month during peak production 32 ",
