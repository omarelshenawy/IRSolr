			"previous": " The Italian Renaissance is said by many to be the golden age of painting roughly spanning the 14th through the mid 17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello Fra Angelico Masaccio Piero della Francesca Andrea Mantegna Filippo Lippi Giorgione Tintoretto Sandro Botticelli Leonardo da Vinci Michelangelo Buonarroti Raphael Giovanni Bellini and Titian took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective the study of human anatomy and proportion and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520 and his great masterpieces including his David Piet Moses Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include Lorenzo Ghiberti Luca Della Robbia Donatello Filippo Brunelleschi Andrea del Verrocchio ",
			"after": " In the 15th and 16th centuries the High Renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as Mannerism In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century the Mannerists sought instability artifice and doubt The unperturbed faces and gestures of Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco In the 17th century among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio Annibale Carracci Artemisia Gentileschi Mattia Preti Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi Subsequently in the 18th century Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo since France was the founding nation of that particular style with artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Canaletto Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused with Antonio Canova s nudes on the idealist aspect of the movement ",
