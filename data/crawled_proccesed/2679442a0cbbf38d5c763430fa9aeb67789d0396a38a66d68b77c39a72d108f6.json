			"after": " A large number of tiles and tile fragments that had lined the floor of the church and some of the monastic buildings were found in the excavations 123 The oldest tiles date from the early 14th century The total area of tiles discovered was about 80 square metres 860 sq ft and is the largest area of a floor of this type to be found in any modern excavation 124 The site has the largest and most varied excavated collection of medieval tiles in the North West and the greatest variety of individual mosaic shapes found anywhere in Britain 125 The tiles found made a pavement forming the floor of the choir of the church and the transepts The chancel floor was probably also tiled these tiles have not survived because the chancel was at a higher level than the rest of the church and the tiles would have been removed during subsequent gardening A dump of tiles to the south of the site of the chapter house suggests that this was also tiled 124 In the 15th century a second tile floor was laid on top of the original floor in the choir where it had become worn 126 The tiles on the original floor were of various shapes forming a mosaic 124 The tiles were all glazed and coloured the main colours being black green and yellow Many of them had been decorated by impressing a wooden stamp into the moist clay before it was fired these are known as line impressed tiles 127 The line impressed designs included masks of lions or other animals rosettes and trefoils 128 Other tiles or tile fragments showed portions of trees foliage birds and inscriptions 129 In the chapels of the north transept the burial place of the Dutton family were tiles depicting mail thought to be part of a military effigy and tiles bearing fragments of heraldic designs 130 The tiles from the upper later pavement were all square and again were line inscribed with patterns forming parts of larger designs 131 A related discovery at the excavation was the kiln in which most of the tiles on the site were fired 132 ",
