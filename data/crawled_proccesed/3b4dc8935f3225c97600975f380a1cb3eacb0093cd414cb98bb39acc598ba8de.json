			"previous": " In 1972 the A300 made its maiden flight and the first production model the A300B2 entered service in 1974 23 though the launch of the A300 was overshadowed by the similarly timed supersonic aircraft Concorde 24 Initially the success of the consortium was poor 25 but orders for the aircraft picked up 26 27 due in part to the marketing skills used by Airbus CEO Bernard Lathi re targeting airlines in America and Asia 28 By 1979 the consortium had 256 orders for A300 24 and Airbus had launched a more advanced aircraft the A310 in the previous year 16 It was the launch of the A320 in 1987 that guaranteed the status of Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market 29 the aircraft had over 400 orders before it first flew compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972 ",
			"after": " The retention of production and engineering assets by the partner companies in effect made Airbus Industrie a sales and marketing company 30 This arrangement led to inefficiencies due to the inherent conflicts of interest that the four partner companies faced they were both GIE shareholders of and subcontractors to the consortium The companies collaborated on development of the Airbus range but guarded the financial details of their own production activities and sought to maximise the transfer prices of their sub assemblies 31 It was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single plane as per its original mission statement it had become a long term brand for the development of further aircraft By the late 1980s work had begun on a pair of new medium sized aircraft the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340 32 33 In the early 1990s the then Airbus CEO Jean Pierson argued that the GIE should be abandoned and Airbus established as a conventional company 34 However the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies as well as legal issues delayed the initiative In December 1998 when it was reported that British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging 35 A rospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion the French company feared the combined BAe DASA which would own 57 9 of Airbus would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50 50 split 36 However the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with Marconi Electronic Systems to become BAE Systems 37 38 39 Then in 2000 three of the four partner companies DaimlerChrysler Aerospace successor to Deutsche Airbus A rospatiale Matra successor to Sud Aviation and CASA merged to form EADS simplifying the process EADS now owned Airbus France Airbus Deutschland and Airbus Espa a and thus 80 of Airbus Industrie 31 40 BAE Systems and EADS transferred their production assets to the new company Airbus SAS in return for shareholdings in that company 31 41 ",
