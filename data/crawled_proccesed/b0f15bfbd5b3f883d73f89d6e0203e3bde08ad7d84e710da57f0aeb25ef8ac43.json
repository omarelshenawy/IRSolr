			"previous": " Paley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with Adolph Zukor of Paramount Pictures who planned to move into radio in response to RCA s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies 11 The deal came to fruition in September 1929 Paramount acquired 49 of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth 3 8 million at the time 7 The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1 1932 for a flat 5 million provided CBS had earned 2 million during 1931 and 1932 11 For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed Paramount Radio but it only lasted a month the 1929 stock market crash sent all stock value tumbling It galvanized Paley and his troops who had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the 2 000 000 in two years This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born 11 The near bankrupt movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932 12 In the first year of Paley s watch CBS s gross earnings more than tripled going from 1 4 million to 4 7 million 13 ",
			"after": " Much of the increase was a result of Paley s second upgrade to the CBS business plan improved affiliate relations There were two types of program at the time sponsored and sustaining i e unsponsored Rival NBC paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran 14 It was onerous for small and medium stations and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs Paley had a different idea designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible 15 he would give the sustaining programs away for free provided the station would run every sponsored show and accept CBS s check for doing so 16 CBS soon had more affiliates than either NBC Red or NBC Blue 17 ",
