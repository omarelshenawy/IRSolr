			"previous": " Several Lockheed 12s were used as technology testbeds The U S National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA bought two adding a center vertical fin to each of them to improve their stability One of the NACA Lockheed 12s was used to test hot wing deicing technology in which hot exhaust air from the engines was ducted through the wing s leading edge to prevent ice accumulation 16 17 ",
			"after": " Three other Lockheed 12s were used to test tricycle landing gear 18 These had their normal landing gear replaced by a non retracting version with a large nosewheel and with the main wheels shifted further back on the engine nacelles 18 The tailwheel from the normal conventional gear was retained 18 The gear was non retractable because there wasn t room within the structure to stow it in retracted position 13 Streamlined fairings were placed on the gear to reduce drag One of the tricycle gear Lockheed 12s went to the U S Navy as the XJO 3 and performed carrier landing tests on the USS Lexington to study the suitability of a twin engined tricycle gear aircraft for carrier operations 17 18 Another went to the U S Army as the C 40B and still another was retained by Lockheed for its own testing both of these were eventually converted back to the normal landing gear configuration 17 18 ",
