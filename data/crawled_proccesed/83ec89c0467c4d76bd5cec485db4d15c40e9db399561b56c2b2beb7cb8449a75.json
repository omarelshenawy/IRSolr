			"after": " In the 333 years that Vasa lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor called Stockholms str m the Stream in Swedish the ship and its contents were subject to several destructive forces first among which were decomposition and erosion Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the beakhead and much of the sterncastle together and this included all of the ship s wooden sculptures Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking and only large objects such as anchors or items made of cast iron such as cannonballs survived Organic materials fared better in the anaerobic conditions and so wood cloth and leather are often in very good condition but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water so that some are barely recognizable 35 Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding Of the human remains most of the soft tissue was quickly consumed by bacteria fish and crustaceans leaving only the bones which were often held together only by clothing although in one case hair nails and brain tissue survived 36 ",
