			"previous": " Existing simultaneously with the image of Boone as a refugee from society was paradoxically the popular portrayal of him as civilization s trailblazer Boone was celebrated as an agent of Manifest Destiny a pathfinder who tamed the wilderness paving the way for the extension of American civilization In 1852 critic Henry Tuckerman dubbed Boone the Columbus of the woods comparing Boone s passage through the Cumberland Gap to Christopher Columbus s voyage to the New World In popular mythology Boone became the first to explore and settle Kentucky opening the way for countless others to follow In fact other Americans had explored and settled Kentucky before Boone as debunkers in the 20th century often pointed out but Boone came to symbolize them all making him what historian Michael Lofaro called the founding father of westward expansion 43 ",
			"after": " In the 19th century when Native Americans were being displaced from their lands and confined on reservations Boone s image was often reshaped into the stereotype of the belligerent Indian hating frontiersman which was then popular In John A McClung s Sketches of Western Adventure 1832 for example Boone was portrayed as longing for the thrilling excitement of savage warfare Boone was transformed in the popular imagination into someone who regarded Indians with contempt and had killed scores of the savages The real Boone disliked bloodshed however According to historian John Bakeless there is no record that Boone ever scalped Indians unlike other frontiersmen of the era Boone once told his son Nathan that he was certain of having killed only one Indian during the battle at Blue Licks although he believed others might have died from his bullets in other battles Even though Boone had lost two sons in wars with Indians he respected Indians and was respected by them In Missouri Boone often went hunting with the very Shawnees who had captured and adopted him decades earlier Some 19th century writers regarded Boone s sympathy for Indians as a character flaw and therefore altered his words to conform to contemporary attitudes 44 ",
