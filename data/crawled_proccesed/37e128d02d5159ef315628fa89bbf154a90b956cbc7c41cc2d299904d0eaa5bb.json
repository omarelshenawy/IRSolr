			"after": " Blade pitch control is a feature of nearly all large modern horizontal axis wind turbines While operating a wind turbine s control system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes Feathering the blades stops the rotor during emergency shutdowns or whenever the wind speed exceeds the maximum rated speed During construction and maintenance of wind turbines the blades are usually feathered to reduce unwanted rotational torque in the event of wind gusts ",
