			"previous": " As with other storks the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar 21 In flapping flight its wingbeats are slow and regular It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched In contrast it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting 22 Moulting has not been extensively studied but appears to take place throughout the year with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season 19 ",
			"after": " Upon hatching the young white stork is partly covered with short sparse whitish down feathers This early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down By three weeks the young bird acquires black scapulars and flight feathers On hatching the chick has pinkish legs which turn to greyish black as it ages Its beak is black with a brownish tip 19 By the time it fledges the juvenile bird s plumage is similar to that of the adult though its black feathers are often tinged with brown and its beak and legs are a duller brownish red or orange The beak is typically orange or red with a darker tip 22 The bills gain the adults red colour the following summer although the black tips persist in some individuals Young storks adopt adult plumage by their second summer 23 ",
