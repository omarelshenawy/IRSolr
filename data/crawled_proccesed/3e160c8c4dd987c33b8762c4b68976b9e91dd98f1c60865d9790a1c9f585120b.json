			"after": " An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules Oxidation is a chemical reaction involving the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals In turn these radicals can start chain reactions When the chain reaction occurs in a cell it can cause damage or death to the cell Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates and inhibit other oxidation reactions They do this by being oxidized themselves so antioxidants are often reducing agents such as thiols ascorbic acid vitamin C or polyphenols 1 ",
