			"previous": " The corn crake is solitary on the wintering grounds where each bird occupies 4 2 4 9 ha 10 4 11 6 acres at one time although the total area used may be double that since an individual may move locally due to flooding plant growth or grass cutting Flocks of up to 40 birds may form on migration sometimes associating with common quails Migration takes place at night and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites 12 The ability to migrate is innate not learned from adults Chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild bred young 27 ",
			"after": " Until 1995 it was assumed that the corn crake is monogamous but it transpires that a male may have a shifting home range and mate with two or more females moving on when laying is almost complete The male s territory can vary from 3 to 51 ha 7 5 126 acres but averages 15 7 ha 39 acres The female has a much smaller range averaging only 5 5 ha 13 5 acres A male will challenge an intruder by calling with his wings drooped and his head pointing forward Usually the stranger moves off if it stays the two birds square up with heads and necks raised and the wings touching the ground They then run around giving the growling call and lunging at each other A real fight may ensue with the birds leaping at each other and pecking and sometimes kicking Females play no part in defending the territory ",
