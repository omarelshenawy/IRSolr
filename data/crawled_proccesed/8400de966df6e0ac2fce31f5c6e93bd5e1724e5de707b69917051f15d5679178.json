			"previous": "  Two straight engines can be similarly joined to provide a U engine  An H engine can be viewed as two flat engines one atop or beside the other The two engines each have their own crankshaft which are then geared together at one end for power take off The H configuration allows the building of multi cylinder engines that are shorter than the alternatives sometimes delivering advantages on aircraft For race car applications there is the disadvantage of a higher centre of gravity not only because one crankshaft is located atop the other but also because the engine must be high enough off the ground to allow clearance underneath for a row of exhaust pipes The power to weight ratio is not as good as simpler configurations employing one crankshaft There is excellent mechanical balance especially desirable and otherwise difficult to achieve in a four cylinder engine 1 ",
