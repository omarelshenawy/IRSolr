			"previous": " Assembly of the first MD 11 began on March 9 1988 and the mating of the fuselage with wings occurred in October that year The first flight was originally planned to occur in March 1989 but numerous problems with the manufacturing delays with suppliers producing essential components and labor industrial actions delayed the ceremonial roll out of the prototype until September of that year The following months were used to prepare the prototype for its maiden flight which finally happened on January 10 1990 The first two aircraft manufactured were intended for FedEx and thus were already fitted with the forward side cargo door They remained with the manufacturer as test aircraft until 1991 before being completely converted to freighters and delivered to their customer FAA certification was achieved on November 8 1990 while the European Joint Aviation Authorities JAA certified the MD 11 on October 17 1991 after approximately 200 separate issues were resolved 2 ",
