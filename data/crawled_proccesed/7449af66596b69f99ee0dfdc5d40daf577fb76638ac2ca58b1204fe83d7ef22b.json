			"previous": " The Anglo Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom Following Lord Carnarvon s successful introduction of federation in Canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the African kingdoms tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa In 1874 Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army The Zulu nation spectacularly defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana Eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the Zulu nation s independence ",
			"after": " The Boer Republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War 1880 1881 using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions The British returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the Second Boer War 1899 1902 but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful ",
