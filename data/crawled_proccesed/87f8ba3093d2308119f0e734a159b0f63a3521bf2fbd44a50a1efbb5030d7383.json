			"previous": " On flowering plants the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem They are thick and decurrent with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and lower leaves on the stem ranging from oblong to oblanceolate and reaching sizes up to 50 cm long and 14 cm across 19 inches long and 5 inches wide 6 7 They become smaller higher up the stem 1 2 and less strongly decurrent down the stem 1 The flowering stem is solid and 2 2 5 cm nearly an inch across and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence 2 usually following damage 8 After flowering and seed release the stem and fruits usually persist in winter 9 drying into dark brown stiff structures of densely packed ovoid shaped and dry seed capsules The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer The plant produces a shallow taproot 7 ",
