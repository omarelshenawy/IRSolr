			"previous": " Anachronox is a turn based role playing game similar in nature to many Japanese role playing video games like Final Fantasy The player controls a party of up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment colloquially known as a field map of futuristic cities space vessels and outdoor areas 2 Players can swap for new party members talk to non player characters and collect and shop for equipment and items When players near an interactive character or item a floating arrow shaped electronic device called the LifeCursor appears which lets the player click on the person or item 2 After a certain point in the story players can travel by shuttle to other planets triggering cutscenes of the shuttle trips Each playable character has a unique skill such as lockpicking which may be used to solve puzzles 2 Some sequences involve minigames such as an unnamed mission in which the player pilots a fighter spaceship to destroy enemies with lasers Certain field maps also feature simple two dimensional minigames including the original games Ox and Bugaboo 2 The protagonist Boots also possesses a camera which the player can use to take screenshots for their own enjoyment or as part of quest objectives 2 ",
