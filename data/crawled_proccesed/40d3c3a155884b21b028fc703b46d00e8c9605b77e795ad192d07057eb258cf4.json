			"after": " The Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927 arose from a disagreement among members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club over the selection of a new captain to succeed the retired Major Arthur Lupton The main issue was whether a professional cricketer should be appointed to the post It was a tradition throughout English county cricket that captains should always be amateurs At Yorkshire a succession of amateur captains held office in the 1920s on the grounds of their supposed leadership qualities although they were not worth their place in the team as cricketers None lasted long after Lupton s departure some members felt it was time to appoint a more accomplished cricketer on a long term basis ",
