			"previous": " In the United States most of these aircraft are privately owned and contracted to government agencies and the National Guard and the U S Marines also maintain fleets of firefighting aircraft On May 10 2004 The U S Forest Service USFS and the Bureau of Land Management BLM announced that they were cancelling contracts with operators of 33 heavy airtankers They cited liability concerns and an inability to safely manage the fleet after the wing failure and resulting crash of a C 130A Hercules in California and a PB4Y 2 in Colorado during the summer of 2002 Both aged aircraft broke up in flight due to catastrophic fatigue cracks at the wing roots After subsequent third party examination and extensive testing of all USFS contracted heavy airtankers three companies were awarded contracts and now maintain a combined fleet of 23 aircraft ",
			"after": " Borate salts used in the past to fight wildfires have been found to sterilize the soil and be toxic to animals so are now prohibited 20 Newer retardants use ammonium sulfate or ammonium polyphosphate with attapulgite clay thickener or diammonium phosphate with a guar gum derivative thickener These are not only less toxic but act as fertilizers to help the regrowth of plants after the fire Fire retardants often contain wetting agents preservatives and rust inhibitors and are colored red with ferric oxide or fugitive color to mark where they have been dropped Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include Fire Trol and Phos Chek ",
