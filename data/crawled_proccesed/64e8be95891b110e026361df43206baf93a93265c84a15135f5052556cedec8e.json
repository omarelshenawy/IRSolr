			"after": " The Glen Rose Formation of central Texas preserves many dinosaur footprints including large three toed theropod prints The most famous of these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City 32 although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature 33 34 It is impossible to say what animal made the prints since no fossil bones have been associated with the trackways However scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus 35 A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus However the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks 36 ",
