			"after": " John Harris is often credited with introducing the now familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English Lexicon Technicum Or A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences Explaining not only the Terms of Art but the Arts Themselves to give its full title Organized alphabetically its content does indeed contain explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences but of the arts and sciences themselves Sir Isaac Newton contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710 Its emphasis was on science and conformably to the broad 18th century understanding of the term science its content extends beyond what would be called science or technology today and includes topics from the humanities and fine arts e g a substantial number from law commerce music and heraldry At about 1 200 pages its scope can be considered as more that of an encyclopedic dictionary than a true encyclopedia Harris himself considered it a dictionary the work is one of the first technical dictionaries in any language citation needed ",
