			"after": " Vasa was built during a time of transition in naval tactics from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organized ship of the line and a focus on victory through superior gunnery Vasa was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers she was supposed to carry but the high sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimized for boarding She was neither the largest ship ever built nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannon of one side 588 pounds 267 kg excluding stormstycken guns used for firing anti personnel ammunition instead of solid shot This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time perhaps in all of northern Europe and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried By comparison USS Constitution a famous Napoleonic era frigate built 169 years after Vasa had roughly the same firepower but was over 700 tonnes heavier 17 ",
