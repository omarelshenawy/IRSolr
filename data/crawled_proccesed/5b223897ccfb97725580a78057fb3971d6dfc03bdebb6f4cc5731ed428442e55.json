			"after": " There are both advantages and disadvantages in P2P networks related to the topic of data backup recovery and availability In a centralized network the system administrators are the only forces controlling the availability of files being shared If the administrators decide to no longer distribute a file they simply have to remove it from their servers and it will no longer be available to users Along with leaving the users powerless in deciding what is distributed throughout the community this makes the entire system vulnerable to threats and requests from the government and other large forces For example YouTube has been pressured by the RIAA MPAA and entertainment industry to filter out copyrighted content Although server client networks are able to monitor and manage content availability they can have more stability in the availability of the content they choose to host A client should not have trouble accessing obscure content that is being shared on a stable centralized network P2P networks however are more unreliable in sharing unpopular files because sharing files in a P2P network requires that at least one node in the network has the requested data and that node must be able to connect to the node requesting the data This requirement is occasionally hard to meet because users may delete or stop sharing data at any point 36 ",
