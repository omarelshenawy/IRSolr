			"previous": " In 1804 Cayley constructed a model glider which was the first modern heavier than air flying machine having the layout of a conventional modern aircraft with an inclined wing towards the front and adjustable tail at the back with both tailplane and fin A movable weight allowed adjustment of the model s centre of gravity 31 ",
			"after": " In 1809 goaded by the farcical antics of his contemporaries see above he began the publication of a landmark three part treatise titled On Aerial Navigation 1809 1810 32 In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem The whole problem is confined within these limits viz to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft thrust lift drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs He also identified and described the importance of the cambered aerofoil dihedral diagonal bracing and drag reduction and contributed to the understanding and design of ornithopters and parachutes ",
