			"after": " The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme thus permitting its subversion or evasion  It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs Claude Shannon proved that the one time pad cipher is unbreakable provided the key material is truly random never reused kept secret from all possible attackers and of equal or greater length than the message 35 Most ciphers apart from the one time pad can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher In such cases effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required i e work factor in Shannon s terms is beyond the ability of any adversary This means it must be shown that no efficient method as opposed to the time consuming brute force method can be found to break the cipher Since no such proof has been found to date the one time pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher ",
