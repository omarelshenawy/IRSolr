			"previous": " Virgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as Southwest Airlines and Ryanair eliminating costs such as included in flight meals and printed tickets in favour of selling food on board and using telephone and internet booking systems It also cut costs in the past by limiting the number of airports serviced and by operating one type of aircraft the Boeing 737 This strategy changed with the introduction of a second type into the fleet The airline ordered 20 Embraer E jets in a mix of six E170s and 14 E190s 9 These were ordered specifically so that the airline could re enter the Sydney Canberra market that it abandoned in 2004 and to fly to less populous areas 9 10 The first E 170 arrived in Australia in September 2007 and by the end of the year the three on initial order had been delivered These were placed on limited frequency services before full scale operations were launched on 4 February 2008 with services from Sydney to Canberra branded as Capital Jet services 9 Mackay in Queensland and the New South Wales regional centres of Port Macquarie and Albury which were promoted with a one cent fare 11 12 The flights to Canberra and the regional centres signified an effort to compete more directly with Qantas and its subsidiary QantasLink operation which flies to all three cities and with independent Regional Express Airlines 9 ",
			"after": " At its inception in 2000 Virgin Blue did not have interline or marketing alliances with other airlines However after the collapse of its domestic competitor Ansett Australia it began a codeshare agreement with United Airlines This allowed United customers to fly from the United States to any of Virgin Blue s Australian destinations that United did not already serve In 2006 in an effort to compete with Qantas Virgin Blue started exploring these relationships forming frequent flyer agreements with Emirates Airline Hawaiian Airlines and Malaysia Airlines Virgin Blue also has an Interline Agreement with Regional Express Airlines for travellers to and from smaller regional centres in the eastern states of Australia and operates its own two routes with Virgin Australia Regional Airlines in Western Australia In November 2007 the airline announced an agreement with Garuda Indonesia offering easy transfer from a domestic Virgin Blue flight to an international Garuda service departing from Perth Melbourne Sydney or Darwin Since then Virgin Blue has also announced an agreement with Vietnam Airlines which allows passengers to fly from Melbourne and Sydney and connect with Vietnam Airlines s destinations through its flight network 13 ",
