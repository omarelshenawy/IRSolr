			"previous": " To calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed The stars provide such a system If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole This point is 90 if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or 90 if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole 107 The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude known as declination The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West if the horizon is flat and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0 The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night see diagram below Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction ",
