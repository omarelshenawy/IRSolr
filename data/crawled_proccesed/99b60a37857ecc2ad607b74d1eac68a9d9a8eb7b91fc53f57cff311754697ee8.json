			"previous": " In England the snail is regularly predated by the song thrush Turdus philomelos which breaks them open on thrush anvils large stones Here fragments accumulate permitting researchers to analyse the snails taken The thrushes hunt by sight and capture selectively those forms which match the habitat least well Snail colonies are found in woodland hedgerows and grassland and the predation determines the proportion of phenotypes morphs found in each colony ",
			"after": " A second kind of selection also operates on the snail whereby certain heterozygotes have a physiological advantage over the homozygotes In addition apostatic selection is likely with the birds preferentially taking the most common morph This is the search pattern effect where a predominantly visual predator persists in targeting the morph which gave a good result even though other morphs are available ",
