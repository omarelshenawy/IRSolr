			"previous": " On March 24 2005 the new wiki was set up under the domain ksh wikipedia org  In September 2004 already a request had been made to create a Wikipedia for Ripuarian languages 4 which spurred a discussion which finally led to the acceptance of the proposal by the Wikimedia Foundations board of trustees two days before chistmass in the same year 5 Although the Wikipedia is dedicated to all Ripuarian languages it was pars pro toto to be created with the identifyer ksh for the wiki and interlanguage links to it That was a SIL code which was later to become an ISO 639 3 code It refers solely to the Colognian language the biggest and best documented 6 Ripuarian variety The ISO 639 joint advisory committee had refused to add ksh to the ISO 639 2 7 and to create a code for the Ripuarian group at that time ",
			"after": " When the new wiki was created on the server cluster of the Wikimedia Foundation under the domain ksh wikipedia org and was going to be used a series of outages of the test website delayed copying content from there Also it was not possible to transfer data directly from one SQL server to the other thus the newly developed page export and import feature of MediaWiki 8 had to be used Several bugs and deficiencies 9 were detected during the process and had to be overcome 10 Since it was not possible to transfer user accounts and passwords a volunteer developed and hosted a dual login web page allowing to supply two username password pairs which were automatically verified against either wiki If successful a public list of user name pairs was updated so the user continuity and proper attribution was guaranteed 11 Towards the end of April 2006 the Wikipedia became eventually usable with page data and its history 12 but cleaning up various remains of the problems left behind by the transition took several more months ",
