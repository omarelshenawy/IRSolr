			"after": " Many but not all maps are drawn to a scale expressed as a ratio such as 1 10 000 meaning that 1 of any unit of measurement on the map corresponds exactly to 10 000 of that same unit on the ground The scale statement may be taken as exact when the region mapped is small enough for the curvature of the Earth to be neglected for example in a town planner s city map Over larger regions where the curvature cannot be ignored we must use map projections from the curved surface of the Earth sphere or ellipsoid to the plane The impossibility of flattening the sphere to the plane implies that no map projection can have constant scale on most projections the best we can achieve is accurate scale on one or two lines not necessarily straight on the projection Thus for map projections we must introduce the concept of point scale which is a function of position and strive to keep its variation within narrow bounds Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for all but the most precise of measurements ",
