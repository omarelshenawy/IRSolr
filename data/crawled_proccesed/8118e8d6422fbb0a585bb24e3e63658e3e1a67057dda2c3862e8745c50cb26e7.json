			"after": " Much of the information we have gathered about the Mausoleum and its structure has come from the Roman polymath Pliny the Elder He wrote some basic facts about the architecture and some dimensions The building was rectangular not square surrounded by a colonnade of thirty six columns There was a pyramidal superstructure receding in twenty four steps to the summit On top there were 4 horse chariots of marble The building was accented with both sculptural friezes and free standing figures The free standing figures were arranged on 5 or 6 different levels 7 We are now able to justify that Pliny s knowledge came from a work written by the architect It is clear that Pliny did not grasp the design of the mausoleum fully which creates problems in recreating the structure He does state many facts which help the reader recreate pieces of the puzzle Other writings by Pausanias Strabo and Vitruvius also help us to gather more information about the Mausoleum 14 ",
