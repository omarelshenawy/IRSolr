			"after": " A ramjet sometimes referred to as a flying stovepipe or an athodyd an abbreviation of aero thermodynamic duct is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine s forward motion to compress incoming air without an axial compressor Ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill A ramjet powered vehicle therefore requires an assisted take off like a rocket assist to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around Mach 3 2 284 mph 3 675 km h This type of engine can operate up to speeds of Mach 6 2 041 7 m s 7 350 km h ",
