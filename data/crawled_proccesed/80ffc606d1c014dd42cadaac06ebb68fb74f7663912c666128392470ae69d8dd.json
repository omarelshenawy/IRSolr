			"after": " Airlines using the 747 400 have accelerated its retirement as at 2015 and are replacing the model with more fuel efficient aircraft The 747 400 s leasing resale and salvage value has dropped steeply because it is relatively expensive to operate In most cases it is being replaced with wide body twin engine aircraft The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point to point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets For example Delta Airlines has reduced the number of flights it operates from the United States to Narita International Airport that are intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia Instead Delta will utilize twin engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at Seattle Tacoma International Airport 25 Total capacity will be cut but consequentially load factors will increase In April 2015 Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747 400 aircraft and replace them either with Airbus A330 aircraft reassigned from cancelled international runs or with new Airbus A350 aircraft now on order That will leave just six 747s flying for the airline in 2015 Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four engine aircraft led to a drag on profits 26 Moreover economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions Since the cost of replacing a 747 400 is high an airline must purchase or lease another wide body some operators choose to fly the 747 400 to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines 27 Several airlines have retired their 747 400 from the trans pacific market Remaining operators in 2014 include Qantas British Airways and United United is retaining its 23 747 400s for now but the airline s deployment of them also reflects a change in emphasis from Asian hubs to domestic hubs meaning that it will have more direct flights from the United States to secondary Asian market cities This may reduce the need for jumbo jets 28 ",
