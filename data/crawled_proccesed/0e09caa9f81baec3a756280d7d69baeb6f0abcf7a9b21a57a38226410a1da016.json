			"previous": " The FB 111A had new electronics known as the SAC Mark IIB avionics suite For the FB 111A the system used an attack radar improved from the F 111A s system along with components that would be used on the F 111D including the inertial navigation system digital computers and multi function displays 118 Armament for the strategic bombing role was the Boeing AGM 69 SRAM short range attack missile two could be carried in the internal weapons bay and four more on the inner underwing pylons Nuclear gravity bombs were also typical FB armament Fuel tanks were often carried on the third non swivelling pylon of each wing The FB 111A had a total weapon load of 35 500 lb 16 100 kg 117 ",
			"after": " Multiple advanced FB 111 strategic bomber designs were proposed by General Dynamics in the 1970s The first design referred to as FB 111G within the company 119 was a larger aircraft with more powerful engines with more payload and range The next was a lengthened FB 111H that featured more powerful General Electric F101 turbofan engines a 12 ft 8 5 in longer fuselage and redesigned fixed intakes The rear landing gear were moved outward so armament could be carried on the fuselage there The FB 111H was offered as an alternative to the B 1A in 1975 119 120 The similar FB 111B C was offered in 1979 without success 121 ",
