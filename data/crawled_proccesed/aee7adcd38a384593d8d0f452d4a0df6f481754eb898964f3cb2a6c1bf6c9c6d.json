			"previous": " Another factor that may have contributed to the relative neglect of creole languages in linguistics is that they do not fit the 19th century neogrammarian tree model for the evolution of languages and its postulated regularity of sound changes these critics including the earliest advocates of the wave model Johannes Schmidt and Hugo Schuchardt the forerunners of modern sociolinguistics This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the comparative method in historical linguistics and in creolistics 12 16 17 ",
			"after": " Because of social political and academic changes brought on by decolonization in the second half of the 20th century creole languages have experienced revivals in the past few decades They are increasingly being used in print and film and in many cases their community prestige has improved dramatically In fact some have been standardized and are used in local schools and universities around the world 12 13 18 At the same time linguists have begun to come to the realization that creole languages are in no way inferior to other languages They now use the term creole or creole language for any language suspected to have undergone creolization terms that now imply no geographic restrictions nor ethnic prejudices ",
