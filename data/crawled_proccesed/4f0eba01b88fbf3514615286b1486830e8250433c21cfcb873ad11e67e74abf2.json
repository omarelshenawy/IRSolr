			"previous": " In response to Barber s letter Preston wrote to Saint Gaudens there are no presses anywhere in mints or in use among silversmiths which can bring up your proposed relief at a single stroke 23 When the models were brought to the Mint Barber examined and rejected them It was only after considerable discussion that he agreed to experiment 24 At that time the Mint was intensely busy generating designs for new coinage for Cuba and the Philippines and Barber was reluctant to waste time on what he considered an experimental piece which would never be coined for circulation 25 Experimental dies were made from the plaster model 24 Approximately 24 pieces were struck as patterns even though the Mint used a medal press set for maximum pressure it still took up to nine strokes of the press to fully bring out the design 18 These patterns are today known as the Ultra High Relief or Extra High Relief pieces and only about 20 are known 26 one sold in a 2005 auction for 2 990 000 27 On May 8 1907 the President wrote Saint Gaudens It has proved hitherto impossible to strike them by one blow which is necessary under the conditions of making coins of the present day 28 On May 11 1907 Saint Gaudens replied I am grieved that the striking of the die did not bring better results Evidently it is no trifling matter to make Greek art conform with modern numismatics 29 ",
			"after": " A second set of dies was produced with the relief reduced somewhat but still proved too high relief for practical coining requiring three strokes of the press to fully bring out the design 30 Saint Gaudens had produced the models for these dies under the misapprehension that the first pieces had been struck on a production press rather than on the Mint s only medal press and therefore only slight adjustment need be made 31 When Saint Gaudens died on August 3 1907 Hering was working on a third model Uncertain where to find Hering Roosevelt ordered the new Secretary of the Treasury George Cortelyou to have the Mint finalize the design and put the coin in circulation by September 1 30 Barber was recalled from his vacation in Ocean Grove New Jersey to comply with the President s order 32 Barber wrote Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis on August 14 that what Roosevelt wanted was impossible he had no dies nor any clear idea of how Saint Gaudens had planned to reduce the relief The Mint chief engraver alleged that he could take no action with respect to the double eagle 30 On September 28 Hering finally appeared at the Mint with a new set of models which Barber again quickly rejected 33 Barber wrote to Preston Upon examination it was found that the relief of the models was so great that it would be a waste of time to make reductions for coinage as it would be quite impossible to coin when the dies are made 34 Instead Barber began work on his own low relief version of Saint Gaudens s design 35 ",
