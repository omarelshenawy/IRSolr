			"previous": " True guns are characterized by long range having a maximum elevation significantly less than 45 a high muzzle velocity and hence a relatively long barrel smooth bore no rifling and a single charge The latter often led to fixed ammunition where the projectile is locked to the cartridge case There is no generally accepted minimum muzzle velocity or barrel length associated with a gun ",
			"after": " Howitzers can fire at maximum elevations at least close to 45 elevations up to about 70 are normal for modern howitzers Howitzers also have a choice of charges meaning that the same elevation angle of fire will achieve a different range depending on the charge used They have rifled bores lower muzzle velocities and shorter barrels than equivalent guns All this means they can deliver fire with a steep angle of descent Because of their multi charge capability their ammunition is mostly separate loading the projectile and propellant are loaded separately ",
