			"after": " Koalas are seasonal breeders and births take place from the middle of spring through the summer to early autumn from October to May Females in oestrus tend to hold their head further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms However males do not appear to recognise these signs and have been observed to mount non oestrous females Because of his much larger size a male can usually force himself on a female mounting her from behind and in extreme cases the male may pull the female out of the tree A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors but will submit to one who is dominant or who is more familiar The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight the intruders off These fights may allow the female to assess who is dominant 77 Older males usually have accumulated scratches scars and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids 78 ",
