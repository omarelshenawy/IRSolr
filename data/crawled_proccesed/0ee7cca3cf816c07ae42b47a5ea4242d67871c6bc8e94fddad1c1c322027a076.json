			"after": " Saul Sternberg 1966 devised an experiment wherein subjects were told to remember a set of unique digits in short term memory Subjects were then given a probe stimulus in the form of a digit from 0 9 The subject then answered as quickly as possible whether the probe was in the previous set of digits or not The size of the initial set of digits determined the reaction time of the subject The idea is that as the size of the set of digits increases the number of processes that need to be completed before a decision can be made increases as well So if the subject has 4 items in short term memory STM then after encoding the information from the probe stimulus the subject needs to compare the probe to each of the 4 items in memory and then make a decision If there were only 2 items in the initial set of digits then only 2 processes would be needed The data from this study found that for each additional item added to the set of digits about 38 milliseconds were added to the response time of the subject This supported the idea that a subject did a serial exhaustive search through memory rather than a serial self terminating search 10 Sternberg 1969 developed a much improved method for dividing reaction time into successive or serial stages called the additive factor method 11 ",
