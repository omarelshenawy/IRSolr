			"previous": " Monastic reform inspired change in the secular church The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX pope 1049 1054 and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century This involved Pope Gregory VII pope 1073 85 and Emperor Henry IV who initially clashed over episcopal appointments a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture clerical marriage and simony The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands but the papacy insisted on the Church s independence from secular lords These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors 247 ",
			"after": " The High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms people sought to participate in new forms of religious life New monastic orders were founded including the Carthusians and the Cistercians The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux d 1153 These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity or to live an Apostolic life 206 Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome Jerusalem and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence 249 ",
