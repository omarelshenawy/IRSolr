			"previous": " The great majority of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme These men were not concentrated in Australian units and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi national bomber crew Five Australian heavy bomber squadrons No 460 No 462 No 463 No 466 and No 467 squadrons were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945 however and the proportion of Australians in these units increased over time 60 No 464 Squadron which was equipped with light bombers was also formed as part of Bomber Command but was transferred to the Second Tactical Air Force in June 1943 where it continued to attack targets in Europe 61 Unlike Canada which concentrated its heavy bomber squadrons into No 6 Group RCAF in 1943 the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units and the Australian Government had little control over how they were used 62 ",
			"after": " Australians took part in all of Bomber Command s major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France 63 The Australian contribution to major raids was often substantial and the Australian squadrons typically provided about 10 percent of the main bomber force during the winter of 1943 44 including during the Battle of Berlin 64 Overall the Australian squadrons in Bomber Command dropped 6 percent of the total weight of bombs dropped by the command during the war 65 Australian aircrew in Bomber Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during World War II Although only two percent of Australians enlisted in the military served with Bomber Command they incurred almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat 3 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner 66 ",
