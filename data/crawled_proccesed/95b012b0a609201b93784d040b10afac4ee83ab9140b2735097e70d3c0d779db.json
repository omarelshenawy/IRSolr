			"previous": " Shipping lines are companies engaged in shipping passengers and cargo often on established routes and schedules Regular scheduled voyages on a set route are called line voyages and vessels passenger or cargo trading on these routes to a timetable are called liners The alternative to liner trade is tramping whereby vessels are notified on an ad hoc basis as to the availability of a cargo to be transported In older usage liner also referred to ships of the line that is line of battle ships but that usage is now rare The term ocean liner has come to be used interchangeably with passenger liner although it can refer to a cargo liner or cargo passenger liner ",
			"after": " Beginning at the advent of the Jet Age where transoceanic ship service declined a gradual transition from passenger ships as mean of transportation to nowadays cruise ships started 3 In order for ocean liners to remain profitable cruise lines have modified some of them to operate on cruise routes such as the Queen Elizabeth 2 and SS France Certain characteristics of older ocean liners made them unsuitable for cruising such as high fuel consumption deep draught preventing them from entering shallow ports and cabins often windowless designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort The Italian Line s SS Michelangelo and SS Raffaello the last ocean liners to be built primarily for crossing the North Atlantic could not be converted economically and had short careers 4 ",
