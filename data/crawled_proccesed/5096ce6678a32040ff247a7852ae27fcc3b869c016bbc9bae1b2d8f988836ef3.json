			"previous": " Special balloting conducted October 18 1785 unanimously elected Franklin the sixth president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania replacing John Dickinson The office of president of Pennsylvania was analogous to the modern position of governor It is not clear why Dickinson had to be replaced with less than two weeks remaining before the regular election Franklin held that office for slightly over three years longer than any other and served the constitutional limit of three full terms Shortly after his initial election he was reelected to a full term on October 29 1785 and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31 1787 Officially his term concluded on November 5 1788 but there is some question regarding the de facto end of his term suggesting that the aging Franklin may not have been actively involved in the day to day operation of the council toward the end of his time in office ",
