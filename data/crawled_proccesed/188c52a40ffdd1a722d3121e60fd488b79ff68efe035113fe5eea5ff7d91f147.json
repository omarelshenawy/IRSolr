			"previous": " In 1871 John Hollingshead commissioned Gilbert to work with Sullivan on a holiday piece for Christmas Thespis or The Gods Grown Old at the Gaiety Theatre Thespis outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety 51 However nothing more came of it at that point and Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways Gilbert worked again with Clay on Happy Arcadia 1872 and with Alfred Cellier on Topsyturveydom 1874 as well as writing several farces operetta libretti extravaganzas fairy comedies adaptations from novels translations from the French and the dramas described above Also in 1874 he published his last contribution for Fun magazine Rosencrantz and Guildenstern after a gap of three years then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner s other publishing interests 52 ",
			"after": " It would be nearly four years after Thespis was produced before the two men worked together again In 1868 Gilbert had published a short comedic sketch libretto in Fun magazine entitled Trial by Jury An Operetta In 1873 Gilbert arranged with the theatrical manager and composer Carl Rosa to expand the piece into a one act libretto Rosa s wife was to sing the role of the plaintiff However Rosa s wife died in childbirth in 1874 Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to Richard D Oyly Carte but Carte could not use the piece at that time By early 1875 Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach s La P richole He contacted Gilbert asked about the piece and suggested Sullivan to set the work Sullivan was enthusiastic and Trial by Jury was composed in a matter of weeks The little piece was a runaway hit outlasting the run of La P richole and being revived at another theatre 53 ",
