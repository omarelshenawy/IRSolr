			"previous": " The American white pelican has increased in numbers 49 with its population estimated at over 157 000 birds in 2005 becoming more numerous east of the continental divide while declining in the west 79 However it is unclear whether its numbers have been affected by exposure to pesticides as it has also suffered from loss of habitat through wetland drainage and competition with recreational use of lakes and rivers 49 ",
			"after": " Great white pelicans range over a large area of Africa and southern Asia The overall trend in numbers is uncertain with a mix of regional populations that are increasing declining stable or unknown but there is no evidence of rapid overall decline and the status of the species is assessed as being of Least Concern Threats include the drainage of wetlands persecution and sport hunting disturbance at the breeding colonies and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals 80 ",
