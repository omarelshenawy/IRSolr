			"previous": " On 15 June 1863 the principal Charles Williams principal 1857 1877 and fellows agreed to renovate the chapel 10 One of the prime movers behind the decision was the vice principal Lewis Gilbertson as part of his unsuccessful attempt to move the college towards Anglo Catholicism 78 The architect George Edmund Street was appointed and had almost free rein in his work In 1863 he said to the bursar that the chapel was so good in style considering its late date that it would be very inadvisable to alter it in any respect save one the old features of the walls and roofing 79 However he later said that the fittings were incongruous with the seats being so thoroughly uncomfortable that kneeling is rendered all but impossible and sitting even is concerted into a sort of penance 79 His work was completed in 1864 at a cost of 1 679 18s 10d n 13 The arch of the chancel was widened and the memorials to Sir Eubule Thelwell and Francis Mansell which had been on each side of the arch were moved to the north wall of the chancel The original Jacobean woodwork was removed with the exception of the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit new seats were installed and new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel A stone reredos was added behind the altar although the design originally submitted by Street was not approved and he was asked to make changes 10 72 The reredos as finally installed has three marble panels a crucifixion scene centre Christ carrying his cross right and Christ on the knees of St Mary left The altar has a slab and six pillars all made from granite 80 ",
			"after": " Views of Street s alterations have differed On 21 October 1864 Building News reported that the restoration was nearing completion and was of a very spirited character It said that the new handsome arch showed the east window to great advantage with other improvements including a handsome reredos and an exceedingly beautiful pavement of marble alabaster and Minton s encaustic tiles 10 Llewellyn Thomas said that there might be two opinions as to the success of the restoration but there was no doubt that widening the arch was a mistake since it has permanently dwarfed the proportions of the building 70 He said that the new woodwork though good of its kind presented too violent a contrast with the ante chapel screen 70 Hardy was also critical calling the work ill considered 1 He complained that the Jacobean woodwork had been sold for too little saying that it had been ruthlessly torn up and sold for a mere song to a passing stranger and described the reredos as somewhat tawdry 68 William Stride writing at about the same time as Hardy said that the beautiful Jacobean interior of the chapel had been destroyed and Oxford had narrowly escaped other irreparable losses 81 Norwich said that the restoration was good in individual details but was sadly damaging to its character and atmosphere 5 ",
