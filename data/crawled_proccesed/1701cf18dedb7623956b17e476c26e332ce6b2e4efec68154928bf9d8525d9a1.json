			"after": " There is no universal consensus on the name for this topographic feature The Metacomet Ridge is described by some sources as a traprock ridge beginning on the Holyoke Range in Belchertown Massachusetts and ending at the Hanging Hills in Meriden Connecticut 4 A 2004 report conducted for the National Park Service extends that definition to include the entire traprock ridgeline from Greenfield Massachusetts to Long Island Sound 1 The Sierra Club has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as The Traprock Ridge 5 Geologically and visually the traprock ridgeline exists as one continuous landscape feature from Belchertown Massachusetts to Branford Connecticut at Long Island Sound a distance of 71 miles 114 km broken only by the river gorges of the Farmington River in northern Connecticut and the Westfield and Connecticut Rivers in Massachusetts 1 3 Until January 2008 the United States Board on Geographic Names USBGN did not recognize Metacomet Ridge Traprock Ridge or any other name although several sub ranges were identified 6 7 Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as the traprock ridge or the traprock mountains or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms 8 Further complicating the matter is the fact that traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern three fourths of the range an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part of the structure of the ridge in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another 35 miles 56 km through Greenfield to nearly the Vermont border 8 9 This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it ",
