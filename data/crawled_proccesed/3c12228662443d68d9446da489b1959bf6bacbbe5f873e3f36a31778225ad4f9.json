			"after": " The conditions for diamond formation to happen in the lithospheric mantle occur at considerable depth corresponding to the requirements of temperature and pressure These depths are estimated between 140 and 190 kilometers 87 and 118 mi though occasionally diamonds have crystallized at depths about 300 kilometers 190 mi 13 The rate at which temperature changes with increasing depth into the Earth varies greatly in different parts of the Earth In particular under oceanic plates the temperature rises more quickly with depth beyond the range required for diamond formation at the depth required The correct combination of temperature and pressure is only found in the thick ancient and stable parts of continental plates where regions of lithosphere known as cratons exist Long residence in the cratonic lithosphere allows diamond crystals to grow larger 13 ",
