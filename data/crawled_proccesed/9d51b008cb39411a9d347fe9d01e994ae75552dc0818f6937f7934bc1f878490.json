			"previous": " Zebu a form of humped cattle were introduced to the island around 1000 CE by settlers from east Africa who also brought sorghum goats possibly Bambara groundnut and other food sources Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture they were eaten only rarely typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals 2 Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted a major part of the pastoralists diet 13 Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo ruled 1575 1612 who is credited with the discovery although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo s time It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period which corresponds with the emergence of complex structured polities in the highlands 2 ",
			"after": " Foods were commonly prepared by boiling in water at first using green bamboo as a vessel and later clay or iron pots 14 roasting over a fire or grilling over hot stones or coals 6 Fermentation was also used to create curds from milk develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey sugar cane juice or other local plants 5 The techniques of sun curing drying smoking and salting were used to preserve various foods for transport trade or future consumption Many foods prepared in these ways such as a smoked dried beef called kitoza ki tuz and salted dried fish are still eaten in a similar form in modern day Madagascar 15 ",
