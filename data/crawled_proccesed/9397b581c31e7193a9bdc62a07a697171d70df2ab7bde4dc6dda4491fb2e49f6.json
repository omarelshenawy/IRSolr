			"previous": " In 2000 Congress approved a federal effort to restore the Everglades named the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan CERP with the objectives of restoration preservation and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water related needs of the region 81 and claiming to be the largest environmental restoration in history It was a controversial plan detractors worried that it relies on uncertain technologies overlooks water quality subsidizes damaging growth and delays its environmental benefits 82 Supporters of the plan included the National Audubon Society who were accused by Friends of the Everglades and the Biodiversity Legal Foundation of prioritizing agricultural and business interests 82 ",
			"after": " CERP projects are designed to capture 1 7 billion US gallons 6 400 000 m3 of fresh water every day store it in underground reservoirs and release the water to areas within 16 counties in South Florida Approximately 35 600 acres 144 km2 of man made wetlands are to be constructed to confine contaminated water before it is released to the Everglades and 240 miles 390 km of canals that divert water away from the Everglades are to be destroyed 83 During the first five years of implementation CERP was responsible for the purchase of 207 000 acres 840 km2 of land at a cost of 1 billion The plan aims to spend 10 5 billion over 30 years combining 50 different projects and giving them 5 year timelines 84 The State of Florida has invested more than 2 billion into restoring the Everglades but the funds have not been matched by the U S government 85 As of June 2008 the U S government has spent only 400 million of the 7 8 billion legislated 86 Initiatives that could aid Everglades restoration include the U S Sugar Land Corp transaction the C 111 spreader canal and the Tamiami Trail bridging These projects are supported by groups such as the Everglades Foundation whose mission is to aid in the efforts of saving America s Everglades for future generations 87 In spite of this Everglades National Park was removed in 2007 from the List of World Heritage in Danger 88 However it was listed again on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2010 89 The National Research Council reported in September 2008 that no CERP projects had been completed and the lack of progress on water deliveries to Everglades National Park is one of the most discouraging stories in Everglades restoration 90 ",
