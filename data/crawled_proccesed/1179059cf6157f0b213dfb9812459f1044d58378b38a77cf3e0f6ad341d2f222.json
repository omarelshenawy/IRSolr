			"after": " Grass is the guinea pig s natural diet Their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter and grow continuously throughout the animal s life 82 Most grass eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy the eating of their own feces 83 However they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately but produce special soft pellets called cecotropes which recycle B vitamins fiber and bacteria required for proper digestion 84 85 The cecotropes or caecal pellets are eaten directly from the anus unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese 54 They share this behaviour with rabbits In geriatric boars or sows the condition is rarer in young ones the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak This creates a condition known as anal impaction which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass 86 The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces ",
