			"after": " Across northern Australia Banksia dentata has been recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to as far south as Cooktown Off the coast it has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands 2 3 as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands 24 It also extends onto the Aru Islands where it is found around Trangan and New Guinea where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby and around Bulolo and Mount Mau 25 It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded 2 Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora 26 ",
