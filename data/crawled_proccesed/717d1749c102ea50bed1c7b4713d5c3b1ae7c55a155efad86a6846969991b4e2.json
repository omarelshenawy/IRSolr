			"after": " Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock soil and water Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth s crust Uranium is also the highest numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements 10 Along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron it is only naturally formed in supernovae 46 The decay of uranium thorium and potassium 40 in the Earth s mantle is thought to be the main source of heat 47 48 that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection which in turn drives plate tectonics ",
