			"previous": " The new palace was known in Catherine s time as the H tel de la Reine and later as the H tel de Soissons The original design was based on the Uffizi palace in Florence but Catherine dropped that idea for a less costly plan after 1576 10 Engravings made by Isra l Silvestre in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the H tel de la Reine possessed a central wing a courtyard and gardens 72 The central wing consisted of three large pavilions with tall pitched roofs In the middle two tall projections decorated with pilasters flanked an arch The walled gardens of the h tel included an aviary a lake with a water jet and long avenues of trees Catherine also installed an orangery that could be dismantled in winter 63 The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant s death in 1582 73 The building was demolished in the 1760s ",
			"after": " All that remains of the H tel de la Reine today is a single Doric column known as the Colonne de l Horoscope which stood in the courtyard 74 It can be seen next to the domed Bourse de Commerce Catherine s biographer Leonie Frieda has called it a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power 75 The staircase inside leads to a platform that can hold three persons and is topped by an iron cage A balcony is thought to have once encircled the top 76 The purpose of the column is not clear but it would have served as a useful observation post Catherine s astrologers may have used it to look at the stars 20 The column also seems to have had a memorial significance 77 Carvings of shattered mirrors torn love knots and the intertwined letters C and H all symbols of Catherine s grief at the loss of her husband are embedded in the fluting 20 ",
