			"previous": " In recent centuries the Mendips like the Cotswolds to the north have been quarried for stone to build the cities of Bath and Bristol as well as smaller towns in Somerset The quarries are now major suppliers of road stone to southern England 80 among them producing around twelve million tonnes of limestone every year employing over two thousand people and turning over approximately 150 million per annum 81 ",
			"after": " There are two main rock types on the Mendips the Devonian sandstones visible around Blackdown and Downhead and the carboniferous limestones which dominate the hills and surround the older rock formations 29 There are nine active quarries and a host of disused sites several of which have been designated as geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest by English Nature Because of the effect quarrying has on the environment and local communities a campaign has been started to halt the creation of any new quarries and to restrict the activities and expansion of the existing ones 82 ",
