			"previous": " Primates show an evolutionary trend towards a reduced snout 65 Technically Old World monkeys are distinguished from New World monkeys by the structure of the nose and from apes by the arrangement of their teeth 64 In New World monkeys the nostrils face sideways in Old World monkeys they face downwards 64 Dental pattern in primates vary considerably although some have lost most of their incisors all retain at least one lower incisor 64 In most strepsirrhines the lower incisors and canines form a toothcomb which is used in grooming and sometimes foraging 64 69 and the first lower premolar is shaped like a canine 69 Old World monkeys have eight premolars compared with 12 in New World monkeys 64 The Old World species are divided into apes and monkeys depending on the number of cusps on their molars apes have five Old World monkeys have four 64 although humans may have four or five 70 The main hominid molar cusp hypocone evolved in early primate history while the cusp of the corresponding primitive lower molar paraconid was lost Prosimians are distinguished by their immobilized upper lips the moist tip of their noses and forward facing lower front teeth ",
			"after": " The evolution of color vision in primates is unique among most eutherian mammals While the remote vertebrate ancestors of the primates possessed three color vision trichromaticism the nocturnal warm blooded mammalian ancestors lost one of three cones in the retina during the Mesozoic era Fish reptiles and birds are therefore trichromatic or tetrachromatic while all mammals with the exception of some primates and marsupials 71 are dichromats or monochromats totally color blind 69 Nocturnal primates such as the night monkeys and bush babies are often monochromatic Catarrhines are routinely trichromatic due to a gene duplication of the red green opsin gene at the base of their lineage 30 to 40 million years ago 69 72 Platyrrhines on the other hand are trichromatic in a few cases only 73 Specifically individual females must be heterozygous for two alleles of the opsin gene red and green located on the same locus of the X chromosome 69 Males therefore can only be dichromatic while females can be either dichromatic or trichromatic Color vision in strepsirrhines is not as well understood however research indicates a range of color vision similar to that found in platyrrhines 69 ",
