			"after": " Uncredited Cast According to the 2002 documentary Darkness at High Noon The Carl Foreman Documents written produced and directed by Lionel Chetwynd Carl Foreman s role in the creation and production of High Noon has been unfairly downplayed over the years in favor of Foreman s former partner and producer Stanley Kramer 5 The documentary was prompted by and based in part on a single spaced 11 page letter that Foreman wrote to film critic Bosley Crowther in April 1952 5 In the letter Foreman asserts that the film began as a four page plot outline about aggression in a western background and telling a motion picture story in the exact time required for the events of the story itself a device used in High Noon 5 An associate of Foreman pointed out similarities between Foreman s outline and the short story The Tin Star by John W Cunningham which led Foreman to purchase the rights to Cunningham s story and proceed with the original outline 5 By the time the documentary aired most of those immediately involved were dead including Kramer Foreman Fred Zinnemann and Cooper Kramer s widow rebuts Foreman s contentions Victor Navasky author of Naming Names and familiar with some of the circumstances surrounding High Noon because of interviews with Kramer s widow among others said the documentary seemed one sided and the problem is it makes a villain out of Stanley Kramer when it was more complicated than that 5 ",
