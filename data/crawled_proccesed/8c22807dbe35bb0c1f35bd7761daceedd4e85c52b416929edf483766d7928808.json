			"previous": " For at least a portion of its life a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core releasing energy that traverses the star s interior and then radiates into outer space Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium were created by stars either via stellar nucleosynthesis during their lifetimes or by supernova nucleosynthesis when stars explode Astronomers can determine the mass age chemical composition and many other properties of a star by observing its spectrum luminosity and motion through space The total mass of a star is the principal determinant in its evolution and eventual fate Other characteristics of a star are determined by its evolutionary history including diameter rotation movement and temperature A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities known as a Hertzsprung Russell diagram H R diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of a star to be determined ",
