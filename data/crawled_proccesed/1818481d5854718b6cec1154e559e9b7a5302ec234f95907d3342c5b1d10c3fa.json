			"previous": " A chronometer is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards Initially the term was used to refer to the marine chronometer a timepiece used to determine longitude by means of celestial navigation a precision firstly achieved by John Harrison More recently the term has also been applied to the chronometer watch a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency COSC ",
			"after": " The most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years 35 and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments Atomic clocks use the spin property of atoms as their basis and since 1967 the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time the second on the properties of caesium atoms SI defines the second as 9 192 631 770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom ",
