			"previous": " A pure rocket is not usually regarded as an aerodyne because it does not depend on the air for its lift and can even fly into space however many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors Rocket powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case ",
			"after": " The forerunner of the fixed wing aircraft is the kite Whereas a fixed wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the wind blowing over its wings to provide lift Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly and were invented in China around 500 BC Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft wind tunnels and computer modelling programs became available ",
