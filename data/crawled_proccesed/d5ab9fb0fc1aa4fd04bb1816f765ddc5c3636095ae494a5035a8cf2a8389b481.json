			"previous": " Amsterdam has a rich architectural history The oldest building in Amsterdam is the Oude Kerk Old Church at the heart of the Wallen consecrated in 1306 89 The oldest wooden building is het Houten Huys 90 at the Begijnhof It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings It is also one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Amsterdam In the 16th century wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones During this period many buildings were constructed in the architectural style of the Renaissance Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their stepped gable fa ades which is the common Dutch Renaissance style Amsterdam quickly developed its own Renaissance architecture These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect Hendrick de Keyser 91 One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the Westerkerk In the 17th century baroque architecture became very popular as it was elsewhere in Europe This roughly coincided with Amsterdam s Golden Age The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were Jacob van Campen Philips Vingboons and Daniel Stalpaert 92 ",
			"after": " Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants houses throughout the city A famous building in baroque style in Amsterdam is the Royal Palace on Dam Square Throughout the 18th century Amsterdam was heavily influenced by French culture This is reflected in the architecture of that period Around 1815 architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo styles 93 Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a neo gothic style At the end of the 19th century the Jugendstil or Art Nouveau style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style The houses in the vicinity of the Museum Square in Amsterdam Oud Zuid are an example of Jugendstil The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the modern era was Art Deco Amsterdam had its own version of the style which was called the Amsterdamse School Whole districts were built this style such as the Rivierenbuurt 94 A notable feature of the fa ades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate with oddly shaped windows and doors ",
