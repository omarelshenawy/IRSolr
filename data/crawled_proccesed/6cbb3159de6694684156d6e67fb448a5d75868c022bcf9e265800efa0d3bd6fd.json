			"previous": " Mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron but is cheaper and more widely available Carbon steel contains 2 0 carbon or less 62 with small amounts of manganese sulfur phosphorus and silicon Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals such as chromium vanadium molybdenum nickel tungsten etc Their alloy content raises their cost and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses One common alloy steel though is stainless steel Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels also termed HSLA or high strength low alloy steels containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost ",
			"after": " Apart from traditional applications iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material lead it is much stronger mechanically The attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph ",
