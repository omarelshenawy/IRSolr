			"previous": " Cuninggim also charged that Stanford s religious policies were inadequate compared to other prominent U S universities Harvey speculated that if Stanford had established a seminary like other prestigious universities its religious studies department and the ethos of the entire institution would be different 5 In 1966 however the Board of Trustees got a court order that allowed them to change the non sectarian clause in Stanford s charter so that they could expand the university s religious program which included permitting sectarian worship services at Stanford Memorial Church 31 ",
			"after": " Stanford did not employ a full time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973 later than most other universities in the U S Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907 and by 1910 he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes Gardner s successor D Elton Trueblood taught classes about the philosophy of religion In 1941 Trueblood s efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion as well as twenty one courses offered by him and four faculty members By 1960 the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion 32 By the mid 1960s the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying enormous success 33 ",
