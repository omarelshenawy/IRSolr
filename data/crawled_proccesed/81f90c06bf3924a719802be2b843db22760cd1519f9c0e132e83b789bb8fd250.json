			"previous": " Earlier copper mining had been small in scale but Elizabeth I concerned for the defence of her kingdom required large quantities of copper for the manufacture of weapons and the strengthening of warships There was the additional advantage for her that the Crown was entitled to royalties on metals extracted from English land 24 The experts in copper mining were German and Elizabeth secured the services of Daniel Hechstetter of Augsburg to whom she granted a licence to search dig try roast and melt all manner of mines and ores of gold silver copper and quicksilver in the Keswick area and elsewhere 24 ",
			"after": " As well as copper a new substance was found extracted and exploited this was variously called wad black lead plumbago or black cauke and is now known as graphite Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral it reduced friction in machinery made a heat resistant glaze for crucibles and when used to line moulds for cannonballs resulted in rounder smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon 25 Later from the second half of the 18th century it was used to make pencils for which Keswick became famous 25 ",
