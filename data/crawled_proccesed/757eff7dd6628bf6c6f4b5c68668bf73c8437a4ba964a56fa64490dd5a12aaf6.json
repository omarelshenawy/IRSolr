			"previous": " In 1997 a piece of mammoth tusk was discovered protruding from the tundra of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia Russia In 1999 this 20 380 year old carcass and 25 tons of surrounding sediment were transported by an Mi 26 heavy lift helicopter to an ice cave in Khatanga The specimen was nicknamed the Jarkov mammoth In October 2000 the careful defrosting operations in this cave began with the use of hair dryers to keep the hair and other soft tissues intact 112 113 ",
			"after": " In 2007 the carcass of a female calf nicknamed Lyuba was discovered near the Yuribey River where it had been buried for 41 800 years 54 114 By cutting a section through a molar and analysing its growth lines they found that the animal had died at the age of one month 61 The mummified calf weighed 50 kg 110 lb was 85 cm 33 in high and 130 cm 51 in in length 115 116 At the time of discovery its eyes and trunk were intact and some fur remained on its body Its organs and skin are very well preserved 117 Lyuba is believed to have been suffocated by mud in a river that its herd was crossing 54 118 After death its body may have been colonised by bacteria that produce lactic acid which pickled it preserving the mammoth in a nearly pristine state 54 ",
