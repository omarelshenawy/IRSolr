			"previous": " During the 1880s Sydney became a prosperous city commerce and industry flourished and the suburbs expanded As more churches were built and fewer people lived in the heart of the city the congregation of St James Church shrank The challenge that it faced was to minister effectively to city workers rather than dwellers to serve the poor of the city and to attract those whose preference was for the style of worship and intellectual topical preaching that distinguished St James from many of the newly created parish churches 40 The young Henry Latimer Jackson from Cambridge was appointed in 1885 He introduced weekday services and a magazine called The Kalendar one of Australia s first parish papers 41 He also lectured at Sydney University addressed conferences spoke at synod and acted as secretary to the newly established Sydney Church of England Boys Grammar School 42 However his sermons were described as not so much opposed as simply not understood 43 He resigned in 1895 after accepting a position in the Diocese of Ely 44 ",
			"after": " Although Sydney was prospering St James had an acute shortage of money and the government considered resuming the site for a city railway 43 45 The trustees at this time leased the parsonage and in 1894 used the money for urgent restoration to the exterior of the building The architect Varney Parkes replaced the old spire using copper that was pre weathered so that there was no radical change in its appearance 46 He removed infilling from the north portico and designed a new portico and entrance to the tower to match that of the eastern vestry The result was to make the north face of the building its most significant aspect 45 ",
