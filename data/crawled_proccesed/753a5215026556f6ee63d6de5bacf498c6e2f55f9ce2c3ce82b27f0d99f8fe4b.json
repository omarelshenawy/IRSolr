			"previous": " Welding can be dangerous and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken However using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding 52 Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame the risk of burns and fire is significant this is why it is classified as a hot work process To prevent injury welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames Additionally the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure Since the 2000s some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light To protect bystanders the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains These curtains made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets 53 ",
			"after": " Welders are often exposed to dangerous gases and particulate matter Processes like flux cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes with smaller particles presenting a greater danger This is because smaller particles have the ability to cross the blood brain barrier Fumes and gases such as carbon dioxide ozone and fumes containing heavy metals can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training 54 Exposure to manganese welding fumes for example even at low levels 0 2 mg m3 may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs liver kidneys or central nervous system 55 Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis 56 The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace 54 ",
