			"after": " The barn owl hunts by flying slowly quartering the ground and hovering over spots that may conceal prey It may also use branches fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings and this is the main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia The bird has long broad wings enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey 26 Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles or their equivalent per night equivalent to about twenty three percent of the bird s bodyweight Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce 35 ",
