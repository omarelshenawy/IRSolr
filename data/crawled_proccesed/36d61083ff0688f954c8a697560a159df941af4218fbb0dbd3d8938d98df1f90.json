			"after": " In typography a glyph has a slightly different definition it is the specific shape design or representation of a character 1 It is a particular graphical representation in a particular typeface of an element of written language which could be a grapheme or part of a grapheme or sometimes several graphemes in combination a composed glyph note 1 If there is more than one allograph of a unit of writing and the choice between them depends on context or on the preference of the author they now have to be treated as separate glyphs because mechanical arrangements have to be available to differentiate between them and to print whichever of them is required The same is true in computing In computing as well as typography the term character refers to a grapheme or grapheme like unit of text as found in natural language writing systems scripts In typography and computing the range of graphemes is broader than in a written language in other ways too a typographical font often has to cope with a range of different languages each of which contribute their own graphemes and it may also be required to print other symbols such as dingbats The range of glyphs required increases correspondingly In summary in typography and computing a glyph is a graphical unit ",
