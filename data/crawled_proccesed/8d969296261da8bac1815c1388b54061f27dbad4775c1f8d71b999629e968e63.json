			"previous": " Terminal velocity is higher for larger creatures and thus potentially more deadly A creature such as a mouse falling at its terminal velocity is much more likely to survive impact with the ground than a human falling at its terminal velocity A small animal such as a cricket impacting at its terminal velocity will probably be unharmed This combined with the relative ratio of limb cross sectional area vs body mass commonly referred to as the Square cube law explains why very small animals can fall from a large height and not be harmed 16 ",
			"after": " The equation for viscous resistance or linear drag is appropriate for objects or particles moving through a fluid at relatively slow speeds where there is no turbulence i e low Reynolds number 17 Note that purely laminar flow only exists up to Re 0 1 under this definition In this case the force of drag is approximately proportional to velocity but opposite in direction The equation for viscous resistance is 18 ",
