			"after": " Electrical power transmission networks are protected and controlled by high voltage breakers The definition of high voltage varies but in power transmission work is usually thought to be 72 5 kV or higher according to a recent definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC High voltage breakers are nearly always solenoid operated with current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers In substations the protective relay scheme can be complex protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground earth fault ",
