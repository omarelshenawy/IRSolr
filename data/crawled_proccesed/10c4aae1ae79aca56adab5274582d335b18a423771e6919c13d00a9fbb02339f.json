			"after": " Ever since its construction the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument 57 A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river 58 The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean Baptiste Tavernier a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665 It was suggested that Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb before it could be built Ruins of blackened marble across the river in Moonlight Garden Mahtab Bagh seemed to support this legend However excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discolored white stones that had turned black 59 A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Moonlight Garden A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen befitting Shah Jahan s obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself 60 ",
