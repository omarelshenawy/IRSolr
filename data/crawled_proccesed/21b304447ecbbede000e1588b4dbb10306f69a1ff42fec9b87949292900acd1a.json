			"previous": " Repairs of the earthquake damage began immediately The church and the Old Chemistry were the only two buildings in the Inner Quad that were repaired 23 The extent of the damage was such that the church had to be completely rebuilt It was dismantled stone by stone which along with the windows were labelled and stored 21 To assure permanence in case of further earthquakes the masonry was anchored to concrete reinforced walls 18 The building s crossing received a tiled hipped roof and an oculus which lit the interior of the church and was added above the renovated dome The original dome had been decorated with a frescoed Victorian interpretation of God s eye complete with tear surrounded by cherubs and shooting star 24 The new dome had a frescoed ceiling decorated with bronze designs as opposed to the gold leaf present before the earthquake 25 A further structural alteration was that the irregular rose window of the facade was replaced by a more regular round arched window like the smaller ones flanking it 20 ",
			"after": " The dedication which was engraved in large letters below the facade mosaic was replaced by a smaller dedication plaque placed at the lower left of the facade 26 The mosaics were restored by Camerino who did not appraise the damage until 1913 He had saved the original drawings in Venice so he removed and re fabricated the chancel mosaic and redesigned the entire exterior mosaic 8 Camerino also donated mosaics to fill the spaces left by the removal of the dedication The tile floor was replaced with cork The Stanford alumni magazine in early 1917 declared the renovation complete stating that the church for almost the first time since it was begun is finished 26 ",
