			"previous": " In the 1960s and 1970s American livestock breed enthusiasts including scientists farmers and historians became increasingly aware of the disappearance of many traditional livestock breeds in the US This awareness was partially due to difficulties encountered in obtaining heritage breeds for living history sites 2 This was particularly evident when historians were searching for historically authentic breeds to display at the Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts and were unable to find sheep of the Vermont strain of Merino as they had gone extinct As a result these historians and others decided to attempt preservation of other rare breeds facing extinction 3 On March 16 1977 the American Minor Breeds Conservancy was incorporated in Vermont 4 It was the first United States organization focused on preserving rare breeds of livestock and promoting genetic diversity among livestock breeds 5 6 and remains the preeminent organization in this field in the United States 7 A similar organization in Great Britain the Rare Breeds Survival Trust had been formed in 1973 8 The organization conducted its first comprehensive survey of American livestock breeds in 1985 Since then the survey has been repeated every five years with the status of endangered breeds being monitored in between 9 The initial survey was called the most comprehensive assessment of livestock genetic resources ever conducted in the United States 10 In 1986 a fellow organization Rare Breeds Canada was formed and the two bodies have worked together closely to preserve and promote breeds that have populations in the US and Canada 11 In 1993 the organization changed its name to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy ALBC 12 In 2013 the organization again shortened its name to The Livestock Conservancy 13 ",
