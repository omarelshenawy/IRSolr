			"previous": " The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard s punched cards to control a mechanical calculator which could use as input the results of preceding computations 157 The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers including sequential control branching and looping It would have been the first mechanical device to be in principle Turing complete The Engine was not a single physical machine but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871 ",
