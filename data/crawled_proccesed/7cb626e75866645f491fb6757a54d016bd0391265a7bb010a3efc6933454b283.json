			"after": " Beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere For example mainland Chile observed DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March with transitions at 24 00 local time 44 The time difference between the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could therefore be five hours during the Northern summer three hours during the Northern winter and four hours a few weeks per year because of mismatch of changing dates ",
