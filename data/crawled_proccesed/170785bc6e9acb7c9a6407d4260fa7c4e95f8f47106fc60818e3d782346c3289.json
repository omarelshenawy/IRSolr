			"after": " The Bread Winners is an 1883 novel by John Hay who was Secretary to the President under Abraham Lincoln and William McKinley s third Secretary of State The book takes an anti labor stance and when published anonymously provoked considerable public speculation over the author s identity Hay wrote his only novel as a reaction to several strikes that affected him and his business interests in the 1870s and early 1880s Originally published in installments in The Century Magazine the book attracted wide interest In the main storyline a wealthy former army captain Arthur Farnham organizes Civil War veterans to keep the peace when the Bread winners a group of lazy and malcontented workers call a violent general strike Hay had left hints as to his identity in the novel and some guessed right but he never acknowledged the book as his and it did not appear with his name on it until after his death in 1905 Hay s hostile view of organized labor was soon seen as outdated and the book is best remembered for its onetime popularity and controversial nature Full article ",
