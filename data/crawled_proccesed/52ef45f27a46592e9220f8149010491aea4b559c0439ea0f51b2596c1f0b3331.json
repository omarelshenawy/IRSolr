			"previous": " Saint Martin uses the euro as its currency while Sint Maarten uses the Netherlands Antillean guilder pegged at 1 79 per United States dollar As a consequence of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles the Netherlands Antillean guilder will cease to be legal tender and be replaced by the Caribbean guilder in the coming years Almost every store on the island also accepts the United States dollar although sometimes a more expensive exchange rate is used even 1 to 1 is no exception ",
			"after": " Neither side of the island is part of the Schengen Area full border checks are performed when traveling between the island and Europe Passport controls are also exercised when taking the ferry from Marigot to Anguilla There are rarely checks at the border between the two sides of the island The Franco Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls requires a working group that has never been set up to harmonize external checks at the two main airports The Dutch side has expressed concern that following tighter French visa requirements would harm their tourism 22 ",
