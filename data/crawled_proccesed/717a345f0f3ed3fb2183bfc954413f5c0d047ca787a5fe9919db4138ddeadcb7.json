			"previous": " At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3 ends of chromosomes 57 These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected 58 In human cells telomeres are usually lengths of single stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence 59 ",
			"after": " These guanine rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four base units rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules Here four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four base units then stack on top of each other to form a stable G quadruplex structure 61 These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four base unit 62 Other structures can also be formed with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases or several different parallel strands each contributing one base to the central structure ",
