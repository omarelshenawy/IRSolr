			"previous": " In many applications the noble gases are used to provide an inert atmosphere Argon is used in the synthesis of air sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds such as reactive intermediates by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures 72 Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography as a filler gas for thermometers and in devices for measuring radiation such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber 61 Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry 60 ",
			"after": " Noble gases are commonly used in lighting because of their lack of chemical reactivity Argon mixed with nitrogen is used as a filler gas for incandescent light bulbs 60 Krypton is used in high performance light bulbs which have higher color temperatures and greater efficiency because it reduces the rate of evaporation of the filament more than argon halogen lamps in particular use krypton mixed with small amounts of compounds of iodine or bromine 60 The noble gases glow in distinctive colors when used inside gas discharge lamps such as neon lights These lights are called after neon but often contain other gases and phosphors which add various hues to the orange red color of neon Xenon is commonly used in xenon arc lamps which due to their nearly continuous spectrum that resembles daylight find application in film projectors and as automobile headlamps 60 ",
