			"previous": " The male calls from near the nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate He may also carry nest material into the nest hole 5 The display and nest building is repeated in autumn The preferred locations for the autumn display are old Eurasian tree sparrow nests particularly those where nestlings had hatched Empty nest boxes and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds such as tits pied flycatchers or common redstarts are rarely used for the autumn display 36 ",
			"after": " The untidy nest is composed of hay grass wool or other material and lined with feathers 30 which improve the thermal insulation 37 A complete nest consists of three layers base lining and dome 36 The typical clutch is five or six eggs rarely more than four in Malaysia 31 white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots small blotches or speckling 38 they are 20 x 14 mm 0 8 x 0 6 in in size and weigh 2 1 g 0 08 oz of which 7 is shell 3 The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12 13 days before the altricial naked chicks hatch and a further 15 18 days elapse before they fledge Two or three broods may be raised each year 3 birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs but the reverse is true for second and third clutches 39 Females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time so within pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs reproductive ability 40 There is a significant level of promiscuity in a Hungarian study more than 9 of chicks were sired by extra pair males and 20 of the broods contained at least one extra pair young 41 ",
