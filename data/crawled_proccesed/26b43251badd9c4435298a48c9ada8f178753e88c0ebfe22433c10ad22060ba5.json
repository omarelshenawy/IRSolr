			"after": " Interstate Highways and U S Routes are assigned at the national level Interstate Highways are numbered in a grid even numbered routes are east west routes but the lowest numbers are along Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico and odd numbered routes are north south routes with the lowest numbers along the Pacific Ocean U S Routes are also numbered in a grid even numbered for east west routes with the lowest numbers along Canada and odd numbered for north south routes with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean For this reason mainline two digit Interstate Highways in New York all have numbers above 78 and mainline U S Routes with the exception of US 44 and US 62 all have numbers below 20 Three digit Interstate and U S Highways also known as child routes are branches off their main one or two digit parents The majority of Interstate and U S Highways are maintained by NYSDOT ",
