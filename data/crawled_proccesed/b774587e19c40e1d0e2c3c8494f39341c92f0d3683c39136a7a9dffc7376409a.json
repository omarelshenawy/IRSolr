			"previous": " Modes are numbered according to the number of half wavelengths in the vibration Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction such as drumhead mode which has two and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number When the vibration is in one of the higher modes there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion For some types of resonator this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response In figure 5 some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes The modes shown are 5a the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end 5b the first torsional mode 5c the second torsional mode 5d the second flexural mode 5e first radial expansion mode and 5f first radially symmetric drumhead mode 33 ",
