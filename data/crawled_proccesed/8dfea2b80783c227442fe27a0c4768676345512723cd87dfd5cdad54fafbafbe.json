			"previous": " The word lesbian is derived from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos home to the 6th century BCE poet Sappho 1 From various ancient writings historians gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho s charge for their instruction or cultural edification 4 Little of Sappho s poetry remains but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about women s daily lives their relationships and rituals She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls 5 Before the late 19th century the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos including a type of wine note 1 ",
			"after": " In Algernon Charles Swinburne s 1866 poem Sapphics the term lesbian appears twice but capitalized both times after twice mentioning the island of Lesbos and so could be construed to mean from the island of Lesbos 6 In 1875 George Saintsbury in writing about Baudelaire s poetry refers to his Lesbian studies in which he includes his poem about the passion of Delphine which is a poem simply about love between two women which does not mention the island of Lesbos though the other poem alluded to entitled Lesbos does 7 Lesbianism to describe erotic relationships between women had been documented in 1870 8 In 1890 the term lesbian was used in a medical dictionary as an adjective to describe tribadism as lesbian love The terms lesbian invert and homosexual were interchangeable with sapphist and sapphism around the turn of the 20th century 8 The use of lesbian in medical literature became prominent by 1925 the word was recorded as a noun to mean the female equivalent of a sodomite 8 9 ",
