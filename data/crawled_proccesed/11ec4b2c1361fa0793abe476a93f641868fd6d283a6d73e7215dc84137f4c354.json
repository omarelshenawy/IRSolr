			"previous": " Unlike Darwin Alfred Russel Wallace influenced by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when he began his career as a naturalist By 1855 his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species Like Darwin it was Wallace s consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection In February 1858 Wallace unaware of Darwin s unpublished ideas composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin asking for his opinion The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin s 1844 essay along with Wallace s letter Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species 79 ",
