			"previous": " Ailanthus produces an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone which inhibits the growth of other plants 34 The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots but are also present in the leaves wood and seeds of the plant One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50 of a sample of garden cress Lepidium sativum seeds from germinating The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress redroot pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti yellow bristlegrass Setaria pumila barnyard grass Echinochloa crusgalli pea Pisum sativum cv Sugar Snap and maize Zea mays cv Silver Queen It proved able to kill nearly 100 of seedlings with the exception of velvetleaf which showed some resistance 35 Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers with the white ash Fraxinus americana being the only plant not adversely affected 36 The chemical does not however affect the tree of heaven s own seedlings indicating that A altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity 34 Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts 37 ",
