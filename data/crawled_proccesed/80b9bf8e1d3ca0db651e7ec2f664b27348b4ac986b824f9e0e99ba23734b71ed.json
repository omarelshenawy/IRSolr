			"after": " Food at various stages of digestion has been found in the intestines of several woolly mammoths giving a good picture of their diet Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food mainly grass and sedges which were supplemented with herbaceous plants flowering plants shrubs mosses and tree matter The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth like modern elephants An adult of six tonnes would need to eat 180 kg 397 lb daily and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day The two fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age Quaternary glaciation 2 58 million years ago to present by wrapping around them whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts delicately picking buds and flowers and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present The Yukagir mammoth had ingested plant matter that contained spores of dung fungus 51 Isotope analysis shows that woolly mammoths fed mainly on C3 plants unlike horses and rhinos 52 ",
