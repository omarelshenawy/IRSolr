			"previous": " In 2009 the decisions to construct Sweden s two largest scientific installations the synchrotron radiation facility MAX IV and the European Spallation Source were taken 191 192 Both installations will be built in Lund The European Spallation Source costing some SEK 14 billion to construct 193 will be operational in 2019 and will give an approximately 30 times stronger neutron beam than any of today s existing neutron source installations 194 The MAX IV costing some SEK 3 billion will be operational in 2015 Both facilities have strong implications on material research ",
			"after": " In the 18th century Sweden s scientific revolution took off Previously technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe  In 1739 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was founded with people such as Carolus Linnaeus and Anders Celsius as early members Many of the companies founded by early pioneers still remain major international brands Gustaf Dal n founded AGA and received the Nobel Prize for his sun valve Alfred Nobel invented dynamite and instituted the Nobel Prizes Lars Magnus Ericsson started the company bearing his name Ericsson still one of the largest telecom companies in the world Jonas Wenstr m was an early pioneer in alternating current and is along with Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla credited as one of the inventors of the three phase electrical system 195 ",
