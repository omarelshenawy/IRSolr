			"previous": " Both France and Germany reorganised the programme including steps such the adoption of fixed term contracts which placed greater financial risk upon the private firms involved Thomson CSF also took over the majority of the Tiger s electronic development work such as the visual systems and sensors 2 Despite the early development problems and the political uncertainty between 1984 and 1986 the program was formally relaunched in November 1987 it was at this point that a greater emphasis on the attack helicopter s anti tank capabilities came about 3 Much of the project s organisational framework was rapidly redeveloped between 1987 and 1989 such as the installation of a Franco German Helicopter Office to act as a program executive agency in May 1989 4 ",
			"after": " In November 1989 Eurocopter signed an agreement that financially secured the majority of the helicopter s development through to serial production including arrangements for two assembly lines to be built at Aerospatiale s Marignane plane and MBB s Donauw rth facility 5 This same arrangement also included the manufacture of five Tiger prototypes 5 Three were to operate as unarmed testbeds and the other two as armed combat prototypes with one for the French escort helicopter variant and the other for the German anti tank variant The first prototype took the Tiger s maiden flight on 27 April 1991 that lasted for 30 minutes 5 ",
