			"previous": " Soon however Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self declaration of Vice in medieval drama At the same time Richard s vivid self awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare s mature plays 145 No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles 146 By the time of Romeo and Juliet Richard II and A Midsummer Night s Dream in the mid 1590s Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself ",
			"after": " Shakespeare s standard poetic form was blank verse composed in iambic pentameter In practice this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line spoken with a stress on every second syllable The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones It is often beautiful but its sentences tend to start pause and finish at the end of lines with the risk of monotony 148 Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse he began to interrupt and vary its flow This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet Shakespeare uses it for example to convey the turmoil in Hamlet s mind 149 ",
