			"previous": " In 1823 she discovered a second even more complete plesiosaur skeleton the first one had been missing the skull When Conybeare presented his analysis of plesiosaur anatomy to a meeting of the Geological Society in 1824 he again failed to mention Anning by name even though she had collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation Conybeare s presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles 57 58 ",
			"after": " Conybeare s presentation followed the resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy of one of the fossils The fact that the plesiosaur s long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning s drawings of the second skeleton and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th century fossil collectors and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning s ability to sell fossils to other geologists Cuvier s accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824 which after some debate had concluded the skeleton was legitimate Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken 59 ",
