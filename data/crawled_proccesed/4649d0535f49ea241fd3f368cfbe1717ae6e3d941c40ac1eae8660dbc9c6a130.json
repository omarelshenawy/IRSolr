			"previous": " At the very beginning of the 20th century the Carrossier Normand was considered the best carriage horses available 4 The arrival of automobiles and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses coincided with a split in the breed A distinction was made between the lighter faster horses in the breed used for sport and larger horses used for agricultural work The lighter horses eventually became the French Trotter for driving and Anglo Norman for riding and cavalry while the heavier horses became the Norman Cob 20 In 1912 when French horse populations were at their highest there were 422 stallions at the Saint Lo stud mainly cobs and trotters 10 When the original Carrossier Normand became extinct in the 1920s breeding focused on the two remaining types 9 with the Norman Cob continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo Norman being used to create the Selle Francais the national French sport horse 20 ",
			"after": " In the regions of Saint Lo and Cotentin the Norman Cob was widespread in agricultural uses until 1950 and the population continued to increase in the first half of the 20th century even through the occupation during World War II 21 Even the Percheron which was internationally recognized as the Norman draft horse was not as popular in the homeland of the Norman Cob breed 8 In 1945 Norman Cob stallions accounted for 40 of the conscripted horses 21 and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed 23 ",
