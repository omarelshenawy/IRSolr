			"after": " Mary Cassatt s brother Alexander Cassatt was president of the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1899 until his death in 1906 She was shaken as they had been close but she continued to be very productive in the years leading up to 1910 64 An increasing sentimentality is apparent in her work of the 1900s her work was popular with the public and the critics but she was no longer breaking new ground and her Impressionist colleagues who once provided stimulation and criticism were dying off She was hostile to such new developments in art as post Impressionism Fauvism and Cubism 65 Two of her works appeared in the Armory Show of 1913 both images of a mother and child 66 ",
