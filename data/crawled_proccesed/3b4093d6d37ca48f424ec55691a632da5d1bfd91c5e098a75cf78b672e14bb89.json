			"previous": " In 1991 MD 11 was not quite a success ongoing tests of the MD 11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft s performance An important prospective carrier Singapore Airlines SIA required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris against strong headwinds during mid winter the MD 11 did not have sufficient range for this at the time 59 Due to the less than expected performance figures SIA cancelled its 20 aircraft MD 11 order on 2 August 1991 and ordered 20 A340 300s instead 60 ",
			"after": " In 1992 McDonnell Douglas unveiled a study of a double deck jumbo sized aircraft designated MD 12 35 61 Despite briefly leaving the market the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft 62 and the study quickly sank without a trace A similar double deck concept was used in Boeing s later Ultra Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747 63 64 but ultimately the double deck concept would not see the light of day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s 65 66 ",
