			"previous": " Unlike the fixed stars the Sun changes its position on the celestial sphere being at a positive declination in spring and summer and at a negative declination in autumn and winter and having exactly zero declination i e being on the celestial equator at the equinoxes The Sun s celestial longitude also varies changing by one complete revolution per year The path of the Sun on the celestial sphere is called the ecliptic The ecliptic passes through the twelve constellations of the zodiac in the course of a year citation needed ",
			"after": " This model of the Sun s motion helps to understand sundials If the shadow casting gnomon is aligned with the celestial poles its shadow will revolve at a constant rate and this rotation will not change with the seasons This is the most common design In such cases the same hour lines may be used throughout the year The hour lines will be spaced uniformly if the surface receiving the shadow is either perpendicular as in the equatorial sundial or circular about the gnomon as in the armillary sphere citation needed ",
