			"after": " In 1845 Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarisation of linearly polarised light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric an effect now known as Faraday rotation 30 This was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines 30 Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high frequency electromagnetic vibration which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether ",
