			"after": " The W 2 was basically a larger version of Whittle s original flying design the Whittle Supercharger Type W 1 or simply W 1 which flew in 1941 in the Gloster E 28 39 experimental testbed aircraft The engines used a single double sided centrifugal compressor or impeller with the compressed air being taken off at several ports around the extreme outer edge of the compressor disk They both used Whittle s reverse flow design in which the flame cans combustion chambers were placed around the turbine to produce a shorter engine This required the heated air to flow forward before reversing its direction to pass through the single stage axial flow turbine For the W 2 the impeller was 19 inches 480 mm in diameter and there were ten flame cans Air was bled from the compressor and fed into the inner portion of the turbine for cooling The entire engine weighed about 850 pounds 390 kilograms ",
