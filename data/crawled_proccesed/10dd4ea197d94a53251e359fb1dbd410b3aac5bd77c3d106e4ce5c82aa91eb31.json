			"previous": " In 1985 the combination of the Mac Apple s LaserWriter printer and Mac specific software like Boston Software s MacPublisher and Aldus PageMaker enabled users to design preview and print page layouts complete with text and graphics an activity to become known as desktop publishing Initially desktop publishing was unique to the Macintosh but eventually became available for other platforms 47 Later applications such as Macromedia FreeHand QuarkXPress and Adobe s Photoshop and Illustrator strengthened the Mac s position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market ",
			"after": " The Macintosh s minimal memory became apparent even compared with other personal computers in 1984 and could not be expanded easily It also lacked a hard disk drive or the means to easily attach one Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 KB or removing the computer s 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger capacity chips a tedious operation that was not always successful In October 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh 512K with quadruple the memory of the original at a price of US 3 195 48 It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logic board ",
