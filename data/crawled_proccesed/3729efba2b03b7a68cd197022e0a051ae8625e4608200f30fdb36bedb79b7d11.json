			"previous": " Ultrasound inspection of welded joints has been an alternative to radiography for non destructive testing since the 1960s Ultrasonic inspection eliminates the use of ionizing radiation with safety and cost benefits Ultrasound can also provide additional information such as the depth of flaws in a welded joint Ultrasonic inspection has progressed from manual methods to computerized systems that automate much of the process An ultrasonic test of a joint can identify the existence of flaws measure their size and identify their location Not all welded materials are equally amenable to ultrasonic inspection some materials have a large grain size that produces a high level of background noise in measurements 19 ",
