			"previous": " As a result the B 17s loss rate was up to 25 on some early missions 60 of 291 B 17s were lost in combat on the second Raid on Schweinfurt 121 and it was not until the advent of long range fighter escorts particularly the North American P 51 Mustang resulting in the degradation of the Luftwaffe as an effective interceptor force between February and June 1944 that the B 17 became strategically potent ",
			"after": " The B 17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage still reach its target and bring its crew home safely Wally Hoffman a B 17 pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War II said The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home 122 Martin Caidin reported one instance in which a B 17 suffered a mid air collision with a Focke Wulf Fw 190 losing an engine and suffering serious damage to both the starboard horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer and being knocked out of formation by the impact The B 17 was reported as shot down by observers but it survived and brought its crew home without injury 123 Its toughness was compensation for its shorter range and lighter bomb load compared to the B 24 and British Avro Lancaster heavy bombers clarification needed Stories abound of B 17s returning to base with tails having been destroyed with only a single engine functioning or even with large portions of wings having been damaged by flak 124 This durability together with the large operational numbers in the Eighth Air Force and the fame achieved by the Memphis Belle made the B 17 a key bomber aircraft of the war Other factors such as combat effectiveness and political issues also contributed to the B 17 s success 125 ",
