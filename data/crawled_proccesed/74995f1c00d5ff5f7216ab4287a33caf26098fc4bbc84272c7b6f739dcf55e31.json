			"after": " The fruit body of Lactifluus volemus has a fleshy and firm cap with a velvety or smooth surface and a shape that changes with maturity it starts off convex with edges curved inwards then later grows flat with a depression in the middle With a typical diameter of 5 to 11 cm 2 4 1 2 in its colour ranges from apricot to tawny 30 The cap colouration however is somewhat variable as has been noted in Asian 3 European 31 and North American specimens 2 The stem whose height varies between 4 and 12 cm 1 1 2 and 5 in and which is typically between 1 and 1 5 cm 0 4 and 0 6 in thick has a slightly lighter colouration than the cap It is firm with a velvety or smooth surface that sometimes has depressions running longitudinally up and down its length The gills are adnate to slightly decurrent brittle narrow quite closely spaced and sometimes forked Normally a pale golden yellow colour the gills turn brown when bruised Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae short gills that do not extend to the stem The flesh is whitish and firm The mushroom smells somewhat fishy 30 one source suggests the odour is like a dead shad which anglers will tell you is probably the most malodorous freshwater fish 32 The odour is concentrated when the fruit bodies are dried One of the mushroom s most distinctive features is the abundant latex so plentiful that a small nick on the gills will cause it to weep the milky substance 18 The latex tends to impart brown stains on whatever it contacts 32 ",
