			"previous": " When examining Sue paleontologist Pete Larson found a broken and healed fibula and tail vertebrae scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus embedded in a neck vertebra If correct these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether it would have been competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear 136 However further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries or simply damage to the fossil after death and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict 124 Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators In this light scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators 132 although they may have had a hard time finding enough meat to scavenge being outnumbered by smaller theropods 137 Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores ",
			"after": " Tyrannosaurus may have had infectious saliva used to kill its prey This theory was first proposed by William Abler 138 Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have However Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor s teeth which are rounded 139 All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria so the prospect of it being used as a method of predation is disputable ",
