			"previous": " Studies have shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between urban population density and energy consumption per capita and that public transport could facilitate increased urban population densities and thus reduce travel distances and fossil fuel consumption 42 ",
			"after": " Supporters of the green movement usually advocate public transportation because it offers decreased airborne pollution compared to automobiles A study conducted in Milan Italy in 2004 during and after a transportation strike serves to illustrate the impact that mass transportation has on the environment Air samples were taken between 2 and 9 January and then tested for Methane Carbon Monoxide non methane Hydrocarbons NMHCs and other gases identified as harmful to the environment The figure below is a computer simulation showing the results of the study with 2 January showing the lowest concentrations as a result of decreased activity in the city during the holiday season 9 January showed the highest NMHC concentrations because of increased vehicular activity in the city due to a public transportation strike 43 ",
