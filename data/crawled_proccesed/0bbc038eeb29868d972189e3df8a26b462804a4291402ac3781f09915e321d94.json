			"previous": " Although the 1900 UK general election also known as the Khaki election had resulted in a victory for the Conservative government on the back of recent British victories against the Boers public support quickly waned as it became apparent that the war would not be easy and further unease developed following reports about the treatment by the British army of the Boer civilians Public and political opposition to government policies in South Africa regarding Boer civilians was first expressed in Parliament in February 1901 in the form of an attack on the policy the government and the army by the radical Liberal MP David Lloyd George ",
			"after": " Emily Hobhouse a delegate of the South African Women and Children s Distress Fund visited some of the camps in the Orange Free State from January 1901 and in May 1901 she returned to England on board the ship the Saxon Alfred Milner High Commissioner in South Africa also boarded the Saxon for holiday in England but unfortunately for both the camp internees and the British government he had no time for Miss Hobhouse regarding her as a Boer sympathiser and trouble maker 49 On her return Emily Hobhouse did much to publicise the distress of the camp inmates She managed to speak to the Liberal Party leader Henry Campbell Bannerman who professed to be suitably outraged but was disinclined to press the matter as his party was split between the imperialists and the pro Boer factions ",
