			"after": " B telmatiaea is a fairly secure species as most populations are of more than 100 plants and 26 of known plants are in conservation reserves Its proximity to Perth suggests that land clearing for urban development could pose a threat and in 1988 The Banksia Atlas recommended that the species should continue to be monitored since land clearing could change the situation greatly particularly amongst its northern populations It is also known to be susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi a soil borne water mould that causes root rot 25 in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it used as an indicator species for the presence of the disease 26 An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction but under less severe change scenarios the distribution may actually grow depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas 27 ",
