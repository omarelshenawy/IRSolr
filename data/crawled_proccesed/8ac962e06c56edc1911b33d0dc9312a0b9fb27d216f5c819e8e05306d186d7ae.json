			"previous": " Historic timber frame construction in England and the rest of the United Kingdom showed regional variation 31 which has been divided into eastern school western school and the northern school although the characteristic types of framing in these schools can be found in the other regions except the northern school 32 A characteristic of the eastern school is close studding which is a half timbering style of many studs spaced about the width of the studs apart for example six inch studs spaced six inches apart until the middle of the 16th century and sometimes wider spacing after that time Close studding was an elite style found mostly on expensive buildings A principal style of the western school is the use of square panels of roughly equal size and decorative framing utilizing many shapes such as lozenges stars crosses quatrefoils cusps and many other shapes 32 The northern school sometimes used posts which landed on the foundation rather than on a sill beam the sill joining to the sides of the posts and called an interrupted sill Another northern style was to use close studding but in a herring bone or chevron pattern 32 ",
