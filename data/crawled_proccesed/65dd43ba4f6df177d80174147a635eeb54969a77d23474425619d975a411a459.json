			"after": " In the colonies of a few ant species there are physical castes workers in distinct size classes called minor median and major workers Often the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads and correspondingly stronger mandibles Such individuals are sometimes called soldier ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting although they still are workers and their duties typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers In a few species the median workers are absent creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors 43 Weaver ants for example have a distinct bimodal size distribution 44 45 Some other species show continuous variation in the size of workers The smallest and largest workers in Pheidologeton diversus show nearly a 500 fold difference in their dry weights 46 Workers cannot mate however because of the haplodiploid sex determination system in ants workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile haploid males The role of workers may change with their age and in some species such as honeypot ants young workers are fed until their gasters are distended and act as living food storage vessels These food storage workers are called repletes 47 For instance these replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus Rissing found that usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes and if repletes are removed from the colony other workers become repletes demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism 48 This polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths however genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in Acromyrmex sp 49 These polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes differences in a single gene of Solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens 50 The Australian jack jumper ant Myrmecia pilosula has only a single pair of chromosomes with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid the lowest number known for any animal making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects 51 52 ",
