			"after": " Galileo s theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies along with the largely independent work of Kepler and Ren Descartes was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by Sir Isaac Newton Galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums It is popularly believed thanks to the biography by Vincenzo Viviani that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa using his pulse as a timer Later experiments are described in his Two New Sciences Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is isochronous i e that its swings always take the same amount of time independently of the amplitude In fact this is only approximately true 123 as was discovered by Christiaan Huygens Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum Galileo s son Vincenzo sketched a clock based on his father s theories in 1642 The clock was never built and because of the large swings required by its verge escapement would have been a poor timekeeper See Technology above ",
