			"previous": " Portable foghorns powered by compressed gas from aerosol cans are used as goal horns in ice hockey  Fog signals have also been used on railway lines since the middle of the 19th century to indicate to the driver of a moving train that a broken down train a work party or some other unforeseen hazard is on the line ahead Small explosive detonators or torpedoes are placed on the track and detonated by the pressure of the wheels of the oncoming train The loud report of the explosion provides the indication to the driver that in most cases requires the train to be stopped immediately During World War II these devices were modified to detonate demolition charges during railroad sabotage operations ",
