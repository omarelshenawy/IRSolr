			"previous": " Mining exists in many countries London is known as the capital of global mining houses such as Rio Tinto Group BHP Billiton and Anglo American PLC 39 The US mining industry is also large but it is dominated by the coal and other nonmetal minerals e g rock and sand and various regulations have worked to reduce the significance of mining in the United States 39 In 2007 the total market capitalization of mining companies was reported at US 962 billion which compares to a total global market cap of publicly traded companies of about US 50 trillion in 2007 40 In 2002 Chile and Peru were reportedly the major mining countries of South America 41 The mineral industry of Africa includes the mining of various minerals it produces relatively little of the industrial metals copper lead and zinc but according to one estimate has as a percent of world reserves 40 of gold 60 of cobalt and 90 of the world s platinum group metals 42 Mining in India is a significant part of that country s economy In the developed world mining in Australia with BHP Billiton founded and headquartered in the country and mining in Canada are particularly significant For rare earth minerals mining China reportedly controlled 95 of production in 2013 43 ",
			"after": " While exploration and mining can be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small businesses most modern day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish Consequently the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large often multinational companies most of them publicly listed It can be argued that what is referred to as the mining industry is actually two sectors one specializing in exploration for new resources and the other in mining those resources The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies called juniors which are dependent on venture capital The mining sector is made up of large multinational companies that are sustained by production from their mining operations Various other industries such as equipment manufacture environmental testing and metallurgy analysis rely on and support the mining industry throughout the world Canadian stock exchanges have a particular focus on mining companies particularly junior exploration companies through Toronto sTSX Venture Exchange Canadian companies raise capital on these exchanges and then invest the money in exploration globally 39 Some have argued that below juniors there exists a substantial sector of illegitimate companies primarily focused on manipulating stock prices 39 ",
