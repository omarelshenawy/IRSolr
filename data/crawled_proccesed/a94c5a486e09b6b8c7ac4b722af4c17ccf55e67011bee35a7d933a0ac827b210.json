			"previous": " The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC s Steve Allen Show in New York Allen no fan of rock and roll introduced a new Elvis in a white bow tie and black tails Presley sang Hound Dog for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie As described by television historian Jake Austen Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd he set things up so that Presley would show his contrition 113 Allen for his part later wrote that he found Presley s strange gangly country boy charisma his hard to define cuteness and his charming eccentricity intriguing and simply worked the singer into the customary comedy fabric of his program 114 Just before the final rehearsal for the show Presley told a reporter I m holding down on this show I don t want to do anything to make people dislike me I think TV is important so I m going to go along but I won t be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance 115 Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career 116 Later that night he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling a popular local TV show Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected Presley responded No I haven t I don t feel like I m doing anything wrong I don t see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it s only music I mean how would rock n roll music make anyone rebel against their parents 110 ",
