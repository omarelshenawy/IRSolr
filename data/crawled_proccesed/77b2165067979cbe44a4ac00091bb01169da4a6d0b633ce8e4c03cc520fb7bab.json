			"previous": " The similar sounding terms chronograph and chronometer are often confused although they mean altogether different things A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer often a stopwatch complication as explained above while a chronometer watch is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre defined conditions a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the COSC Contr le Officiel Suisse des Chronom tres The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive so a watch can be a chronograph a chronometer both or neither ",
