			"after": " In July 2006 the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and 454 Life Sciences announced that they would sequence the Neanderthal genome over the next two years This genome was expected to be roughly the size of the human genome three billion base pairs and share most of its genes It was hoped the comparison would expand understanding of Neanderthals as well as the evolution of humans and human brains 96 ",
