			"previous": " The discipline of software engineering was created to address poor quality of software get projects exceeding time and budget under control and ensure that software is built systematically rigorously measurably on time on budget and within specification Engineering already addresses all these issues hence the same principles used in engineering can be applied to software The widespread lack of best practices for software at the time was perceived as a software crisis 13 14 15 ",
			"after": " The book analyzes sixty three software projects and concludes the cost of fixing errors escalates as we move the project toward field use The book also asserts that the key driver of software cost is the capability of the software development team ",
