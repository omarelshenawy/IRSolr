			"previous": " One evening Bu uel and Serge Silberman were discussing uncanny repetition in everyday life when Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house only to forget about it so that on the night of the dinner party he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes 219 This became the germ of the idea for their next film together The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie which tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in The Exterminating Angel where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal 158 For this film Bu uel Silberman and Carri re assembled a top flight cast of European performers a veritable rogues gallery of French art house cinema according to one critic 220 For the first time Bu uel made use of a video playback monitor which allowed him to make much more extensive use of crane shots and elaborate tracking shots and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for reshoots 219 Filming required only two months and Bu uel claimed that editing took only one day 219 When the film was released Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film which it won leading Bu uel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of 2500 idiots including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio 219 ",
			"after": " As was his habit Bu uel took advantage of the popular success of Discreet Charm to make one of the puzzling idiosyncratic films he really wanted to make 210 In 1973 at the Monastery of Paular in the Spanish Somosierra he wrote the screenplay for The Phantom of Liberty with Carri re for production by Silberman and his Hollywood partners 109 p 249 The resulting film is a series of 12 distinctive episodes with separate protagonists linked together only by following a character from one episode to another in a relay race manner 223 Bu uel has stated that he made the film as a tribute to poet Benjamin P ret a founding member of French Surrealism 119 p 170 and called it his most Surrealist film 109 p 249",
