			"previous": " The Australian magpie prefers open areas such as grassland fields and residential areas such as parks gardens golf courses and streets with scattered trees or forest nearby Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly on the ground in these open areas 52 It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas 46 In general evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land clearing although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting pine tree removal and spread of the masked lapwing Vanellus miles have been implicated 53 ",
			"after": " The Australian magpie is almost exclusively diurnal although it may call into the night like some other members of the Artamidae 54 Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl 55 Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines or poisoned after killing and eating house sparrows or mice rats or rabbits targeted with baiting 56 The Australian raven may take nestlings left unattended 57 ",
