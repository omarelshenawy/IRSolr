			"previous": " More than a century after his death literary critics such as G Birkbeck Hill and T S Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic They began to study Johnson s works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets 234 Yvor Winters claimed that A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson 6 F R Leavis agreed and on Johnson s criticism said When we read him we know beyond question that we have here a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature This we can say with emphatic conviction really is criticism 237 Edmund Wilson claimed that The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism 6 The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson s work firmly within the Western canon describing him as unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour 238 It is no wonder that his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid 20th century 239 ",
			"after": " There are many societies formed around and dedicated to the study and enjoyment of Samuel Johnson s life and works On the bicentennial of Johnson s death in 1984 Oxford University held a week long conference featuring 50 papers and the Arts Council of Great Britain held an exhibit of Johnsonian portraits and other memorabilia The London Times and Punch produced parodies of Johnson s style for the occasion 240 In 1999 the BBC Four television channel started the Samuel Johnson Prize an award for non fiction 241 ",
