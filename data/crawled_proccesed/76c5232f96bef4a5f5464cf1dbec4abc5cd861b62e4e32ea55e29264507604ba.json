			"previous": " Local police and FBI agents immediately began questioning possible suspects One of the first was an Oregon man with a minor police record named D B Cooper contacted by Portland police on the off chance that the hijacker had used his real name or the same alias in a previous crime His involvement was quickly ruled out but an inexperienced wire service reporter Clyde Jabin of UPI by most accounts 38 Joe Frazier of AP by others 39 rushing to meet an imminent deadline confused the eliminated suspect s name with the pseudonym used by the hijacker The mistake was picked up and repeated by numerous other media sources and the moniker D B Cooper became lodged in the public s collective memory 33 ",
			"after": " A precise search area was difficult to define as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft s speed or the environmental conditions along the flight path which varied significantly by location and altitude changed Cooper s projected landing point considerably 40 An important variable was the length of time he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all 41 Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner either visually or on radar nor did they see a parachute open but at night with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected 42 The T 33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all 43 ",
