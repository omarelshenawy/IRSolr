			"previous": " In sculling a single blade is moved through an arc from side to side taking care to keep presenting the blade to the water at the effective angle The innovation introduced with the screw propeller was the extension of that arc through more than 360 by attaching the blade to a rotating shaft Propellers can have a single blade but in practice there are nearly always more than one so as to balance the forces involved ",
			"after": " The origin of the screw propeller starts with Archimedes who used a screw to lift water for irrigation and bailing boats so famously that it became known as Archimedes screw It was probably an application of spiral movement in space spirals were a special study of Archimedes to a hollow segmented water wheel used for irrigation by Egyptians for centuries Leonardo da Vinci adopted the principle to drive his theoretical helicopter sketches of which involved a large canvas screw overhead ",
