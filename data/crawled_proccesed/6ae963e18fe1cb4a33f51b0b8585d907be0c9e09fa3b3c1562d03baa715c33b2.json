			"after": " There are a great many combinations of resonators and transducers that can be used to construct a mechanical filter A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator causing it to vibrate The edges of the disc move in antiphase to the centre when the driving signal is at or close to resonance and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator When the driving signal is not close to resonance there is little movement at the edges and the filter rejects does not pass the signal 40 Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a chain by connecting rods In this diagram the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers 30 Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators In this diagram the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer This would be quite unusual in a real design as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa 30 38 41 Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter not shown in the diagram so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter 38 ",
