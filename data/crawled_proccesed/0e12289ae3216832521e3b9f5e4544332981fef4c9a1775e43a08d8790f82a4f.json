			"previous": " The early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason starting in Europe One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world 15 Nature was no longer assumed to be human like with its own aims or reason and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same laws of nature which affect inanimate things This new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe ",
			"after": " Accordingly in the 17th century Ren Descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as rational animals suggesting instead that they are nothing more than thinking things along the lines of other things in nature Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was therefore subject to doubt ",
