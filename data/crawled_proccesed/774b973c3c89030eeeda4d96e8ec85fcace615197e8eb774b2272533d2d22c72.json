			"after": " American businessman Rodman Wanamaker became determined that the prize should go to an American aircraft and commissioned the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company to design and build an aircraft capable of making the flight Curtiss development of the Flying Fish flying boat in 1913 brought him into contact with John Cyril Porte a retired Royal Navy Lieutenant aircraft designer and test pilot who was to become an influential British aviation pioneer Recognising that many of the early accidents were attributable to a poor understanding of handling while in contact with the water the pair s efforts went into developing practical hull designs to make the transatlantic crossing possible 6 ",
