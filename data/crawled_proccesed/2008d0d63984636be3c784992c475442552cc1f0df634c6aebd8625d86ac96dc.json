			"after": " To meet Admiral Fisher s goal of building Dreadnought in a single year material was stockpiled in advance and a great deal of prefabrication was done before she was formally laid down on 2 October 1905 In addition she was built at HM Dockyard Portsmouth which was regarded as the fastest building shipyard in the world Christened with a bottle of Australian wine 33 Dreadnought was launched by King Edward VII on 10 February 1906 after only four months on the ways the bottle required multiple blows to shatter on a bow that later became famous She went to sea on 3 October 1906 for her steam trials only a year and a day after construction started although she was not commissioned until 11 December 1906 fifteen months after she was laid down 34 The ship cost 1 783 883 to build 35 The suggestion 36 37 that her building had been sped up by using guns and or turrets originally designed for the Lord Nelson class battleships which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905 It seems more likely that Dreadnought s turrets and guns merely received higher priority than those of the earlier ships 20 ",
