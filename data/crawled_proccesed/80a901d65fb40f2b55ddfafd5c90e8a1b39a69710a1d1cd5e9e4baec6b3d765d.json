			"previous": " The most important nautical innovation of the Song period seems to have been the introduction of the magnetic mariner s compass which permitted accurate navigation on the open sea regardless of the weather 170 The magnetized compass needle known in Chinese as the south pointing needle was first described by Shen Kuo in his 1088 Dream Pool Essays and first mentioned in active use by sailors in Zhu Yu s 1119 Pingzhou Table Talks ",
			"after": " There were other considerable advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty The 10th century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges 185 There was the Song era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships 75 186 If ships were damaged the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water 187 The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal like structure 188 Stern mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship In the Song period the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths 188 The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction 188 David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement made them more reliable for anchoring ships 188 ",
