			"after": " Jet engine thrust is governed by the general principle of mass flow rate Thrust depends on two things the velocity of the exhaust gas and the mass of that gas A jet engine can produce more thrust by either accelerating the gas to a higher velocity or by having a greater mass of gas exit the engine Designing a basic turbojet engine around the second principle produces the turbofan engine which creates slower gas but more of it Turbofans are highly fuel efficient and can deliver high thrust for long periods but the design trade off is a large size relative to the power output To generate increased power with a more compact engine for short periods an engine requires an afterburner The afterburner increases thrust primarily by accelerating the exhaust gas to a higher velocity While the mass of the fuel added to the exhaust does contribute to an increase in exhaust mass this effect is small compared to the increase in exhaust velocity citation needed ",
