			"after": " More than 40 years before the creation of the National Park Service Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1 1872 as the world s first national park Between 1872 and 1886 the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park s natural features and wildlife or to deal with poaching vandalism and other destructive activities 3 Over the next decade special interest groups such as concessionaires railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands 3 The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances was complicit with special interest groups Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource and along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park 4 Administration of the park was officially handed over to the War Department and the United States Army in 1886 ",
