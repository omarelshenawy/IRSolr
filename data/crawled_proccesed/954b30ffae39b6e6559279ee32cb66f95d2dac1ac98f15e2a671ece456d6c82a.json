			"after": " The Concorde s variable geometry intake like any jet engine intake has to deliver the air to the engine at as high a pressure as possible pressure recovery and with a pressure distribution distortion that can be tolerated by the compressor Poor pressure recovery is an unacceptable loss for the intake compression process and unacceptable distortion causes engine surging from loss of surge margin If the engine is an afterburning turbojet the intake also has to supply cooling air for the hot afterburner duct and engine nozzle Meeting all the above requirements over the relevant parts of the operating envelope was vital for Concorde to become a viable commercial aircraft They were met with variable geometry and an intake control system that did not compromise the operation of the engine nor the control of the aircraft ",
