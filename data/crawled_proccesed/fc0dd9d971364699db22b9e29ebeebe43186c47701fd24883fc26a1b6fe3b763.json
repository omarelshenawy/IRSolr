			"previous": " Since December secessionists with and without state forces had seized Federal Court Houses U S Treasury mints and post offices Southern governors ordered militia mobilization seized most of the federal forts and cannons within their boundaries and U S armories of infantry weapons The governors in big state Republican strongholds of Massachusetts New York and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units themselves 125 President Buchanan protested seizure of Federal property but made no military response apart from a failed attempt on January 9 1861 to resupply Fort Sumter using the ship Star of the West which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort 124 ",
			"after": " On March 4 1861 Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President In his inaugural address he argued that the Constitution was a more perfect union than the earlier Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union that it was a binding contract and called any secession legally void 126 He had no intent to invade Southern states nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed but said that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property The government would make no move to recover post offices and if resisted mail delivery would end at state lines Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law U S Marshals and Judges would be withdrawn No mention was made of bullion lost from U S mints in Louisiana Georgia and North Carolina In Lincoln s inaugural address U S policy would only collect import duties at its ports there could be no serious injury to justify revolution in the politics of four years His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union 127 ",
