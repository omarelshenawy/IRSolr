			"previous": " Antarctica is divided in two by the Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian ",
			"after": " About 98 of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet a sheet of ice averaging at least 1 6 km 1 0 mi thick The continent has about 90 of the world s ice and thereby about 70 of the world s fresh water If all of this ice were melted sea levels would rise about 60 m 200 ft 32 In most of the interior of the continent precipitation is very low down to 20 mm 0 8 in per year in a few blue ice areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by sublimation and so the local mass balance is negative In the dry valleys the same effect occurs over a rock base leading to a desiccated landscape ",
