			"previous": " Unmeasured and uncontrollable ballistic factors like high altitude temperature humidity barometric pressure wind direction and velocity required final adjustment through observation of the fall of shot Visual range measurement of both target and shell splashes was difficult prior to availability of Radar The British favoured coincident rangefinders while the Germans favored the stereoscopic type The former were less able to range on an indistinct target but easier on the operator over a long period of use the latter the reverse ",
			"after": " Submarines were also equipped with fire control computers for the same reasons but their problem was even more pronounced in a typical shot the torpedo would take one to two minutes to reach its target Calculating the proper lead given the relative motion of the two vessels was very difficult and torpedo data computers were added to dramatically improve the speed of these calculations ",
