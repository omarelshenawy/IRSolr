			"after": " The first edition of The World Book Encyclopedia was published in 1917 As a rule writes Editor Michael Vincent O Shea in the preface of that first edition encyclopedias are apt to be quite formal and technical A faithful effort has been made in the World Book to avoid this common defect Since the encyclopedia first appeared in print it has grown from 8 volumes to 22 volumes from a set with limited color plates to one with color throughout Over the years the World Book has been characterized by its design Unlike most other encyclopedias it is traditionally published in variously sized volumes depending on the letter of the alphabet Although most volumes cover exactly one letter completely the letters with exceptionally numerous entries C and S are divided between two volumes while adjacent letters with relatively few entries J K N O Q R U V and W Z share a volume World Book editors lay out major articles distinctly often starting them on a page of their own perhaps with a two column heading Materials are reviewed and authored by experts It recognizes that one of the primary uses of general purpose encyclopedias is students work on school reports For instance every article for a U S state has a box giving information about such things as the official state bird and tree and each President of the United States gets a very distinctive look with an oversized portrait a timeline and significant historial events that occurred during that president s administration ",
