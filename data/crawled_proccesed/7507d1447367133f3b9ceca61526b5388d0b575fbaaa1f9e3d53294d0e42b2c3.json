			"after": " The technique of reborning a play doll typically involves a number of steps To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed 1 Then a blue color wash may be applied to the inside of each vinyl part to give the appearance of realistic baby skin undertones 1 6 For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced 1 6 The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint 11 If heat set paints are used the doll parts must be heat set by baking them inside an oven or by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied 3 Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers 7 The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of veins and gives the doll its newborn mottled look 1 3 Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process 6 7 The next step is to apply hair The hair can either be done in one of two ways wigging or microrooting 6 11 When microrooting hair is added strand by strand 11 This can take up to 30 or more hours per head Once the hair is finished the original vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect 1 Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance Reborns heads are often weighted so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common 7 Reborns can come with an umbilical cord baby fat heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds 8 23 For preemie dolls they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose 7 ",
