			"previous": " Technical fire control has been performed in various places but mostly in firing batteries However in the 1930s the French moved it to battalion level and combined it with some tactical fire control This was copied by the US Nevertheless most armies seemed to have retained it within firing batteries and some duplicated the technical fire control teams in a battery to give operational resilience and tactical flexibility Computers reduced the number of men needed and enabled decentralisation of technical fire control to autonomous sub battery fire units such as platoons troops or sections although some armies had sometimes done this with their manual methods Computation on the gun or launcher integrated with their laying system is also possible MLRS led the way in this ",
			"after": " A fire unit is the smallest artillery or mortar element consisting of one or more weapon systems capable of being employed to execute a fire assigned by a tactical fire controller Generally it is a battery but sub divided batteries are quite common and in some armies very common On occasions a battery of 6 guns has been 6 fire units Fire units may or may not occupy separate positions Geographically dispersed fire units may or may not have an integral capability for technical fire control ",
