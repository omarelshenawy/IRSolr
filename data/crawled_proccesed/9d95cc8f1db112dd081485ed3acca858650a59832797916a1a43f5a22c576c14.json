			"previous": " In the early 20th century Dickinson s legacy was promoted in particular by Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham Bianchi who had inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt s poetry from her parents published works such as Emily Dickinson Face to Face and Letters of Emily Dickinson which stoked public curiosity about her aunt Her books perpetrated the myths surrounding her aunt while combining family tradition personal recollections and pieces of correspondence In comparison Millicent Todd Bingham s works provided a more distant and realistic perspective of the poet 167 ",
			"after": " Emily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture 168 Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson s eccentric and secluded nature she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative pre modernist poet 169 As early as 1891 William Dean Howells wrote that If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson America or New England rather had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world and could not be left out of any record of it 170 Twentieth century critic Harold Bloom has placed her alongside Walt Whitman Wallace Stevens Robert Frost T S Eliot and Hart Crane as a major American poet 4 and among twenty six of the greatest Western Writers of all time 171 ",
