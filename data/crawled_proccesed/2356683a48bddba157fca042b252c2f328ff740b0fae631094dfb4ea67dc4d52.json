			"previous": " In December 1902 the German government asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its dispute with Venezuela over unpaid debts Hay did not think this appropriate as Venezuela also owed the U S money and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in Hay supposedly said as final details were being worked out I have it all arranged If Teddy will keep his mouth shut until tomorrow noon 181 Hay and Roosevelt also differed over the composition of the Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute The commission was to be composed of impartial jurists and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges Roosevelt appointed politicians including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge Although Hay was supportive of the President s choices in public in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt complained by letter to his friends and offered his resignation Roosevelt declined it but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4 2 vote with the one English judge joining the three Americans 181 ",
			"after": " One incident involving Hay that benefitted Roosevelt politically was the kidnapping of Greek American playboy Ion Perdicaris in Morocco e by chieftain Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli an opponent of Sultan Abdelaziz Raisuli demanded a ransom but also wanted political prisoners to be released and control of Tangier in place of the military governor Raisuli supposed Perdicaris to be a wealthy American and hoped United States pressure would secure his demands In fact Perdicaris though born in New Jersey had renounced his citizenship during the Civil War to avoid Confederate confiscation of property in South Carolina and had accepted Greek naturalization a fact not generally known until years later but that decreased Roosevelt s desire for military action The sultan was ineffective in dealing with the incident and Roosevelt considered seizing the Tangier waterfront source of much of Abdelaziz s income as a means of motivating him With Raisuli s demands escalating Hay with Roosevelt s approval finally cabled the consul general in Tangier Samuel Gummer ",
