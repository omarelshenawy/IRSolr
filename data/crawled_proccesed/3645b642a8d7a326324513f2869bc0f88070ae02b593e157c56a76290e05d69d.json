			"previous": " Sperry Bendix and Grimes all produced equipment for World War II planes like instruments navigation electronics wheels and lighting systems 5 During World War II Bendix made just about every ancillary instrument or equipment for military aircraft Garrett Corporation initially produced intercoolers aircoolers and cabin pressurization regulators During the war Garrett expanded to manufacturing its own actuators auxiliary power units mechanical shutters and turbochargers 6 Since then all of these companies have merged and ultimately became a part of Honeywell ",
			"after": " In the beginning of the war most turbochargers were manually controlled superchargers that used mechanical energy from the engine to force air into the combustion process through the intake manifold The exhaust based turbocharger most common today was first created for World War II bomber planes and became stock equipment on B 17 B 24 and B 29 bombers 14 ",
