			"previous": " Within Earth s crust iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld igneous complex in South Africa 42 though the large copper nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of iridium Smaller reserves are found in the United States 42 Iridium is also found in secondary deposits combined with platinum and other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits The alluvial deposits used by pre Columbian people in the Choc Department of Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals As of 2003 the world reserves had not been estimated 11 ",
			"after": " The Cretaceous Paleogene boundary of 66 million years ago marking the temporal border between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time was identified by a thin stratum of iridium rich clay 43 A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact 43 Their theory known as the Alvarez hypothesis is now widely accepted to explain the demise of the dinosaurs A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under what is now the Yucat n Peninsula the Chicxulub crater 44 45 Dewey M McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead because Earth s core is rich in iridium and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise in the island of R union are still releasing iridium 46 47 ",
