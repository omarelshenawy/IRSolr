			"previous": " The beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to Diophantine equations 1 named after the 3rd century Alexandrian mathematician Diophantus who studied them and developed methods for the solution of some kinds of Diophantine equations A typical Diophantine problem is to find two integers x and y such that their sum and the sum of their squares equal two given numbers A and B respectively ",
			"after": " Diophantine equations have been studied for thousands of years For example the solutions to the quadratic Diophantine equation x2 y2 z2 are given by the Pythagorean triples originally solved by the Babylonians c 1800 BC 2 Solutions to linear Diophantine equations such as 26x 65y 13 may be found using the Euclidean algorithm c 5th century BC 3 ",
