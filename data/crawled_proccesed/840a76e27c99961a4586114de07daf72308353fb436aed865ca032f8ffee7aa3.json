			"after": " In US Navy service the initial SH 3A model of the Sea King would be progressively converted into the improved SH 3D and SH 3H variants these featured more powerful engines and improved sensors that gave the type greater operational capabilities as an ASW platform It was also common for Sea Kings to be converted for non ASW activities these roles included minesweeping combat search and rescue and as a cargo passenger utility transport 4 The aircrew on ASW tasked Sea Kings were routinely trained to carry out these secondary roles as aircraft could often be quickly adapted to perform different missions in the face of operational needs 13 ",
