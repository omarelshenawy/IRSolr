			"previous": " Of the several allotropes of plutonium the metallurgists preferred the malleable phase This was stabilized at room temperature by alloying it with gallium Two equal hemispheres of plutonium gallium alloy were plated with silver 51 and designated by serial numbers HS 1 and HS 2 57 The 6 19 kilogram 13 6 lb radioactive core generated 15 W of heat which warmed it up to about 100 to 110 F 38 to 43 C 51 and the silver plating developed blisters that had to be filed down and covered with gold foil later cores were plated with nickel instead The Trinity core consisted of just these two hemispheres Later cores also included a ring with a triangular cross section to prevent jets forming in the gap between them 58 ",
			"after": " A trial assembly of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses was carried out by the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3 It was driven to Trinity and back A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7 followed by a second set on July 10 Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky and the best ones were selected for use 59 The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material 60 This test brought bad news magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail Bethe worked through the night to assess the results and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion 61 ",
