			"after": " The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which according to radiometric dating ranges between 156 3 million years old Ma at its base 71 to 146 8 million years old at the top 72 which places it in the late Oxfordian Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period This formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west The deposits from their east facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands lakes river channels and floodplains 73 This formation is similar in age to the Lourinha Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania 74 In 1877 this formation became the center of the Bone Wars a fossil collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope 75 ",
