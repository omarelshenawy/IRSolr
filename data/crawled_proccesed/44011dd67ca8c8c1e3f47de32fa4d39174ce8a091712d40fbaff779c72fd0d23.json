			"previous": "  Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2 5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation 4 There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and gross domestic product per capita 5 However some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water based vulnerability 6 A report issued in November 2009 suggests that by 2030 in some developing regions of the world water demand will exceed supply by 50 7 Water plays an important role in the world economy as it functions as a solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances and facilitates industrial cooling and transportation Approximately 70 of the fresh water used by humans goes to agriculture 8 ",
