			"previous": " Birds play prominent and diverse roles in folklore religion and popular culture In religion birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity such as in the Cult of Makemake in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs 214 or as the rooster cock serves as a tangible vessel of Christ as in the gospel of Matthew Mark and Luke in the New Testament with Christ speaking through the cock 215 or as attendants as in the case of Hugin and Munin two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin 216 In several civilizations of ancient Italy particularly Etruscan and Roman religion priests were involved in augury or interpreting the words of birds while the auspex from which the word auspicious is derived watched their activities to foretell events 217 They may also serve as religious symbols as when Jonah Hebrew dove embodied the fright passivity mourning and beauty traditionally associated with doves 218 Birds have themselves been deified as in the case of the common peacock which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India 219 Some birds have also been perceived as monsters including the mythological Roc and the M ori s legendary Pou kai a giant bird capable of snatching humans 220 ",
			"after": " Birds have been featured in culture and art since prehistoric times when they were represented in early cave paintings 221 Birds were later used in religious or symbolic art and design such as the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors 222 With the advent of scientific interest in birds many paintings of birds were commissioned for books Among the most famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon whose paintings of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society 223 Birds are also important figures in poetry for example Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2 224 The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a burden 225 Other English metaphors derive from birds vulture funds and vulture investors for instance take their name from the scavenging vulture 226 ",
