			"previous": " Rendering is the generation of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure it would contain geometry viewpoint texture lighting and shading information as a description of the virtual scene The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software though others are available as plug ins or entirely separate programs The term rendering may be by analogy with an artist s rendering of a scene Though the technical details of rendering methods vary the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the graphics pipeline along a rendering device such as a GPU A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting the rendering software should solve the rendering equation The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena but is a general lighting model for computer generated imagery Rendering is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output ",
