			"previous": " The most beneficial category of submission technique is the chokehold Students are taught a variety of different chokes and are taught how a properly applied choke feels so that they know the difference between a choke that they must break or submit to immediately and one that they can safely ignore if they have an opening for a submission hold of their own A properly applied blood choke will prevent the flow of blood to and from the brain resulting in unconsciousness in approximately 4 10 seconds The best known example of this is the rear naked choke ",
			"after": " Less preferred but also effective techniques are joint locks Joint locks are not the preferred method for attacking an enemy because they do not completely disable the enemy Joints locks do inflict large amounts of pain and can secure compliance from the enemy This makes them especially useful in controlling opponents during crowd control operations or when someone is being clearly threatening but the rules of engagement prohibit killing them if the opponent is easily given to surrender under pain If compliance cannot be secured or is not desired the joint lock can be extended fully breaking the applicable joint Students are taught the difference between pain that signals a joint lock is in progress and simple discomfort ",
