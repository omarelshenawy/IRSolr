			"previous": " Areas of physics such as nanoelectronics nanomechanics nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology ",
			"after": " Several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases These include statistical mechanical effects as well as quantum mechanical effects for example the quantum size effect where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions However quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less the so called quantum realm Additionally a number of physical mechanical electrical optical etc properties change when compared to macroscopic systems One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical thermal and catalytic properties of materials Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics Mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with biomaterials ",
