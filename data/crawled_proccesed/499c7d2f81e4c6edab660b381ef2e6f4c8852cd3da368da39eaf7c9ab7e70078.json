			"previous": " In any solid at any temperature the primary particles e g atoms or molecules are not stationary but rather vibrate about mean positions In insulators the capacity of the solid to store thermal energy is due almost entirely to these vibrations Many physical properties of the solid e g modulus of elasticity can be predicted given knowledge of the frequencies with which the particles vibrate The simplest assumption by Einstein is that all the particles oscillate about their mean positions with the same natural frequency This is equivalent to the assumption that all atoms vibrate independently with a frequency Einstein also assumed that the allowed energy states of these oscillations are harmonics or integral multiples of h The spectrum of waveforms can be described mathematically using a Fourier series of sinusoidal density fluctuations or thermal phonons ",
			"after": " Debye subsequently recognized that each oscillator is intimately coupled to its neighboring oscillators at all times Thus by replacing Einstein s identical uncoupled oscillators with the same number of coupled oscillators Debye correlated the elastic vibrations of a one dimensional solid with the number of mathematically special modes of vibration of a stretched string see figure The pure tone of lowest pitch or frequency is referred to as the fundamental and the multiples of that frequency are called its harmonic overtones He assigned to one of the oscillators the frequency of the fundamental vibration of the whole block of solid He assigned to the remaining oscillators the frequencies of the harmonics of that fundamental with the highest of all these frequencies being limited by the motion of the smallest primary unit ",
