			"previous": " A fast bowler needs to take a longer run up toward the wicket than a spinner due to the need to generate the momentum and rhythm required to bowl a fast delivery Fast bowlers will measure their preferred run up in strides and mark the distance from the wicket It is important for the bowler to know exactly how long his or her run up is because it needs to terminate at the popping crease If the bowler steps over this he or she will have bowled a no ball A no ball means the bowler will have to bowl again awards a penalty of one or two runs to the batting team and allows them to score additional runs with a reduced risk of dismissal ",
