			"previous": " In order to maintain his credibility it was decided that Garbo or one of his agents should forewarn the Germans of the timing and some details of the actual invasion of Normandy although sending it too late for them to take effective action Special arrangements were made with the German radio operators to be listening to Garbo through the night of 5 6 June 1944 using the story that a sub agent was about to arrive with important information However when the call was made at 3 am no reply was received from the German operators until 8 am Turning this piece of bad luck on its head Garbo was able to add more operational details to the message when finally sent and increase his standing with the Germans Garbo told his German contacts that he was disgusted that his message was missed saying I cannot accept excuses or negligence Were it not for my ideals I would abandon the work 3 ",
			"after": " On 9 June 3 days after D day Garbo sent a message to German High Command that reached Adolf Hitler 24 saying that he had conferred with his agents and developed an order of battle showing 75 divisions in England in reality there were only about 50 Part of the Fortitude plan was intended to convince the Germans that a fictitious formation First U S Army Group comprising 11 divisions 150 000 men commanded by General George Patton was stationed in the south and east of Britain 3 ",
