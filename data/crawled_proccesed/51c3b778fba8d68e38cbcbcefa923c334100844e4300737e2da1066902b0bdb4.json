			"previous": " Newton and Robert Boyle s approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians 127 The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism 128 and at the same time the second wave of English deists used Newton s discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a Natural Religion ",
			"after": " The attacks made against pre Enlightenment magical thinking and the mystical elements of Christianity were given their foundation with Boyle s mechanical conception of the Universe Newton gave Boyle s ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and perhaps more importantly was very successful in popularising them 130 ",
