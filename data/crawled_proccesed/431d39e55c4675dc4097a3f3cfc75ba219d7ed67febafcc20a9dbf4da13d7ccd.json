			"after": " The earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre Galfridian tradition as a whole rather than in a single text or text story type A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material 37 The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats Some of these are human threats such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum but the majority are supernatural including giant cat monsters destructive divine boars dragons dogheads giants and witches 38 The second is that the pre Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore particularly topographic or onomastic folklore and localised magical wonder tales the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape 39 The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn On the one hand he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners On the other his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin 40 ",
