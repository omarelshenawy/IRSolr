			"previous": " Another more influential early functional contribution to VTOL was Rolls Royce s Thrust Measuring Rig flying bedstead of 1953 This led to the first VTOL engines as used in the first British VTOL aircraft the Short SC 1 1957 which used 4 vertical lift engines with a horizontal one for forward thrust ",
			"after": " The Short SC 1 was the first British fixed wing VTOL aircraft The SC 1 was designed to study the problems with VTOL flight and the transition to and from forward flight The SC 1 was designed to meet a Ministry of Supply MoS request for tender ER 143T for a vertical take off research aircraft issued in September 1953 The design was accepted by the ministry and a contract was placed for two aircraft XG900 and XG905 to meet Specification ER 143D dated 15 October 1954 The SC 1 was also equipped with the first fly by wire control system for a VTOL aircraft This permitted three modes of control of the aerodynamic surfaces and or the nozzle controls ",
