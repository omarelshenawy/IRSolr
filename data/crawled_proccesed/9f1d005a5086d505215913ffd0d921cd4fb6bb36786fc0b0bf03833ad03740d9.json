			"previous": " Determining the execution date relies on stylistic analysis and the degree of van der Weyden s influence The dating of the work to the 1440s is based on the notion that Christus borrowed heavily from the immediate influence of van der Weyden and Bouts Although some of the similarities are undeniably striking and might be attributed to following a template the degree of sophistication in the Nativity far surpasses the other two painters according to Ainsworth She writes that Bouts and van der Weyden merely expand the narrative in their use of the archway motif whereas Christus shows a strong cause and effect between sin and redemption innovations which almost certainly evolved later in his career placing the date no earlier than the mid 1450s 42 ",
			"after": " The underdrawing is visible through modern technical analysis revealing the main group of figures and contour lines in the folds and drape of the clothing The angels wings to Mary s left are visible but not those to the right probably because of later overpainting 7 In the underdrawing Mary s gown extends far to the left of the angel but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution 11 ",
