			"after": " On October 16 1854 in his Peoria Speech Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency 124 Speaking in his Kentucky accent with a very powerful voice 125 he said the Kansas Act had a declared indifference but as I must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery I cannot but hate it I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world 126 ",
