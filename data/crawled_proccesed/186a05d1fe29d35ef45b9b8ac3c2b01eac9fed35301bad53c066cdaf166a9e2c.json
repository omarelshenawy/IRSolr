			"previous": " Istanbul is situated near the North Anatolian Fault close to the boundary between the African and Eurasian Plates This fault zone which runs from northern Anatolia to the Sea of Marmara has been responsible for several deadly earthquakes throughout the city s history Among the most devastating of these seismic events was the 1509 earthquake which caused a tsunami that broke over the walls of the city and killed more than 10 000 people More recently in 1999 an earthquake with its epicenter in nearby zmit left 18 000 people dead including 1 000 people in Istanbul s suburbs The people of Istanbul remain concerned that an even more catastrophic seismic event may be in the city s near future as thousands of structures recently built to accommodate Istanbul s rapidly increasing population may not have been constructed properly 80 Seismologists say the risk of a 7 6 magnitude or greater earthquake striking Istanbul by 2030 is more than 60 percent 81 82 ",
