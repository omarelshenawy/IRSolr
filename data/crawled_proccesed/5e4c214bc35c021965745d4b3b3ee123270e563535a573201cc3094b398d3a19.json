			"previous": " The Australian military s role in the South West Pacific decreased during 1944 In the latter half of 1943 the Australian Government decided with MacArthur s agreement that the size of the military would be reduced to release manpower for war related industries which were important to supplying Britain and the US forces in the Pacific Australia s main role in the Allied war effort from this point forward was supplying the other Allied countries with food materials and manufactured goods needed for the defeat of Japan 141 As a result of this policy the Army units available for offensive operations were set at six infantry divisions the three AIF divisions and three CMF divisions and two armoured brigades The size of the RAAF was set at 53 squadrons and the RAN was limited to the ships which were in service or planned to be built at the time 142 In early 1944 all but two of the Army s divisions were withdrawn to the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland for training and rehabilitation 143 Several new battalions of Australian led Papuan and New Guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into the Pacific Islands Regiment however and largely replaced the Australian Army battalions disbanded during the year These troops had seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign 144 ",
			"after": " After the liberation of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in the US led Western New Guinea campaign which had the goal of securing bases to be used to mount the liberation of the Philippines Australian warships and the fighter bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No 10 Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia Biak Noemfoor and Morotai 145 After western New Guinea was secured No 10 Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force 1TAF and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale and contributed to the Morotai Mutiny in April 1945 146 ",
