			"previous": " These early stelae depicted rulers as warriors or wearing the masks and headdresses of Maya deities accompanied by texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns as well as recording their relationships with their ancestors 75 Stelae came to be displayed in large ceremonial plazas designed to display these monuments to maximum effect 10 The raising of stelae spread from the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands throughout the Maya area 76 The development of Maya stelae coincides with the development of divine kingship among the Classic Maya 10 In the southern Maya area the Late Preclassic stelae impressed upon the viewer the achievements of the king and his right to rule thus reinforcing both his political and religious power 77 ",
			"after": " At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in the central lowlands Maya sculptors were producing some of the earliest lowland Maya stelae depicting richly dressed individuals 78 Nakbe Stela 1 has been dated to around 400 BC It was broken into pieces but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor however it also has features that recall the myth of the Maya Hero Twins and would be the earliest known presentation of them 79 Around 200 BC the enormous nearby city of El Mirador had started to erect stela like monuments bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable 80 A stela has also been discovered at El Tintal another major Preclassic city in the Mirador Basin 81 ",
