			"after": " On Sunday 30 September the body of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was discovered at about 1 am in Dutfield s Yard inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street since renamed Henriques Street Whitechapel She was lying in a pool of blood with her throat cut from left to right She had been killed just minutes before and her body was otherwise unmutilated It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard perhaps Louis Diemschutz who discovered the body 47 However some commentators on the case conclude that Stride s murder was unconnected to the others 48 on the basis that the body was unmutilated that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road 49 and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design 47 Most experts however consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride s murder with at least two of the earlier ones as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night 50 ",
