			"previous": " Sullivan s deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under Musical Quotations but other echoes may not have been conscious Hughes cites the concluding bars of Tell a tale of cock and bull from The Yeomen of the Guard as an example of Handel s influence and another critic Edward Greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the Irish Symphony an outrageous crib from Schubert s Unfinished Symphony 215 216 ",
			"after": " Sullivan was trained in the classical style and contemporary music did not greatly attract him 217 Harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of Auber Donizetti Balfe and Schubert 217 Later he drew on Gounod and Bizet Mendelssohn s influence conspicuous in early works appears intermittently in later ones As a contemporary writer observed Sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself 218 Yet in the field of harmony Hughes writes Sullivan remained an eclectic He had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality 217 ",
