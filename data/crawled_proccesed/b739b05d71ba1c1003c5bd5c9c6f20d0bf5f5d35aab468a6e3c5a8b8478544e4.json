			"after": " Veneration of ancestors is prevalent throughout the island of Madagascar Approximately half of the country s population of 20 million currently practice traditional religion 7 which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana ancestors The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana whereby a deceased family member s remains may be exhumed to be periodically re wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor s memory reunite with family and community and enjoy a festive atmosphere Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present 8 Veneration of ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways they may intervene on behalf of the living Conversely misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors Small everyday gestures of respect include throwing the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to give the ancestors their due share 9 ",
