			"previous": " Magma reached the surface of the volcano about October 11 2004 resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome s south side This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006 Several transient features were observed such as the whaleback which comprised long shafts of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed On July 2 2005 the tip of the whaleback broke off causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air 33 ",
			"after": " Mount St Helens showed significant activity on March 8 2005 when a 36 000 foot 11 000 m plume of steam and ash emerged visible from Seattle 34 This relatively minor eruption was a release of pressure consistent with ongoing dome building The release was accompanied by a magnitude 2 5 earthquake ",
