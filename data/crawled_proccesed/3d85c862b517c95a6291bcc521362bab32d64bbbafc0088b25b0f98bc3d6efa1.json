			"previous": " With new noise restrictions coming into effect throughout the 1970s an aircraft tailored for this role would also have to be very quiet Propeller thrust is a factor of its blade length and cord and the speed at which it rotates RPM To meet these new regulations the new design used much larger oversized propellers geared to rotate at a slower speed than is normally designed Much of the problem sound from a typical propeller is generated at the tips of the blades which are rotating just beneath the speed of sound By using overlarge propeller blades there is no need to have the blade tip reach near the speed of sound and the RPM can therefore be reduced without sacrificing thrust In reducing the RPM this noise is reduced substantially The Dash 7 often landed with only 900 RPM and took off at only 1 210 RPM The propellers on the Dash 7 allow for feathering a change in the blade angle to push more or less air as needed This can be used to increase airspeed and climb rate while maintaining a constant and lower RPM ",
			"after": " In other respects the new DHC 7 was essentially a larger four engine version of the Twin Otter the general layout remained similar with a high aspect ratio high mounted wing most details of the cockpit and nose profile Changes included the addition of cabin pressurization requiring a switch to a fuselage with a circular cross section landing gear that folded forward into the inner engine nacelles and a large T tail intended to keep the elevator clear of the propwash during takeoff the Twin Otter s empennage was a cruciform arrangement ",
