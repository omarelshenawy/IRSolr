			"after": " Kabbalah Hebrew lit receiving is a discipline and school of thought discussing the mystical aspect of Judaism It is a set of esoteric teachings that are meant to explain the relationship between an infinite eternal and essentially unknowable Creator with the finite and mortal universe of His creation In solving this paradox Kabbalah seeks to define the nature of the universe and the human being the nature and purpose of existence and various other ontological questions It also presents methods to aid understanding of these concepts and to thereby attain spiritual realization Kabbalah originally developed entirely within the milieu of Jewish thought and constantly uses classical Jewish sources to explain demonstrate or prove its esoteric teachings These teachings are thus held by kabbalists to define the inner meaning of both the Tanakh Hebrew Bible and traditional Rabbinic literature as well as to explain the significance of Jewish religious observances ",
