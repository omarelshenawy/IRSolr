			"previous": " If a horizontal plate sundial is made for the latitude in which it is being used and if it is mounted with its plate horizontal and its gnomon pointing to the celestial pole that is above the horizon then it shows the correct time in apparent solar time Conversely if the directions of the cardinal points are initially unknown but the sundial is aligned so it shows the correct apparent solar time as calculated from the reading of a clock its gnomon shows the direction of True North or South allowing the sundial to be used as a compass The sundial can be placed on a horizontal surface and rotated about a vertical axis until it shows the correct time The gnomon will then be pointing to the North in the northern hemisphere or to the South in the southern hemisphere This method is much more accurate than using a watch as a compass see Cardinal direction Watch face and can be used in places where the magnetic declination is large making a magnetic compass unreliable An alternative method uses two sundials of different designs See Multiple dials above The dials are attached to and aligned with each other and are oriented so they show the same time This allows the directions of the cardinal points and the apparent solar time to be determined simultaneously without requiring a clock citation needed ",
