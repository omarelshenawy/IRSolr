			"previous": " The rova s earliest defining features had crystallised among the Merina as residences for local rulers at least 100 years before the emergence of the united Kingdom of Imerina under Andriamanelo According to custom a rova s foundation was always elevated relative to the surrounding village The compound also always featured a kianja central courtyard marked by a vatomasina tall sacred stone where the sovereign would stand to deliver kabary royal speeches or decrees Contained within the rova was at least one lapa royal palace or residence as well as the fasana tomb of one or more of the site s founders 5 The sovereign s lodgings typically stood in the northern part of the rova while the spouse or spouses lived in the southern part 6 It was not until the dawn of the 19th century that a perimeter wall of sharpened wooden stakes would constitute another defining feature of rova construction 5 ",
