			"after": " Some of Belton s many rooms have been altered over the last 300 years both in use and design One of the principal rooms the Marble Hall 1 the first of the large reception rooms serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles By the time of Belton s conception the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat but intended as a grand entrance to the house The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings Queens and Emperors from William the Conqueror to William III intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above 31 The room is fully panelled and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons 32 In the early 19th century this room and some others were re modelled by Jeffry Wyatville who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak inserted fake doors in the panelling to balance real doors already in place ",
