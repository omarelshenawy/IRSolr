			"after": " In the 1660s Sweden was at its height as a European great power It had defeated Denmark one of its main competitors for hegemony in the Baltic in both the Torstenson War 1643 45 and the Dano Swedish War 1657 58 At the Treaties of Br msebro 1645 and Roskilde 1658 Denmark had been forced to cede the islands of Gotland and sel all of its eastern territories on the Scandinavian Peninsula and parts of Norway In a third war from 1658 to 1660 King Charles X of Sweden attempted to finish off Denmark for good The move was bold royal ambition in an already highly militarized society geared for warfare a fiscal military state 2 Disbanding its armies would have required paying outstanding wages so there was an underlying incentive to keep hostilities alive and let soldiers live off enemy lands and plunder The renewed attack on Denmark threatened the interests of the leading shipping nations of England and the Dutch Republic who were best served by keeping the Baltic region politically divided The Dutch intervened in 1658 by sending a fleet to stop the attempt to crush Denmark 3 England also sent a fleet in November the same year to assist Sweden in keeping the Sound Toll out of Danish and Dutch control The English expedition failed as a result of adverse winter weather and the political turmoil that ended the Protectorate and in the end Charles plans were thwarted 4 ",
