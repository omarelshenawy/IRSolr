			"previous": " In 2010 Robert L Nudds and Gareth J Dyke in the journal Science published a paper in which they analysed the rachises of the primary feathers of Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those compared to modern birds relative to body weight The authors determined that Archaeopteryx along with Confuciusornis were unable to use flapping flight 35 This study was criticized by Philip J Currie and Luis Chiappe however Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers and Currie speculated that Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis must have been able to fly to some degree as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been in marine or lake sediments suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water 36 Gregory Paul also disagreed with the study arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the weights of these early birds and that more accurate weight estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises Nudds and Dyke had assumed a weight of 250 grams for the Munich specimen Archaeopteryx a young juvenile based on published weight estimates of larger specimens Paul argued that a more reasonable body weight estimate for the Munich specimen is about 140 grams Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of 0 75 millimetre 0 030 in for the longest primary feather which Paul could not confirm using photographs Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers finding rachises 1 25 1 4 mm across 37 Despite these criticisms Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions They claimed that Paul s statement that an adult Archaeopteryx would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen was dubious This they reasoned would require even thicker rachis evidence for which has not yet been presented 38 Another possibility is that they hadn t achieved true flight but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the basilisk lizard which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits see Evolution of bird flight 39 40 ",
			"after": " In 2004 scientists analyzing a detailed CT scan of the braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one third of the brain Other well developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination 41 The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non avian reptiles These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing balance spatial perception and coordination needed to fly 42 Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum to brain volume ratio 78 of the way to modern birds from the condition of non coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus which had a crocodile like anatomy of the brain and inner ear 43 Newer research show that while the species brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs even smaller than that of other non avian dinosaurs in several instances which indicates the neurological capabilities required of flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade 44 ",
