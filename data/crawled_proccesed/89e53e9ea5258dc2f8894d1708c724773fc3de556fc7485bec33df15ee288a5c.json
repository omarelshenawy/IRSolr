			"previous": " The painting contains several geometric constructions 14 The roof of the shed s trusses form series of triangles connecting lines joining the base of the pedestals and the crossbeams These surround the gathering of the Holy Family who form an inverse pattern According to art historian Lawrence Steefel the detail participates in an almost emblematic pattern of repeated triangles which establish a rhyme scheme above and below of roof structure and figure disposition 29 Upton writes that a clearly defined diamond is visible within the apex in the roof From there it extends down to Eve and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground It then extends up to Adam and back up to the roof This diamond shape he writes supplemented by the rectangle within it formed by the shed supports the base of the triangle and the ground line in the shed circumscribes the main event of the painting 35 ",
			"after": " Spatial and temporal borders separating the earthly and heavenly spheres are often seen in Netherlandish art usually in the form of frames or arches 36 A boundary is achieved here with the grisaille archway 20 strongly reminiscent of van der Weyden s work Art historians speculate Christus may have imitated his c 1455 Altar of Saint John 31 Instead of merely imitating Christus innovated and extended the use of van der Weyden s arch motif his arch is meant to be an opening or a screen for the viewer to see into the holy space instead of a simple framing device in which figures are placed directly in line or under the arch The multi hued threshold stones at the bottom emphasize its function says Upton who writes it is an opening through which one passes a true frame or doorway to the picture Yet since this arch is painted in grisaille distinct from the rest of the panel it must also be seen as a separate entity much like an elaborate border around an illuminated manuscript page 6 The shadows cast by the grisaille figures stress its function as a diaphragm between real and illusory space 17 ",
