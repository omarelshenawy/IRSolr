			"previous": " An optional section that may occur after the verse is the pre chorus Also referred to as a build channel or transitional bridge the pre chorus functions to connect the verse to the chorus with intermediary material typically using subdominant or similar transitional harmonies Often a two phrase verse containing basic chords is followed by a passage often harmonically probing that leads to the full chorus 5 Often when the verse and chorus involve the same harmonic structure the pre chorus will introduce a new harmonic pattern in order to make the harmony reappearance of the verse harmonies in the chorus seem fresh ",
			"after": "  The difference between refrain and chorus is not always cut and dried both refer to passages of unchanging music and text providing a periodic sense of return 6 At times the term refrain has been used interchangeably with chorus Technically the refrain may be considered anything that s not the verse a song part that contains the hook or title and appears more than once in a song is usually called a chorus 7 The chorus contains the main idea or big picture of what is being expressed lyrically and musically It is repeated throughout the song and the melody and lyric rarely vary 1 A refrain is a repeated line or musical phrase that ties a song together A refrain is only a phrase or a word while a chorus contains many more words 8 A refrain may be defined as a repetitive phrase or phrases that serve the function of a chorus lyrically but are not placed in a separate section and or long enough so as to be considered a chorus 4 For example refrains are found in AC DC s You Shook Me All Night Long Paul Simon s The Sound of Silence and Deck the Halls fa la la la la 8 ",
