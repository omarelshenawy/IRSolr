			"after": " In 1878 Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting 46 He began by tackling the problem of creating a long lasting incandescent lamp something that would be needed for indoor use Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps including Alessandro Volta s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy James Bowman Lindsay Moses G Farmer 47 William E Sawyer Joseph Swan and Heinrich G bel Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life high expense to produce and high electric current drawn making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially 48 217 218 Edison realized that in order to keep the thickness of the copper wire needed to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size he would have to come up with a lamp that would draw a low amount of current This meant the lamp would have to have a high resistance and run at a low voltage around 110 volts 49 ",
