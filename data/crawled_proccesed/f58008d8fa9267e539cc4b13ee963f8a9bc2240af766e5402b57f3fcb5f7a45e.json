			"previous": " An enumerative bibliography is a systematic list of books and other works such as journal articles Bibliographies range from works cited lists at the end of books and articles to complete and independent publications A notable example of a complete independent publication is Gow s A E Housman A Sketch Together with a List of His Classical Papers 1936 As separate works they may be in bound volumes such as those shown on the right or computerized bibliographic databases A library catalog while not referred to as a bibliography is bibliographic in nature Bibliographical works are almost always considered to be tertiary sources ",
			"after": " Enumerative bibliographies are based on a unifying principle such as creator subject date topic or other characteristic An entry in an enumerative bibliography provides the core elements of a text resource including a title the creator s publication date and place of publication Belanger 1977 distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source s physical nature materiality or textual transmission The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective One noted example would be Tanselle s bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper ",
