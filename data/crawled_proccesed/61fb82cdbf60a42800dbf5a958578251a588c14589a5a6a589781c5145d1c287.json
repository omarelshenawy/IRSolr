			"after": " Many toads are killed by traffic while migrating to their breeding grounds In Europe they have the highest rate of mortality from roadkill among amphibians Many of the deaths take place on stretches of road where streams flow underneath showing that migration routes often follow water courses 39 In some places in Germany Great Britain Northern Italy and Poland special tunnels have been constructed so that toads can cross under roads in safety In other places local wildlife groups run toad patrols carrying the amphibians across roads at busy crossing points in buckets The toads start moving at dusk and for them to travel far the temperature needs to remain above 5 C 41 F On a warm wet night they may continue moving all night but if it cools down they may stop earlier 40 An estimate was made of the significance of roadkill in toad populations in the Netherlands The number of females killed in the spring migration on a quiet country road ten vehicles per hour was compared with the number of strings of eggs laid in nearby fens A 30 mortality rate was found with the rate for deaths among males likely to be of a similar order 41 ",
