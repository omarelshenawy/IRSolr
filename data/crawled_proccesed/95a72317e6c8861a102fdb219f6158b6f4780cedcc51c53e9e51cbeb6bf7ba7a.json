			"previous": " A set T of sentences is called a first order theory A theory is satisfiable if it has a model i e a structure of the appropriate signature which satisfies all the sentences in the set T Consistency of a theory is usually defined in a syntactical way but in first order logic by the completeness theorem there is no need to distinguish between satisfiability and consistency Therefore model theorists often use consistent as a synonym for satisfiable ",
			"after": " Lack of expressivity when compared to higher logics such as second order logic has its advantages though For model theorists the L wenheim Skolem theorem is an important practical tool rather than the source of Skolem s paradox In a certain sense made precise by Lindstr m s theorem first order logic is the most expressive logic for which both the L wenheim Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem hold ",
