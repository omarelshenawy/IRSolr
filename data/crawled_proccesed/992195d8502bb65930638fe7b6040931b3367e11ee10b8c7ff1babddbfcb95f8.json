			"previous": " Another feature of pulsejet engines is that their thrust can be increased by a specially shaped duct placed behind the engine The duct acts as an annular wing which evens out the pulsating thrust by harnessing aerodynamic forces in the pulsejet exhaust The duct typically called an augmenter can significantly increase the thrust of a pulsejet with no additional fuel consumption Gains of 100 increases in thrust are possible resulting in a much higher fuel efficiency However the larger the augmenter duct the more drag it produces and it is only be effective within specific speed ranges ",
			"after": " The combustion cycle comprises five or six phases depending on the engine Induction Compression optional Fuel Injection Ignition Combustion and Exhaust  Starting with ignition within the combustion chamber a high pressure is raised by the combustion of the fuel air mixture The pressurized gas from combustion cannot exit forward through the one way intake valve and so exits only to the rear through the exhaust tube ",
