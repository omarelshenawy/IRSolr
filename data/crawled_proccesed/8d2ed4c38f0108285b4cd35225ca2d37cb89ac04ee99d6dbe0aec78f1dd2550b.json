			"previous": " An important field of invention during this period was the tape recorder Magnetic tape recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a tape head which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape In playback mode the signal path is reversed the tape head acting as a miniature electric generator as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it 15 The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester This technology the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of AC biasing first used in the 1920s for wire recorders which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer John T Mullin with backing from Bing Crosby Enterprises Mullin s pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders In the late 1940s the Ampex company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US ",
			"after": " Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry Sound could be recorded erased and re recorded on the same tape many times sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder the Ampex 200 model launched in 1948 American musician inventor Les Paul had invented the first multitrack tape recorder ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the Musique Concr te school and avant garde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as Frank Zappa The Beatles and The Beach Boys ",
