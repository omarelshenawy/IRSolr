			"previous": " In March 2007 Johnson began suggesting standing for the position of Mayor of London in the 2008 mayoral election 175 His candidacy was not initially taken seriously within the Conservative Party who instead considered Nick Boles the party s main contender for the job 176 However after Boles had to withdraw and no other well known candidate was forthcoming Cameron agreed to back Johnson s candidacy 177 He was reassured by London s free newspaper The Evening Standard that they would support him throughout the campaign 34 In July 2007 he officially announced his candidacy 178 179 and was selected as Conservative candidate in September after gaining 75 of the vote in a public London wide primary 180 181 There was some anger in Henley among party members and constituents who felt that Johnson was abandoning them for London 182 Right wing journalists Simon Heffer and Peregrine Worsthorne described Johnson as not being serious enough to hold the role of Mayor of London 183 Worsthorne noting that the harder he tried to be serious the more insincere incoherent evasive and even puerile he looked and sounded 184 Labour incumbent Ken Livingstone took Johnson more seriously than many others were doing referring to him as the most formidable opponent I will face in my political career 185 Livingstone s campaign focused on portraying Johnson as an upper class toff who was out of touch with the lives of most Londoners also alleging that he was a bigot as evidenced by racist and homophobic language that he had used in his Telegraph column 186 This situation was exacerbated when the far right British National Party urged its supporters to give their second preference votes to Johnson 187 188 ",
			"after": " Johnson s candidacy was primarily funded by sympathetic individuals in London s financial sector 189 The Conservative Party hired Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby to run Johnson s campaign 190 Aware of Johnson s propensity for committing gaffes Crosby prevented him from holding interviews with the print and broadcast media in favour of radio talk shows and daytime television which asked easier questions 191 192 Crosby also made Johnson tell fewer jokes and have a simpler haircut to help make him appear more serious 191 Johnson s campaign focused on reducing youth crime making public transport safer and replacing the bendy buses with a new fleet of Routemasters 193 Johnson s campaign capitalised on his popularity even among those who opposed his policies 194 His political opponents complained that a common attitude among voters was that I m voting for Boris because he is a laugh 193 The campaign targeted Conservative leaning suburbs in outer London to capitalise on a sense of being overlooked by the Livingstone administration which had paid most attention to inner London areas 195 192 Johnson also focused on counteracting his image as a bigot he declared that I m absolutely 100 anti racist I despise and loath racism 196 Publicly emphasising his own Turkish ancestry 197 he went contrary to Conservative policy by declaring his support for an earned amnesty for illegal immigrants 198 ",
