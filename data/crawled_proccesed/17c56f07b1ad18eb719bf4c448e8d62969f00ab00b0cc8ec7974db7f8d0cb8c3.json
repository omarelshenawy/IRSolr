			"previous": " The impact of the First World War dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man s wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the post war era The creeping barrage artillery tactic developed during the War required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare with luminous dials and unbreakable glass Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos Dumont had The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917 140 ",
			"after": " The company H Williamson Ltd based in Coventry was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity During the company s 1916 AGM it was noted that the public is buying the practical things of life Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can By the end of the War almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized the fashion soon caught on the British Horological Journal wrote in 1917 that the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire Within a decade sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches 135 ",
