			"after": " Indeed a key reason for using continuous compounding is to simplify the analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus Further for interest accrued and capitalized overnight hence compounded daily continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding More sophisticated analysis includes the use of differential equations as detailed below ",
