			"previous": " In December 2001 EasyJet switched from a third party reservation system to an in house system designed and developed for them by BulletProof Technologies Inc 66 Internet bookings were priced cheaper than booking over the phone to reflect the reduced call centre costs and the aircraft were repainted with the web address Within a year over 50 of bookings were made using the web site by April 2004 the figure had jumped to 98 Now flights can be booked either via the Internet or by phone within 3 months of the flight 16 ",
			"after": " EasyJet s aircraft cabins are configured in a single class high density layout 67  The airline s main fleet comprising Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft carry up to 156 and 180 passengers respectively depending on layout A typical Airbus A319 carries approximately 140 passengers in a single class configuration but as EasyJet does not serve meals on its shorter flights the airline opted for smaller galleys and had a lavatory installed in unused space at the rear of the aircraft The space saved by having smaller galleys allowed for the installation of 156 seats Due to this seating arrangement EasyJet s Airbus A319 aircraft have two pairs of overwing exits instead of the standard one pair configuration found on most Airbus A319 aircraft to satisfy safety requirements 51 59 60 ",
