			"previous": " For the surface movement of large A380 structural components a complex route known as the Itin raire Grand Gabarit was developed This involved the construction of a fleet of roll on roll off RORO ships and barges the construction of port facilities and the development of new and modified roads to accommodate oversized road convoys 30 The front and rear fuselage sections are shipped on one of three RORO ships from Hamburg in northern Germany to the United Kingdom 31 The wings are manufactured at Broughton in North Wales then transported by barge to Mostyn docks where the ship adds them to its cargo 32 ",
			"after": " In Saint Nazaire in western France the ship exchanges the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger assembled sections some of which include the nose The ship unloads in Bordeaux The ship then picks up the belly and tail sections from Construcciones Aeron uticas SA in C diz in southern Spain and delivers them to Bordeaux From there the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse 33 In order to avoid damage from direct handling parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self powered wheeled vehicles 28 ",
