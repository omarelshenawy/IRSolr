			"previous": " Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate 151 At the same time the US Britain and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them 152 Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines an American possession since 1898 and warned Japan that the US would react to Japanese attacks against any neighboring countries 152 ",
			"after": " Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American British Dutch sanctions Japan prepared for war On 20 November it presented an interim proposal as its final offer It called for the end of American aid to China and the supply of oil and other resources to Japan In exchange they promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw their forces from their threatening positions in southern Indochina 151 The American counter proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non aggression pacts with all Pacific powers 153 That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force 154 the Japanese military did not consider the former an option and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war 155 ",
