			"previous": " In the past some palaeontologists notably Robert Bakker have speculated that the plates may have been mobile to some degree although others disagree 37 Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip from one side to another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort 38 S stenops also had disk shaped plates on its hips ",
			"after": " The function of the plates has been much debated Initially thought of as some form of armor 29 they appear to have been too fragile and ill placed for defensive purposes leaving the animal s sides unprotected 39 The plates large size suggests that they may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal either to intimidate enemies 24 or to impress other members of the same species in some form of sexual display 39 although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates More recently researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal 37 in a similar way to the sails of the pelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus and modern elephant and rabbit ears The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood 40 Some 2010 structural comparisons of Stegosaurus plates to Alligator osteoderms seem to support the conclusion that the potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of Stegosaurus definitely exists 41 This hypothesis has been seriously questioned 42 since its closest relatives such as Kentrosaurus had more low surface area spikes than plates implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun Since a cooling trend occurred towards the end of the Jurassic a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun ",
