			"previous": " The traditional picture of an orderly series of scripts each one invented suddenly and then completely displacing the previous one has been conclusively demonstrated to be fiction by the archaeological finds and scholarly research of the later 20th and early 21st centuries 28 Gradual evolution and the coexistence of two or more scripts was more often the case As early as the Shang Dynasty oracle bone script coexisted as a simplified form alongside the normal script of bamboo books preserved in typical bronze inscriptions as well as the extra elaborate pictorial forms often clan emblems found on many bronzes ",
			"after": " Based on studies of these bronze inscriptions it is clear that from the Shang Dynasty writing to that of the Western Zhou and early Eastern Zhou the mainstream script evolved in a slow unbroken fashion until assuming the form that is now known as seal script in the late Eastern Zhou in the state of Qin without any clear line of division 29 30 Meanwhile other scripts had evolved especially in the eastern and southern areas during the late Zhou Dynasty including regional forms such as the g w n ancient forms of the eastern Warring States preserved as variant forms in the Han Dynasty character dictionary Shuowen Jiezi as well as decorative forms such as bird and insect scripts ",
