			"previous": " The placement of these wing struts and the forces acting on them depends chiefly on the wing configuration They are most common in high wing aircraft like the Cessna 152 or parasol wing aircraft like the Consolidated PBY Catalina running from the wing underside to the lower fuselage longeron or equivalent structure In flight these lift struts are in tension from the lift forces In level flight they convey the weight of the aircraft to the wings On the ground they are under compression supporting the wing against gravity Less commonly and chiefly in the past low winged monoplanes like the Piper Pawnee have had lift struts mounted above the wing acting in compression in flight and in tension on the ground ",
			"after": " Sometimes each wing has just a single lift strut as on the Cessna 152 but they often come in pairs sometimes parallel as on the Catalina sometimes splayed or as V form pairs e g Auster Autocrat joined to the fuselage at a single point Many more complicated arrangements have been used often with two primary lift struts augmented by auxiliary interconnections known as jury struts between each other or to the wing or the fuselage Each pair of the inverted V struts of the Pawnee for example is assisted by a pair of vertical support struts 2 ",
