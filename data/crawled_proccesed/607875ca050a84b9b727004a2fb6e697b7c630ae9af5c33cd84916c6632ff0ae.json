			"previous": " Heins examines the question of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography 17 27 contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material 27 She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is based on the idea that minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship 27 Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children s access to potentially inappropriate material believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents 28 She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First Amendment rights guaranteed to adults Fitting art literature and entertainment into neat categories for purposes of prohibitions or ratings inevitably falls victim to highly subjective discretionary decision making that reflects the ideological and personal predilections of the censors and classifiers 17 ",
			"after": " The author believes that determinations of what should be censored from whom should not be made by the government 28 stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship Given the overwhelming difficulty in even defining what it is we want to censor and the significant costs of censorship to society and to youngsters themselves we ought to be sure that real not just symbolic harm results from youthful pursuit of disapproved pleasures and messages before mandating indecency laws Internet filters and other restrictive regimes 17 ",
