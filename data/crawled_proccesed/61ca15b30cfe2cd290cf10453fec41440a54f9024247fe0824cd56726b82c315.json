			"previous": " Red necked grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than 50 m 160 ft between neighbouring nests although semi colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory 18 Semi colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline Such sites safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders down to 10 m 33 ft 25 Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods 26 The territory is defended with various threat displays including wing spreading hunching and bill thrusting 12 pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of the colony when not incubating 27 Breeding is often in loose association with gulls or other colonial water birds 10 ",
			"after": " The monogamous pair forms in April or May on migration or at the breeding water and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences 10 The elaborate breeding performance includes head shaking a head lowered cat display parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds and culminates in a penguin dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright breast to breast 10 11 12 ",
