			"after": " The architectural writer Geoffrey Tyack has written that Nuffield College was Oxford s most important architectural project of the immediate post war years 43 Opinions about the architecture merits of the college have varied although most have been unfavourable The authors of a 1961 booklet on the architecture of modern Oxford said that it was Oxford s biggest monument to barren reaction 4 The Cotswold style was taken absurdly out of context and mercilessly stretched and did not harmonise with the clumsy tower whilst the spire perched uneasily despite its elaborate base 4 An unnamed journalist wrote in The Times in 1959 that the main buildings of the quadrangles were somewhat oddly wedded to small basins which irresistibly suggest a Lilliputian Versailles 44 The same writer said that the tower rose Manhattan wise for 10 storeys through the twentieth century only to have a diminutive spire escaped from the fifteenth push through its top to steal the last laugh 44 Peter Sager too thought that the high rise library could easily stand on the Hudson 17 Sir Howard Colvin said that the utilitarian function of the tower accorded ill with its original ornamental purpose and that the architects had failed to find a satisfactory solution to the repetitive uniformity of fenestration 27 Of the fl che Colvin said that it makes its contribution to the Oxford skyline without any overt reference to historical precedent 27 Geoffrey Tyack also disliked the tower describing it as an ungainly structure that was lit by a monotonous array of windows punched out of the wall surface however he thought the hall was an effective reinterpretation of the traditional collegiate pattern 5 ",
