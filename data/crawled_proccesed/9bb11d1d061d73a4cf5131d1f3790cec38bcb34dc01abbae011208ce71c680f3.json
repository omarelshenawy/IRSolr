			"previous": " On January 18 1909 Brenner submitted models to the Mint with a Lincoln profile on the obverse and a reverse design very similar to that on the then current French silver coins showing a tree branch He also proposed designs for a Lincoln half dollar with the late president to appear on one side and a standing Liberty design almost identical to the obverse of the same French coins Leach replied on February 2 that no change to the half dollar could be made without congressional approval By February 9 Leach had discovered the origin of the branch design although numismatic historian Don Taxay notes that it is odd Leach had not discovered the source of the standing Liberty design given that they were on opposite sides of the same French coins 13 Leach did not confront the sculptor with the artistic borrowing but instead simply ruled out the submitted designs as unsuitable for the reverse of the cent 13 He urged the sculptor to prepare a simple design bearing the denomination the country s name and the motto E pluribus unum 14 Brenner worked quickly and on February 17 delivered models for both obverse and reverse similar to the eventual coin though with a somewhat larger bust of Lincoln and the motto In God We Trust omitted 15 As a design element on the reverse Brenner used two ears of durum wheat 16 The designs were shown to President Roosevelt who approved them although Roosevelt required UNITED which Brenner had spelled VNITED to be spelled in the conventional way 17 After Leach examined the models he objected to the fact that Brenner had put his full surname on the obverse Brenner wrote in return I shall take it out and put it in small letters on the reverse 15 ",
			"after": " On March 4 1909 the day on which Roosevelt left office replaced by William Howard Taft Brenner met with Mint Engraver Charles E Barber in Philadelphia Barber had written to Leach suggesting that Brenner s designs would have to be modified to be suitable for coinage 18 On March 15 Brenner wrote to Leach stating that Barber seemed in no hurry to have the new coins produced 19 Brenner also complained that the Mint was losing detail as it reduced the large models to coin sized hubs Barber had been stung by criticism that he had lost detail in this way with the new gold coins and he raised no objection to having the reductions done by an outside silversmith 20 After several hubs were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of New York Barber sank a master die and sent it to Brenner for retouching 21 ",
