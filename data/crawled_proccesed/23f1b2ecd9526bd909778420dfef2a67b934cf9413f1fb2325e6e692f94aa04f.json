			"previous": " Besides the integration of southern state and black cadets the post war academy also struggled with the issue of hazing In its first 65 years hazing was uncommon or non existent beyond small pranks played upon the incoming freshmen but took a harsher tone as Civil War veterans began to fill the incoming freshman classes The upper class cadets saw it as their duty to teach the plebes their manners 38 Hazing at the academy entered the national spotlight with the death of former cadet Oscar L Booz on 3 December 1900 Congressional hearings which included testimony by Douglas MacArthur investigated his death and the pattern of systemic hazing of freshmen 39 When MacArthur returned as superintendent he made an effort to end the practice of hazing the incoming freshmen by placing Army sergeants in charge of training new cadets during freshman summer 40 The practice of hazing continued on some levels well into the late 20th century but is no longer allowed in the present day 41 ",
