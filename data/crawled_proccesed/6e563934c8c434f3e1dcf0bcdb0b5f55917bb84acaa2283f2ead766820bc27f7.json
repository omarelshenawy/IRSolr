			"previous": " Organic chemistry is a specific discipline within chemistry which involves the scientific study of the structure properties composition reactions and preparation by synthesis or by other means of chemical compounds consisting primarily of carbon and hydrogen which may contain any number of other elements including nitrogen oxygen halogens as well as phosphorus silicon and sulfur ",
			"after": " The original definition of organic chemistry came from the misconception that organic compounds were always related to life processes Not all organic compounds support life on Earth but life as we know it also depends heavily on inorganic chemistry for example many enzymes rely on transition metals such as iron and copper and materials such as shells teeth and bones are part organic part inorganic in composition Apart from elemental carbon inorganic chemistry deals only with simple carbon compounds with molecular structures which do not contain carbon to carbon connections its oxides acids carbonates carbides and minerals This does not mean that single carbon organic compounds do not exist viz methane and its simple derivatives Biochemistry mainly deals with the chemistry of proteins and other large biomolecules ",
