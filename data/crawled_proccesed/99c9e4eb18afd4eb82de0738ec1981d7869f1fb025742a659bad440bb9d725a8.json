			"after": " Lambeosaurus is the type genus of the Lambeosaurinae the subfamily of hadrosaurids that had hollow skull crests Among the lambeosaurines it is closely related to similar dinosaurs such as Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus with little separating them but crest form 4 The relationships among these dinosaur genera are difficult to pick out Some early classifications placed these genera in the tribe Corythosaurini which was found by David Evans and Robert Reisz to include Lambeosaurus as the sister taxon to a clade made up of Corythosaurus Hypacrosaurus and the Russian genus Olorotitan these lambeosaurines with Nipponosaurus 6 However later researchers pointed out that due to the rules of priority set forth by the ICZN any tribe containing Lambeosaurus is properly named Lambeosaurini and that therefore the name Corythosaurini is a junior synonym 9 The following cladogram illustrating the relationships of Lambeosaurus and its close relatives was recovered in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis by Albert Prieto M rquez Luis M Chiappe and Shantanu H Joshi 10 ",
