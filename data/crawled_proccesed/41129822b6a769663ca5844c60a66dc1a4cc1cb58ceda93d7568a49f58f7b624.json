			"after": " In physics time is a fourth dimension Physicists argue that space time can be understood as a sort of stretchy fabric that bends due to forces such as gravity In classical physics the future is just a half of the timeline which is the same for all observers In special relativity the flow of time is relative to the observer s frame of reference The faster an observer is traveling away from a reference object the slower that object seems to move through time Hence future is not an objective notion anymore A more significant notion is absolute future or the future light cone While a person can move backwards or forwards in the three spatial dimensions many physicists argue you are only able to move forward in time 6 ",
