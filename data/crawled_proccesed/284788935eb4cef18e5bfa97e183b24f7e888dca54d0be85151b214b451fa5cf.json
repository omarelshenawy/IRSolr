			"previous": " The 757 was intended to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727 15 The focus on fuel efficiency reflected airline concerns over operating costs which had grown amid rising oil prices during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 9 16 Design targets included a 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines plus an additional 10 percent from aerodynamic improvements versus preceding aircraft 16 Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency 9 The maximum take off weight MTOW was set at 220 000 pounds 99 800 kg 17 which was 10 000 pounds 4 540 kg more than the 727 18 The 757 s higher power to weight ratio allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in hot and high climates offering better takeoff performance than that offered by competing aircraft Competitors needed longer takeoff runs at airports at higher elevations with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air Boeing also offered options for higher payload capability 17 19 ",
			"after": " The twin engine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three and four engine designs 20 Launch customers Eastern Air Lines and British Airways selected the RB211 535C turbofan built by Rolls Royce which was capable of 37 400 pounds force 166 kN of thrust 21 This marked the first time that a Boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the U S 9 Domestic manufacturer Pratt Whitney subsequently offered the 38 200 pounds force 170 kN thrust PW2037 21 which Delta Air Lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in November 1980 9 22 General Electric also offered its CF6 32 engine early in the program but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand 23 ",
