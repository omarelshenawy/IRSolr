			"after": " In a small sample of 11 deceased dogs Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11 7 years maximum 15 9 yrs 31 A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13 41 years with a standard deviation of 2 36 years 32 The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13 years 33 There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey born in 1910 and living for 29 5 years but the record is unverified 34 Even if true Bluey s record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed 32 It remains however that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class 32 Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14 years of age and some maintain their sight hearing and even their teeth until their final days 21 ",
