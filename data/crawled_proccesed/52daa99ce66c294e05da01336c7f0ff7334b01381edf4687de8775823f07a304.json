			"after": " A quantum computer is any device for computation that makes direct use of distinctively quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on data In a classical or conventional computer the amount of data is measured by bits in a quantum computer it is measured by qubits The basic principle of quantum computation is that the quantum properties of particles can be used to represent and structure data and that devised quantum mechanisms can be used to perform operations with this data For a generally accessible overview of quantum computing see Quantum Computing with Molecules an article in Scientific American by Neil Gershenfeld and Isaac L Chuang ",
