			"after": " RADAR is a system that uses radio waves to determine and map the location direction and or speed of both moving and fixed objects such as aircraft ships motor vehicles weather formations and terrain A transmitter emits radio waves which are reflected by the target and detected by a receiver typically in the same location as the transmitter Although the radio signal returned is usually very weak radio signals can easily be amplified so radar can detect objects at ranges where other emissions such as sound or visible light would be too weak to detect Radar is used in many contexts including meteorological detection of precipitation air traffic control police detection of speeding traffic and by the military ",
