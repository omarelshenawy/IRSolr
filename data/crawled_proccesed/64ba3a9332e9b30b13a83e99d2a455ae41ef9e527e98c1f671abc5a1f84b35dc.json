			"previous": " During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong the Japanese army committed atrocities against civilians and POWs such as the St Stephen s College massacre Local residents also suffered widespread food shortages limited rationing and hyper inflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from Hong Kong Dollars to Japanese military banknotes The initial ratio of 2 1 was gradually devalued to 4 1 and ownership of Hong Kong Dollars was declared illegal and punishable by harsh torture Due to starvation mass executions and forced deportation for slave labour to mainland China the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1 6 million in 1941 to 600 000 in 1945 when Britain resumed control of the colony on 30 August 1945 65 ",
			"after": " Hong Kong s population recovered quickly after the war as a wave of skilled migrants from China flooded in for refuge from the Chinese Civil War When the Communists gained control of mainland China in 1949 even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution 58 Many newcomers especially those who had been based in the major port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou established corporations and small to medium sized businesses and shifted their base operations to British Hong Kong 58 The Chinese Communist Party s establishment of a socialist state in China on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong s open border to mainland China In 1951 a boundary zone was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist China Border posts in the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the movement of people and goods into and out of British Hong Kong ",
