			"previous": " In the postwar period the bell became a symbol of freedom used in the Cold War The bell was chosen for the symbol of a savings bond campaign in 1950 The purpose of this campaign as Vice President Alben Barkley put it was to make the country so strong that no one can impose ruthless godless ideologies on us 66 In 1955 former residents of nations behind the Iron Curtain were allowed to tap the bell as a symbol of hope and encouragement to their compatriots 67 Foreign dignitaries such as Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and West Berlin Mayor Ernst Reuter were brought to the bell and they commented that the bell symbolized the link between the United States and their nations 66 During the 1960s the bell was the site of several protests both for the civil rights movement and by various protesters supporting or opposing the Vietnam War 68 ",
			"after": " Almost from the start of its stewardship the Park Service sought to move the bell from Independence Hall to a structure where it would be easier to care for the bell and accommodate visitors The first such proposal was withdrawn in 1958 after considerable public protest 69 The Park Service tried again as part of the planning for the 1976 United States Bicentennial The Independence National Historical Park Advisory Committee proposed in 1969 that the bell be moved out of Independence Hall as the building could not accommodate the millions expected to visit Philadelphia for the Bicentennial 70 In 1972 the Park Service announced plans to build a large glass tower for the bell at the new visitors center at South Third Street and Chestnut Street two blocks east of Independence Hall at a cost of 5 million but citizens again protested the move Instead in 1973 the Park Service proposed to build a smaller glass pavilion for the bell at the north end of Independence Mall between Arch and Race Streets Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo agreed with the pavilion idea but proposed that the pavilion be built across Chestnut Street from Independence Hall which the state feared would destroy the view of the historic building from the mall area 71 Rizzo s view prevailed and the bell was moved to a glass and steel Liberty Bell Pavilion about 200 yards 180 m from its old home at Independence Hall as the Bicentennial year began 72 ",
