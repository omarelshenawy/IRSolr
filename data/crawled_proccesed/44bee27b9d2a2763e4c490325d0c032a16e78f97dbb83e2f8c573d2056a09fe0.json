			"previous": " The phase of water i e whether it assumes the form of a solid liquid or gas is determined by its temperature and pressure For example in the case of liquid gas transition at each pressure there is a special transition temperature such that if the sample temperature is even a little above the sample will be a gas but if the sample temperature is even a little below the sample will be a liquid see phase transition For example at the standard atmospheric pressure is 100 C 212 F The transition temperature decreases with decreasing pressure which explains why water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes and at higher temperatures in a pressure cooker see here for more information In the case of water vapor in air the corresponding to the partial pressure of water vapor is called the dew point The solid liquid transition also happens around a specific transition temperature called the melting point For most substances the melting point also decreases with decreasing pressure although water ice in particular in its Ih form which is the most familiar one is a prominent exception to this rule ",
			"after": " Here we follow the discussion in Ref 3 To first approximation the formation of vortex cores is thermodynamically an adiabatic process i e one with no exchange of heat In such a process the drop in pressure is accompanied by a drop in temperature according to the equation",
