			"previous": " Systems are able to transport large amounts of people quickly over short distances with little land use Variations of rapid transit include people movers small scale light metro and the commuter rail hybrid S Bahn More than 160 cities have rapid transit systems totalling more than 8 000 km 4 971 mi of track and 7 000 stations Twenty five cities have systems under construction ",
			"after": " Personal rapid transit is an automated cab service that runs on rails or a guideway This is an uncommon mode of transportation excluding elevators due to the complexity of automation A fully implemented system might provide most of the convenience of individual automobiles with the efficiency of public transit The crucial innovation is that the automated vehicles carry just a few passengers turn off the guideway to pick up passengers permitting other PRT vehicles to continue at full speed and drop them off to the location of their choice rather than at a stop Conventional transit simulations show that PRT might attract many auto users in problematic medium density urban areas A number of experimental systems are in progress One might compare personal rapid transit to the more labor intensive taxi or paratransit modes of transportation or to the by now automated elevators common in many publicly accessible areas ",
