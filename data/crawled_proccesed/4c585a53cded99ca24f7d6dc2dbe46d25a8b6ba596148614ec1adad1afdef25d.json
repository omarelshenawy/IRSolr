			"after": " As Edison was expanding his direct current DC power delivery system he began receiving stiff competition from companies installing alternating current AC systems From the early 1880s on AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US With development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885 1886 it became possible to transmit AC very long distances over thinner and cheaper wires and step down the voltage at the destination for distribution to users This allowed AC to be used not only in street lighting but also in lighting for small business and domestic customers the market Edison s patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system had been designed to supply 67 Edison s DC empire began suffering from one of its chief drawbacks it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities Edison s DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers who were more than one mile from the plant and the short range left a patchwork of un supplied customers in between plants Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all This left a large part of market without electrical service and AC companies were expanding into this gap ",
