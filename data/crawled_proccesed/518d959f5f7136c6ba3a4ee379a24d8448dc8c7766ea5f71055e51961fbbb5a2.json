			"previous": " The semantic view of theories which identifies scientific theories with models rather than propositions has replaced the received view as the dominant position in theory formulation in the philosophy of science 33 34 35 A model is a logical framework intended to represent reality a model of reality similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country 36 37 ",
			"after": " In this approach theories are a specific category of models which fulfill the necessary criteria see above One can use language to describe a model however the theory is the model or a collection of similar models and not the description of the model A model of the solar system for example might consist of abstract objects that represent the sun and the planets These objects have associated properties e g positions velocities and masses The model parameters e g Newton s Law of Gravitation determine how the positions and velocities change with time This model can then be tested to see whether it accurately predicts future observations astronomers can verify that the positions of the model s objects over time match the actual positions of the planets For most planets the Newtonian model s predictions are accurate for Mercury it is slightly inaccurate and the model of general relativity must be used instead ",
