			"previous": " Modern theoretical computer science research is based on these basic developments but includes many other mathematical and interdisciplinary problems that have been posed  With the development of quantum mechanics in the beginning of the 20th century came the concept that mathematical operations could be performed on an entire particle wavefunction In other words one could compute functions on multiple states simultaneously This led to the concept of a quantum computer in the latter half of the 20th century that took off in the 1990s when Peter Shor showed that such methods could be used to factor large numbers in polynomial time which if implemented would render most modern public key cryptography systems uselessly insecure citation needed ",
