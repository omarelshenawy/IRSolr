			"previous": " The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers in comparison to earlier systems but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard the World Wide Web was non proprietary making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions On 30 April 1993 CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone with no fees due 21 Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System ",
			"after": " Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction 22 of the Mosaic web browser 23 in 1993 a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign NCSA UIUC led by Marc Andreessen Funding for Mosaic came from the U S High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 one of several computing developments initiated by U S Senator Al Gore 24 Prior to the release of Mosaic graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web s popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers WAIS Mosaic s graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular Internet protocol ",
