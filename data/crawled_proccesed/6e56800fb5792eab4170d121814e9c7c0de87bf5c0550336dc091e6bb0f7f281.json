			"after": " The discovery of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants 148 and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant scientists in the United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s 149 In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers but instead produced less pigmented fully or partially white flowers indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased in fact both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers Soon after a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa 150 although it was not immediately recognized as related Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation 151 This phenomenon was called co suppression of gene expression but the molecular mechanism remained unknown 152 ",
