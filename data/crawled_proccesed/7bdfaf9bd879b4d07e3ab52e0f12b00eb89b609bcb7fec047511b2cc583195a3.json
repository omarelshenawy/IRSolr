			"previous": " The Raft of the Medusa was first shown at the 1819 Paris Salon under the generic title Sc ne de Naufrage Scene of Shipwreck although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers 27 G ricault s Raft was the star at the Salon of 1819 It strikes and attracts all eyes Le Journal de Paris Louis XVIII visited the Salon three days before the opening and reportedly said Monsieur vous venez de faire un naufrage qui n en est pas un pour vous 46 freely translated as Monsieur G ricault your shipwreck is certainly no disaster 47 Critics were divided the horror and terribilit of the subject exercised fascination but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a pile of corpses whose realism they considered a far cry from the ideal beauty incarnated by Girodet s Pygmalion and Galatea which triumphed the same year G ricault s work expressed a paradox how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting how could the painter reconcile art and reality Marie Philippe Coupin de la Couperie a French painter and contemporary of G ricault was categorical Monsieur G ricault seems mistaken The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes not to repel The painting had fervent admirers too including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal who praised its political theme its liberal position the advancement of the negro the critique of ultra royalism and its modernity For French historian Jules Michelet our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa 3 ",
			"after": " The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1 300 individual paintings 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs The contemporary critic Frank Anderson Trapp suggested that the volume of work shown and the sheer scale of the event indicates the ambition behind the exhibition Trapp notes that the fact that 100 grandiose history paintings were included in itself proclaimed a munificent government patronage for aside from a few affluent competitors like G ricault only those favoured by a major commission could afford the outlay of time energy and money necessary for undertakings of this kind 7 ",
