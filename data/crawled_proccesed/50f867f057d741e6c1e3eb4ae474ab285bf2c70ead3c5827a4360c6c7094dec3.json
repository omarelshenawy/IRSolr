			"previous": " Western attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades In the mid 1960s and early 1970s killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness starting with the first live capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964 185 So little was known at the time it was nearly two months before the whale s keepers discovered what food fish it was willing to eat To the surprise of those who saw him Moby Doll was a docile nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans 195 ",
			"after": " Between 1964 and 1976 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria and public interest in the animals grew In the 1970s research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species complex social structure its use of vocal communication and its extraordinarily stable mother offspring bonds Through photo identification techniques individuals were named and tracked over decades 196 ",
