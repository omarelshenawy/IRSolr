			"previous": " Camouflage is a common defensive mechanism in frogs Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal during the day they seek out a position where they can blend into the background and remain undetected Some frogs have the ability to change colour but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours For example White s tree frog Litoria caerulea varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature and the Pacific tree frog Pseudacris regilla has green and brown morphs plain or spotted and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour 55 Features such as warts and skin folds are usually found on ground dwelling frogs where a smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage Certain frogs change colour between night and day as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract 32 ",
