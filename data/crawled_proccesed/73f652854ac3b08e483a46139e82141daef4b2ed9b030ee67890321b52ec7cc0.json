			"after": " As runways at sea aircraft carriers have a flat top flight deck which launches and recovers aircraft Aircraft launch forward into the wind and are recovered from astern The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier for example the fact that it is a ship means that a full length runway would be costly to construct and maintain This affects take off procedure as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift This either requires a thrust boost a vertical component to its velocity or a reduced take off load to lower mass The differing types of deck configuration as above influence the structure of the flight deck The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself ",
