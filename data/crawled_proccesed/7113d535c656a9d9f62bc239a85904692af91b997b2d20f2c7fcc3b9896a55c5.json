			"previous": " In 1964 Volkswagen acquired Auto Union and in 1969 NSU Motorenwerke AG NSU The former company owned the historic Audi brand which had disappeared after the Second World War VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company and would go on to develop it as its luxury vehicle marque The purchase of Auto Union and NSU proved to be a pivotal point in Volkswagen s history as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air cooled models went into decline ",
			"after": " Volkswagen was in serious trouble by 1973 17 The Type 3 and Type 4 models had sold in much smaller numbers than the Beetle and the NSU based K70 also failed to woo buyers Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets The company knew that Beetle production had to end but faced a conundrum of how to replacing it VW s ownership of Audi Auto Union proved to be beneficial with its expertise in front wheel drive and water cooled engines that Volkswagen needed to produce a credible Beetle successor Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens known as the Passat Scirocco Golf and Polo ",
