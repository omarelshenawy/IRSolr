			"previous": " Diptychs were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid 15th to the early 16th century They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges or less often a fixed frame 136 the panels were usually linked thematically Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book allowing both an interior and exterior view while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images 137 Originating from conventions in Books of Hours diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces 138 Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side 139 They were usually near miniature in scale and some emulated medieval treasury art small pieces made of gold or ivory The tracery seen in works such as van der Weyden s Virgin and Child reflects ivory carving of the period 140 The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the House of Valois Burgundy 137 and refined by Hugo van der Goes Hans Memling and later Jan van Scorel 139 ",
			"after": " Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child 141 reflecting the Virgin s contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion 142 The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits often of husbands and their wives 139 alongside saints or the Virgin and Child 137 The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length with hands clasped in prayer 137 The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the place of honour alongside the divine 143 ",
