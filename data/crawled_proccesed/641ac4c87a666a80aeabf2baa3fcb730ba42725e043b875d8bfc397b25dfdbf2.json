			"previous": " Despite these advances the liquid compass was not introduced generally into the Royal Navy until 1908 An early version developed by RN Captain Creak proved to be operational under heavy gunfire and seas but was felt to lack navigational precision compared with the design by Lord Kelvin 11 78 However with ship and gun sizes continuously increasing the advantages of the liquid compass over the Kelvin compass became unavoidably apparent to the Admiralty and after widespread adoption by other navies the liquid compass was generally adopted by the Royal Navy as well 11 ",
			"after": " Liquid compasses were next adapted for aircraft In 1909 Captain F O Creagh Osborne Superintendent of Compasses at the British Admiralty introduced his Creagh Osborne aircraft compass which used a mixture of alcohol and distilled water to damp the compass card 79 80 After the success of this invention Capt Creagh Osborne adapted his design to a much smaller pocket model 81 for individual use 82 by officers of artillery or infantry receiving a patent in 1915 83 ",
