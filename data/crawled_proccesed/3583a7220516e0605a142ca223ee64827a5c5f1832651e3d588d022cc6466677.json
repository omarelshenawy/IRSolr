			"previous": " Only recently the assembly process of the 19S regulatory particle has been elucidated to considerable extent The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents the base and the lid Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones Hsm3 S5b Nas2 p27 Rpn14 PAAF1 and Nas6 gankyrin names for yeast mammals 34 These assembly chaperones bind to the AAA ATPase subunits and their main function seems to be to ensure proper assembly of the heterohexameric AAA ATPase ring To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately whether the assembly is templated by the 20S core particle or whether alternative assembly pathways exist In addition to the four assembly chaperones the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 Usp14 also promotes base assembly but it is not essential 35 The lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones 36 ",
			"after": " Proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue that requires the coordinated reactions of three enzymes In the first step a ubiquitin activating enzyme known as E1 hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule This is then transferred to E1 s active site cysteine residue in concert with the adenylylation of a second ubiquitin 37 This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 In the last step a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases E3 recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers in the form of a polyubiquitin chain before it is recognized by the proteasome lid 38 It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system 39 The number of E1 E2 and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system ",
