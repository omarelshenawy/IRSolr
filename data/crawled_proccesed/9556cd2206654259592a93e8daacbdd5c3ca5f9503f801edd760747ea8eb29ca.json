			"after": " This is the preferred method of constructing an all aluminum fuselage First a series of frames in the shape of the fuselage cross sections are held in position on a rigid fixture These frames are then joined with lightweight longitudinal elements called stringers These are in turn covered with a skin of sheet aluminum attached by riveting or by bonding with special adhesives The fixture is then disassembled and removed from the completed fuselage shell which is then fitted out with wiring controls and interior equipment such as seats and luggage bins Most modern large aircraft are built using this technique but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage As the accuracy of the final product is determined largely by the costly fixture this form is suitable for series production where a large number of identical aircraft are to be produced Early examples of this type include the Douglas Aircraft DC 2 and DC 3 civil aircraft and the Boeing B 17 Flying Fortress Most metal light aircraft are constructed using this process ",
