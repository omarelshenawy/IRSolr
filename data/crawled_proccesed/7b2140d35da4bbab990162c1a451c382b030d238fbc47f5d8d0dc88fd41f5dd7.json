			"previous": " Compression of air creates heat the air is warmer after compression Expansion requires heat If no extra heat is added the air will be much colder after expansion If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion the efficiency of the storage improves considerably 10 There are three ways in which a CAES system can deal with the heat Air storage can be adiabatic diabatic or isothermal Several companies have also done design work for vehicles using compressed air power 31 32 ",
			"after": " Flywheel energy storage FES works by accelerating a rotor flywheel to a very high speed and maintaining the energy in the system as rotational energy with the least friction losses possible When energy is extracted from the system the flywheel s rotational speed is reduced as a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy adding energy to the system correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel ",
