			"previous": " Initially training was done by short hops in primary gliders which are very basic aircraft with no cockpit and minimal instruments 21 Since shortly after World War II training has always been done in two seat dual control gliders but high performance two seaters are also used to share the workload and the enjoyment of long flights Originally skids were used for landing but the majority now land on wheels often retractable Some gliders known as motor gliders are designed for unpowered flight but can deploy piston rotary jet or electric engines 22 Gliders are classified by the FAI for competitions into glider competition classes mainly on the basis of span and flaps ",
			"after": " A class of ultralight sailplanes including some known as microlift gliders and some as airchairs has been defined by the FAI based on a maximum weight They are light enough to be transported easily and can be flown without licensing in some countries Ultralight gliders have performance similar to hang gliders but offer some additional crash safety as the pilot can be strapped in an upright seat within a deformable structure Landing is usually on one or two wheels which distinguishes these craft from hang gliders Several commercial ultralight gliders have come and gone but most current development is done by individual designers and home builders ",
