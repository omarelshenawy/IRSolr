			"previous": " In August after the Japanese government repeatedly refused surrender demands as specifically outlined in the Potsdam Declaration and with the invasion of mainland Japan imminent Truman authorized the atomic bombing of Japan Although it was not known how devastating the explosions and the aftermath would be Truman like most Americans was not inclined to be merciful toward the Japanese in the wake of the long years of war Truman always said that his decision to attack Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250 000 to 500 000 American casualties He also knew that such an invasion program could cost 2 billion and so he was not inclined to forgo an alternative that might quickly end the war Hiroshima was bombed on August 6 and Nagasaki three days later When the Japanese were still slow to surrender Truman ordered a massive conventional air raid on Tokyo for August 13 Japan agreed to surrender the following day 67 68 ",
