			"after": " The common toad usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short shuffling jumps involving all four legs It spends the day concealed in a lair that it has hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous It emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in the dark while hunting It is most active in wet weather By morning it has returned to its base and may occupy the same place for several months It is voracious and eats woodlice slugs beetles caterpillars flies earthworms and even small mice 21 22 Small fast moving prey may be caught by a flick of the tongue while larger items are grabbed with the jaws Having no teeth it swallows food whole in a series of gulps 21 It does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small dark coloured moving object it encounters at night A research study showed that it would snap at a moving 1 cm 0 4 in piece of black paper as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece 23 Toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at very low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything 24 Periodically the common toad sheds its skin This comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed 21 ",
