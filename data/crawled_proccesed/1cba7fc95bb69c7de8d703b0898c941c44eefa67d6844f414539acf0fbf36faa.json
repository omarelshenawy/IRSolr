			"after": " The 20S proteasome is both ubiquitous and essential in eukaryotes Some prokaryotes including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU whose gene products are a multimeric protease arranged in a two layered ring and an ATPase 58 The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome 59 In general HslV is not essential in bacteria and not all bacteria possess it whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems 58 Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase most notably ClpP and ClpX This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential ",
