			"previous": " Velociraptor like other dromaeosaurids had a large manus hand with three strongly curved claws which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern birds The second digit was the longest of the three digits present while the first was shortest The structure of the carpal wrist bones prevented pronation of the wrist and forced the hands to be held with the palmar surface facing inwards medially not downwards 5 The first digit of the foot as in other theropods was a small dewclaw However whereas most theropods had feet with three digits contacting the ground dromaeosaurids like Velociraptor walked on only their third and fourth digits The second digit for which Velociraptor is most famous was highly modified and held retracted off the ground It bore a relatively large sickle shaped claw typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs This enlarged claw which could grow to over 6 5 cm 2 6 in long around its outer edge 6 was most likely a predatory device used to tear into or restrain struggling prey 6 7 ",
			"after": " As in other dromaeosaurs Velociraptor tails had long bony projections prezygapophyses on the upper surfaces of the vertebrae as well as ossified tendons underneath The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail caudal vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae depending on position in the tail These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail forcing the entire tail to act as a single rod like unit However at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S shape suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought 6 8 ",
