			"previous": " Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to Project Mercury America s first manned space flight program The Center assumed a lead role for the project in its early days and managed the first 250 employees involved in the effort who were stationed at Langley Research Center in Hampton Virginia However the size and scope of Project Mercury soon prompted NASA to build a new Manned Spacecraft Center now the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas Project Mercury s personnel and activities were transferred there in 1961 ",
			"after": " Goddard Space Flight Center remained involved in the manned space flight program providing computer support and radar tracking of flights through a worldwide network of ground stations called the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network STDN However the Center focused primarily on designing unmanned satellites and spacecraft for scientific research missions Goddard pioneered several fields of spacecraft development including modular spacecraft design which reduced costs and made it possible to repair satellites in orbit Goddard s Solar Max satellite launched in 1980 was repaired by astronauts on the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984 The Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990 remains in service and continues to grow in capability thanks to its modular design and multiple servicing missions by the Space Shuttle ",
