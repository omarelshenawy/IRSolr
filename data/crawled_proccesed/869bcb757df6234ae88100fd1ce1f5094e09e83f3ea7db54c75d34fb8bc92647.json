			"after": " Outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum It has effectively no friction allowing stars planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits However even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter 40 By comparison the air we breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter 41 42 The sparse density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km or 10 billion light years 43 In spite of this extinction which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy 44 ",
