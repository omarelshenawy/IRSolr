			"after": " Certain conditions such as low concentrations of oxygen or high concentrations of species such as chloride which complete as anions can interfere with a given alloy s ability to re form a passivating film In the worst case almost all of the surface will remain protected but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified and can cause corrosion pits of several types depending upon conditions While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process In extreme cases the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys citation needed but it can be prevented by control of the alloy s environment ",
