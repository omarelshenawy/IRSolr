			"previous": " The discussion thus far has assumed that extremal functions possess two continuous derivatives although the existence of the integral A requires only first derivatives of trial functions The condition that the first variation vanish at an extremal may be regarded as a weak form of the Euler Lagrange equation The theorem of Du Bois Reymond asserts that this weak form implies the strong form If L has continuous first and second derivatives with respect to all of its arguments and if",
			"after": " Hilbert was the first to give good conditions for the Euler Lagrange equations to give a stationary solution Within a convex area and a positive thrice differentiable Lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the Euler Lagrange equations in the interior ",
