			"previous": " Carbon metabolism in bacteria is either heterotrophic where organic carbon compounds are used as carbon sources or autotrophic meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria green sulfur bacteria and some purple bacteria but also many chemolithotrophic species such as nitrifying or sulfur oxidising bacteria 88 Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy the use of light through photosynthesis or based on chemotrophy the use of chemical substances for energy which are mostly oxidised at the expense of oxygen or alternative electron acceptors aerobic anaerobic respiration ",
			"after": " Bacteria are further divided into lithotrophs that use inorganic electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation by aerobic anaerobic respiration or fermentation and biosynthetic reactions e g carbon dioxide fixation whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds as a source of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction This reaction releases energy that can be used to synthesise ATP and drive metabolism In aerobic organisms oxygen is used as the electron acceptor In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds such as nitrate sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification sulfate reduction and acetogenesis respectively ",
