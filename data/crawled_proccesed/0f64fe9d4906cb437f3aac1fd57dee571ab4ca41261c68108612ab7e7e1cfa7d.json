			"previous": " Broward asked James O Wright an engineer on loan to the State of Florida from the USDA s Bureau of Drainage Investigations to draw up plans for drainage in 1906 Two dredges were built by 1908 but had cut only 6 miles 9 7 km of canals The project quickly ran out of money so Broward sold real estate developer Richard J Bolles a million dollars worth of land in the Everglades 500 000 acres 2 000 km2 before the engineer s report had been submitted 30 Abstracts from Wright s report were given to the IIF stating that eight canals would be enough to drain 1 850 000 acres 7 500 km2 at a cost of a dollar an acre 31 The abstracts were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements and Wright and the USDA were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible 31 Wright s supervisor noted errors in the report as well as undue enthusiasm for draining and delayed its release in 1910 Different unofficial versions of the report circulated some that had been altered by real estate interests and a version hastily put together by Senator Duncan U Fletcher called U S Senate Document 89 included early unrevised statements causing a frenzy of speculation 1 ",
			"after": " Wright s initial report concluded that drainage would not be difficult Building canals would be more cost effective than constructing a dike around Lake Okeechobee The soil would be fertile after drainage the climate would not be adversely affected and the enormous lake would be able to irrigate farmland in the dry season 1 Wright based his conclusions on 15 years of weather data since the recording of precipitation began in the 1890s His calculations concentrated on the towns of Jupiter and Kissimmee Since weather data had not been recorded for any area within the Everglades none was included in the report Furthermore the heaviest year of rain on record Wright assumed was atypical and he urged that canals should not be constructed to bear that amount of water due to the expense Wright s calculations for what canals should be able to hold were off by 55 percent 32 His most fundamental mistake however was designing the canals for a maximum rainfall of 4 inches 10 cm of water a day based on flawed data for July and August rainfall despite available data that indicated torrential downpours of 10 inches 25 cm and 12 inches 30 cm had occurred in 24 hour periods 1 ",
