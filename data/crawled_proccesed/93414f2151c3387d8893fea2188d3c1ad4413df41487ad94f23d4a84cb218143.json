			"previous": "  Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay or Shapiro delay the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction 64 In the parameterized post Newtonian formalism PPN measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space 65 ",
			"after": " The current models of cosmology are based on Einstein s field equations which include the cosmological constant since it has important influence on the large scale dynamics of the cosmos  where is the spacetime metric 115 Isotropic and homogeneous solutions of these enhanced equations the Friedmann Lema tre Robertson Walker solutions 116 allow physicists to model a universe that has evolved over the past 14 billion years from a hot early Big Bang phase 117 Once a small number of parameters for example the universe s mean matter density have been fixed by astronomical observation 118 further observational data can be used to put the models to the test 119 Predictions all successful include the initial abundance of chemical elements formed in a period of primordial nucleosynthesis 120 the large scale structure of the universe 121 and the existence and properties of a thermal echo from the early cosmos the cosmic background radiation 122 ",
