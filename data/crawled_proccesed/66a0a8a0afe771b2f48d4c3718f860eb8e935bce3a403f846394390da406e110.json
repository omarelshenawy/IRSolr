			"previous": " In 1931 the airline nearly went out of business after TWA Flight 599 a Fokker F 10 shed a wing and crashed on March 31 near Bazaar Kansas killing all eight on board the plane including University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne Investigation revealed that the wing s wooden structure had deteriorated leading it to fail In the wake of the crash the Fokker F 10 was temporarily grounded and a more frequent and rigorous inspection and maintenance regime was put in place making it more expensive to operate The F 10 s public image and that of all wooden structured aircraft also suffered badly from the crash TWA needed a replacement ",
			"after": " The dominant manufacturer of the day was Bill Boeing but his contract with United Air Lines did not allow him to sell his 247 to competing lines Frye and other members of TWA approached several other manufacturers including Donald Douglas with specifications for a larger plane On September 20 1932 the contract was signed with Douglas and the DC 1 was delivered to TWA in December 1933 the one and only DC 1 This was followed by the delivery of 32 Douglas DC 2 aircraft that started operations in May 1934 Most were phased out by 1937 as the DC 3 started service but several DC 2 would be operational through the early years of WWII 11 Throughout 1934 Tomlinson and Richter tested the DC 1 and Tomlinson s extensive testing in 1934 and 1935 led to higher altitude over weather flying and cabin pressurization ",
