			"after": " As air traffic and the number of aircraftmovements grew greatly year on year the authorities identified the need to develop a new system for air traffic navigation and control The state as a result marked a number of air corridors for use by civil airlines whilst radio stations were established to regulate such traffic and divert it away from sensitive and restricted areas By 1938 the airport was equipped with 16 immigration checkpoints for passengers both departing and arriving on international flights These posts were then manned by the Polish Border Guard By 1937 the airport had also received new radio navigation equipment and was using Lorenz beam technology to assure the safety of landings and approaches over Warsaw during periods of poor visibility or bad weather On the eve of World War II Ok cie airport was connected by regular scheduled flights with 6 domestic and 17 foreign airports among which were Tel Aviv then in Palestine and Beirut in Lebanon there were also plans to soon begin transatlantic service to the United States 5 ",
