			"after": " Here the cj are simply the coefficients of the polynomial z p z z0 and we let k be the index of the first coefficient following the constant term that is non zero But now we see that for z sufficiently close to z0 this has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial in the sense that as is easy to check the function is bounded by some positive constant M in some neighborhood of z0 Therefore if we define and let then for any sufficiently small positive number r so that the bound M mentioned above holds using the triangle inequality we see that",
