			"previous": " One of the lahars virtually erased the small town of Armero in Tolima which lay in the Lagunilla River valley Only one quarter of its 28 700 inhabitants survived 35 The second lahar which descended through the valley of Chinchin River killed about 1 800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of Chinchin in the department of Caldas 37 In total over 23 000 people were killed and approximately 5 000 were injured 35 More than 5 000 homes were destroyed 35 The Armero tragedy as the event came to be known was the second deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pel e 38 and is the fourth deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history 39 It is also the deadliest known lahar 8 and Colombia s worst natural disaster 40 ",
			"after": " The loss of life during the 1985 eruption was due partly to the fact that scientists did not know precisely when the eruption would occur and the authorities would not take costly preventative measures without clear warnings of imminent danger 41 Because the volcano s last substantial eruption occurred 140 years ago it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented locals even called it the Sleeping Lion 26 Hazard maps showing Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation with Armero s mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening 42 Another factor was the storm that hit that evening causing electrical outages and hindering communications Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero but failed to make radio contact 43 ",
