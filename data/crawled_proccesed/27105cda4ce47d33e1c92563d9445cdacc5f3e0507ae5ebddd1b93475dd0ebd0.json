			"previous": " The Metacomet Ridge hosts a combination of microclimates unusual to the region Dry hot upper ridges support oak savannas often dominated by chestnut oak and a variety of understory grasses and ferns Eastern red cedar a dry loving species clings to the barren edges of cliffs Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby Appalachians containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak hickory forest ecosystem types Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines blocking sunlight and creating damp cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium loving plants uncommon in the region Miles of high cliffs make ideal raptor habitat and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor ",
