			"previous": " Scottish Gaelic should not be confused with Scots the English derived language varieties which had come to be spoken in most of the Lowlands of Scotland by the early modern era Prior to the 15th century these dialects were known as Inglis English by its own speakers with Gaelic being called Scottis Scottish From the late 15th century however it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as Erse Irish and the Lowland vernacular as Scottis 11 Today Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish so the word Erse in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used citation needed ",
			"after": " The traditional view was that Gaelic language was brought to Scotland probably in the 4th century by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of D l Riata on Scotland s west coast 12 13 This is based mostly on medieval writings from the 9th and 10th centuries However this view is no longer universally accepted Archeologists say there is no archeological or placename evidence for a migration or invasion 14 In his academic paper Were the Scots Irish archeologist Ewan Campbell suggests that in the maritime province of northern Ireland and western Scotland sea communications dominated and allowed a shared archaic language to be maintained isolated from linguistic developments which were taking place east of the Highland massif 14 ",
