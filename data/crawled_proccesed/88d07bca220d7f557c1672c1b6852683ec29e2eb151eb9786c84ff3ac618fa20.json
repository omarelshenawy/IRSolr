			"previous": " Two characters the Pardoner and the Summoner whose roles apply the church s secular power are both portrayed as deeply corrupt greedy and abusive A pardoner in Chaucer s day was a person from whom one bought Church indulgences for forgiveness of sins but pardoners were often thought guilty of abusing their office for their own gain Chaucer s Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares 35 The Summoner is a Church officer who brought sinners to the church court for possible excommunication and other penalties Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests Chaucer s Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins he is threatening to bring others to court for and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner 36 In The Friar s Tale one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil not God 37 ",
			"after": " Churchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk the Prioress the Nun s Priest and the Second Nun Monastic orders which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world had by Chaucer s time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money while peasants worked in their employ 38 The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church The Monk and the Prioress on the other hand while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner fall far short of the ideal for their orders Both are expensively dressed show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth 39 The Prioress s Tale is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy a blood libel against Jews which became a part of English literary tradition 40 The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century 41 ",
