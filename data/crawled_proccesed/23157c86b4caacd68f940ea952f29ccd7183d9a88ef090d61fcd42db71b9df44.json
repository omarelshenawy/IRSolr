			"after": " Weighing between 16 and 20 kg 35 and 44 lb Babakotia radofilai was a medium sized lemur and noticeably smaller than the large sloth lemurs Archaeoindris and Palaeopropithecus but larger than the small sloth lemurs Mesopropithecus 5 2 In many ways it had an intermediate level of adaptations for suspensory behavior between the large sloth lemurs and the small sloth lemurs 2 3 11 9 12 This includes its highly mobile hip and ankle joints as well as other specializations in the vertebral column pelvis and limbs 12 Its forelimbs were 20 longer than its hind limbs giving it a higher intermembral index 119 than Mesopropithecus 97 to 113 suggesting that it was convergently similar to arboreal sloths 12 13 It had a reduced tarsus and curved elongated digits adapted for grasping and suggesting suspensory behavior 12 14 Its hind feet were reduced making it well adapted for climbing and hanging like in other palaeopropithecids but not leaping like in indriids 5 2 3 Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrated that this species was a vertical climber 15 Additionally analysis of its semicircular canals 16 lumbar vertebrae and its spinous processes indicate slow movement and climbing antipronograde adaptations but not necessarily sloth like hanging vertical clinging or leaping 17 Therefore it was likely a slow climber like a loris and also exhibited some suspensory behavior like a sloth 8 ",
