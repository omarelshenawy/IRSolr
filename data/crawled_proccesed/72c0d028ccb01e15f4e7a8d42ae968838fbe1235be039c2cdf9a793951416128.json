			"previous": " The Hairpin Banksia s infructescence is a typical Banksia cone like structure with up to 100 crowded embedded follicles which are 1 2 4 centimetres 1 in in diameter these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed while the others regenerate from buds around the base of the lignotuber 2 Old flower spikes fade to brown then grey with age Old flower parts usually persist for a long time giving the infructescence a hairy appearance 2 In Central and North Queensland old cones of both var spinulosa and var collina are generally bare 6 ",
			"after": " The first known specimens of B spinulosa were collected near Sydney by John White Surgeon General to the British colony of New South Wales sometime between 1788 and 1793 He called it Prickly leaved Banksia though this name has fallen out of use It is uncertain exactly when he first collected the species it may have been before 1790 as there is speculation that a sketch in his 1790 Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales is of a B spinulosa infructescence Text accompanying the figure states",
