			"after": " Mined rough diamonds are converted into gems through a multi step process called cutting Diamonds are extremely hard but also brittle and can be split up by a single blow Therefore diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills scientific knowledge tools and experience Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster that is dispersion of white light whereas the number and area of facets would determine the weight of the final product The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50 68 Several possible shapes are considered but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific but also practical considerations For example the diamond might be intended for display or for wear in a ring or a necklace singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape 69 ",
