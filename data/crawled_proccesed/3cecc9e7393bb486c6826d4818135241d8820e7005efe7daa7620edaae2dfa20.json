			"previous": " By the end of the war turbojet engines were replacing piston engines as the means of propulsion further increasing aircraft speed Since the weight of the engine was so much less than on piston engined fighters having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used depending on requirements This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape and G suits to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers ",
			"after": " In the 1950s radar was fitted to day fighters since pilots could no longer see far enough ahead to prepare for any opposition Since then radar capabilities have grown enormously and are now the primary method of target acquisition Wings were made thinner and swept back to reduce transonic drag which required new manufacturing methods to obtain sufficient strength Skins were no longer sheet metal riveted to a structure but milled from large slabs of alloy The sound barrier was broken and after a few false starts due to required changes in controls speeds quickly reached Mach 2 past which aircraft can t maneuver to avoid attack ",
