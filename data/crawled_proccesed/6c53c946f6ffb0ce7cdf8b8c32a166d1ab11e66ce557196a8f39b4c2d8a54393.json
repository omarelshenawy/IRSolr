			"after": " From an evolutionary standpoint the most predominant characteristic that is often found in polygynous mating systems is extreme sexual dimorphism Sexual dimorphism or the difference in size or appearance between males and females gives males an advantage in fights against each other to demonstrate dominance and win over harems Sexual dimorphism can present in larger body size and canine size 3 Polygyny is beneficial in particular to the male because he has a greater increase in fitness and reproductive success This increase consequently reduces the genetic diversity of the community often leading to increased inbreeding However polygyny is not a particularly beneficial mating system for females because their mate choice is limited to one male Extra pair copulations are a strategy used by females to avoid the sexual conflict caused by polygyny allowing them access to better mate choice 4 ",
