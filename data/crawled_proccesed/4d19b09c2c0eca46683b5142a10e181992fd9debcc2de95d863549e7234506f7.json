			"previous": " In the 1990s the Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL began the HyTECH program for hypersonic propulsion Pratt Whitney received a contract from the AFRL to develop a hydrocarbon fueled scramjet engine which led to the development of the SJX61 engine The SJX61 engine was originally meant for the NASA X 43C which was eventually canceled The engine was applied to the AFRL s Scramjet Engine Demonstrator program in late 2003 4 The scramjet flight test vehicle was designated X 51 on 27 September 2005 5 ",
			"after": " In flight demonstrations the X 51 is carried by a B 52 to an altitude of about 50 000 feet 15 km 9 5 mi and then released over the Pacific Ocean 6 The X 51 is initially propelled by an MGM 140 ATACMS solid rocket booster to approximately Mach 4 5 2 970 mph 4 780 km h The booster is then jettisoned and the vehicle s Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne SJY61 scramjet accelerates it to a top flight speed near Mach 6 7 8 The X 51 uses JP 7 fuel for the SJY61 scramjet carrying some 270 lb 120 kg on board 1 ",
