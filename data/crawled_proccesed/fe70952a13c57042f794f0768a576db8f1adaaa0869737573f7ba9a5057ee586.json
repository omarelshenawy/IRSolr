			"previous": " This led Freud to eventually establish in the course of his clinical practice that a more consistent and effective pattern of symptom relief could be achieved without recourse to hypnosis by encouraging patients to talk freely about whatever ideas or memories occurred to them In addition to this procedure which he called free association Freud found that patients dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of repression which underlay symptom formation By 1896 Freud had abandoned hypnosis and was using the term psychoanalysis to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based 36 ",
			"after": " Freud s development of these new theories took place during a period in which he experienced heart irregularities disturbing dreams and periods of depression a neurasthenia which he linked to the death of his father in 1896 37 and which prompted a self analysis of his own dreams and memories of childhood His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his mother s affections led him to a fundamental revision of his theory of the origin of the neuroses ",
