			"previous": " When considered as beings that a person might actually encounter fairies were noted for their mischief and malice Some pranks ascribed to them such as tangling the hair of sleepers into Elf locks stealing small items or leading a traveler astray are generally harmless But far more dangerous behaviors were also attributed to fairies Any form of sudden death might stem from a fairy kidnapping with the apparent corpse being a wooden stand in with the appearance of the kidnapped person 8 Consumption tuberculosis was sometimes blamed on the fairies forcing young men and women to dance at revels every night causing them to waste away from lack of rest 44 Fairies riding domestic animals such as cows or pigs or ducks could cause paralysis or mysterious illnesses ",
			"after": " As a consequence practical considerations of fairies have normally been advice on averting them In terms of protective charms cold iron is the most familiar but other things are regarded as detrimental to the fairies wearing clothing inside out running water bells especially church bells St John s wort and four leaf clovers among others Some lore is contradictory such as rowan trees in some tales being sacred to the fairies and in other tales being protection against them In Newfoundland folklore the most popular type of fairy protection is bread varying from stale bread to hard tack or a slice of fresh home made bread The belief that bread has some sort of special power is an ancient one Bread is associated with the home and the hearth as well as with industry and the taming of nature and as such seems to be disliked by some types of fairies On the other hand in much of the Celtic folklore baked goods are a traditional offering to the folk as are cream and butter 35 ",
