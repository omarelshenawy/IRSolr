			"after": " Levels of genetic diversity within individual populations of B cuneata are unusually high for a rare and endangered species 29 but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B cuneata and the birds that pollinate it It thus functions as a barrier to the exchange of genetic material allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested on both sides of the river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate 16 21 30 31 More recently however a model based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size This leads to the conclusion that all populations and all available habitat should be protected 17 ",
