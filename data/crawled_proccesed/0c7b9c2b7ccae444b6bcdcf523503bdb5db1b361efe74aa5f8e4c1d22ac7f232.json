			"previous": " Petrified Forest National Park is known for its fossils especially of fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic period of the Mesozoic era about 225 million years ago During this period the region that is now the park was near the equator on the southwestern edge of the supercontinent Pangaea and its climate was humid and sub tropical 11 What later became northeastern Arizona was a low plain flanked by mountains to the south and southeast and a sea to the west Streams flowing across the plain from the highlands deposited inorganic sediment and organic matter including trees as well as other plants and animals that had entered or fallen into the water Although most organic matter decays rapidly or is eaten by other organisms some is buried so quickly that it remains intact and may become fossilized 12 Within the park the sediments containing the fossil logs for which the park is named are part of the Chinle Formation 11 ",
			"after": " The colorful Chinle which appears on the surface in many parts of the southwestern United States and from which the Painted Desert gets its name is up to 800 feet 240 m thick in the park 12 It consists of a variety of sedimentary rocks including beds of soft fine grained mudstone siltstone and claystone much of which is bentonite as well as harder sandstone and conglomerate and limestone 11 12 Exposed to wind and water the Chinle usually erodes differentially into badlands made up of cliffs gullies mesas buttes and rounded hills 12 Its bentonite clay which swells when wet and shrinks while drying causes surface movement and cracking that discourages plant growth Lack of plant cover makes the Chinle especially susceptible to weathering 11 ",
