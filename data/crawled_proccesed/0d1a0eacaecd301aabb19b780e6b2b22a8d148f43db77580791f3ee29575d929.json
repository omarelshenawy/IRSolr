			"previous": " Many major battles of the American Civil War were fought in Tennessee most of them Union victories Ulysses S Grant and the U S Navy captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862 They held off the Confederate counterattack at Shiloh in April Memphis fell to the Union in June following a naval battle on the Mississippi River in front of the city The Capture of Memphis and Nashville gave the Union control of the western and middle sections this control was confirmed at the Battle of Murfreesboro in early January 1863 and by the subsequent Tullahoma Campaign ",
			"after": " Confederates held East Tennessee despite the strength of Unionist sentiment there with the exception of extremely pro Confederate Sullivan County The Confederates led by General James Longstreet did attack General Burnside s Fort Sanders at Knoxville and lost A big blow the East Tennessee Confederates Longstreet won the Battle of Bean s Station a few weeks later The Confederates besieged Chattanooga during the Chattanooga Campaign in early fall 1863 but were driven off by Grant in November Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General Braxton Bragg who led the Army of Tennessee from Perryville Kentucky to Confederate defeat at Chattanooga ",
