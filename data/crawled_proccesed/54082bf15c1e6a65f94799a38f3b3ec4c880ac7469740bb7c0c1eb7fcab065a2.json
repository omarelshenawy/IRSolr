			"previous": " Several major aircraft manufacturers are multinational and it is not unusual for them to have plants in widely separated locations Airbus is unique in that it is a consortium formed by the major British French German and Spanish aerospace companies The geographic location of Airbus manufacturing is not only influenced by cost and convenience it is also a matter of aviation history and national interest Each of the Airbus partners makes an entire aircraft section which must be transported to a central location for final assembly The details vary from one model to another but the general arrangement is for the wings and landing gear to be made in the UK the tail and doors in Spain the fuselage in Germany and the nose and centre section in France with final assembly in either Toulouse France Hamburg Germany or Seville Spain ",
			"after": " When Airbus started in 1970 the first few components were delivered by road but growing production soon necessitated a switch to air transport From 1972 onwards a fleet of four highly modified Super Guppies took over These were former Boeing Stratocruisers from the 1940s converted with custom fuselages and turbine engines to carry large volume loads for the 1960s NASA space program leading to the jest that every Airbus is delivered on the wings of a Boeing As time went by the Super Guppies grew increasingly unsatisfactory for Airbus s ferrying needs their age meant that operating expenses were high and ever increasing and growing Airbus production required greater capacity ",
