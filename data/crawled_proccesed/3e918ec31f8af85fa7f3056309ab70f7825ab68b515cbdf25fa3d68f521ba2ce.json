			"previous": " Mauritius is divided into nine districts which consist of different cities towns and villages  When it was discovered the island of Mauritius was the home of a previously unknown species of bird the dodo Dodos were descendents of a type of pigeon which settled in Mauritius over four million years ago With no predators to attack them they lost their need and ability to fly In 1505 the Portuguese became the first humans to set foot on Mauritius The island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade Weighing up to 50 pounds the dodo was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors Large numbers of dodos were killed for food Later when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony new species were introduced to the island Rats pigs and monkeys ate dodo eggs in the ground nests The combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced the dodo population Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius the once abundant dodo became a rare bird The last one was killed in 1681 54 The dodo is prominently featured as a heraldic supporter of the national Coat of arms of Mauritius ",
