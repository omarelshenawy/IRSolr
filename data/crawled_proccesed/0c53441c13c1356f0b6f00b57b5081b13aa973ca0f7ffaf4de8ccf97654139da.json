			"after": " The amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown 3 The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States comprising a mine retorting plant upgrading plant supporting utilities and spent shale reclamation would range between US 70 95 440 600 m3 adjusted to 2005 values This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency In order to run a profitable operation the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35 70 after producing its first 500 million barrels 79 10 6 m3 Assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day 4 0 10 3 m3 d during each year after the start of commercial production RAND predicts the costs would decline to 35 48 per barrel 220 300 m3 within 12 years After achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels 160 10 6 m3 its costs would decline further to 30 40 per barrel 190 250 m3 45 53 Some commentators compare the proposed American oil shale industry to the Athabasca oil sands industry the latter enterprise generated over 1 million barrels 160 000 m3 of oil per day in late 2007 stating that the first generation facility is the hardest both technically and economically 66 67 ",
