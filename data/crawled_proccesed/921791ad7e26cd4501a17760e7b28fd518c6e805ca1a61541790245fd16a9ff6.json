			"previous": " Electrons and how they interact with electromagnetic fields are important in our understanding of chemistry and physics In the classical view the energy of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is larger for orbits further from the nucleus of an atom However quantum mechanical effects force electrons to take on discrete positions in orbitals Thus electrons are found in specific energy levels of an atom two of which are shown below ",
			"after": " When an electron absorbs energy either from light photons or heat phonons it receives that incident quanta of energy But transitions are only allowed between discrete energy levels such as the two shown above This leads to emission lines and absorption lines ",
