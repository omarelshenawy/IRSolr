			"after": " A war memorial in Melbourne was proposed as soon as the war ended in November 1918 7 In the early 1920s the Victorian state government appointed the War Memorials Advisory Committee chaired by Sir Baldwin Spencer which recommended an arch of victory over St Kilda Road 5 the major boulevard leading out of the city of Melbourne to the south In August 1921 an executive committee was formed with the former commander of the Australian forces in the war General Sir John Monash as its driving force The committee soon abandoned the idea of an arch and proposed a large monumental memorial to the east of St Kilda Road 8 a position which would make it clearly visible from the centre of the city 9 A competition was launched in March 1922 to find a design for the new memorial open both to British subjects residing in Australia and any Australian citizens who were residing overseas A total of 83 entries were submitted 8 and in December 1923 the design offered by two Melbourne architects and war veterans Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop was announced as the winner 10 ",
