			"after": " No living species of crocodilian can be considered truly marine although the saltwater crocodile and the American crocodile are able to swim out to sea their normal habitats are river mouths estuaries mangrove swamps and hypersaline lakes though several extinct species have had marine habits including the recently gone Gavialis papuensis which occurred in a fully marine habitat in the Solomon Islands coastlines 63 All crocodilians need to maintain the concentration of salt in body fluids at suitable levels Osmoregulation is related to the quantity of salts and water exchanged with the environment Intake of water and salts takes place across the lining of the mouth when water is drunk incidentally while feeding and when present in foods 64 Water is lost from the body during breathing and both salts and water are lost in the urine and faeces through the skin and via salt excreting glands on the tongue though these are only present in crocodiles and gharials 65 66 The skin is a largely effective barrier to both water and ions Gaping causes water loss by evaporation from the lining of the mouth and on land water is also lost through the skin 65 Large animals are better able to maintain homeostasis at times of osmotic stress than smaller ones 67 Newly hatched crocodilians are much less tolerant of exposure to salt water than are older juveniles presumably because they have a higher surface area to volume ratio 65 ",
