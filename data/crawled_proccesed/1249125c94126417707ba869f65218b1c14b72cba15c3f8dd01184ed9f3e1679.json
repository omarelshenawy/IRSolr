			"previous": " Species in the genus Cyathus have fruit bodies peridia that are vase trumpet or urn shaped with dimensions of 4 8 mm wide by 7 18 mm tall 10 Fruit bodies are brown to gray brown in color and covered with small hair like structures on the outer surface Some species like C striatus and C setosus have conspicuous bristles called setae on the rim of the cup The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of the underlying growing surface improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain 11 ",
			"after": " Immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane an epiphragm that covers the peridium opening when young but eventually dehisces breaking open during maturation Viewed with a microscope the peridium of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers the endo meso and ectoperidium referring to the inner middle and outer layers respectively While the surface of the ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy the endoperidial surface is smooth and depending on the species may have longitudinal grooves striations 3 ",
