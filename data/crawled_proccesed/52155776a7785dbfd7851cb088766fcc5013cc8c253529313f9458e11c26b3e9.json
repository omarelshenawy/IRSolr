			"previous": " Alphonse P naud a Frenchman living from 1850 to 1880 advanced the theory of wing contours and aerodynamics and constructed successful models of aeroplanes helicopters and ornithopters In 1871 he flew the first aerodynamically stable fixed wing aeroplane a model monoplane he called the Planophore a distance of 40 m 130 ft P naud s model incorporated several of Cayley s discoveries including the use of a tail wing dihedral for inherent stability and rubber power The planophore also had longitudinal stability being trimmed such that the tailplane was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings an original and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics 44 P naud s later project for an amphibian aeroplane although never built incorporated other modern features A tailless monoplane with a single vertical fin and twin tractor propellers it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces retractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed instrumented cockpit ",
			"after": " Equally authoritative as a theorist was P naud s fellow countryman Victor Tatin In 1879 he flew a model which like P naud s project was a monoplane with twin tractor propellers but also had a separate horizontal tail It was powered by compressed air Flown tethered to a pole this was the first model to take off under its own power ",
