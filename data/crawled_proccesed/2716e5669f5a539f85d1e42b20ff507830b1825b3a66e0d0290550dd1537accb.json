			"previous": " Numerous fragmentary remains from Mahajanga Province in northwestern Madagascar were recovered by French collectors over the next 100 years many of which were deposited in the Mus um National d Histoire Naturelle in Paris 1 In 1955 Ren Lavocat described a theropod dentary MNHN MAJ 1 with teeth from the Maevarano Formation in the same region where the original material was found The teeth matched those first described by Dep ret but the strongly curved jaw bone was very different from both Megalosaurus and Dryptosaurus Based on this dentary Lavocat created the new genus Majungasaurus using an older spelling of Mahajanga as well as the Greek word sauros meaning lizard 16 Hans Dieter Sues and Philippe Taquet described a dome shaped skull fragment MNHN MAJ 4 as a new genus of pachycephalosaur Majungatholus atopus in 1979 This was the first report of a pachycephalosaur in the Southern Hemisphere 17 ",
			"after": " In 1993 scientists from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the University of Antananarivo began the Mahajanga Basin Project a series of expeditions to examine the fossils and geology of the Late Cretaceous sediments near the village of Berivotra in Mahajanga Province 1 Among these scientists was paleontologist David W Krause of Stony Brook The first expedition turned up hundreds of theropod teeth identical to those of Majungasaurus some of which were attached to an isolated premaxilla that was described in 1996 18 The following seven expeditions would turn up tens of thousands of fossils many of which belonged to species new to science The Mahajanga Basin Project claims credit for quintupling the known diversity of fossil taxa in the region 1 ",
