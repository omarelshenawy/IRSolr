			"previous": " A successful generalist predator the cougar will eat any animal it can catch from insects to large ungulates over 500 kg Like all cats it is an obligate carnivore meaning it needs to feed exclusively on meat to survive The mean weight of vertebrate prey MWVP that pumas attack increases with the puma s body weight in general MWVP is lower in areas closer to the equator 3 Its most important prey species are various deer species particularly in North America mule deer white tailed deer elk and even bull moose are taken Other species such as the bighorn and Dall s sheep horse fallow deer caribou mountain goat coyote pronghorn and domestic livestock such as cattle and sheep are also primary food bases in many areas 62 A survey of North America research found 68 of prey items were ungulates especially deer Only the Florida Panther showed variation often preferring feral hogs and armadillos 3 ",
			"after": " Investigation in Yellowstone National Park showed that elk followed by mule deer were the cougar s primary targets the prey base is shared with the park s gray wolves with whom the cougar competes for resources 63 Another study on winter kills November April in Alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99 of the cougar diet Learned individual prey recognition was observed as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep while others relied heavily on the species 64 ",
