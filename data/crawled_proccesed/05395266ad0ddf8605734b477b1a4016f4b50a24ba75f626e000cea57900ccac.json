			"after": " Caspar David Friedrich 1774 1840 was a 19th century German Romantic landscape painter generally considered the most important of the movement He is best known for his mid period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies morning mists barren trees or Gothic ruins His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature and his often symbolic and anti classical work seeks to convey a subjective emotional response to the natural world Friedrich s work characteristically sets the human element in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes reducing the figures to a scale that according to the art historian Christopher John Murray directs the viewer s gaze towards their metaphysical dimension Friedrich was born in the Swedish Pomeranian town of Greifswald where he began his studies in art as a youth Later he studied in Copenhagen until 1798 before settling in Dresden Friedrich s work brought him renown early in his career and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d Angers 1788 1856 spoke of him as a man who had discovered the tragedy of landscape However his work fell from favour during his later years and he died in obscurity By the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the Expressionists and in the 1930s and early 1940s Surrealists and Existentialists frequently drew ideas from his work ",
