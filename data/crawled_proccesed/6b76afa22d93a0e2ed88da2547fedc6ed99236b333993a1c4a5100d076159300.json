			"previous": " Gas tungsten arc welding is most commonly used to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium but it can be applied to nearly all metals with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding Furthermore GTAW can be performed in a variety of other than flat positions depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded 29 ",
			"after": " Aluminum and magnesium are most often welded using alternating current but the use of direct current is also possible depending on the properties desired Before welding the work area should be cleaned and may be preheated to 175 to 200 C 347 to 392 F for aluminum or to a maximum of 150 C 302 F for thick magnesium workpieces to improve penetration and increase travel speed 30 AC current can provide a self cleaning effect removing the thin refractory aluminium oxide sapphire layer that forms on aluminium metal within minutes of exposure to air This oxide layer must be removed for welding to occur 30 When alternating current is used pure tungsten electrodes or zirconiated tungsten electrodes are preferred over thoriated electrodes as the latter are more likely to spit electrode particles across the welding arc into the weld Blunt electrode tips are preferred and pure argon shielding gas should be employed for thin workpieces Introducing helium allows for greater penetration in thicker workpieces but can make arc starting difficult 30 ",
