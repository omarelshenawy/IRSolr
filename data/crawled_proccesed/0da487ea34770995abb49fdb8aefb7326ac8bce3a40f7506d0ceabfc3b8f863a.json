			"after": " Despite their ancient history all living Andalusians trace to a small number of horses bred by religious orders in the 18th and 19th centuries An influx of heavy horse blood beginning in the 16th century resulted in the dilution of many of the bloodlines only those protected by selective breeding remained intact to become the modern Andalusian 37 During the 19th century the Andalusian breed was threatened because many horses were stolen or requisitioned in wartime including the War of the Oranges the Peninsular War and the three Carlist Wars Napoleon s invading army also stole many horses One herd of Andalusians was hidden from the invaders however and subsequently used to renew the breed 6 38 In 1822 breeders began to add Norman blood into Spanish bloodlines as well as further infusions of Arabian blood This was partially because increasing mechanization and changing needs within the military called for horses with more speed in cavalry charges as well as horses with more bulk for pulling gun carriages 38 In 1832 an epidemic seriously affected Spain s horse population from which only one small herd survived in a stud at the monastery in Cartuja 6 During the 19th and early 20th centuries European breeders especially the Germans changed from an emphasis on Andalusian and Neapolitan horses an emphasis that had been in place since the decline of chivalry to an emphasis on the breeding of Thoroughbreds and warmbloods further depleting the stock of Andalusians 39 Despite this change in focus Andalusian breeding slowly recovered and in 1869 the Seville Horse Fair originally begun by the Romans played host to between ten and twelve thousand Spanish horses 40 In the early 20th century Spanish horse breeding began to focus on other breeds particularly draft breeds Arabians Thoroughbreds and crosses between these breeds as well as crosses between these breeds and the Andalusian The purebred Andalusian was not viewed favorably by breeders or the military and their numbers decreased significantly 38 ",
