			"previous": " Their skeletons suggest that most subfossil lemurs were tree dwellers adapted for living in forests and possibly limited to such habitats 6 8 9 Unlike some of the living species the subfossil lemurs lacked adaptations for leaping Instead suspension used by some indriids and ruffed lemurs was extensively used in some lineages Although living lemurs are known to visit the ground to varying extents only the extinct archaeolemurids exhibit adaptations for semiterrestrial locomotion Due to the size of the extinct subfossil lemurs all were likely to travel on the ground between trees 8 They had shorter more robust limbs heavily built axial skeletons trunks and large heads 10 and are thought to have shared the common lemur trait of low basal metabolic rates making them slow moving 9 Studies of their semicircular canals confirm this assumption showing that koala lemurs moved slower than orangutans monkey lemurs were less agile than Old World monkeys and sloth lemurs exhibited slow movements like those of lorises and sloths 11 ",
			"after": " The sloth lemurs family Palaeopropithecidae were the most species rich group of the subfossil lemurs with four genera and eight species The common name is due to strong similarities in morphology with arboreal sloths 9 or in the case of Archaeoindris with giant ground sloths 12 They ranged in size from some of the smallest of the subfossil lemurs such as Mesopropithecus weighing as little as 10 kg 22 lb 12 to the largest Archaeoindris weighing approximately 160 kg 350 lb 4 Their characteristic curved finger and toe bones phalanges suggest slow suspensory movement similar to that of an orangutan or a loris making them some of the most specialized mammals for suspension 9 13 Their day vision was very poor and they had relatively small brains and short tails 8 Their diet consisted mostly of leaves seeds and fruit 8 9 although dental wear analysis suggests they were primarily folivorous seed predators 14 ",
