			"after": " The exclusive focus of the WSPU on votes for women was another hallmark of its militancy While other organisations agreed to work with individual political parties the WSPU insisted on separating itself from and in many cases opposing parties which did not make women s suffrage a priority The group protested against all candidates belonging to the party of the ruling government since it refused to pass women s suffrage legislation This brought them into immediate conflict with Liberal Party organisers particularly since many Liberal candidates supported women s suffrage One early target of WSPU opposition was future Prime Minister Winston Churchill his opponent attributed Churchill s defeat in part to those ladies who are sometimes laughed at 65 ",
