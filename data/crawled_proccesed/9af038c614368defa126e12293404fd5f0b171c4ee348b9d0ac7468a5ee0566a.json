			"after": " Woolly mammoth fossils have been found in many different types of deposits including former rivers and lakes and also in Doggerland in the North Sea which was dry at times during the ice age Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed elephants graveyards as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found it is thought these are the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time perhaps due to flooding Natural traps such as kettle holes sink holes as well as mud have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time 101 ",
