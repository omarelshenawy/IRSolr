			"after": " Although the thylacine was extinct on mainland Australia it survived into the 1930s on the island state of Tasmania At the time of the first settlement the heaviest distributions were in the northeast northwest and north midland regions of the state 39 They were rarely sighted during this time but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers The Van Diemen s Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine from as early as 1830 and between 1888 and 1909 the Tasmanian government paid 1 per head Current value today after inflation and introduction of decimal currency 132 29 for dead adult thylacines and ten shillings for pups In all they paid out 2 184 bounties but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for 34 Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and bounty hunters 34 However it is likely that multiple factors led to its decline and eventual extinction including competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers 70 erosion of its habitat the concurrent extinction of prey species and a distemper like disease that also affected many captive specimens at the time 28 71 Whatever the reason the animal had become extremely rare in the wild by the late 1920s Despite the fact that the thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep in 1928 the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna recommended a reserve to protect any remaining thylacines with potential sites of suitable habitat including the Arthur Pieman area of western Tasmania 72 ",
