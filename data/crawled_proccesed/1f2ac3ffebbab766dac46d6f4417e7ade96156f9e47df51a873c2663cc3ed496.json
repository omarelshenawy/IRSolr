			"after": " The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by historians 30 The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city s doorstep and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet front capturing or forwarding beyond the city in a matter of days This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces played out successfully in a number of European capitals such as Paris 115 and Prague However despite easy capture of area south east of Warsaw barely 10 km from the city centre and holding these positions for about 40 days the Soviets did not extend any effective aid to the insurgents within Warsaw At that time city outskirts were defended by the under manned and under equipped German 73rd Infantry Division which was destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and was yet again being reconstituted 116 The weak German defence forces did not experience any significant Soviet pressure during that period which effectively allowed them to strengthen German forces fighting against uprising in the city itself ",
