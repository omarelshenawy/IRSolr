			"previous": " Ideas about the transmutation of species were associated with the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation rather than gradual change over time He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt which were thousands of years old showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals The strength of Cuvier s arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades 60 ",
			"after": " In Great Britain the philosophy of natural theology remained influential William Paley s 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin 62 Geologists influenced by natural theology such as Buckland and Sedgwick made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck Grant and Vestiges 63 64 Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology he also believed in the immutability of species and in his Principles of Geology he criticized Lamarck s theories of development 53 Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology as well as in the fossil record but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity Owen developed the idea of archetypes in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies such as vertebrate limbs Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory but the harsh treatment of Grant and the controversy surrounding Vestiges showed him the need to ensure that his own ideas were scientifically sound 57 65 66 ",
