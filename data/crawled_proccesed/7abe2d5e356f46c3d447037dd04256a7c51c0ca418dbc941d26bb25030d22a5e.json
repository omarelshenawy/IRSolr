			"previous": " Subfossil remains of the King Island emu show that the tibia was about 330 mm 13 in long and the femur was 180 mm 7 in long The pelvis was 280 mm 11 in long 64 mm 2 5 in wide at the front and 86 mm 3 in wide at the back 8 The tarsometatarsus averaged 232 mm 9 in in length In males the tibiotarsus averaged 261 mm 10 in whereas it averaged 301 mm 12 in in females In contrast the same bones measured 269 mm 10 5 in and 305 mm 12 in in the Kangaroo Island emu Apart from being smaller the King Island emu differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island emu in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu 14 ",
			"after": " The King Island emu and the mainland emu show few morphological differences other than their significant difference in size Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of the mainland emu yet the toes were nearly of equal length and therefore proportionally longer The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu 9 Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus and the contour of the cranium However the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant 19 The same is true of the contour of the cranium which is more dome shaped in the King Island emu a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus 15 ",
