			"previous": " The Sun s orbit around the Milky Way is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non uniform mass distributions In addition the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2 7 times per orbit It has been argued that the Sun s passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with mass extinctions on Earth perhaps due to increased impact events 131 It takes the Solar System about 225 250 million years to complete one orbit through the Milky Way a galactic year 132 so it is thought to have completed 20 25 orbits during the lifetime of the Sun The orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of the Milky Way is approximately 251 km s 156 mi s 133 At this speed it takes around 1 190 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light year or 7 days to travel 1 AU 134 ",
			"after": " The Sun s motion about the center of mass of the Solar System is complicated by perturbations from the planets The barycenter is just outside the volume of the Sun when Jupiter and Saturn the two planets with the greatest masses are roughly in the same direction as seen from the Sun When they are in opposite directions and the other planets are aligned appropriately the barycenter can be very close to the center of the Sun Every few hundred years this motion switches between prograde and retrograde 135 ",
