			"previous": " Using global geometry some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called horizons which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime The best known examples are black holes if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space as specified in the hoop conjecture the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius 134 no light from inside can escape to the outside Since no object can overtake a light pulse all interior matter is imprisoned as well Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible showing that the boundary the black hole s horizon is not a physical barrier 135 ",
			"after": " Early studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein s equations notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution used to describe a static black hole and the axisymmetric Kerr solution used to describe a rotating stationary black hole and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere Using global geometry later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes In the long run they are rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying energy linear momentum angular momentum location at a specified time and electric charge This is stated by the black hole uniqueness theorems black holes have no hair that is no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole the object that results having emitted gravitational waves is very simple 136 ",
