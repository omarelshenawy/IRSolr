			"after": " Cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads produced during the first year of its biennial cycle Plants perform best when grown in well drained soil in a location that receives full sun Different varieties prefer different soil types ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6 0 and 6 8 55 For optimal growth there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil especially during the early head formation stage and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves 56 Temperatures between 4 and 24 C 39 and 75 F prompt the best growth and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting flowering 55 Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures a process called vernalization only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about 6 mm 0 24 in Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering In certain climates cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower a practice that was common in the eastern US 57 ",
