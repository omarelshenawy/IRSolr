			"previous": " The first dreadnoughts tended to have a very light secondary armament intended to protect them from torpedo boats Dreadnought carried 12 pounder guns each of her twenty two 12 pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack 54 The South Carolinas and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped 55 At this stage torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions Therefore there was no need to armour the secondary gun armament or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns In this context the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire 56 ",
			"after": " Within a few years the principal threat was from the destroyer larger more heavily armed and harder to destroy than the torpedo boat Since the risk from destroyers was very serious it was considered that one shell from a battleship s secondary armament should sink rather than merely damage any attacking destroyer Destroyers in contrast to torpedo boats were expected to attack as part of a general fleet engagement so it was necessary for the secondary armament to be protected against shell splinters from heavy guns and the blast of the main armament This philosophy of secondary armament was adopted by the German navy from the start Nassau for instance carried twelve 150 mm 5 9 in and sixteen 88 mm 3 45 in guns and subsequent German dreadnought classes followed this lead 39 These heavier guns tended to be mounted in armoured barbettes or casemates on the main deck The Royal Navy increased its secondary armament from 12 pounder to first 4 inch 100 mm and then 6 inch 150 mm guns which were standard at the start of World War I 57 the US standardized on 5 inch 130 mm calibre for the war but planned 6 inch guns for the ships designed just afterwards 58 ",
