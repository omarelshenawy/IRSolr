			"after": " Differential calculus is the study of the definition properties and applications of the derivative of a function The process of finding the derivative is called differentiation Given a function and a point in the domain the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small scale behavior of the function near that point By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain it is possible to produce a new function called the derivative function or just the derivative of the original function In mathematical jargon the derivative is a linear operator which inputs a function and outputs a second function This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra where functions usually input a number and output another number For example if the doubling function is given the input three then it outputs six and if the squaring function is given the input three then it outputs nine The derivative however can take the squaring function as an input This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function such as that two is sent to four three is sent to nine four is sent to sixteen and so on and uses this information to produce another function The function it produces turns out to be the doubling function ",
