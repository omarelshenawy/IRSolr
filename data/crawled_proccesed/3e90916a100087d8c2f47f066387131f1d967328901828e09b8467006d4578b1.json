			"previous": " The MD 10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC 10 and a re designation to MD 10 The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck ACF used on the MD 11 and was launched in 1996 36 The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD 11 This allows companies such as FedEx Express which operate both the MD 10 and MD 11 to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft The MD 10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing s international affiliate companies perform the conversions 37 ",
