			"after": " Gorgosaurus was smaller than Tyrannosaurus or Tarbosaurus closer in size to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus Adults reached 8 to 9 m 26 to 30 ft from snout to tail 1 2 Paleontologists have estimated full grown adults to weigh more than 2 4 tonnes 2 6 short tons 3 perhaps approaching 2 8 tonnes 3 1 short tons 4 The largest known skull measures 99 cm 39 in long just slightly smaller than that of Daspletosaurus 1 As in other tyrannosaurids the skull was large compared to its body size although chambers within the skull bones and large openings fenestrae between bones reduced its weight Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus share proportionally longer and lower skulls than Daspletosaurus and other tyrannosaurids The end of the snout was blunt and the nasal and parietal bones were fused along the midline of the skull as in all other members of the family The eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera A tall crest rose from the lacrimal bone in front of each eye similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus 2 Differences in the shape of bones surrounding the brain set Gorgosaurus apart from Albertosaurus 5 ",
