			"previous": " In 1978 the discovery of Pluto s moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto s mass for the first time Its mass roughly 0 2 that of Earth was far too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X notably by Robert Sutton Harrington 57 failed In 1992 Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2 s 1989 flyby of Neptune which had revised the planet s total mass downward by 0 5 to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus With the new figures added in the discrepancies and with them the need for a Planet X vanished 58 Today the majority of scientists agree that Planet X as Lowell defined it does not exist 59 Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X s position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto s position at that time Ernest W Brown concluded soon after Pluto s discovery that this was a coincidence 60 a view still held today 58 ",
