			"previous": " Daspletosaurus had a massive skull that could reach more than 1 meter 3 3 ft in length 1 The bones were heavily constructed and some including the nasal bones on top of the snout were fused for strength Large fenestrae openings in the skull reduced its weight An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade like Unlike its other teeth those in the premaxilla at the end of the upper jaw had a D shaped cross section an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla upper jaw bone and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal postorbital and jugal bones The orbit eye socket was a tall oval somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the keyhole shape of Tyrannosaurus 6 7 8 Split carinae 9 have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth 10 ",
			"after": " Daspletosaurus shared the same body form as other tyrannosaurids with a short S shaped neck supporting the massive skull It walked on its two thick hindlimbs which ended in four toed feet although the first digit the hallux did not contact the ground In contrast the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid A long heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso with the center of gravity over the hips 1 8 ",
