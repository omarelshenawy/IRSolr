			"previous": " Although weakened and pushed south along the Huai River the Southern Song found new ways to bolster its strong economy and defend its own state against the Jin dynasty They had able military officers such as Yue Fei and Han Shizhong The government sponsored massive shipbuilding and harbor improvement projects and the construction of beacons and seaport warehouses in order to support maritime trade abroad and the major international seaports such as Quanzhou Guangzhou and Xiamen that were sustaining China s commerce 26 27 28 To protect and support the multitudes of ships sailing for maritime interests into the waters of the East China Sea and Yellow Sea to Korea and Japan Southeast Asia the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea it was a necessity to establish an official standing navy 29 The Song dynasty therefore established China s first permanent navy in 1132 28 with a headquarters at Dinghai 30 With a permanent navy the Song were prepared to face the naval forces of the Jin on the Yangtze River in 1161 in the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi During these battles the Song navy employed swift paddle wheel driven naval vessels armed with trebuchet catapults aboard the decks that launched gunpowder bombs 30 Although the Jin forces commanded by Emperor Hailing boasted 70 000 men on 600 warships and the Song forces only 3 000 men on 120 warships 31 the Song dynasty forces were victorious in both battles due to the destructive power of the bombs and the rapid assaults by paddle wheel ships 32 The strength of the navy was heavily emphasized after that A century after the navy was founded it had grown in size to 52 000 fighting marines 30 The Song government confiscated portions of land owned by the landed gentry in order to raise revenue for these projects an act which caused dissension and loss of loyalty amongst leading members of Song society but did not stop the Song s defensive preparations 33 34 35 Financial matters were made worse by the fact that many wealthy land owning families some which had officials working for the government used their social connections with those in office in order to obtain tax exempt status 36 ",
			"after": " Although the Song dynasty was able to hold back the Jin a new considerable foe came to power over the steppe deserts and plains north of the Jin dynasty The Mongols led by Genghis Khan r 1206 1227 initially invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209 engaging in large raids across its borders and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin 37 The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and pay tribute to the Mongols as vassals when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng the Mongols saw this as a revolt 38 Under the leadership of gedei Khan r 1229 1241 both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces 38 39 The Mongols also invaded Korea the Abbasid Caliphate of the Middle East and Kievan Rus The Mongols were at one time allied with the Song but this alliance was broken when the Song recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng Luoyang and Chang an at the collapse of the Jin dynasty The Mongol leader M ngke Khan led a campaign against the Song in 1259 but died on August 11 during the Battle of Diaoyu Fortress in Chongqing 40 M ngke s death and the ensuing succession crisis prompted Hulagu Khan to pull the bulk of the Mongol forces out of the Middle East where they were poised to fight the Egyptian Mamluks who defeated the remaining Mongols at Ain Jalut Although Hulagu was allied with Kublai Khan his forces were unable to help in the assault against the Song due to Hulagu s war with the Golden Horde 41 ",
