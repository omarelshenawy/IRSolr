			"previous": " After Columbus first voyage to the New World in 1492 other explorers followed with settlement into the Floridas and the American Southwest 58 59 There were also some French attempts to colonize the east coast and later more successful settlements along the Mississippi River Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims Plymouth Colony in 1620 Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings 60 Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom The continent s first elected legislative assembly Virginia s House of Burgesses created in 1619 and the Mayflower Compact signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking established precedents for the pattern of representative self government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies 61 62 ",
			"after": " Most settlers in every colony were small farmers but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements Cash crops included tobacco rice and wheat Extraction industries grew up in furs fishing and lumber Manufacturers produced rum and ships and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one seventh of the world s iron supply 63 Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch Irish and other groups As coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west 64 Slave cultivation of cash crops began with the Spanish in the 1500s and was adopted by the English but life expectancy was much higher in North America because of less disease and better food and treatment leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves 65 66 67 Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice 68 69 But by the turn of the 18th century African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor especially in southern regions 70 ",
