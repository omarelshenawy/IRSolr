			"after": " The Atlantic puffin is sturdily built with a thick set neck and short wings and tail It is 28 to 30 centimetres 11 to 12 in in length from the tip of its stout bill to its blunt ended tail Its wingspan is 47 to 63 centimetres 19 to 25 in and on land it stands about 20 cm 8 in high The male is generally slightly larger than the female but they are coloured alike The forehead crown and nape are glossy black as are the back wings and tail A broad black collar extends around the neck and throat On each side of the head is a large lozenge shaped area of very pale grey These face patches taper to a point and nearly meet at the back of the neck The shape of the head creates a crease extending from the eye to the hindmost point of each patch giving the appearance of a grey streak The eye looks almost triangular in shape because of a small peaked area of horny blue grey skin above it and a rectangular patch below The irises are brown or very dark blue and each has red orbital ring The underparts of the bird the breast belly and undertail coverts are white By the end of the breeding season the black plumage may have lost its shine or even taken on a slightly brownish tinge The legs are short and set well back on the body giving the bird its upright stance on land Both legs and large webbed feet are bright orange contrasting with the sharp black claws 15 ",
