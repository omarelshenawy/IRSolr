			"previous": " CBC Radio stopped running commercial advertising in 1974 Until 1995 the network signed off the air between 1 a m and 6 a m daily in that year it launched an overnight program CBC Radio Overnight which airs international news and documentary programs ",
			"after": " Until 1958 the CBC was not only a broadcaster but the principal broadcast regulator in Canada It used this dual role to snap up most of Canada s clear channel frequencies on the AM dial However in the 1990s many of the CBC s AM stations moved to FM in response to complaints of poor AM reception This meant that the old distinction between the AM Radio network and the FM Stereo network was no longer accurate even though many of the FM Radio stations broadcast in mono only As a result in 1997 CBC Radio became CBC Radio One and CBC Stereo became CBC Radio 2 Although several Radio One stations still broadcast on AM as of 2008 most also have FM rebroadcasters in major urban centres within their broadcast area The channel was added to the Sirus lineup in 2005 and the XM lineup in 2013 ",
