			"previous": " While the concept of using the airplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I 72 the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces All of the major forces in Europe had light aircraft typically derived from pre war sporting designs attached to their reconnaissance departments Radiotelephones were also being explored on airplanes notably the SCR 68 as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important ",
			"after": " It was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other but the lack of any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem The French solved this problem when in late 1914 Roland Garros attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane but while Adolphe Pegoud would become known as the first ace getting credit for five victories before also becoming the first ace to die in action it was German Luftstreitkr fte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens who on July 1 1915 scored the very first aerial victory by a purpose built fighter plane with a synchronized machine gun ",
