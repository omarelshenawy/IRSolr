			"previous": " Since the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations 141 142 It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a plumb bob was used to ascertain where north lay The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction 143 ",
