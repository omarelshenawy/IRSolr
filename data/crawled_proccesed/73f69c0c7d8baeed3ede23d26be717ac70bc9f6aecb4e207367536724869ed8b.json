			"previous": " Most igniters in gas turbine applications are electrical spark igniters similar to automotive spark plugs The igniter needs to be in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter it is self sustaining and the igniter is no longer used 17 In can annular and annular combustors see Types of combustors below the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another so igniters are not needed at each one In some systems ignition assist techniques are used One such method is oxygen injection where oxygen is fed to the ignition area helping the fuel easily combust This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude 18 ",
			"after": " This is the main combustion air It is highly compressed air from the high pressure compressor often decelerated via the diffuser that is fed through the main channels in the dome of the combustor and the first set of liner holes This air is mixed with fuel and then combusted 19 ",
