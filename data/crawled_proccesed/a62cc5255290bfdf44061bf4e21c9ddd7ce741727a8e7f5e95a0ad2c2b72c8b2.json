			"after": " About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica of which about 750 are non lichen forming and 400 are lichen forming 64 65 Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges The apparently simple morphology scarcely differentiated structures metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys In particular their thick walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV light Those features are observed in different Antarctic fungi which can be shown by molecular studies to belong in different taxonomic orders They can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica This has led to speculation that if life ever occurred on Mars it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces minteri 66 Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm blooded animals 67 ",
