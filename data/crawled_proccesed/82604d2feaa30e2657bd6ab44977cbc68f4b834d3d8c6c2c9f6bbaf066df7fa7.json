			"previous": " In a classic set of experiments the Englishman Osborne Reynolds 1842 1912 of the University of Manchester demonstrated that the airflow pattern over a scale model would be the same for the full scale vehicle if a certain flow parameter were the same in both cases This factor now known as the Reynolds number is a basic parameter in the description of all fluid flow situations including the shapes of flow patterns the ease of heat transfer and the onset of turbulence This comprises the central scientific justification for the use of models in wind tunnels to simulate real life phenomena However there are limitations on conditions in which dynamic similarity is based upon the Reynolds number alone ",
