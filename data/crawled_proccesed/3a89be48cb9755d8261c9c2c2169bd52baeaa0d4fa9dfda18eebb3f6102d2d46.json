			"previous": " Divorcing a spouse was permissible if there was mutual consent between husband and wife 165 while remarriage after the death of a spouse was common during the Song period 166 However widows under post Song dynasties did not often remarry following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi 1033 1107 who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying 166 Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty 1644 1912 yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior 167 ",
