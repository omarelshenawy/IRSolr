			"after": " Water is usually dropped directly on flames because its effect is short lived Fire retardants are typically dropped ahead of the moving fire or along its edge and may remain effective for two or more days This can create artificial firebreaks where the terrain is too rugged or remote for ground crews to cut fireline ",
