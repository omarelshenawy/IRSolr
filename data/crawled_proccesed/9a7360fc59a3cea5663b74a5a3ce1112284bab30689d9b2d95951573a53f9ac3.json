			"previous": " When the viscosity effect over the pressure distribution is considered separately the remaining drag force is called pressure or form drag In the absence of viscosity the pressure forces on the vehicle cancel each other and hence the drag is zero Pressure drag is the dominant component in the case of vehicles with regions of separated flow in which the pressure recovery is fairly ineffective ",
			"after": " The sum of friction drag and pressure form drag is called viscous drag This drag component takes into account the influence of viscosity In a thermodynamic perspective viscous effects represent irreversible phenomena and therefore they create entropy The calculated viscous drag use entropy changes to accurately predict the drag force ",
