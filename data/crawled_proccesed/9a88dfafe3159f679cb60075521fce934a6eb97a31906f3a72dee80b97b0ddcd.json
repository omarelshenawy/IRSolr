			"after": " Under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction Newton s law of universal gravitation simplifies to F mg where m is the mass of the body and g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9 81 m s2 on Earth This resulting force is the object s weight The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this g An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time The image on the right spanning half a second was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second During the first 1 20 of a second the ball drops one unit of distance here a unit is about 12 mm by 2 20 it has dropped at total of 4 units by 3 20 9 units and so on ",
