			"after": " Gas tungsten arc welding is an arc welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by a shielding gas usually an inert gas such as argon and a filler metal is normally used though some welds known as autogenous welds do not require it A constant current welding power supply produces energy which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma GTAW is most commonly used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and light metals such as aluminum magnesium and copper alloys The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing procedures such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding allowing for stronger higher quality welds However GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master and furthermore it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques A related process plasma arc welding uses a slightly different welding torch to create a more focused welding arc and as a result is often automated ",
