			"after": " While military fighters require very high speeds many civil airplanes do not Yet civil aircraft designers wanted to benefit from the high power and low maintenance that a gas turbine engine offered Thus was born the idea to mate a turbine engine to a traditional propeller Because gas turbines optimally spin at high speed a turboprop features a gearbox to lower the speed of the shaft so that the propeller tips don t reach supersonic speeds Often the turbines that drive the propeller are separate from the rest of the rotating components so that they can rotate at their own best speed referred to as a free turbine engine A turboprop is very efficient when operated within the realm of cruise speeds it was designed for which is typically 200 to 400 mph 320 to 640 km h ",
