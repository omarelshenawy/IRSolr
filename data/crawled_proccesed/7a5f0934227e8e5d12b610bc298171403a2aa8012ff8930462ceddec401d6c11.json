			"previous": " The art world developed a new appreciation for Vel zquez s less Italianate paintings after 1819 when Ferdinand VII opened the royal collection to the public 74 In 1879 John Singer Sargent painted a small scale copy of Las Meninas and in 1882 painted a homage to the painting in his The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit while the Irish artist Sir John Lavery chose Vel zquez s masterpiece as the basis for his portrait The Royal Family at Buckingham Palace 1913 George V visited Lavery s studio during the execution of the painting and perhaps remembering the legend that Philip IV had daubed the cross of the Knights of Santiago on the figure of Vel zquez asked Lavery if he could contribute to the portrait with his own hand According to Lavery Thinking that royal blue might be an appropriate colour I mixed it on the palette and taking a brush he George V applied it to the Garter ribbon 74 ",
			"after": " Between August and December 1957 Pablo Picasso painted a series of 58 interpretations of Las Meninas and figures from it which currently fill the Las Meninas room of the Museu Picasso in Barcelona Spain Picasso did not vary the characters within the series but largely retained the naturalness of the scene according to the museum his works constitute an exhaustive study of form rhythm colour and movement 76 A print of 1973 by Richard Hamilton called Picasso s Meninas draws on both Vel zquez and Picasso 77 Photographer Joel Peter Witkin was commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Culture to create a work titled Las Meninas New Mexico 1987 which references Vel zquez s painting as well as other works by Spanish artists 78 ",
