			"previous": " With the introduction of higher gross weight Boeing 777s such as the 200ER and specifically 300ER sales of the A340 began to decline The 777 frequently outsold the A340 by a wide margin Although the larger GE90 engines on the 777 300ER burn considerably more fuel than the Trent 500s using only two engines compared to four Trents gave a typical operating cost advantage of around 8 9 44 In 2008 jet fuel prices doubled compared to the year before consequently the A340 s fuel consumption led airlines to reduce flight stages exceeding 15 hours Thai Airways International cancelled its 17 hour nonstop Bangkok New York JFK route on 1 July 2008 and placed its four A340 500s for sale While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel thirsty take offs and landings ultra long flights require completely full fuel tanks The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft s fuel fraction just to take off and once aloft to stay airborne In 2008 Air France KLM SA s chief executive Pierre Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340 as a flying tanker with a few people on board 79 While Thai Airways consistently filled 80 of the seats on its New York City Bangkok flights it estimated that at 2008 fuel prices it would need an impossible 120 of seats filled just to break even 80 Other airlines also re examined long haul flights In August 2008 Cathay Pacific stated that rising fuel costs were hurting its trans Pacific long haul routes disproportionately and that it would cut the number of such flights and redeploy its aircraft to shorter routes such as between Hong Kong and Australia We will reshap e our network where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money 81 Aviation Week compared the fortunes of the A340 to the Boeing 747 noting that the rapid performance increases of twin engine aircraft have been the detriment of four engine types 82 83 84 85 ",
			"after": " By 2014 Singapore Airlines had phased out the type while Emirates Airlines decided to accelerate the retirement of its A340 fleet International Airlines Group the parent of Iberia Airlines is overhauling its A340 600s for continued service for the foreseeable future The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes the business class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type s overall operating cost Lufthansa which operates both Airbus A340 300s and 600s concluded that while it is not possible to make the A340 more fuel efficient it can respond to increased interest in business class services by replacing first class seats with more business class seats to increase revenue 85 86 ",
