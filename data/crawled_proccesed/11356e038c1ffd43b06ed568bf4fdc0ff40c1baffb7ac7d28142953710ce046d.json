			"previous": " The pistons are short cylindrical parts which seal one end of the cylinder from the high pressure of the compressed air and combustion products and slide continuously within it while the engine is in operation The top wall of the piston is termed its crown and is typically flat or concave Some two stroke engines use pistons with a deflector head Pistons are open at the bottom and hollow except for an integral reinforcement structure the piston web When an engine is working the gas pressure in the combustion chamber exerts a force on the piston crown which is transferred through its web to a gudgeon pin Each piston has rings fitted around its circumference that mostly prevent the gases from leaking into the crankcase or the oil into the combustion chamber A ventilation system drives the small amount of gas that escape past the pistons during normal operation the blow by gases out of the crankcase so that it does not accumulate contaminating the oil and creating corrosion In two stroke gasoline engines the crankcase is part of the air fuel path and due to the continuous flow of it they do not need a separate crankcase ventilation system ",
			"after": " The cylinder head is attached to the engine block by numerous bolts or studs It has several functions The cylinder head seals the cylinders on the side opposite to the pistons it contains short ducts the ports for intake and exhaust and the associated intake valves that open to let the cylinder be filled with fresh air and exhaust valves that open to allow the combustion gases to escape However 2 stroke crankcase scavenged engines connect the gas ports directly to the cylinder wall without poppet valves the piston controls their opening and occlusion instead The cylinder head also holds the spark plug in the case of spark ignition engines and the injector for engines that use direct injection All CI engines use fuel injection usually direct injection but some engines instead use indirect injection SI engines can use a carburetor or fuel injection as port injection or direct injection Most SI engines have a single spark plug per cylinder but some have 2 A head gasket prevents the gas from leaking between the cylinder head and the engine block The opening and closing of the valves is controlled by one or several camshafts and springs or in some engines a desmodromic mechanism that uses no springs The camshaft may press directly the stem of the valve or may act upon a rocker arm again either directly or through a pushrod ",
