			"after": " Logic from Classical Greek logos meaning word thought idea argument account reason or principle is the study of the principles and criteria of valid inference and demonstration As a formal science logic investigates and classifies the structure of statements and arguments both through the study of formal systems of inference and through the study of arguments in natural language The field of logic ranges from core topics such as the study of fallacies and paradoxes to specialized analysis of reasoning using probability and to arguments involving causality Logic is also commonly used today in argumentation theory Since the mid nineteenth century formal logic has been studied in the context of the foundations of mathematics ",
