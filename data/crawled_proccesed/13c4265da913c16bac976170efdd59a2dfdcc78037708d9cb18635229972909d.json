			"after": " The blunt and short claws of Deinocheirus are similar to those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus which indicates the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour Deinocheirus was likely diurnal active during the day since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length 1 The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm but was capable of only a limited flexing motion unable to close in grasping 6 ",
