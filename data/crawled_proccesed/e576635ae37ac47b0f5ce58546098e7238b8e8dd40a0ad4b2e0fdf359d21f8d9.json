			"previous": " The claim to an 11th century date is due to scholars who argue that rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk Beowulf reflects an original interpretation of the story by the manuscript s two scribes 34 35 However some scholars argue that linguistic paleographical and onomastic considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century 29 36 37 38 in particular the poem s regular observation of etymological length distinctions Kaluza s law has been thought to suggest a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century 39 40 However scholars disagree about whether the metrical phenomena described by Kaluza s law reflect an early date of composition or correspond to a longer prehistory of the Beowulf meter 41 B R Hutcheson for instance does not believe Kaluza s Law can be used to date the poem while opining that the weight of all the evidence Fulk presents in his book b tells strongly in favor of an eighth century date 42 ",
