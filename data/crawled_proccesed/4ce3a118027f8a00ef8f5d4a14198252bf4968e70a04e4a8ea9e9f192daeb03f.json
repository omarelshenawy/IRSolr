			"previous": " Later Niccol Machiavelli rejected the views of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as unrealistic The ideal sovereign is not the embodiment of the moral virtues rather the sovereign does whatever is successful and necessary rather than what is morally praiseworthy Thomas Hobbes also contested many elements of Aristotle s views For Hobbes human nature is essentially anti social people are essentially egoistic and this egoism makes life difficult in the natural state of things Moreover Hobbes argued though people may have natural inequalities these are trivial since no particular talents or virtues that people may have will make them safe from harm inflicted by others For these reasons Hobbes concluded that the state arises from a common agreement to raise the community out of the state of nature This can only be done by the establishment of a sovereign in which or whom is vested complete control over the community and is able to inspire awe and terror in its subjects 20 ",
			"after": " Many in the Enlightenment were unsatisfied with existing doctrines in political philosophy which seemed to marginalize or neglect the possibility of a democratic state Jean Jacques Rousseau was among those who attempted to overturn these doctrines he responded to Hobbes by claiming that a human is by nature a kind of noble savage and that society and social contracts corrupt this nature Another critic was John Locke In Second Treatise on Government he agreed with Hobbes that the nation state was an efficient tool for raising humanity out of a deplorable state but he argued that the sovereign might become an abominable institution compared to the relatively benign unmodulated state of nature 21 ",
