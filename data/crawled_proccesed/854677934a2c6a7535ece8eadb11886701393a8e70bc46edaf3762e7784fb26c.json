			"after": " Banksia attenuata is generally encountered as a tree up to 10 m 35 ft tall In the north of its range as the climate becomes warmer and dryer it is often a stunted multistemmed shrub 0 4 to 2 m 1 7 ft tall Both forms occur in the vicinity of Hill River but there is otherwise a marked demarcation 2 In the Wheatbelt and east of the Stirling Range it is a stunted tree Tree forms have a solid trunk generally wavy or bent with 1 2 cm 0 4 0 8 in thick crumbly orange grey bark which is a red brown underneath 3 It regenerates from fire via lignotuber or epicormic buds from its fire tolerant trunk It has long narrow shiny green linear leaves 4 to 27 cm 1 6 11 in long and 0 5 to 1 6 cm 0 2 0 7 in wide 4 5 The leaf margins have v or u shaped serrations along their length The new growth is a pale grey green and occurs mainly in the late spring and summer 6 often after flowering The brilliant yellow inflorescences flower spikes occur from spring into summer and are up 5 cm 2 in wide and up to 25 30 cm 10 12 in tall 3 They are made up of many small individual flowers a study at Mount Adams 330 km 200 mi north of Perth revealed a count of 1933 a standard error of 88 flowers per inflorescence 7 and another in the Fitzgerald River National Park yielded a count of 1720 76 flowers Anthesis proceeds up the flower spike over about 10 to 20 days and is asynchronous That is a plant produces flower spikes over a several week period and will thus have spikes at different stages of development over the flowering season 8 Often bright green in bud stage 9 they are terminal occurring at the ends of one to three year old branches and displayed prominently above the foliage 3 The smell of the open flowers has been likened to a peppery Shiraz wine 9 Over time the spikes fade to brown and then grey 4 and the individual flowers shrivel and lie against the spikes This coincides with the development of dark furry oval follicles which measure 2 3 5 cm 0 8 1 4 in long 1 1 5 cm 0 4 0 6 in high and 1 4 2 cm 0 5 0 8 in wide 3 However only a very small percentage 0 1 of flowers develop into follicles the field study at Mount Adams yielded a count of 3 6 1 2 per cone 7 The follicles develop and mature over seven to eight months from February to December while seed development occurs over four months from September to December 10 ",
