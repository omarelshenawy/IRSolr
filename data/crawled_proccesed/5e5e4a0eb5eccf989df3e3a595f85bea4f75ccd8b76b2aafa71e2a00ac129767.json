			"after": " By the middle of the 6th century some Brythonic people in the lowlands of Britain had moved across the sea to form Brittany some had moved west but the majority were abandoning their past language and culture and adopting the new culture of the Anglo Saxons As they adopted language and culture so the barriers that existed between peoples who had lived parallel lives started to break down 37 The archaeological evidence shows a lot of continuity in the system of landscape and local governance 38 which was inherited from the indigenous community and there is evidence for a fusion of culture in this early period 39 One of the elements is the Brythonic names that appear in the lists of Anglo Saxon elite The Wessex royal line was traditionally founded by a man named Cerdic an undoubtedly Celtic name ultimately derived from Caratacus This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton and that his dynasty became anglicised over time 40 41 A number of Cerdic s alleged descendants also possessed Celtic names including the Bretwalda Ceawlin 42 The last occurrence of a British name in this dynasty being that of King Caedwalla who died as late as 689 43 ",
