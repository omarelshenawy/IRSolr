			"previous": " Humans in East Asia were consuming large amounts of freshwater fish around 40 000 years ago 174 Spearfishing with barbed harpoons along the coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic 175 Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2 500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th century BC businessman Fan Li 176 is the earliest known work on fish farming 177 A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax s 1st century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf 178 and Oppian s 2nd century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook and line netting passive traps and trident 179 Traditional fishing boats operate in near shore waters but during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period fishing on the open sea particularly cod became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe New England and Canada 180 Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep sea fishers such as the Brixham 181 and otter trawlers which might serve as motherships for longlining dories 182 in the 19th century advances such as rail transport canning and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full fledged industry Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and during the 1950s great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season 182 By the 1960s the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons 20 million tons in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons 93 1 2 million tons by the late 1980s it has remained essentially constant since 183 i Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production from 7 of the world total in 1961 to 35 by 2010 183 Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions the collapse of the Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1 of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 184 and China has enforced a zero growth policy in its wild catch since 2000 redirecting its industry towards aquaculture 185 its annual months long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states 186 ",
			"after": " As of 2006 there were an estimated 43 5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood 85 5 of whom lived in Asia About 3 4 were fishers and the remainder fish farmers 188 In 2012 total global production of fish crustaceans molluscs and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons 174 million tons of which 91 3 million metric tons 100 million tons were caught in the wild 189 This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy 189 whose population can vary dramatically with the El Ni o cycle 190 191 The overall trend remains increasing but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems 192 over the most productive regions of the sea accounting for around 87 of the annual harvest 193 The results are sometimes dramatic the lull in fishing over the course of the First World War saw the North Sea s 1919 catch double 1913 s 182 and sometimes much less so two decades on the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10 of their peak At present the species most frequently landed are herring cod anchovy tuna flounder mullet squid and salmon A number of these as well as large predatory fish 194 remain well below historical levels 195 ",
