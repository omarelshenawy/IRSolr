			"after": " Conflicting reports have been made as to its preferred habitat two papers suggest it preferred channels to floodplains 38 39 but another suggests it preferred the opposite 40 The possible preference for channels is based on the relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones representing channel environments in comparison to mudstones representing floodplain environments 39 No bonebeds or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported Dale Russell in a popular work noted that Thescelosaurus was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck area He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees to bald cypress to ferns and ginkgos Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests Thescelosaurus skeletons are much more complete suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels Thus when a Thescelosaurus died it may have been in or near a river making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization Russell tentatively compared it to the capybaras and tapirs 41 Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus ankylosaurid Ankylosaurus pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus and the theropods Ornithomimus Troodon and Tyrannosaurus 42 43 Thescelosaurus was also abundant in the Lance Formation Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus and it may have been the most common dinosaur there in life if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals 44 ",
