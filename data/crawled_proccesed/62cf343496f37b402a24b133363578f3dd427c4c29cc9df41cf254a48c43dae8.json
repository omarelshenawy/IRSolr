			"previous": " The use of alloys by humans started with the use of meteoric iron a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron It is the main constituent of iron meteorites which occasionally fall down on Earth from outer space As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel the alloy was used as it was 9 Meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools weapons and nails In many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads They were often used as anvils Meteoric iron was very rare and valuable and difficult for ancient people to work 10 ",
			"after": " Iron is usually found as iron ore on Earth except for one deposit of native iron in Greenland which was used by the Inuit people 11 Native copper however was found worldwide along with silver gold and platinum which were also used to make tools jewelry and other objects since Neolithic times Copper was the hardest of these metals and the most widely distributed It became one of the most important metals to the ancients Eventually humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore and around 2500 BC began alloying the two metals to form bronze which is much harder than its ingredients Tin was rare however being found mostly in Great Britain In the Middle East people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass 12 Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced such as hardness toughness and melting point under various conditions of temperature and work hardening developing much of the information contained in modern alloy phase diagrams 13 Arrowheads from the Chinese Qin dynasty around 200 BC were often constructed with a hard bronze head but a softer bronze tang combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use 14 ",
