			"previous": " In 2013 UNICEF reported a downward trend in over half the 29 key countries in the 15 19 group compared to women aged 45 49 102 Little difference was found in countries with very high prevalence but the rate of FGM had declined in countries with lower prevalence or less severe forms of FGM were being practised 103 According to UNICEF in July 2014 the likelihood of a girl experiencing FGM was overall one third lower than 30 years ago 104 Despite this because of population growth the numbers affected by FGM in the key 29 countries will increase from 133 million to 196 million by 2050 if the rate of decline as of 2014 update continues 105 ",
			"after": " Women who respond to surveys on FGM are reporting events experienced years ago so prevalence figures for the 15 49 group do not reflect current trends 107 UNICEF bases its figures on the 15 49 group because girls are generally at risk until they are 14 108 An additional complication in judging prevalence among girls 14 and under is that women might not report that their daughters have been cut in countries running campaigns against FGM 109 ",
