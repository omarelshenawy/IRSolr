			"previous": " In late 1901 Chile and Argentina were on the brink of war and Chile was concerned about its navy s ability to counter the armoured cruisers Rivadavia and Moreno which Argentina had ordered from Italy earlier that year Sir Edward Reed chief designer for Armstrong Whitworth was in Chile for health reasons at the time and met with Chilean Navy officials to discuss the idea of purchasing or building two battleships with high speed and a powerful armament on a low displacement Purchase of existing ships was not a practical option so the Chileans asked Reed to design the ships for construction in the United Kingdom Chile ordered the ships to be named Constituci n and Libertad in 1901 Constituci n from Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick and Libertad from Vickers at Barrow in Furness 2 ",
			"after": " The ships were considered second class battleships lightly constructed armed and armoured by British standards Swiftsure in fact suffered from structural weakness while in service and required hull strengthening although Triumph did not have such problems Chile had required the ships to fit into the graving dock at Talcahuano so they had to be longer and narrower for their displacement than ships built to British standards Details in mast and anchor arrangements as well as the arrangement of magazines and shell handling rooms also were different from British standards 3 ",
