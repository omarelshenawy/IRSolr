			"previous": " C rdoba the capital of the caliphate since Abd ar Rahman III was the largest richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe Some important philosophers at the time were Averroes Ibn Arabi and Maimonides The Romanised cultures of the Iberian Peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways giving the region a distinctive culture 23 Outside the cities where the vast majority lived the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture ",
			"after": " In the 11th century the Muslim holdings fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories 23 The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings with a stricter less tolerant application of Islam and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes This re united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains ",
