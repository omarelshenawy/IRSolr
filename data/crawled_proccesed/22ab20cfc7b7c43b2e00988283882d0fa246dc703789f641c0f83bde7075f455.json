			"previous": " The integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands Local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads The outside of the skin is shed periodically more or less in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin 33 Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial Lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages 50 ",
			"after": " Amphibian skin is permeable to water Gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds 33 To compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist In addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect 51 The main poison producing glands the paratoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians 52 ",
