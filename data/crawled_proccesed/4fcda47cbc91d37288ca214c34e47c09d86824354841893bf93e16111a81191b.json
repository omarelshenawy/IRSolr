			"after": " In 1916 Einstein showed that Planck s radiation law could be derived from a semi classical statistical treatment of photons and atoms which implies a relation between the rates at which atoms emit and absorb photons The condition follows from the assumption that light is emitted and absorbed by atoms independently and that the thermal equilibrium is preserved by interaction with atoms Consider a cavity in thermal equilibrium and filled with electromagnetic radiation and atoms that can emit and absorb that radiation Thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density of photons with frequency which is proportional to their number density is on average constant in time hence the rate at which photons of any particular frequency are emitted must equal the rate of absorbing them 71 ",
