			"previous": " Molecular symmetry is responsible for many physical and spectroscopic properties of compounds and provides relevant information about how chemical reactions occur In order to assign a point group for any given molecule it is necessary to find the set of symmetry operations present on it The symmetry operation is an action such as a rotation around an axis or a reflection through a mirror plane In other words it is an operation that moves the molecule such that it is indistinguishable from the original configuration In group theory the rotation axes and mirror planes are called symmetry elements These elements can be a point line or plane with respect to which the symmetry operation is carried out The symmetry operations of a molecule determine the specific point group for this molecule ",
			"after": " In chemistry there are five important symmetry operations The identity operation E consists of leaving the molecule as it is This is equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis This is a symmetry of all molecules whereas the symmetry group of a chiral molecule consists of only the identity operation Rotation around an axis Cn consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle For example if a water molecule rotates 180 around the axis that passes through the oxygen atom and between the hydrogen atoms it is in the same configuration as it started In this case n 2 since applying it twice produces the identity operation Other symmetry operations are reflection inversion and improper rotation rotation followed by reflection 13 ",
