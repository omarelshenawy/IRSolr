			"after": " A sundial is a device that tells the time of day by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky In common designs such as the horizontal sundial the sun casts a shadow from its style onto a surface marked with lines indicating the hours of the day The style is the time telling edge of the gnomon often a thin rod or a sharp straight edge As the sun appears to move across the sky the shadow edge aligns with different hour lines Those sundials that directly measure the sun s hour angle by the shadow of an edge must have that edge parallel to the axis of the Earth s rotation to tell the correct time throughout the year The style s angle from the horizontal will thus equal the sundial s geographical latitude It is common for inexpensive mass produced decorative sundials to have incorrect hour angles which cannot be adjusted to tell correct time 1 ",
