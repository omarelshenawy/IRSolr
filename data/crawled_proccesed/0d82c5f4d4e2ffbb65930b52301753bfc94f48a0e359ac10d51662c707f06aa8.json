			"previous": " Included in Lusitania s cargo were 4 200 000 rounds of Remington 303 rifle cartridges 1 250 cases of empty 3 inch 76 mm fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of non explosive fuses 54 all of which were listed on the ship s two page manifest filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May 98 99 However these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition were non explosive in bulk and were clearly marked as such It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion citation needed Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo such as fine aluminium powder concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests or guncotton pyroxylene disguised as casks of beef have never been proven citation needed Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of internal explosion citation needed ",
			"after": " In 1993 Dr Robert Ballard the famous explorer who discovered Titanic and Bismarck conducted an in depth exploration of the wreck of Lusitania Ballard found John Light who dove on the wreck in the 1960s had been mistaken in his identification of a gaping hole in the ship s side To explain the second explosion Ballard advanced the theory of a coal dust explosion He believed dust in the bunkers would have been thrown into the air by the vibration from the explosion the resulting cloud would have been ignited by a spark causing the second explosion In the years since he first advanced this theory it has been argued that this is nearly impossible Critics of the theory say coal dust would have been too damp to have been stirred into the air by the torpedo impact in explosive concentrations additionally the coal bunker where the torpedo struck would have been flooded almost immediately by seawater flowing through the damaged hull plates 99 100 ",
