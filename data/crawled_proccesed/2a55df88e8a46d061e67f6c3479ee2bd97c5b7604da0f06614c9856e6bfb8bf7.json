			"previous": " Unlike many other aircraft designed to play a similar role the variants of the B 29 were all essentially the same The developments made between the first prototype XB 29 and any of the three versions flown in combat were all minuscule excluding the Silverplate models built for the Manhattan Project The biggest differences were between variants modified for non bomber missions In addition to acting as cargo carriers rescue aircraft weather ships and trainers some were used for odd purposes such as flying relay television transmitters under the name of Stratovision ",
			"after": " An example of a later variant of the B 29 the B 50 Superfortress which was powered by four 3 500 hp 2 600 kW Pratt Whitney R 4360 35 Wasp Major engines acted as the mothership for experimental parasite fighter aircraft such as the McDonnell XF 85 Goblin and Republic F 84 Thunderjets as in flight lock on and offs It was also used to develop the Airborne Early Warning program it was the ancestor of various modern radar picket aircraft A B 29 with the original Wright Duplex Cyclone powerplants was used to air launch the famous Bell X 1 supersonic research rocket aircraft as well as Cherokee rockets for the testing of ejection seats 59 ",
