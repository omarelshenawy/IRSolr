			"previous": " Chemical rocket propellants are most commonly used which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas which is used by a rocket for propulsive purposes Alternatively a chemically inert reaction mass can be heated using a high energy power source via a heat exchanger and then no combustion chamber is used ",
			"after": " Solid rocket propellants are prepared as a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called grain and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber Liquid fuelled rockets typically pump separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber where they mix and burn Hybrid rocket engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants Both liquid and hybrid rockets use injectors to introduce the propellant into the chamber These are often an array of simple jets holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles When two or more propellants are injected the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily ",
