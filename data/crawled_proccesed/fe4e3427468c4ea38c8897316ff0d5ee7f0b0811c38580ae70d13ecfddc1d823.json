			"previous": " Ethics or moral philosophy is concerned primarily with the question of the best way to live and secondarily concerning the question of whether this question can be answered The main branches of ethics are meta ethics normative ethics and applied ethics Meta ethics concerns the nature of ethical thought such as the origins of the words good and bad and origins of other comparative words of various ethical systems whether there are absolute ethical truths and how such truths could be known Normative ethics are more concerned with the questions of how one ought to act and what the right course of action is This is where most ethical theories are generated Lastly applied ethics go beyond theory and step into real world ethical practice such as questions of whether or not abortion is correct Ethics is also associated with the idea of morality and the two are often interchangeable ",
