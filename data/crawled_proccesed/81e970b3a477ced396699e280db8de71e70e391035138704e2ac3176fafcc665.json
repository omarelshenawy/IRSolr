			"previous": " Based on the EQ Psittacosaurus was behaviourally complex as a higher EQ influences the behaviour of animals Various dinosaurs have high EQs similar to birds which range from 0 36 to 2 98 Thus Psittacosaurus behaved complexly even as complex as Tyrannosaurus whose EQ ranges from 0 30 to 0 38 Behaviours influenced by high EQs include nest building parental care and bird like sleeping some of which have been shown to be present in Psittacosaurus and others of which may have occurred Based on the 2007 study these may come from the high EQ in Psittacosaurus 13 ",
			"after": " The senses of Psittacosaurus can be inferred from the endocast Large olfactory bulbs are present indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of seek out prey The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show the size of the eyeball The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem but if they are similar to those of Protoceratops Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision The curvature of the semicircular canals are in effect to the agility of reptiles and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians 13 Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral active throughout the day and night at short intervals 14 ",
