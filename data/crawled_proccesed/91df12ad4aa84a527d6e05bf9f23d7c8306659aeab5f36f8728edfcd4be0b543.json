			"previous": " The 1870s were the golden years of Cope s career marked by his most prominent discoveries and rapid flow of publications Among his descriptions were the therapsid Lystrosaurus 1870 43 the archosauromorph Champsosaurus 1876 44 and the sauropod Amphicoelias 1878 45 possibly the largest dinosaur ever discovered 46 In the period of one year from 1879 to 1880 Cope published 76 papers based on his travels through New Mexico and Colorado and on the findings of his collectors in Texas Kansas Oregon Colorado Wyoming and Utah 47 During the peak years Cope published around 25 reports and preliminary observations each year The hurried publications led to errors in interpretation and naming many of his scientific names were later canceled or withdrawn In comparison Marsh wrote and published less frequently and more succinctly his works appearance in the widespread American Journal of Science led to faster reception abroad and subsequently Marsh s reputation grew more rapidly than Cope s 48 ",
			"after": " In autumn 1871 Cope began prospecting farther west to the fossil fields of Kansas Leidy and Marsh had been to the region earlier and Cope employed one of Marsh s guides Benjamin Mudge who was in want of a job 49 Cope s companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions Cope would suffer from a severe attack of nightmare in which every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber Nevertheless Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds 50 The severe desert conditions and Cope s habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him and in 1872 he broke down from exhaustion 51 Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879 52 ",
