			"previous": " In its simplest terms the definition of a castle accepted amongst academics is a private fortified residence 3 This contrasts with earlier fortifications such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled cities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lords either for themselves or for their monarch 4 Feudalism was the link between a lord and his vassal where in return for military service the lord would grant the vassal land and expect loyalty 5 In the late 20th century there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal ownership thus tying castles to the medieval period however this does not necessarily reflect the terminology used in the medieval period During the First Crusade 1096 1099 the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately referred to as castles but which would not be considered as such under the modern definition 3 ",
