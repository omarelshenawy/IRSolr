			"previous": " Ultrasonication offers great potential in the processing of liquids and slurries by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various applications and industries Ultrasonication generates alternating low pressure and high pressure waves in liquids leading to the formation and violent collapse of small vacuum bubbles This phenomenon is termed cavitation and causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear forces These effects are used for the deagglomeration and milling of micrometre and nanometre size materials as well as for the disintegration of cells or the mixing of reactants In this aspect ultrasonication is an alternative to high speed mixers and agitator bead mills Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to distribute the cellulose fibres more uniformly in the produced paper web which will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces Furthermore chemical reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers For many processes this sonochemical see sonochemistry effect leads to a substantial reduction in the reaction time like in the transesterification of oil into biodiesel ",
			"after": " Substantial ultrasonic intensity and high ultrasonic vibration amplitudes are required for many processing applications such as nano crystallization nano emulsification 34 deagglomeration extraction cell disruption as well as many others Commonly a process is first tested on a laboratory scale to prove feasibility and establish some of the required ultrasonic exposure parameters After this phase is complete the process is transferred to a pilot bench scale for flow through pre production optimization and then to an industrial scale for continuous production During these scale up steps it is essential to make sure that all local exposure conditions ultrasonic amplitude cavitation intensity time spent in the active cavitation zone etc stay the same If this condition is met the quality of the final product remains at the optimized level while the productivity is increased by a predictable scale up factor The productivity increase results from the fact that laboratory bench and industrial scale ultrasonic processor systems incorporate progressively larger ultrasonic horns able to generate progressively larger high intensity cavitation zones and therefore to process more material per unit of time This is called direct scalability It is important to point out that increasing the power of the ultrasonic processor alone does not result in direct scalability since it may be and frequently is accompanied by a reduction in the ultrasonic amplitude and cavitation intensity During direct scale up all processing conditions must be maintained while the power rating of the equipment is increased in order to enable the operation of a larger ultrasonic horn 35 36 37 ",
