			"after": " In Prague the emergence of Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre and had led to a downturn in the Neues Deutsches Theater s fortunes Mahler s task was to help arrest this decline by offering high quality productions of German opera 24 He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner composers with whom he would be particularly associated for the rest of his career 22 but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction and a falling out with his more experienced fellow conductor Ludwig Slansky 24 In April 1886 Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the Neues Stadttheater in Leipzig where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch began at once This was primarily over how the two should share conducting duties for the theatre s new production of Wagner s Ring cycle Nikisch s illness in January 1887 meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle and scored a resounding public success This did not however win him popularity with the orchestra who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules 24 25 ",
