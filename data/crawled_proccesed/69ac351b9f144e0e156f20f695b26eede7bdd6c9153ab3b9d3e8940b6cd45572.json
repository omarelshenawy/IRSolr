			"previous": " Current knowledge on genetic diversity is fragmentary and the total number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy 15 Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23 of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains obscure 26 The Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization 27 ",
