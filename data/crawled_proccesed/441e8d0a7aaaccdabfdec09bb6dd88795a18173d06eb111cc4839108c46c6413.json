			"previous": " Van der Weyden s depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany 9 33 identified by the time of Pope Gregory I as the repentant prostitute of Luke 7 36 50 34 She then became associated with weeping and reading Christ s mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes associating tears with words and in turn weeping with reading Examples can be seen in 16th century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading often with her eyes averted towards her book and presumably away from a male gaze or looking up to the heavens or sometimes glancing coyly towards the viewer 35 Writing in The Crying Face Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden s time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a pictorial formula for crying 36 ",
			"after": " By the medieval period reading became synonymous with devotion which involved withdrawal from public view Van der Weyden s placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid 15th century The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes 37 Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts Because the Magdalen was present at Christ s death and subsequent resurrection she was seen as the bearer of news a witness and hence directly associated with the text 38 ",
