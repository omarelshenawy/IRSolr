			"previous": " The original engine nacelles incorporated thrust reversers taken from the 727 outboard nacelles Unfortunately they proved to be relatively ineffective and apparently tended to lift the aircraft up off the runway when deployed This reduced the downforce on the main wheels thereby reducing the effectiveness of the wheel brakes In 1968 an improvement to the thrust reversal system was introduced A 48 inch tailpipe extension was added and new target style thrust reversers were incorporated The thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings 30 The improvement became standard on all aircraft after March 1969 and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft Boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacelle wing fairings and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats The production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system allowing increased use during takeoff and landing All these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range and improved short field performance 24 In May 1971 after aircraft 135 all improvements including more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity were incorporated into the 737 200 giving it a 15 increase in payload and range over the original 200s 26 This became known as the 737 200 Advanced which became the production standard in June 1971 31 ",
			"after": " In 1970 Boeing received only 37 orders Facing financial difficulties Boeing considered closing the 737 production line and selling the design to Japanese aviation companies 13 After the cancellation of the Boeing Supersonic Transport and scaling back of 747 production enough funds were freed up to continue the project 32 In a bid to increase sales by offering a variety of options Boeing offered a 737C Convertible model in both 100 and 200 lengths This model featured a 340 cm 221 cm 134 in 87 in freight door just behind the cockpit and a strengthened floor with rollers which allowed for palletized cargo A 737QC Quick Change version with palletized seating allowed for faster configuration changes between cargo and passenger flights 33 With the improved short field capabilities of the 737 Boeing offered the option on the 200 of the gravel kit which enables this aircraft to operate on remote unpaved runways 34 35 Until retiring its 200 fleet in 2007 Alaska Airlines used this option for some of its rural operations in Alaska 36 Northern Canadian operators Air Inuit Air North Canadian North First Air and Nolinor Aviation still operate the gravel kit aircraft in Northern Canada where gravel runways are common ",
