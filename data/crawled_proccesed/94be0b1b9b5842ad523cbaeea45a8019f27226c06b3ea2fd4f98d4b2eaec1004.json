			"previous": " The British transferred the technology of the Rolls Royce Nene jet engine to the Soviets who soon put it to use in their advanced Mikoyan Gurevich MiG 15 fighter which used fully swept wings that allowed flying closer to the speed of sound than straight winged designs such as the F 80 Its top speed of 1 075 km h 668 mph proved quite a shock to the American F 80 pilots who encountered them over Korea along with their armament of two 23 mm cannons and a single 37 mm cannon Nevertheless in the first jet versus jet dogfight which occurred during the Korean War on 8 November 1950 an F 80 downed two North Korean MiG 15s ",
			"after": " The Americans responded by rushing their own swept wing F 86 into battle against the MiGs which had similar transsonic performance The two aircraft had different strengths and weaknesses but were similar enough that victory could go either way While the Sabres were focussed primarily on downing MiGs and scored favourably against those flown by the poorly trained North Koreans the MiGs in turn decimated US bomber formations and forced the withdrawal of numerous American types from operational service ",
