			"previous": " On 5 July 1937 A S Wilcockson flew a Short Empire for Imperial Airways from Foynes to Botwood Newfoundland and Harold Gray piloted a Sikorsky S 42 for Pan American in the opposite direction Both flights were a success and both airlines made a series of subsequent proving flights that same year to test out a variety of different weather conditions France s Air France also became interested and began experimental flights in 1938 20 ",
			"after": " As the Short Empire only had enough range with enlarged fuel tanks at the expense of passenger room a number of pioneering experiments were done with the aircraft to work around the problem It was known that aircraft could maintain flight with a greater load than is possible to take off with so Major Robert H Mayo Technical General Manager at Imperial Airways proposed mounting a small long range seaplane on top of a larger carrier aircraft using the combined power of both to bring the smaller aircraft to operational height at which time the two aircraft would separate the carrier aircraft returning to base while the other flew on to its destination 18 ",
