			"after": " Low drag conformal fuel tanks CFTs were developed for the F 15C and D models They can be attached to the sides of the engine air intake ramps under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft 47 They degrade performance by increasing drag and cannot be jettisoned in flight unlike conventional external tanks Each conformal fuel tank can hold 750 U S gallons 2 840 L of fuel 48 These tanks increase range and reduce the need for in flight refueling All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use Moreover Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the conformal fuel tanks 31 The 57 FIS based at Keflavik NAS Iceland was the only C model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic With the closure of the 57 FIS the F 15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia ",
