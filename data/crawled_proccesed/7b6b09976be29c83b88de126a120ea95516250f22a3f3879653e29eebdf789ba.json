			"after": " Sundials had been used for timekeeping since Ancient Egypt Ancient dials were nodus based with straight hour lines that indicated unequal hours also called temporary hours that varied with the seasons Every day was divided into 12 equal segments regardless of the time of year thus hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer The sundial was further developed by Muslim astronomers The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu l Hasan Ibn al Shatir in 1371 based on earlier developments in trigonometry by Muhammad ibn J bir al Harr n al Batt n Albategni Ibn al Shatir was aware that using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth s axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year His sundial is the oldest polar axis sundial still in existence The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446 68 69 ",
