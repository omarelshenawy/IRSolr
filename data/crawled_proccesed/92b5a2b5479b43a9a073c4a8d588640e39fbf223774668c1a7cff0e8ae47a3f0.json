			"previous": " Little is known about the social structure of slow lorises but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone 86 87 Individuals sleep during the day usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises 86 Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap and those of males are generally larger than those of females 87 88 In the absence of direct studies of the genus primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of the potto another slow moving nocturnal primate 89 Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited scent marking with urine is the dominant form of communication 70 89 Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males 70 90 Vocalizations include an affiliative friendly call krik and a louder call resembling a crow s caw 91 When disturbed slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl To make contact with other individuals they emit a single high pitched rising tone and females use a high whistle when in estrus 70 90 ",
			"after": " Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs 92 To move between trees they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap 7 They will also grip branches with only their hind feet lift themselves upright and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey 92 Due to their slow movement all lorises including the slow lorises have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation Their slow deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent Once disturbed they immediately stop moving and remain motionless 93 In Indonesia slow lorises are called malu malu or shy one because they freeze and cover their face when spotted 94 If cornered they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator 93 The Acehnese name buah angin wind monkey refers to their ability to fleetingly but silently escape 95 Little is known about the predation of slow lorises Documented predators include snakes the changeable hawk eagle Nisaetus cirrhatus 96 and Sumatran orangutans Pongo abelii 97 Other potential predators include cats sun bears Ursus malayanus binturongs Arctictis binturong and civets 98 ",
