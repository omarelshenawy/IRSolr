			"previous": " The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 replaced the wartime Manhattan Project with the Atomic Energy Commission AEC on January 1 1947 The Act also established the General Advisory Committee GAC within the AEC to provide it with scientific and technical advice It was widely expected that Conant would chair the GAC but the position went to Robert Oppenheimer the wartime director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory that had designed and developed the first atomic bombs At the same time the Joint Research and Development Board JRDC was established to coordinate defense research and Bush asked Conant to head its atomic energy subcommittee on which Oppenheimer also served 113 When the new AEC chairman David E Lilienthal raised security concerns about Oppenheimer s relationships with communists including Oppenheimer s brother Frank Oppenheimer his wife Kitty and his former girlfriend Jean Tatlock Bush and Conant reassured Lilienthal that they had known about it when they had placed Oppenheimer in charge at Los Alamos in 1942 With such expressions of support AEC issued Oppenheimer a Q clearance granting him access to atomic secrets 114 ",
			"after": " By September 1948 the Red Scare began to take hold and Conant called for a ban on hiring teachers who were communists although not for the dismissal of those who had already been hired A debate ensued over whether communist educators could teach apolitical subjects 115 Conant was a member of the Educational Policies Commission EPC a body to which he had been appointed in 1941 116 When it next met in March 1949 Conant s push for a ban was supported by the president of Columbia University General of the Army Dwight D Eisenhower The two found common ground in their belief in ideology based education 117 which Conant called democratic education He did not see public education as a side effect of American democracy but as one of its principal driving forces 118 and he disapproved of the public funding of denominational schools that he observed in Australia during his visit there in 1951 119 He called for increased federal spending on education and higher taxes to redistribute wealth 118 His thinking was outlined in his books Education in a Divided World in 1948 120 and Education and Liberty in 1951 121 In 1952 he went further and endorsed the dismissal of academics who invoked the Fifth under questioning by the House Un American Activities Committee 122 ",
