			"after": " Slipping and skidding within a turn is sometimes referred to as a sloppy turn due to the perceptive discomfort it can cause to the pilot and passengers When the aircraft is in a balanced turn ball is centered passengers experience gravity directly in line with their seat force perpendicular to seat With a well balanced turn passengers may not even realize the aircraft is turning unless they are viewing objects outside the aircraft While aircraft slipping and skidding are often undesired in a usual turn that maintains altitude slipping of the aircraft can be used for practical purposes Intentionally putting an aircraft into a slip is used as a forward slip and a sideslip These slips are performed by applying opposite inputs of the aileron and rudder controls A forward slip allows a pilot to quickly drop altitude without gaining unnecessary speed while a sideslip is one method utilized to perform a crosswind landing ",
