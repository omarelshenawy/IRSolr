			"previous": " The first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by James Harrison a British journalist who had emigrated to Australia His 1856 patent was for a vapour compression system using ether alcohol or ammonia He built a mechanical ice making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong Victoria and his first commercial ice making machine followed in 1854 Harrison also introduced commercial vapour compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses and by 1861 a dozen of his systems were in operation He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom which used a cold room system instead of a refrigeration system The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected ",
			"after": " The first gas absorption refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water referred to as aqua ammonia was developed by Ferdinand Carr of France in 1859 and patented in 1860 Carl von Linde an engineer specializing in steam locomotives and professor of engineering at the Technological University of Munich in Germany began researching refrigeration in the 1860s and 70s in response to demand from brewers for a technology that would allow year round large scale production of lager he patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876 12 His new process made possible using gases such as ammonia sulfur dioxide SO2 and methyl chloride CH3Cl as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s ",
