			"after": " The hatchling s ability to survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive extended periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground 53 The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings 44 ",
