			"previous": " The preservation of various pure breeds and strains including some that are rare today was once undertaken in North America in large part by large agriculture focused colleges and universities However many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains with many herds being sent to slaughter The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases leading to the survival and preservation of some gene stocks The United States Department of Agriculture USDA participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm genetic material storage However although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times they were never focused on individual breeds The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US 22 ",
			"after": " In the 1980s the Conservancy began a gene bank designed to preserve the genetic material of rare breeds After collecting genetic material from over a dozen rare breeds the bank was transferred to the USDA National Animal Germplasm Program NAGP It maintains a close relationship with the NAGP including assisting in the collection of genetic material from additional rare breeds 23 The conservation list published by the Conservancy is also used by the SVF Foundation an organization that uses cryopreservation to preserve germplasm from rare breeds 24 In the early 1990s the organization mounted displays of historic rare breed livestock illustrations at the National Agricultural Library and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History designed to raise public awareness of the declining populations of rare livestock breeds 25 26 ",
