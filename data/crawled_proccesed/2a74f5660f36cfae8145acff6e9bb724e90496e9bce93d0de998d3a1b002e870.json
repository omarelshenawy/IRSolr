			"previous": " Only the males have antlers which start growing in the spring and are shed each winter The largest antlers may be 1 2 metres 3 9 ft long and weigh 18 kilograms 40 lb 28 Antlers are made of bone which can grow at a rate of 2 5 centimetres 0 98 in per day While actively growing the antlers are covered with and protected by a soft layer of highly vascularised skin known as velvet The velvet is shed in the summer when the antlers have fully developed Bull elk may have eight or more tines on each antler however the number of tines has little to do with the age or maturity of a particular animal The Siberian and North American elk carry the largest antlers while the Altai wapiti have the smallest 15 The formation and retention of antlers is testosterone driven 29 After the breeding season in late fall the level of pheromones released during estrus declines in the environment and the testosterone levels of males drop as a consequence This drop in testosterone leads to the shedding of antlers usually in the early winter ",
			"after": " During the fall elk grow a thicker coat of hair which helps to insulate them during the winter Males females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not 20 By early summer the heavy winter coat has been shed and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats with gray or lighter coloration prevalent in the winter and a more reddish darker coat in the summer Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests 30 Most have lighter yellow brown to orange brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head neck and legs during the summer Forest adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish brown coats with less contrast between the body coat and the rest of the body during the summer months 15 Calves are born spotted as is common with many deer species and they lose their spots by the end of summer Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older This characteristic has also been observed in the forest adapted European red deer 15 ",
