			"previous": " Historically quagga taxonomy was further complicated by the fact that the extinct southernmost population of Burchell s zebra Equus quagga burchellii formerly Equus burchellii burchellii was thought to be a distinct subspecies also sometimes thought a full species E burchellii The extant northern population the Damara zebra was later named Equus quagga antiquorum which means that it is today also referred to as E q burchellii after it was realised they were the same taxon The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts 8 As an example of this Shortridge placed the two in the now disused subgenus Quagga in 1934 11 Most experts now suggest that the two subspecies represent two ends of a cline 12 ",
			"after": " Different subspecies of plains zebra were recognised as members of Equus quagga by early researchers though there was much confusion over which species were valid 13 Quagga subspecies were described on the basis of differences in striping patterns but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations 14 Some subspecies and even species such as E q danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus were only based on illustrations iconotypes of aberrant quagga specimens 15 16 Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse Equus caballus 12 It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable 17 ",
