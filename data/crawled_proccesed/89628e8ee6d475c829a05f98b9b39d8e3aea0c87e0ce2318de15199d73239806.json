			"previous": " In 1967 Pennsylvania leased the reactor complex to the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation NUMEC which already had a federal license to work with nuclear materials NUMEC which soon became a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield Corporation ARCO set up a large irradiator in what had been the reactor pool The irradiator contained over 1 million curies of cobalt 60 to produce intense gamma rays which were used to sterilize medical equipment and irradiate food and wood In the spring of 1967 the state had concluded that radiation contamination at the Quehanna site could never be completely cleaned up and so was glad to find a tenant with nuclear experience 8 38 ",
			"after": " A group of NUMEC employees discovered that irradiating hardwood treated with plastics produced very durable flooring In 1978 they formed PermaGrain Products Inc as a separate company from ARCO and purchased the rights to the process as well as the main irradiator a smaller shielded irradiator and related equipment 38 PermaGrain sold the flooring for use in basketball courts and gymnasiums and was the longest occupant of the Quehanna facility operating there from 1978 to December 2002 PermaGrain also let Neutron Products Inc a Maryland company do cobalt 60 work in its hot cells which required an amendment of their license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC the successor to the AEC 8 38 52 ",
