			"previous": " In The Third of May the man with raised arms at the focal point of the composition has often been compared to a crucified Christ 36 and a similar pose is sometimes seen in depictions of Christ s nocturnal Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane 37 Goya s figure displays stigmata like marks on his right hand 34 while the lantern at the center of the canvas references a traditional attribute of the Roman soldiers who arrested Christ in the garden 38 Not only is he posed as if in crucifixion he wears yellow and white the heraldic colors of the papacy 39 In The Third of May however there is no attempt to find transcendence and no sense that the sacrifice of life will lead to salvation ",
			"after": " The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by Baroque artists and perfected by Caravaggio 40 Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle Rather it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted 40 ",
