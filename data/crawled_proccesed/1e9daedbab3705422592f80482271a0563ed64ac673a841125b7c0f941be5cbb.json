			"previous": " Mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony There they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce workers The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers but they begin to serve the colony immediately They enlarge the nest forage for food and care for the other eggs This is how new colonies start in most ant species Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site 61 a process akin to swarming in honeybees ",
