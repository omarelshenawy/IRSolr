			"previous": " The Dictionary was exported to America The American adoption of the Dictionary was a momentous event not just in its history but in the history of lexicography For Americans in the second half of the eighteenth century Johnson was the seminal authority on language and the subsequent development of American lexicography was coloured by his fame 28 For American lexicographers the Dictionary was impossible to ignore America s two great nineteenth century lexicographers Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester argued fiercely over Johnson s legacy In 1789 Webster declared that Great Britain whose children we are and whose language we speak should no longer be our standard for the taste of her writers is already corrupted and her language on the decline 29 Where Webster found fault with Johnson Joseph Worcester saluted him In 1846 he completed his Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language He defended Johnson s work arguing that from the time of its publication it has been far more than any other regarded as the standard for the language 30 Notwithstanding the evolution of lexicography in America The Dictionary has also played its part in the law especially in the United States Legislators are much occupied with ascertaining first meanings with trying to secure the literal sense of their predecessors legislation Often it is a matter of historicizing language to understand a law you need to understand what its terminology meant to its original architects as long as the American Constitution remains intact Johnson s Dictionary will have a role to play in American law 31 ",
