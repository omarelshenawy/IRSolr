			"previous": " At Geauga Academy which he attended from 1848 to 1850 Garfield learned academic subjects he had not previously had time for He shone as a student and was especially interested in languages and elocution He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience writing that the speaker s platform creates some excitement I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error 12 Geauga was co educational and Garfield was attracted to one of his fellow students Lucretia Rudolph whom he later married 13 To support himself at Geauga he worked as a carpenter s assistant and as a teacher 14 The need to go from town to town to find a place as a teacher disgusted Garfield and he thereafter developed a dislike of what he called place seeking which became he said the law of my life 15 In later years he would astound his friends by letting positions pass that could have been his with a little politicking 15 Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God but in his late teens underwent a religious awakening and attended many camp meetings at one of which he was born again The next day March 4 1850 he was baptized into the Disciples by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River 16 ",
			"after": " After leaving Geauga Garfield worked for a year at various jobs including teaching 17 Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college Garfield determined to do the same and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations From 1851 to 1854 he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute later named Hiram College in Hiram Ohio a school run by the Disciples While there he was most interested in the study of Greek and Latin but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered 18 Securing a position on entry as janitor he was hired to teach while still a student 19 Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek 20 He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches in some cases earning a gold dollar per service By 1854 Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full time teacher 21 Garfield then enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown Massachusetts as a third year student given credit for two year s study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination Garfield was impressed with the college president Mark Hopkins who had responded warmly to Garfield s letter inquiring about admission He said of Hopkins The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other 22 Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject There was no pretense of genius or alternation of spasmodic effort but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions 23 After his first term Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby Pownal Vermont a post whose previous incumbent was Chester A Arthur 23 ",
