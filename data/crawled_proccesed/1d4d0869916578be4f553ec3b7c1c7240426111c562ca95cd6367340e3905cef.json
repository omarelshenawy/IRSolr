			"after": " The traditional view of historians informed by the work of Michael Rostovtzeff was of a widespread economic decline at the beginning of the 5th century However consistent archaeological evidence has told another story and the accepted view is undergoing re evaluation though some features are agreed more opulent but fewer urban houses an end to new public building and some abandonment of existing ones with the exception of defensive structures and the widespread formation of black earth deposits indicating increased horticulture within urban precincts 60 Turning over the basilica at Silchester to industrial uses in the late 3rd century doubtless officially condoned marks an early stage in the de urbanisation of Roman Britain 61 The abandonment of some sites is now believed to be later than had formerly been thought Many buildings changed use but were not destroyed There were growing barbarian attacks but these were focused on vulnerable rural settlements rather than towns Some villas such as Great Casterton in Rutland and Hucclecote in Gloucestershire had new mosaic floors laid around this time suggesting that economic problems may have been limited and patchy although many suffered some decay before being abandoned in the 5th century the story of Saint Patrick indicates that villas were still occupied until at least 430 Exceptionally new buildings were still going up in this period in Verulamium and Cirencester Some urban centres for example Canterbury Cirencester Wroxeter Winchester and Gloucester remained active during the 5th and 6th centuries surrounded by large farming estates ",
