			"after": " Around this time Fuller was hoping to prepare a biography of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe Her father s death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea 21 In 1836 Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott s Temple School in Boston 29 where she remained for a year She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller no relation at the Greene Street School in Providence Rhode Island in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of 1 000 per year 30 Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain Massachusetts 31 On November 6 1839 Fuller held the first of her conversations 32 discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys 33 Fuller intended to compensate for the lack of women s education 34 with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts history mythology literature and nature 35 Serving as the nucleus of conversation Fuller also intended to answer the great questions facing women What were we born to do How shall we do it which so few ever propose to themselves till their best years are gone by 36 A number of significant figures in the women s rights movement attended these gatherings including Sophia Dana Ripley Caroline Sturgis 37 and Maria White Lowell 32 ",
