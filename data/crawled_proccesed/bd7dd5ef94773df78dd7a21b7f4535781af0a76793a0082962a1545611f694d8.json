			"previous": " From the 3rd century onwards Chinese methods of geographical study and writing of geographical literature became much more complex than what was found in Europe at the time until the 13th century 19 Chinese geographers such as Liu An Pei Xiu Jia Dan Shen Kuo Fan Chengda Zhou Daguan and Xu Xiake wrote important treatises yet by the 17th century advanced ideas and methods of Western style geography were adopted in China ",
			"after": " During the Middle Ages the fall of the Roman empire led to a shift in the evolution of geography from Europe to the Islamic world 19 Muslim geographers such as Muhammad al Idrisi produced detailed world maps such as Tabula Rogeriana while other geographers such as Yaqut al Hamawi Abu Rayhan Biruni Ibn Battuta and Ibn Khaldun provided detailed accounts of their journeys and the geography of the regions they visited Turkish geographer Mahmud al Kashgari drew a world map on a linguistic basis and later so did Piri Reis Piri Reis map Further Islamic scholars translated and interpreted the earlier works of the Romans and the Greeks and established the House of Wisdom in Baghdad for this purpose 20 Ab Zayd al Balkh originally from Balkh founded the Balkh school of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad 21 Suhr b a late tenth century Muslim geographer accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map with equirectangular projection or cylindrical equidistant projection 21 verification needed ",
