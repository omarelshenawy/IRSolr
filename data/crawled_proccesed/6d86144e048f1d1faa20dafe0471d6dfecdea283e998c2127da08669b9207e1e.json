			"previous": " Sexual size dimorphism in this species is perhaps the greatest in any neognath bird 25 Males were considerably larger than females measuring 90 cm 35 in in length and weighing up to 28 kg 62 lb whereas females were 70 cm 28 in and weighed 17 kg 37 lb 26 This is only 60 of the weight of a mature male 25 Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons but slim during hot seasons and may have been as low as 21 kg in males and 13 kg in females 27 Though male pigeons are usually larger than females there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species and this has only been assumed based on early works Though the male was probably largest this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques and not skeletal morphology alone 25 ",
			"after": " The Rodrigues solitaire shared traits with the dodo its closest relative such as size and features in the skull pelvis and sternum It differed in other aspects it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak a flatter skull roof and larger orbits Its neck and legs were proportionally longer and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds to support their greater weight and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic underdeveloped retaining juvenile features However the skull trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic which means they changed considerably with maturity 27 ",
