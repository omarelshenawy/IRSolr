			"previous": " The Cultural Revolution brought China s education system to a virtual halt for some time In the early months of the Cultural Revolution schools and universities were closed Primary and middle schools later gradually reopened but all colleges and universities were closed until 1970 and most universities did not reopen until 1972 98 The university entrance exams were cancelled after 1966 to be replaced later by a system whereby students were recommended by factories villages and military units and entrance exams were not restored until 1977 under Deng Xiaoping According to the documents for the prosecution of the Gang of Four 142 000 cadres and teachers in the education circles were persecuted and noted academics scientists and educators who died included Xiong Qinglai Jian Bozan Rao Yutai Wu Dingliang and Zhao Jiuzhang 99 Many intellectuals were sent to rural labor camps and many of those who survived left China shortly after the revolution ended citation needed Many survivors and observers who suggest that almost anyone with skills over that of the average person was made the target of political struggle in some way The entire generation of tormented and inadequately educated individuals is often referred to in the West as well as in China as the lost generation 100 101 102 ",
			"after": " During the Cultural Revolution basic education was emphasized and rapidly expanded While the years of schooling were reduced and education standard fell the proportion of Chinese children who had completed primary education increased from less than half before the Cultural Revolution to almost all after the Cultural Revolution and those who completed junior middle school rose from 15 to over two third The educational opportunities for rural children expanded considerably while those of the children of the urban elite became restricted by the anti elitist policies 103 However the impact of the Cultural Revolution on popular education varied among regions and formal measurements of literacy did not resume until the 1980s 104 Some counties in Zhanjiang had illiteracy rates as high as 41 some 20 years after the revolution The leaders of China at the time denied any illiteracy problems from the start This effect was amplified by the elimination of qualified teachers many districts were forced to rely on selected students to educate the next generation 104 ",
