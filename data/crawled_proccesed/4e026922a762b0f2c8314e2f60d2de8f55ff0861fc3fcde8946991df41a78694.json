			"previous": " An example here may be helpful Consider the Pythagorean equation we would like to study its rational solutions i e its solutions such that x and y are both rational This is the same as asking for all integer solutions to any solution to the latter equation gives us a solution to the former It is also the same as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve described by This curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin ",
			"after": " The rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve that is rational or integer solutions to an equation where is a polynomial in two variables turns out to depend crucially on the genus of the curve The genus can be defined as follows note 13 allow the variables in to be complex numbers then defines a 2 dimensional surface in projective 4 dimensional space since two complex variables can be decomposed into four real variables i e four dimensions Count the number of doughnut holes in the surface call this number the genus of Other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial ",
