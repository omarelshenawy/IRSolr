			"after": " All variants of the CFM56 feature a single stage high pressure turbine HPT In some variants the HPT blades are grown from a single crystal superalloy giving them high strength and creep resistance The low pressure turbine LPT features four stages in most variants of the engine but the CFM56 5C has a five stage LPT This change was implemented to drive the larger fan on this variant 42 Improvements to the turbine section were examined during the Tech56 program and one development was an aerodynamically optimized low pressure turbine blade design which would have used 20 fewer blades for the whole low pressure turbine saving weight Some of those Tech56 improvements made their way into the Tech Insertion package where the turbine section was updated 28 The turbine section was updated again in the Evolution upgrade 29 32 ",
