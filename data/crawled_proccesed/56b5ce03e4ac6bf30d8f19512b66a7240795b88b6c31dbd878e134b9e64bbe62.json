			"after": " The detail included explicitly in the music notation varies between genres and historical periods In general art music notation from the 17th through the 19th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles For example in the 17th and 18th century music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple unadorned melody However performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments such as trills and turns In the 19th century art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively without describing in detail how the performer should do this The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes accentuation and pauses among other devices to obtain this expressive performance style In the 20th century art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece ",
