			"previous": " The film tells the story of a street gang of children who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood at one point brutalizing a blind man 140 and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on a dolly which they toss down a hill 141 Film historian Carl J Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama Bu uel s street children are not ennobled by their desperate struggle for survival they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims 142 p 91 The film was made quickly 18 days and cheaply 450 000 pesos with Bu uel s fee being the equivalent of 2 000 103 pp 210 211 During filming a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways one technician confronted Bu uel and asked why he didn t make a real Mexican movie rather than a miserable picture like this one 22 p 200 the film s hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist s mother refuses to give him food In Mexico no mother would say that to her son 143 p 99 another staff member urged Bu uel to abandon shooting on a garbage heap noting that there were many lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas that were available 143 p 99 while Pedro de Urdimalas one of the scriptwriters refused to allow his name in the credits 144 ",
			"after": " This hostility was also felt by those who attended the movie s premi re in Mexico City on 9 November 1950 when Los olvidados was taken by many as an insult to Mexican sensibilities and to the Mexican nation 87 p 67 At one point the audience shrieked in shock as one of the characters looked straight into the camera and hurled a rotten egg at it leaving a gelatinous opaque ooze on the lens for a few moments 146 In his memoir Bu uel recalled that after the initial screening painter Diego Rivera s wife refused to speak to him while poet Le n Felipe s wife had to be restrained physically from attacking him 22 pp 200 201 There were even calls to have Bu uel s Mexican citizenship revoked 34 p 61 Dancigers panicked by what he feared would be a complete debacle quickly commissioned an alternate happy ending to the film 147 and also tacked on a preface showing stock footage of the skylines of New York London and Paris with voice over commentary to the effect that behind the wealth of all the great cities of the world can be found poverty and malnourished children and that Mexico City that large modern city is no exception 148 Regardless attendance was so poor that Dancigers withdrew the film after only three days in theaters 149 ",
