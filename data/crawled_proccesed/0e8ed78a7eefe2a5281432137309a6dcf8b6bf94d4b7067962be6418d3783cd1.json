			"previous": " Of the 100 B 1Bs built 93 remained in 2000 after losses in accidents In June 2001 the Pentagon sought to place one third of its then fleet into storage this proposal resulted in several U S Air National Guard officers and members of Congress lobbying against the proposal including the drafting of an amendment to prevent such cuts 67 The 2001 proposal was intended to allow money to be diverted to further upgrades to the remaining B 1Bs such as computer modernization 67 In 2003 accompanied by the removal of B 1Bs from the two bomb wings in the Air National Guard the USAF decided to retire 33 aircraft to concentrate its budget on maintaining availability of remaining B 1Bs 123 In 2004 a new appropriation bill called for some of the retired aircraft to return to service 124 and the USAF returned seven mothballed bombers to service to increase the fleet to 67 aircraft 125 ",
