			"previous": " According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs Gilbert s plot admirably sparked off Sullivan s genius 156 Sullivan embraces the nautical setting in We Sail the Ocean Blue for example he presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty 157 In the Captain s opening song I am the Captain of the Pinafore he admits that his gentlemanliness never well hardly ever gives way to swearing at his men and although he has experience at sea he hardly ever suffers from seasickness 157 Sullivan unerringly found the right musical setting for the key phrase What never cunningly sharpened through the chromatic touch on the bassoon 158 Audrey Williamson argued that the music of Pinafore is quintessentially English and free of European influences throughout most of the score from the glee for Ralph the Boatswain and the Carpenter to For He Is an Englishman 159 ",
			"after": " The best known songs from the opera 160 161 include I m called Little Buttercup a waltz tune introducing the character which Sullivan repeats in the entr acte and in the Act II finale to imprint the melody on the mind of the audience 162 and A British tar a glee for three men describing the ideal sailor composed by Sir Joseph to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man s equal excepting mine 156 Sullivan s voicing advances the satiric lyric which mocks the equality plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph 153 Another popular number is Sir Joseph s song When I was a Lad recounting the meteoric rise of his career which bears similarities to that of W H Smith the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty in 1877 117 ",
