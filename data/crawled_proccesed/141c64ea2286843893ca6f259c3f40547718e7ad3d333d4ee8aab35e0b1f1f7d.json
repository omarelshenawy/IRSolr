			"after": " Several species sometimes suffer from a wasting condition caused by bacteria in the genus Vibrio 70 however a more widespread wasting disease causing mass mortalities among starfish appears sporadically A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star associated densovirus SSaDV 75 The protozoan Orchitophrya stellarum is known to infect the gonads of starfish and damage tissue 70 Starfish are vulnerable to high temperatures Experiments have shown that the feeding and growth rates of P ochraceus reduce greatly when their body temperatures rise above 23 C 73 F and that they die when their temperature rises to 30 C 86 F 76 77 This species has a unique ability to absorb seawater to keep itself cool when it is exposed to sunlight by a receding tide 78 It also appears to rely on its arms to absorb heat so as to protect the central disc and vital organs like the stomach 79 ",
