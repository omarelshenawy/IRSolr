			"previous": " By the turn of the 20th century the difficulty of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades 87 The dredging and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river disrupting its natural flow but also providing electricity irrigation navigability and other benefits to the region ",
			"after": " American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver who explored the river in 1792 proved that it was possible to cross the Columbia Bar Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean 88 ",
