			"after": " Finally after a long process that took 35 months TAME has completed 75 of the renovation process of its fleet This process took such an extensive period of time due to the fact that there were 10 months where the company studied analyzed and compared various types of planes that would meet all the requirements needed to fly through the difficult routes that the company offers These studies lead to the decision of the Board of Directors to acquire Embraer s 170 190 planes This decision implied a letter of intent of purchase of 2 models of the 170 series and 1 of the 190 series while at the same time keeping open the possibility to acquire 4 more planes of the 190 series all of these from the Brazilian manufacturer The following two years were the time needed in order to carry out all the legal dispositions applicable to the state owned airline ",
