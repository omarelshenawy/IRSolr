			"after": " Israel continued to control the city until early June 1974 when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974 The surrender of Quneitra was controversial with Israeli settlers 29 and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it 30 According to Michael Mandelbaum the agreement provided that the city was to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions by creating a hostage to Syrian good behaviour which would encourage the Israelis to pull back further 31 ",
