			"after": " The Italian Renaissance brought about a stricter interpretation of Aristotle as this long lost work came to light in the late 15th century The neoclassical ideal which was to reach its apogee in France during the 17th century dwelled upon the unities of action place and time This meant that the playwright had to construct the play so that its virtual time would not exceed 24 hours that it would be restricted to a single setting and that there would be no subplots Other terms such as verisimilitude and decorum circumscribed the subject matter significantly For example verisimilitude defined that characters were to be based upon the ideal of a type versus what might be considered realistic It also prohibited actions that might not be considered possible within the limits of the unities Decorum fitted proper protocols for behavior and language on stage In France Jean Racine in tragedy and Moli re comedy were purveyors of the unities and other strictures Corneille on the other hand was condemned by the French Academy when his play Le Cid contained too many events and actions thus violating the 24 hour restriction of the unity of time Neoclassicism never had as much traction in England and Shakespeare s plays are directly opposed to these models while in Italy improvised and bawdy commedia dell arte and opera were more popular forms In England after the Interregnum and restoration of the monarchy in 1660 there was a move toward neoclassical tragedy but this was never popular A notable example is John Dryden s All for Love based on Shakespeare s Antony and Cleopatra which attempts to compress the sprawl of action and multiple settings including both Egypt and Rome to a single place and 24 hour time frame ",
