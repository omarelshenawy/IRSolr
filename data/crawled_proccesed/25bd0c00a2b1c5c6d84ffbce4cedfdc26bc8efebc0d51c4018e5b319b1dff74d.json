			"previous": " The holotype of Gorgosaurus libratus NMC 2120 is a nearly complete skeleton associated with a skull discovered in 1913 by Charles M Sternberg This specimen was the first tyrannosaurid found with a complete hand 19 It was found in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and is housed in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa 5 Prospectors from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City were active along the Red Deer River in Alberta at the same time collecting hundreds of spectacular dinosaur specimens including four complete G libratus skulls three of which were associated with skeletons Matthew and Brown described four of these specimens in 1923 7 ",
			"after": " Matthew and Brown also described a fifth skeleton AMNH 5664 which Charles H Sternberg had collected in 1917 and sold to their museum It was smaller than other Gorgosaurus specimens with a lower lighter skull and more elongate limb proportions Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids but still described it as the holotype of a new species G sternbergi 7 Today s paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G libratus 2 5 Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums across the United States and Canada 1 5 G libratus is the best represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record known from a virtually complete growth series 2 22 ",
