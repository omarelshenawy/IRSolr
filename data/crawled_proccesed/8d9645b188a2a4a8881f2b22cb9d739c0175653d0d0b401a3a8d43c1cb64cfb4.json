			"previous": " Air to air missiles largely replaced guns and rockets in the early 1960s since both were believed unusable at the speeds being attained however the Vietnam War showed that guns still had a role to play and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannon typically between 20 and 30 mm in caliber in addition to missiles Most modern combat aircraft can carry at least a pair of air to air missiles ",
			"after": " In the 1970s turbofans replaced turbojets improving fuel economy enough that the last piston engined support aircraft could be replaced with jets making multi role combat aircraft possible Honeycomb structures began to replace milled structures and the first composite components began to appear on components subjected to little stress ",
