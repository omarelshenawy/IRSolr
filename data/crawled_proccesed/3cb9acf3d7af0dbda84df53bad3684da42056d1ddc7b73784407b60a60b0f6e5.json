			"previous": " Military receivers can decode the P Y code transmitted on both L1 and L2 Without decryption keys it is still possible to use a codeless technique to compare the P Y codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information However this technique is slow so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment In the future additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5 frequencies see GPS modernization All users will then be able to perform dual frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors ",
			"after": " Relative Kinematic Positioning RKP is a third alternative for a precise GPS based positioning system In this approach determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than 10 centimeters 4 in This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS DGPS correction data transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests possibly with processing in real time real time kinematic positioning RTK ",
