			"after": " Following the release Madonna s first book publication Sex the erotic thriller Body of Evidence and the album Erotica in the early 1990s the media and public s backlash against Madonna s overtly sexual image was at a peak 2 Released in early March 1994 her first musical release after Erotica was the tender ballad I ll Remember from the soundtrack of the film With Honors When Madonna appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman on March 31 1994 to promote the single her coarse language and behavior which was provocative seemingly random at times full of double entendres at one point asking Letterman to sniff her panties profanities and ended with a refusal to leave the set caused yet another large public controversy 3 Following this Madonna decided to tone down her image and move her career into a new direction Musically she explored new jack R B styles with a generally mainstream radio friendly sound 4 This new R B sound was reflected in Bedtime Stories released in October 1994 4 For Take a Bow the second single released off of the album Madonna wanted a more romantic vein so she worked with Babyface on the track because he had proved himself to be very successful in his previous works with smooth R B working with other artists such as Whitney Houston Boyz II Men and Toni Braxton 5 Although not listed in the credits as a performer Babyface sings background vocals on the track 6 The maxi single release of Take a Bow includes two remixes of the song 7 According to Jose F Promis of Allmusic the first remix known as the In Da Soul mix gives the ballad a funkier more urban feel while the second remix known as the Silky Soul Mix is a little more quiet storm and melancholy than the first 7 ",
