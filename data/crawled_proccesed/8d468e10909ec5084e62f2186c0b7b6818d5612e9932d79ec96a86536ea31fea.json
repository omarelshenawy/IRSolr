			"after": " A supercritical airfoil is an airfoil designed primarily to delay the onset of wave drag in the transonic speed range Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface highly cambered curved aft section and smaller leading edge radius compared with traditional airfoil shapes The supercritical airfoils were designed in the 1960s by then NASA engineer Richard Whitcomb and were first tested on a modified North American T 2C Buckeye 1 After this first test the airfoils were tested at higher speeds on the TF 8A Crusader 2 While the design was initially developed as part of the supersonic transport SST project at NASA it has since been mainly applied to increase the fuel efficiency of many high subsonic aircraft The supercritical airfoil shape is incorporated into the design of a supercritical wing ",
