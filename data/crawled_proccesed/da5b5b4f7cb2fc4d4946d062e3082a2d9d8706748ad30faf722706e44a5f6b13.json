			"previous": " According to the Hughston Health Alert Lacerations to the head scalp and face are the most frequent types of injury in hockey Schmidt 6 Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood Not only are lacerations common it is estimated that direct trauma accounts for 80 of all hockey injuries Most of these injuries are caused by player contact falls and contact with a puck high stick and occasionally a skate blade Schmidt 3 One of the causes of head injury is checking from behind Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind many leagues including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty called boarding Another type of check that accounts for many of the player to player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty called head contact A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player s head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player s head The most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion Most concussions occur during player to player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50 of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention Studies show that ice hockey causes 44 3 of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian kids 47 In severe cases the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare but occur all too much in a variety of sports ",
