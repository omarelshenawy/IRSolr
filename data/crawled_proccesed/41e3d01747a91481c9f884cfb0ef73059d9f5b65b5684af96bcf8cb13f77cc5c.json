			"previous": " Regional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period largely because of the Khalifa s brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country In 1887 a 60 000 man Ansar army invaded Ethiopia penetrating as far as Gondar In March 1889 king Yohannes IV of Ethiopia marched on Metemma however after Yohannes fell in battle the Ethiopian forces withdrew Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi the Khalifa s general attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889 but British led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar s invincibility The Belgians prevented the Mahdi s men from conquering Equatoria and in 1893 the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at Akordat in Eritrea and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia ",
			"after": " In the 1890s the British sought to re establish their control over Sudan once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive but in actuality treating the country as a British colony By the early 1890s British French and Belgian claims had converged at the Nile headwaters Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan s instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt Apart from these political considerations Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at Aswan ",
