			"previous": " Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility is where all the individual parts pieces and systems of the Space Shuttle came together and were assembled and tested Upon completion the spacecraft was turned over to NASA for transport overland from Palmdale to Edwards Air Force Base California NASA s Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base was the site of the mate demate facility for mating or demating the spacecraft and the shuttle carrier aircraft ",
			"after": " Approximately 250 major subcontractors supplied various systems and components to Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility The structures of the orbiter were manufactured at various companies under contract to Rockwell International s Space Transportation Systems Division Downey Calif The upper and lower forward fuselage crew compartment forward reaction control system and aft fuselage were manufactured at Rockwell s Space Transportation Systems Division facility in Downey and were transported overland from Downey to Rockwell s Palmdale Calif assembly facility The midfuselage was manufactured by General Dynamics San Diego Calif and transported overland to Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility The wings including elevons were manufactured by Grumman Bethpage Long Island N Y and transported by ship from New York via the Panama Canal to Long Beach Calif and then transported overland to Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility The vertical tail including rudder speed brake were manufactured by Fairchild Republic Farmingdale Long Island N Y and transported overland to Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility The payload bay doors were manufactured at Rockwell International s Tulsa Okla facility and transported overland to Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility The body flap was manufactured at Rockwell International s Columbus Ohio facility and transported overland to Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility The aft orbital maneuvering system reaction control system pods were manufactured by McDonnell Douglas St Louis Mo and transported by aircraft to Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility They were also transported by aircraft from Rockwell s Palmdale assembly facility to the Kennedy Space Center ",
