			"previous": " In 1885 a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered 35 The hidden footing contains reliefs 160 of which are narratives describing the real K madh tu The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors illustrating the scenes to be carved 67 The real base is hidden by an encasement base the purpose of which remains a mystery It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill 67 There is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed according to Vastu Shastra the Indian ancient book about architecture and town planning 35 Regardless of why it was commissioned the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration ",
