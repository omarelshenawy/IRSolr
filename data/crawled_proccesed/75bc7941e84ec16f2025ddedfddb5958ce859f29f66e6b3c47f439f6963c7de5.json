			"previous": " During the Gemini program Kraft s role changed again He was now the head of mission operations in charge of a team of flight directors although still also serving as a flight director himself Due to the greater length of Gemini missions Mission Control was now manned on a three shift basis Clearly with flight control facing a learning curve space historian David Harland has said these arrangements were an experiment in their own right 28 Yet Kraft proved to be remarkably successful at passing on responsibility to his fellow flight directors arguably too successful as Gene Kranz found during his first shift handover on Gemini 4 As Kranz recalled He just said You re in charge and walked out 29 ",
			"after": " The Gemini program represented a string of firsts for NASA the first flight with two astronauts the first rendezvous in space the first spacewalk and Kraft was on duty during many of these historic events America s first spacewalk happened during the Gemini 4 mission Kraft at his console found that he had to force himself to concentrate on his work distracted by Ed White s mesmerizing descriptions of the Earth below 30 He could easily understand the euphoria that White felt at the spectacle yet he also was mindful of the discipline required to keep the flight safe White delayed his return to the capsule and a communication problem prevented capsule communicator Gus Grissom from getting the crew to hear the order to terminate the spacewalk When contact was finally re established Kraft expressed his frustration on his ground loop to Grissom ",
