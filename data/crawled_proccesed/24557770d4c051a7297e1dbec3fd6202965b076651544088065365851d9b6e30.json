			"after": " The noisy miner engages in most activities in a group Roosting foraging preening bathing and dust bathing or anting are communal activities Dawn song is a communal chorus particularly during the breeding season The communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays postural displays and facial displays In long flight displays initiated by either male or female birds groups of up to twenty birds from more than one coterie fly about 40 metres 130 ft above the canopy for distances of up to 1 5 kilometres 0 93 mi from the colony constantly calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes As they return the remaining birds show signs of agitation and sometimes fly up to join them The short flight display is performed by the male and may be analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds In a ritualised movement the noisy miner flies out from a perch across an open area in a rhythmic undulating pattern usually calling in flight At the end of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near the starting point The head up flight is performed by the female during the nesting period and may function to attract male helpers In its most intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically with legs dangling and the head held up and back It is performed by the female when she is selecting the nest site and when carrying nest building material and probably has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group members 43 ",
