			"previous": " No international organization nor any treaty between nations has fixed the IDL drawn by cartographers the 1884 International Meridian Conference explicitly refused to propose or agree to any time zones stating that they were outside its purview The conference resolved that the Universal Day midnight to midnight Greenwich Mean Time now known as Coordinated Universal Time or UTC which it did agree to shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable From this comes the utility and importance of UTC or Zulu time it permits a single universal reference for time that is valid for all points on the globe at the same moment ",
			"after": " As part of New Spain the Philippines long had its most important communication with Acapulco in Mexico and was accordingly on the east side of the IDL despite being at the far western edge of the Pacific Ocean After Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821 Philippine trade interests turned to Imperial China the Dutch East Indies and adjacent areas so the Philippines decided to shift to the west side of the IDL by skipping 31 December 1844 5 Western publications were generally unaware of this change until the early 1890s so erroneously gave the International Date Line a large western bulge for the next half century 6 ",
