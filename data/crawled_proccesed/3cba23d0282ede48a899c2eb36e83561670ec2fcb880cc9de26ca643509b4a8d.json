			"after": " To strike the electric arc the electrode is brought into contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool As the electrode melts the flux covering disintegrates giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases In addition the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool Once part of the weld pool the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies Once hardened it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld As welding progresses and the electrode melts the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder This activity combined with chipping away the slag reduces the amount of time that the welder can spend laying the weld making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes In general the operator factor or the percentage of operator s time spent laying weld is approximately 25 11 ",
