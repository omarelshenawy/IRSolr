			"previous": " Florida in the 20th century experienced a massive migration into the state Undeveloped land sold well and draining to reclaim wetlands has often gone unchecked and often encouraged by government The St Johns headwaters decreased in size from 30 square miles 78 km2 to one between 1900 and 1972 128 Much of the land was reclaimed for urban use but agricultural needs took their toll as fertilizers and runoff from cattle ranching washed into the St Johns Without wetlands to filter the pollutants the chemicals stayed in the river and flushed into the Atlantic Ocean Boaters destroyed the floating islands of muck and weeds in the upper basin with dynamite causing the lakes to drain completely 129 ",
			"after": " What could have been the most serious human impact on nature in central Florida was the Cross Florida Barge Canal an attempt to connect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state by channeling the Ocklawaha River first authorized in 1933 note 5 The canal was intended to be 171 miles 275 km long 250 feet 76 m wide and 30 feet 9 1 m deep 130 Canal construction was top among the engineering priorities in the state and by 1964 the U S Army Corps of Engineers began construction on the Cross Florida Barge Canal Flood control was the primary impetus behind its construction though the broader reasoning and feasibility of the project remained unclear The Army Corps of Engineers was also constructing hundreds of miles of canals in the Everglades at the same time and by the 1960s was being accused of wasting tax money through its unnecessary construction projects 131 In 1969 the Environmental Defense Fund filed suit in federal court to stop construction on the canal citing irreparable harm that would be done to Florida waterways and the Floridan Aquifer central and north Florida s fresh water source 132 ",
