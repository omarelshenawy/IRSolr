			"previous": " Throttle bodies may also contain valves and adjustments to control the minimum airflow during idle Even in those units that are not drive by wire there will often be a small electric motor driven valve the Idle Air Control Valve IACV that the ECU uses to control the amount of air that can bypass the main throttle opening ",
			"after": " Many cars have a single throttle body Others employ more than one chained together by linkages to improve throttle response At the extreme high performance cars like the E92 BMW M3 and high performance motorcycles like the Yamaha R6 use a separate throttle body for each cylinder often called individual throttle bodies or ITBs ",
