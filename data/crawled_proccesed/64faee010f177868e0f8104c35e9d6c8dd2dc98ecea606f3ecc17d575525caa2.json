			"previous": " Cooper s career during the post war years drifted in new directions as American society was changing 225 While he still played conventional heroic roles his films now relied less on his heroic screen persona and more on novel stories and exotic settings 226 In November 1945 Cooper appeared in Sam Wood s nineteenth century period drama Saratoga Trunk with Ingrid Bergman about a Texas cowboy and his relationship with a beautiful fortune hunter 227 Filmed in early 1943 the movie s release was delayed for two years due to the increased demand for war movies 228 Despite poor reviews Saratoga Trunk did well at the box office 229 and became one of Paramount s top money makers of the year 230 Cooper s only film in 1946 was Fritz Lang s romantic thriller Cloak and Dagger about a mild mannered physics professor recruited by the OSS during the last years of World War II to investigate the German atomic bomb program 231 Playing a part loosely based on physicist J Robert Oppenheimer 232 Cooper was uneasy with the role and was unable to convey the inner sense of the character 233 The film received poor reviews and was a box office failure 234 In 1947 Cooper appeared in Cecil B DeMille s epic adventure film Unconquered with Paulette Goddard about a Virginia militiaman who defends settlers against an unscrupulous gun trader and hostile Indians on the Western frontier during the eighteenth century 235 The film received mixed reviews but even long time DeMille critic James Agee acknowledged the picture had some authentic flavor of the period 236 This last of four films made with DeMille was Cooper s most lucrative earning the actor over 300 000 in salary and percentage of profits 237 Unconquered would be his last unqualified box office success for the next five years 236 ",
			"after": " In 1948 after making Leo McCarey s romantic comedy Good Sam 238 Cooper sold his company to Universal Studios and signed a long term contract with Warner Bros that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed 295 000 per picture 239 His first film under the new contract was King Vidor s drama The Fountainhead 1949 with Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey 240 In the film Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism in the face of societal pressures to conform to popular standards 241 Based on the novel by Ayn Rand who also wrote the screenplay the film reflects her Objectivist philosophy and attacks the concepts of altruism and collectivism while promoting the virtues of selfishness and individualism 242 For most critics Cooper was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark 243 In his review for The New York Times Bosley Crowther concluded he was Mr Deeds out of his element 244 Cooper returned to his element in Delmer Daves war drama Task Force 1949 about a retiring rear admiral who reminisces about his long career as a naval aviator and his role in the development of aircraft carriers 245 Cooper s performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper s most popular during this period 246 In the next two years Cooper made four poorly received films Michael Curtiz period drama Bright Leaf 1950 Stuart Heisler s Western melodrama Dallas 1950 Henry Hathaway s wartime comedy You re in the Navy Now 1951 and Raoul Walsh s Western action film Distant Drums 1951 247 ",
