			"previous": " Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to or even in place of excavation It requires relatively little time and expense because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts Nevertheless surveying a large region or site can be expensive so archaeologists often employ sampling methods 47 As with other forms of non destructive archaeology survey avoids ethical issues of particular concern to descendant peoples associated with destroying a site through excavation It is the only way to gather some forms of information such as settlement patterns and settlement structure Survey data are commonly assembled into maps which may show surface features and or artifact distribution ",
			"after": " The simplest survey technique is surface survey It involves combing an area usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth or overgrown with vegetation Surface survey may also include mini excavation techniques such as augers corers and shovel test pits If no materials are found the area surveyed is deemed sterile ",
