			"after": " Gianni Schicchi is a comic opera in one act by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Giovacchino Forzano composed in 1917 18 The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in Dante s Divine Comedy The work is the third and final part of Puccini s Il trittico three one act operas with contrasting themes written to be presented together Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other trittico operas Gianni Schicchi is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers Gianni Schicchi a comedy completes the triptych by combining elements of Puccini s modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages described as reminiscent of Rossini When Il trittico premiered at New York s Metropolitan Opera in December 1918 Gianni Schicchi became an immediate hit whereas the other two operas were received with less enthusiasm Although on artistic grounds Puccini opposed performing the three operas except as the original triptych by 1920 he had given his reluctant consent to separate performances Gianni Schicchi has subsequently become the most performed part of Il trittico and has been widely recorded ",
