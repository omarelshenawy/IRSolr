			"after": " The fortunes of the Moreton family declined during the English Civil War As supporters of the Royalist cause they found themselves isolated in a community of Parliamentarians 21 Little Moreton Hall was requisitioned by the Parliamentarians in 1643 and used to billet Parliamentary soldiers The family successfully petitioned for its restitution 22 and survived the Civil War with their ownership of Little Moreton Hall intact but financially they were crippled 21 They tried to sell the entire estate but could only dispose of several parcels of land William Moreton died in 1654 leaving debts of 3 000 4 000 equivalent to about 12 16 million as of 2010 23 e which forced his heirs to remortgage what remained of the estate 24 The family s fortunes never fully recovered and by the late 1670s they no longer lived in Little Moreton Hall renting it out instead to a series of tenant farmers The Dale family took over the tenancy in 1841 and were still in residence more than 100 years later 1 By 1847 most of the house was unoccupied and the deconsecrated Chapel was being used as a coal cellar and storeroom 25 Little Moreton Hall was in a ruinous condition its windows were boarded up and its roof was rotten 26 ",
