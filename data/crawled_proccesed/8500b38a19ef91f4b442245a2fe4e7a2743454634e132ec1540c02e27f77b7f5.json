			"previous": " The Millennium Park project has been the subject of some criticism since its inception In addition to concerns about cost overruns individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city s schools Although the park s design and architectural elements have won wide praise there has been some criticism of its aesthetics Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley s election campaign 4 The park s only full service restaurant Park Grill has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor 234 235 ",
