			"previous": " Boletus edulis fruit bodies contain about 500 mg of ergosterol per 100 g of dried mushroom 128 Ergosterol is a sterol compound common in fungi Additionally the fruit bodies have about 30 mg of ergosterol peroxide per 100 g of dried mushroom Ergosterol peroxide is a steroid derivative with a wide spectrum of biological activity including antimicrobial and anti inflammatory activity and cytotoxicity to various tumor cell lines grown in laboratory culture 129 ",
			"after": " The mushroom also contains a sugar binding protein or lectin that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose The lectin is mitogenic that is it can stimulate cells to begin the process of cell division resulting in mitosis Further the lectin has antiviral properties it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase 130 Other studies suggest that B edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus 131 and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture 132 Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease 133 ",
