			"previous": " Napoleon came to power in 1799 Dreaming of a renewed French empire he secured the return of the Louisiana territory from Spain via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso the following year and through other agreements These pacts were initially secret and newly inaugurated American President Thomas Jefferson learned of them in 1801 Fearing that the port of New Orleans would be closed to American shipping he sent former Virginia senator James Monroe to France to assist American Minister Robert Livingston in purchasing the lower Mississippi Congress appropriated 2 million for the purpose 2 ",
			"after": " When the Americans met with Napoleon they found that the emperor desired to sell the entire territory much of which was unmapped and unexplored by white men Napoleon was faced with defeat in revolting Haiti and feared that the British would capture New Orleans meaning he would lose Louisiana with no compensation After some haggling they agreed on a price of 60 million francs plus 20 million more to pay claims by American citizens against France a total of some 15 million which paid for some 828 500 square miles 2 146 000 km2 of land The treaty was signed on April 30 1803 and although there was some question as to whether there was constitutional power for such a purchase the American Senate ratified the treaty on October 20 1803 The United States took formal possession two months later 2 ",
