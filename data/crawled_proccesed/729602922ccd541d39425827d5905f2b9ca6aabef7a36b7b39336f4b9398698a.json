			"after": " From the earliest days of the academy one form of punishment for cadets who commit regulatory infractions has been a process officially known as punishment tours 219 This process is better known to the cadets as hours because as punishment cadets must walk a specified number of hours in retribution Cadets are awarded punishment tours based upon the severity of the infraction Being late to class or having an unkempt room may result in as little as 5 hours while more severe misconduct infractions may result in upwards of 60 to 80 hours In its most traditional form punishment tours are walked off by wearing the dress gray uniform under arms and walking back and forth in a designated area of the cadet barracks courtyard known as Central Area Cadets who get into trouble frequently and spend many weekends walking off their hours are known as area birds 220 Cadets who walk more than 100 total hours in their career are affectionately known as Century Men 221 An alternate form of punishment to walking hours is known as fatigue tours where assigned hours may be worked off by manual labor such as cleaning the barracks Certain cadets whose academics are deficient may also conduct sitting tours where they have to sit hours in a designated academic room in a controlled study environment for which they receive half credit towards their reduction of tours Cadets uniforms are inspected before their tours begin each day A small number of cadets may be relieved of their tours that day if their uniforms are exceptionally presentable Another tradition associated with punishment tours is that any visiting head of state has the authority to grant amnesty releasing all cadets with outstanding hours from the remainder of their assigned tours 222 223 ",
