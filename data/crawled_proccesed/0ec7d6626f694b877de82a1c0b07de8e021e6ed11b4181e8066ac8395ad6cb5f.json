			"after": " The diet and physiology of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth enamel When feeding drinking and breathing animals take in carbon and oxygen which become incorporated into bone The isotopes of these two elements are determined by various internal and external factors such as the type of plants being eaten the physiology of the animal salinity and climate If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes they can be studied for information about the original factors warmblooded animals will have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions and so on Enamel is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms enamel makes it the most resistant material to chemical change in the skeleton 18 ",
