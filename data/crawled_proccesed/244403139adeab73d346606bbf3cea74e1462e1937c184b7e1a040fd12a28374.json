			"previous": " Amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with a number of variations They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs The bones are hollow and lightweight The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the well developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals 54 ",
			"after": " In most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either Some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel like in appearance with tiny stubby legs The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs The caecilians are limbless They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side 55 ",
