			"previous": " i e  In a more sophisticated performance model the cooling air for the first row of static turbine nozzle guide vanes immediately downstream of the combustor can be safely disregarded since for a given HP rotor inlet temperature it has no effect upon either the combustor fuel flow or the net thrust of the engine However the turbine rotor cooling air must be included in such a model The rotor cooling bleed air is extracted from compressor delivery and passes along narrow passage ways before being injected into the base of the rotating blades The bleed air negotiates a complex set of passageways within the aerofoil extracting heat before being dumped into the gas stream adjacent to the blade surface In a sophisticated model the turbine rotor cooling air is assumed to quench the main gas stream emerging from turbine reducing its temperature but also increasing its mass flow ",
			"after": "  The bleed air cooling the turbine discs is treated in a similar manner The usual assumption is that the low energy disc cooling air cannot contribute to the engine cycle until it has passed through one row of blades or vanes ",
