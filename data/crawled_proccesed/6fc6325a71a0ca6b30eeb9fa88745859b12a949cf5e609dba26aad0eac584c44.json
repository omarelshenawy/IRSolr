			"previous": " In the American Revolutionary War 1775 1783 the Royal Navy readily obliterated the small Continental Navy of frigates fielded by the rebel colonists but the entry of France Spain and the Netherlands into the war against Britain produced a combination of opposing forces which deprived the Navy of its position of superiority for the first time since the 1690s briefly but decisively The war saw a series of indecisive battles in the Atlantic and Caribbean in which the Navy failed to achieve the conclusive victories needed to secure the supply lines of British forces in North America and to cut off the colonial rebels from outside support 38 The most important operation of the war came in 1781 when in the Battle of the Chesapeake the British fleet failed to lift the French blockade of Lord Cornwallis s army resulting in Cornwallis s surrender at Yorktown 39 Although this disaster effectively concluded the fighting in North America hostilities continued in the Indian Ocean where the French were prevented from re establishing a meaningful foothold in India and in the Caribbean British Caribbean victories in the Battle of the Saintes in 1782 and in the relief of Gibraltar later the same year symbolised the restoration of British naval ascendancy but this came too late to prevent the independence of the Thirteen Colonies 40 ",
