			"previous": " Salt glands are used by seabirds to deal with the salt they ingest by drinking and feeding particularly on crustaceans and to help them osmoregulate 10 The excretions from these glands which are positioned in the head of the birds emerging from the nasal cavity are almost pure sodium chloride ",
			"after": " With the exception of the cormorants and some terns and in common with most other birds all seabirds have waterproof plumage However compared to land birds they have far more feathers protecting their bodies This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air compared to other diving birds but otherwise soak up water 11 This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water ",
