			"after": " Maps of the world or large areas are often either political or physical The most important purpose of the political map is to show territorial borders the purpose of the physical is to show features of geography such as mountains soil type or land use including infrastructure such as roads railroads and buildings Topographic maps show elevations and relief with contour lines or shading Geological maps show not only the physical surface but characteristics of the underlying rock fault lines and subsurface structures Maps that depict the surface of the Earth also use a projection a way of translating the three dimensional real surface of the geoid to a two dimensional picture Perhaps the best known world map projection is the Mercator projection originally designed as a form of nautical chart Aeroplane pilots use aeronautical charts based on a Lambert conformal conic projection in which a cone is laid over the section of the earth to be mapped The cone intersects the sphere the earth at one or two parallels which are chosen as standard lines This allows the pilots to plot a great circle route approximation on a flat two dimensional chart ",
