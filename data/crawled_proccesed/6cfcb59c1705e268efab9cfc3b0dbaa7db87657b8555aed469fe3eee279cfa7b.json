			"previous": " The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament After the passing of the Test Act 1672 and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament Under the emerging penal laws Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703 1709 and 1728 This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists 53 The new Anglo Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy ",
			"after": " An extraordinary climatic shock known as the Great Frost struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741 after a decade of relatively mild winters The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples and the poor summers severely damaged harvests 54 This resulted in the famine of 1740 An estimated 250 000 people about one in eight of the population died from the ensuing pestilence and disease 55 The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more 55 56 Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality 55 56 ",
