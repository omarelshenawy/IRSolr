			"previous": " The three primary branches of Crocodilia had diverged by the end of the Mesozoic The earliest known members of the group are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in North America and Europe during the Campanian around 83 6 72 1 million years ago Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the Maastrichtian around 72 1 66 0 million years ago that lineage must have been present during the Campanian and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms which indicates that the time of the actual divergence between the three lineages must have been a pre Campanian event 107 ",
