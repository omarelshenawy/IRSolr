			"previous": " Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms 20 The following morning he would often approach his canvas in a bad mood of drinking under tremendous hangovers and drink I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing 21 He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work an image often would morph mid way through into something quite different from what he had first intended He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist To him lifestyle and art were intertwined he said that perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer 21 This is very evident in the 1949 series which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Vel zquez masterpieces and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years 20 ",
			"after": " The series marks Bacon s first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms For him the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated unobserved and had abandoned the need to present an outward face He believed that under these circumstances all pretence falls away and the social being becomes the sum of its neuroses which Bacon attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare bones features a mouth ears eyes a jaw According to Russell the view out front ceases to be the only one and our person is suddenly adrift fragmented and subject to strange mutation 6 Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting the figures are always posed and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed This conceit is abandoned in Bacon s series 6 ",
