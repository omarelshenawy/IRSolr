			"after": " In 2011 graduate student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen 28 Using scanning electron microscopy technology and energy dispersive X ray analysis the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the single feather specimen described in 1861 The resultant structure was then compared to that of 87 modern bird species and was determined with a high percentage of likelihood to be black in colour The feather studied was most probably a single covert which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings While the study does not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black it does suggest that it had some black colouration which included the coverts Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight 29 In a 2013 study published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry 30 new analyses of Archaeopteryx s feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex coloring in the form of light and dark colored plumage with the tips of its flight feathers being primarily black as opposed to the entire feather being dark in color This may have been integral for display and flight but this remains unknown at present 31 ",
