			"previous": " By mid 1944 Allied fighters had gained air superiority throughout the theater which would not be contested again during the war The extent of Allied quantitative and qualitative superiority by this point in the war was demonstrated during Battle of the Philippine Sea a lopsided Allied victory where Japanese fliers were downed in such numbers and with such ease that American fighter pilots likened it to a great turkey shoot ",
			"after": " Late in the war Japan did begin to produce new fighters such as the Nakajima Ki 84 and the Kawanishi N1K to replace the venerable Zero but these were produced only in small numbers and in any case by that time Japan lacked trained pilots or sufficient fuel to mount a sustained challenge to Allied fighters During the closing stages of the war Japan s fighter arm could not seriously challenge raids over Japan by American B 29s and was largely relegated to Kamikaze tactics ",
