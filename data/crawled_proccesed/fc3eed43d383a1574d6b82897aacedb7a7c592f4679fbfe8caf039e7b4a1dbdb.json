			"previous": " Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification 65 As Wikipedia grew Who writes Wikipedia became one of the questions frequently asked on the project 66 Jimmy Wales once argued that only a community a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore much like any traditional organization 67 In 2008 a Slate magazine article reported that According to researchers in Palo Alto 1 percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site s edits 68 This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content measured by number of characters contributed by users with low edit counts 69 ",
			"after": " A report in August 2014 showed that Wikipedia had at least 80 000 editors 70 A significant decline in the number of English language editors was reported in 2013 by Tom Simonite who stated The number of active editors on the English language Wikipedia peaked in 2007 at more than 51 000 and has been declining ever since t his past summer 2013 only 31 000 people could be considered active editors 71 Several attempts to explain this have been offered One possible explanation is that some users become turned off by their experiences 72 Another explanation according to Eric Goldman is found in editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals such as signing talk pages implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non trivial costs the contributor is expected to build a user page learn Wikipedia specific technological codes submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process and learn a baffling culture rich with in jokes and insider references Editors who do not log in are in some sense second class citizens on Wikipedia 73 as participants are accredited by members of the wiki community who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product on the basis of their ongoing participation 74 but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty ",
