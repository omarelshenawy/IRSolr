			"previous": " From the 4th century the Empire s Balkan territories including Greece suffered from the dislocation of the Barbarian Invasions The raids and devastation of the Goths and Huns in the 4th and 5th centuries and the Slavic invasion of Greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the Greek peninsula 42 Following the Slavic invasion the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas particularly the densely populated walled cities such as Athens Corinth and Thessalonica while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognize imperial authority 42 Outside of these areas a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred although on a much smaller scale than previously thought 43 44 ",
			"after": " The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again in stages during the 9th century 45 46 This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula while at the same time many Slavs were captured and re settled in Asia Minor and those that remained were assimilated 43 During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth much stronger than that of the Anatolian territories of the Empire 45 ",
