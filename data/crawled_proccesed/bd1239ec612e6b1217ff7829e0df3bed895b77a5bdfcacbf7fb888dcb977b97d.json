			"after": " The term analytic philosophy roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation attention to semantics use of classical logic and non classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria Some have held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of our language while some maintain that there are genuine philosophical problems and that philosophy is continuous with science Michael Dummett in his Origins of Analytical Philosophy makes the case for counting Gottlob Frege s The Foundations of Arithmetic as the first analytic work on the grounds that in that book Frege took the linguistic turn analyzing philosophical problems through language Bertrand Russell and G E Moore are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy beginning with their rejection of British idealism their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis Russell s classic works The Principles of Mathematics 121 On Denoting and Principia Mathematica with Alfred North Whitehead aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition emphasizing such problems as the reference of proper names whether existence is a property the nature of propositions the analysis of definite descriptions the discussions on the foundations of mathematics as well as exploring issues of ontological commitment and even metaphysical problems regarding time the nature of matter mind persistence and change which Russell tackled often with the aid of mathematical logic Russell and Moore s philosophy in the beginning of the 20th century developed as a critique of Hegel and his British followers in particular and of grand systems of speculative philosophy in general though by no means all analytic philosophers reject the philosophy of Hegel see Charles Taylor nor speculative philosophy Some schools in the group include logical positivism and ordinary language both markedly influenced by Russell and Wittgenstein s development of Logical Atomism the former positively and the latter negatively ",
