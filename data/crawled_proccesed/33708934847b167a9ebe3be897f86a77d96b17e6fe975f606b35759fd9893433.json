			"previous": " Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be either bifurcating or multifurcating and either labeled or unlabeled A rooted bifurcating tree has exactly two descendants arising from each interior node that is it forms a binary tree and an unrooted bifurcating tree takes the form of an unrooted binary tree a free tree with exactly three neighbors at each internal node In contrast a rooted multifurcating tree may have more than two children at some nodes and an unrooted multifurcating tree may have more than three neighbors at some nodes A labeled tree has specific values assigned to its leaves while an unlabeled tree sometimes called a tree shape defines a topology only The number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree but there are always more multifurcating than bifurcating trees more labeled than unlabeled trees and more rooted than unrooted trees The last distinction is the most biologically relevant it arises because there are many places on an unrooted tree to put the root For labeled bifurcating trees there are ",
