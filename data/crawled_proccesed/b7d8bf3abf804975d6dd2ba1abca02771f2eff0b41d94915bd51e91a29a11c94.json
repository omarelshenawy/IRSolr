			"previous": " Along with the holotype Russell designated a specimen collected by Barnum Brown in 1913 as the paratype of D torosus This specimen AMNH 5438 consists of parts of the hindleg the pelvis and some of its associated vertebrae It was discovered in the upper part of the Oldman Formation in Alberta 7 This upper section has since been renamed the Dinosaur Park Formation which dates back to the middle Campanian between 76 5 and 74 8 million years ago 17 Daspletosaurus fossils are known specifically from the middle to upper section of the formation between 75 6 and 75 0 million years ago 18 In 1914 Brown collected a nearly complete skeleton and skull forty years later his American Museum of Natural History sold this specimen to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago It was mounted for display in Chicago and labeled as Albertosaurus libratus for many years but after several skull features were later found to be modeled in plaster including most of the teeth the specimen FMNH PR308 was reassigned to Daspletosaurus 6 A total of eight specimens have been collected from the Dinosaur Park Formation over the years since most of them within the boundaries of Dinosaur Provincial Park Phil Currie believes that the Dinosaur Park specimens represent a new species of Daspletosaurus distinguished by certain features of the skull Pictures of this new species have been published but it still awaits a name and full description in print 7 ",
			"after": " A new tyrannosaurid specimen OMNH 10131 including skull fragments ribs and parts of the hindlimb was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now defunct genus Aublysodon 19 Many later authors have reassigned this specimen along with a few others from New Mexico to yet another unnamed species of Daspletosaurus 7 8 20 However research published in 2010 showed that this species from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid and was classified in the genus Bistahieversor 21 There is currently disagreement over the age of the Kirtland Formation with some workers claiming a late Campanian age 22 while others suggest a younger age in the early Maastrichtian stage 23 ",
