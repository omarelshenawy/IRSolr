			"after": " It soars high while searching for food holding its wings horizontally when gliding It flaps in short bursts which are followed by short periods of gliding 38 Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures as the wings are not as long forming a smaller wing area 39 In comparison with the turkey vulture the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight Like all New World vultures the black vulture often defecates on its own legs using the evaporation of the water in the feces and or urine to cool itself a process known as urohidrosis 3 It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet and causes white uric acid to streak the legs Because it lacks a syrinx the black vulture like other New World vultures has very few vocalization capabilities 3 It is generally silent but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding The black vulture is gregarious and roosts in large groups 40 In areas where their ranges overlap the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures 39 The black vulture generally forages in groups a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture which is generally solitary while foraging from a carcass 40 ",
