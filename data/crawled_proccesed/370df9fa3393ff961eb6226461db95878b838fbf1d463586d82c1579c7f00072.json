			"previous": " Some species such as Tetramorium caespitum attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies Others are less expansionist but just as aggressive they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves Extreme specialists among these slave raiding ants such as the Amazon ants are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive 119 Captured workers of the enslaved species Temnothorax have evolved a counter strategy destroying just the female pupae of the slave making Protomognathus americanus but sparing the males who don t take part in slave raiding as adults 120 ",
			"after": " Ants identify kin and nestmates through their scent which comes from hydrocarbon laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons If an ant is separated from its original colony it will eventually lose the colony scent Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked 121 Also the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other even if they are of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them The Argentine ant however does not have this characteristic due to lack of genetic diversity and has become a global pest because of it ",
