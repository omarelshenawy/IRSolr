			"previous": " An important part of traditional pre generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language these units are known as phonemes For example in English the p sound in pot is aspirated pronounced p while that in spot is not aspirated pronounced p However English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations allophones of the same phonological category that is of the phoneme p Traditionally it would be argued that if an aspirated p were interchanged with the unaspirated p in spot native speakers of English would still hear the same words that is the two sounds are perceived as the same p In some other languages however these two sounds are perceived as different and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes For example in Thai Hindi and Quechua there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature two words with different meanings that are identical except that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one ",
