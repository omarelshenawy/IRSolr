			"previous": " The deduction of the boundary layer equations was one of the most important advances in fluid dynamics Anderson 2005 Using an order of magnitude analysis the well known governing Navier Stokes equations of viscous fluid flow can be greatly simplified within the boundary layer Notably the characteristic of the partial differential equations PDE becomes parabolic rather than the elliptical form of the full Navier Stokes equations This greatly simplifies the solution of the equations By making the boundary layer approximation the flow is divided into an inviscid portion which is easy to solve by a number of methods and the boundary layer which is governed by an easier to solve PDE The continuity and Navier Stokes equations for a two dimensional steady incompressible flow in Cartesian coordinates are given by",
