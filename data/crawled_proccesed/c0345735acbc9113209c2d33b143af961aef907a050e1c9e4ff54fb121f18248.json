			"previous": " The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines culminating in the Great Famine of 1315 17 252 The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures 253 The years 1313 14 and 1317 21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe resulting in widespread crop failures 254 The climate change which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century was accompanied by an economic downturn 255 ",
			"after": " These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death a disease that spread throughout Europe during the following three years 256 AC The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe about one third of the population Towns were especially hard hit because of their crowded conditions AD Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited and in some places fields were left unworked Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields Further problems were the lower rents and lower demands for food both of which cut into agricultural income Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings and popular uprisings broke out across Europe 259 Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France the Peasants Revolt in England and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe which manifested itself in the foundation of new charities the self mortification of the flagellants and the scapegoating of the Jews 260 Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages 256 ",
