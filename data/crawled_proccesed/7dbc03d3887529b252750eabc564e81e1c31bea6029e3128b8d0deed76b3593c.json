			"previous": " Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope place Pluto s density at between 1 8 and 2 1 g cm3 suggesting its internal composition consists of roughly 50 70 percent rock and 30 50 percent ice by mass 84 Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them scientists expect that Pluto s internal structure is differentiated with the rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of ice The diameter of the core is hypothesized to be approximately 7006170000000000000 1700 km 70 of Pluto s diameter 83 It is possible that such heating continues today creating a subsurface ocean layer of liquid water some 100 to 180 km thick at the core mantle boundary 83 85 The DLR Institute of Planetary Research calculated that Pluto s density to radius ratio lies in a transition zone along with Neptune s moon Triton between icy satellites like the mid sized moons of Uranus and Saturn and rocky satellites such as Jupiter s Io 86 ",
