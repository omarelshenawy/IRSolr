			"previous": " The modern lowercase g has two typographic variants the single storey sometimes opentail and the double story sometimes looptail The single storey form derives from the majuscule uppercase form by raising the serif that distinguishes it from c to the top of the loop thus closing the loop and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left The double story form g had developed similarly except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right and to the left again forming a closed bowl or loop The initial extension to the right was absorbed into the upper closed bowl The double story version became popular when printing switched to Roman type because the tail was effectively shorter making it possible to put more lines on a page In the double story version a small top stroke in the upper right often terminating in an orb shape is called an ear ",
