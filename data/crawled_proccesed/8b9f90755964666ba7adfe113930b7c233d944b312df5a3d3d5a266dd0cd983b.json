			"after": " The Hawk had not been designed for carrier operations and numerous modifications were required to make it suitable for use on carriers These included improvements to the low speed handling characteristics and a reduction in the approach speed 4 It was found that the aircraft was apt to stall at the low approach speed required Modifications were designed by BAe in England most notably a simple slat system was devised operated by an actuator and linkage mechanism to fit into the small space available Strakes were also added on the fuselage to improve airflow The re design allowed the T 45 to become carrier capable citation needed Other changes were strengthened airframe 7 more robust and wider landing gear with catapult tow bar attachment and an arresting hook 4 It features a two wheel nose landing gear 8 ",
