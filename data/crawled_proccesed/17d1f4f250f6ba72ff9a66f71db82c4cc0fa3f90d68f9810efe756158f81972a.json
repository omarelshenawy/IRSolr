			"previous": " Criminal law also known as penal law pertains to crimes and punishment 151 It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but in itself makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place 152 Investigating apprehending charging and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of criminal procedure 153 The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof beyond reasonable doubt that a person is guilty of two things First the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal or actus reus guilty act 154 Second the accused must have the requisite malicious intent to do a criminal act or mens rea guilty mind However for so called strict liability crimes an actus reus is enough 155 Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense dolus directus and dolus eventualis and negligence Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment 156 157 ",
			"after": " Examples of crimes include murder assault fraud and theft In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts such as killing in self defence or pleading insanity Another example is in the 19th century English case of R v Dudley and Stephens which tested a defence of necessity The Mignonette sailing from Southampton to Sydney sank Three crew members and Richard Parker a 17 year old cabin boy were stranded on a raft They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death Driven to extreme hunger the crew killed and ate the cabin boy The crew survived and were rescued but put on trial for murder They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives Lord Coleridge expressing immense disapproval ruled to preserve one s life is generally speaking a duty but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it The men were sentenced to hang but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew s right to preserve their own lives In the end the Crown commuted their sentences to six months in jail 158 ",
