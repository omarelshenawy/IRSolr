			"previous": " While it is hard to draw a line between some of the noir films of the early 1960s such as Blast of Silence 1961 and Cape Fear 1962 and the noirs of the late 1950s new trends emerged in the post classic era The Manchurian Candidate 1962 directed by John Frankenheimer Shock Corridor 1962 directed by Samuel Fuller and Brainstorm 1965 directed by experienced noir character actor William Conrad all treat the theme of mental dispossession within stylistic and tonal frameworks derived from classic film noir The Manchurian Candidate examined the situation of American prisoners of war POWs during the Korean War These incidents that occurred during the war as well as post war incidents that ensued functioned as an inspiration for a whole other subgenre of Cold War Noir 92 93 The television series The Fugitive 1963 67 brought classic noir themes and mood to the small screen for an extended run 94 ",
			"after": " In a different vein films began to appear that self consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical archetypes to be revived rejected or reimagined These efforts typify what came to be known as neo noir 96 Though several late classic noirs Kiss Me Deadly in particular were deeply self knowing and post traditional in conception none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time 97 The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director Jean Luc Godard s bout de souffle Breathless 1960 which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a bold new style for a new day 98 In the United States Arthur Penn Mickey One 1964 drawing inspiration from Truffaut s Tirez sur le pianiste and other French New Wave films John Boorman Point Blank 1967 similarly caught up though in the Nouvelle vague s deeper waters and Alan J Pakula Klute 1971 directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original film noirs inviting audiences in on the game 99 ",
