			"previous": " The common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed 2 000 pairs 43 but may occasionally number more than 20 000 pairs 58 Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species such as Arctic 59 roseate and Sandwich terns black headed gulls 60 61 and black skimmers 62 Especially in the early part of the breeding season for no known reason most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea This phenomenon is called a dread 43 ",
			"after": " On their return to the breeding sites the terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory 63 and the actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish 64 Terns defend only a small area with distances between nests sometimes being as little as 50 cm 20 in although 150 350 cm 59 138 in is more typical As with many birds the same site is re used year after year with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons Around 90 of experienced birds reuse their former territory so young birds must nest on the periphery find a bereaved mate or move to another colony 63 A male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late in which case the pair may separate 65 ",
