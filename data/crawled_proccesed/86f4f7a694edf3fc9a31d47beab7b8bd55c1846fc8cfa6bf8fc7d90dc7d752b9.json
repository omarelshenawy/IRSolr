			"previous": " By the middle decades of a war and plague ridden 17th century Europe the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent wide religious political conflicts These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640 and the Netherlands and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive Europe wide Thirty Years War 38 ",
			"after": " In the latter half of the 17th century Spain went into a gradual decline during which it surrendered several small territories to France and the Netherlands however it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century ",
