			"previous": " On July 15 1961 to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton Florida Atlantic University was built on a 1940s era army airbase in Boca Raton During World War II the airfield served as the Army Air Corps sole radar training facility The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on 5 860 acres 23 7 km of adjacent land 13 A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony The land was seized through eminent domain leaving many Japanese Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II 13 ",
			"after": " The Boca Raton airbase was used for radar training anti submarine patrols along the coast and as a stop over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America It had a troop strength of 16 000 men with approximately 1 200 civilian workers The airfield was composed of four runways each stretching 5 200 feet 1 58 km long set in a triangle shape with one runway bisecting the triangle These runways are still visible on the Boca Campus today and are mainly used for parking Over the course of the war the airfield would grow to encompass more than 800 buildings serving approximately 100 000 airmen including those who were aboard the Enola Gay when it dropped a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima 14 15 As the war drew to a close Boca Raton Army Airfield saw a steady decline in use By the end of 1945 about only 100 planes were stationed at the airbase 16 17 ",
