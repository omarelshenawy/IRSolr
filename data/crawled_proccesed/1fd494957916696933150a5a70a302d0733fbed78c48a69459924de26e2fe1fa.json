			"previous": " Early M ori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment eventually developing their own distinctive culture Social organisation was largely communal with families whanau sub tribes hapu and tribes iwi ruled by a chief rangatira whose position was subject to the community s approval 268 The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced M ori culture 269 270 particularly with the introduction of Christianity 271 However M ori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity and M ori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples 272 More recently American Australian Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand Non M ori Polynesian cultures are also apparent with Pasifika the world s largest Polynesian festival now an annual event in Auckland ",
			"after": " The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged industrious problem solvers 273 Modesty was expected and enforced through the tall poppy syndrome where high achievers received harsh criticism 274 At the time New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country 275 From the early 20th century until the late 1960s M ori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of M ori into British New Zealanders 253 In the 1960s as higher education became more available and cities expanded 276 urban culture began to dominate 277 Even though the majority of the population now lives in cities much of New Zealand s art literature film and humour has rural themes ",
