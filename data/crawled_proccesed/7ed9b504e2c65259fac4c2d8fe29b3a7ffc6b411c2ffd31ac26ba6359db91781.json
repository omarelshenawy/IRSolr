			"previous": " The Space Telescope Science Institute STScI is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy AURA and is physically located in Baltimore Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium STScI was established in 1981 41 42 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large NASA had wanted to keep this function in house but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment 43 44 The Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility ST ECF established at Garching bei M nchen near Munich in 1984 provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011 when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre ",
			"after": " One rather complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope 45 Hubble is in a low Earth orbit to enable servicing missions but this means that most astronomical targets are occulted by the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly due to elevated radiation levels and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun precluding observations of Mercury Moon and Earth The solar avoidance angle is about 50 to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments If the FGSs are turned off however the Moon and Earth can be observed Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat fields for the WFPC1 instrument There is a so called continuous viewing zone CVZ at roughly 90 to the plane of Hubble s orbit in which targets are not occulted for long periods Due to the precession of the orbit the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks Because the limb of the Earth is always within about 30 of regions within the CVZ the brightness of scattered earthshine may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations ",
