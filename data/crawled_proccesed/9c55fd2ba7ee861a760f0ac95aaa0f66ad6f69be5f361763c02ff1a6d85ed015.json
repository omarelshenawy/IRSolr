			"previous": " The pitches and form of tonal music are organized hierarchically all pitches deriving their importance from their relationship to a tonic key and secondary themes in other keys are brought back to the tonic in a recapitulation of the primary theme Susan McClary connects this specifically in the sonata allegro form to the feminist hierarchy of gender see above in her book Feminine Endings even pointing out that primary themes were often previously called masculine and secondary themes feminine ",
			"after": " In ethics various virtues are enumerated and sometimes organized hierarchically according to certain brands of virtue theory  In all of these random examples there is an asymmetry of compositional significance between levels of structure so that small parts of the whole hierarchical array depend for their meaning on their membership in larger parts There is a hierarchy of activities in human life productive activity serves or is guided by the moral life the moral life is guided by practical reason practical reason used in moral and political life serves contemplative reason whereby we contemplate God Practical reason sets aside time and resources for contemplative reason ",
