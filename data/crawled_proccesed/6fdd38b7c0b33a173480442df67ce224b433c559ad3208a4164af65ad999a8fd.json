			"previous": " Alligators have created a niche in wet prairies With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout the dry season Alligator holes are integral to the survival of aquatic invertebrates turtles fish small mammals and birds during extended drought periods The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole 50 51 ",
