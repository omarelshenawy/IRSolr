			"previous": " The common starling is 19 23 cm 7 5 9 1 in long with a wingspan of 31 44 cm 12 17 in and a weight of 58 101 g 2 0 3 6 oz 14 Among standard measurements the wing chord is 11 8 to 13 8 cm 4 6 to 5 4 in the tail is 5 8 to 6 8 cm 2 3 to 2 7 in the culmen is 2 5 to 3 2 cm 0 98 to 1 26 in and the tarsus is 2 7 to 3 2 cm 1 1 to 1 3 in 14 The plumage is iridescent black glossed purple or green and spangled with white especially in winter The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted than those of adult females at a given time of year The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed The legs are stout and pinkish or greyish red The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip in the winter it is brownish black but in summer females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue grey bases Moulting occurs once a year in late summer after the breeding season has finished the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white breast feathers or buff wing and back feathers which gives the bird a speckled appearance The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off Juveniles are grey brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering especially on the head 12 19 They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises rich brown in males mouse brown or grey in females Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always dark pupil is 97 accurate in determining sex rising to 98 if the length of the throat feathers is also considered 20 21 The common starling is mid sized by both starling standards and passerine standards It is readily distinguished from other mid sized passerines such as thrushes icterids or small corvids by its relatively short tail sharp blade like bill round bellied shape and strong sizeable and rufous coloured legs In flight its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive while on the ground its strange somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage 22 ",
			"after": " Like most terrestrial starlings the common starling moves by walking or running rather than hopping Their flight is quite strong and direct their triangular shaped wings beat very rapidly and periodically the birds glide for a short way without losing much height before resuming powered flight When in a flock the birds take off almost simultaneously wheel and turn in unison form a compact mass or trail off into a wispy stream bunch up again and land in a coordinated fashion 19 Common starling on migration can fly at 60 80 km hr 37 50 mi hr and cover a total distance up to 1 000 1 500 km 600 900 mi 23 ",
