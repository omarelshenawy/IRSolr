			"previous": " The durability and life of dynamically loaded welded steel structures are determined often by the welds particular by the weld transitions By selective treatment of weld transitions with the High Frequency Mechanical Impact HFMI treatment method 22 23 the durability of many designs can be increased significantly This method is universally applicable requires only technical equipment and offers high reproducibility and a high grade of quality control ",
			"after": " Following the King s f te celebrations at the Palace of Versailles a train returning to Paris crashed in May 1842 at Meudon after the leading locomotive broke an axle The carriages behind piled into the wrecked engines and caught fire At least 55 passengers were killed trapped in the carriages including the explorer Jules Dumont d Urville This accident is known in France as the Catastrophe ferroviaire de Meudon The accident was witnessed by the British locomotive engineer Joseph Locke and widely reported in Britain It was discussed extensively by engineers who sought an explanation ",
