			"previous": " As part of Boulton s efforts to market to the wealthy he started to sell vases decorated with ormolu previously a French speciality Ormolu was milled gold from the French or moulu amalgamated with mercury and applied to the item which was then heated to drive off the mercury leaving the gold decoration 33 In the late 1760s and early 1770s there was a fashion among the wealthy for decorated vases and he sought to cater to this craze He initially ordered ceramic vases from his friend and fellow Lunar Society member Josiah Wedgwood but ceramic proved unable to bear the weight of the decorations and Boulton chose marble and other decorative stone as the material for his vases 34 Boulton copied vase designs from classical Greek works and borrowed works of art from collectors merchants and sculptors 34 ",
			"after": " Fothergill and others searched Europe for designs for these creations 35 In March 1770 Boulton visited the Royal Family and sold several vases to Queen Charlotte George III s wife 36 He ran annual sales at Christie s in 1771 and 1772 The Christie s exhibition succeeded in publicising Boulton and his products which were highly praised but the sales were not financially successful with many works left unsold or sold below cost 37 When the craze for vases ended in the early 1770s the partnership was left with a large stock on its hands and disposed of much of it in a single massive sale to Catherine the Great of Russia 38 the Empress described the vases as superior to French ormolu and cheaper as well 39 Boulton continued to solicit orders though ormolu was dropped from the firm s business description from 1779 and when the Boulton Fothergill partnership was dissolved by the latter s 1782 death there were only 14 items of ormolu in the toy room 40 ",
