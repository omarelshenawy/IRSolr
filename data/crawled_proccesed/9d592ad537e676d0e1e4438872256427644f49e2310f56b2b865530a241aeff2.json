			"after": " The tailhook is a strong metal bar with its free end flattened out thickened somewhat and fashioned into a claw like hook The hook is mounted on a swivel on the keel of the aircraft and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed up position Upon actuation by the pilot hydraulic or pneumatic pressure lowers the hook to the down position The presence of a tailhook is not evidence of an aircraft s aircraft carrier suitability Carrier aircraft hooks are designed to be quickly raised by the pilot after use Many land based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake tire malfunctions aborted takeoffs or other emergencies Land based aircraft landing gear and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing 3 and some land based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation 4 ",
