			"after": " Rinaldo is an opera by George Frideric Handel composed in 1711 and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill and the work was first performed at the Queen s Theatre in London s Haymarket on 24 February 1711 The story of love battle and redemption set at the time of the First Crusade is loosely based on Torquato Tasso s epic poem Gerusalemme liberata Jerusalem Delivered and its staging involved many original and vivid effects It was a great success with the public despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres Rinaldo was the most frequently performed of all Handel s musical dramas during his lifetime However after 1731 the opera was not staged for more than 200 years Following a successful run at New York s Metropolitan Opera in 1984 performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide Despite the lack of a standard edition with its spectacular vocal and orchestral passages Rinaldo has been cited as one of Handel s greatest operas Of its individual numbers the soprano aria Lascia ch io pianga has become a particular favourite and is a popular concert piece ",
