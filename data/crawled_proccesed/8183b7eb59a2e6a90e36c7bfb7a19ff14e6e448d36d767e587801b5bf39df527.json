			"previous": " In Britain in 1914 the Public Schools Officers Training Corps annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings near Salisbury Plain Head of the British Army Lord Kitchener was to review the cadets but the imminence of the war prevented him General Horace Smith Dorrien was sent instead He surprised the two or three thousand cadets by declaring in the words of Donald Christopher Smith a Bermudian cadet who was present that war should be avoided at almost any cost that war would solve nothing that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated In our ignorance I and many of us felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments but during the next four years those of us who survived the holocaust probably not more than one quarter of us learned how right the General s prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it 297 Voicing these sentiments did not hinder Smith Dorien s career or prevent him from doing his duty in World War I to the best of his abilities ",
