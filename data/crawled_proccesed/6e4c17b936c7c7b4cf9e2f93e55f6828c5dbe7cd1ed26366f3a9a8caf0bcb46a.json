			"previous": " During the era of the collodion process before the arrival of less demanding photographic technology the gelatin silver process photographic film and smaller cameras and the consequent rise of amateur photography commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas 31 By 1889 however Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers even if this was an exaggeration the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously having an impact on the commercial photography business To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise Farsari provided free use of a darkroom 32 ",
			"after": " Attribution is often difficult with Farsari s photographs because 19th century photographers frequently acquired each others images and sold them under their own names This may be due to the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio 33 Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato Stillfried Andersen or Kusakabe 34 A case in point is the photograph of an Officer s Daughter variously attributed to Farsari Stillfried Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin ichi 35 ",
