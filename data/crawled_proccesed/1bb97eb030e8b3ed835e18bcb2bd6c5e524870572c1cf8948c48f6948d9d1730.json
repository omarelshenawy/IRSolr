			"after": " The main reason authors make their articles openly accessible is to maximize their research impact 21 A study in 2001 first reported an open access citation impact advantage 22 and a growing number of studies 23 have confirmed with varying degrees of methodological rigor that an open access article is more likely to be used and cited than one behind subscription barriers 23 For example a 2006 study in PLoS Biology found that articles published as immediate open access in PNAS were three times more likely to be cited than non open access papers and were also cited more than PNAS articles that were only self archived 24 This result has been challenged as an artifact of authors self selectively paying to publish their higher quality articles in hybrid open access journals 25 whereas a 2010 study found that the open access citation advantage was equally big whether self archiving was self selected or mandated 26 ",
