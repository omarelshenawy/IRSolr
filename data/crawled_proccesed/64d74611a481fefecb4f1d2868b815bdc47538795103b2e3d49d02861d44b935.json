			"after": " The back cover is decorated more simply with no raised elements and purely geometric decoration of engraved lines which are filled in with two pigments which now appear as the bright yellow and the dark colour once apparently blue Within several framing lines making rectangles of similar proportions to the cover itself a central rectangular panel is marked with pricks to make a grid of 3mm squares 21 tall and 10 wide Lines on the grid are engraved and coloured in yellow to form two stepped crosses or squares standing on one corner with additional stepped elements in the four corners and half way up the vertical sides between the two crosses The vertical axial line down the grid and the two horizontal axes through the crosses are also coloured in the yellow pigment right to the edges of the grid The remaining lines on the grid and all the lines along the edges of the grid are coloured in the dark colour 37 This is a simple version of the sort of design found on Insular carpet pages as well as in Coptic manuscript decoration and textiles and small stepped crosses decorate the main panels of the famous Sutton Hoo shoulder clasps 38 The alignment of the various outer framing lines with the innermost frame and the panel with the grid is noticeably imperfect as the top framing line was extended too far to the left Traces of an uncoloured first attempt at this line can be seen on the right hand side above the coloured line 39 ",
