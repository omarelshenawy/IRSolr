			"previous": " The Venetian governmental structure was similar in some ways to the republican system of ancient Rome with an elected chief executive the Doge a senate like assembly of nobles and a mass of citizens with limited political power who originally had the power to grant or withhold their approval of each newly elected Doge Church and various private properties were tied to military service although there was no knight tenure within the city itself The Cavalieri di San Marco was the only order of chivalry ever instituted in Venice and no citizen could accept or join a foreign order without the government s consent Venice remained a republic throughout its independent period and politics and the military were kept separate except when on occasion the Doge personally headed the military War was regarded as a continuation of commerce by other means hence the city s early production of large numbers of mercenaries for service elsewhere and later its reliance on foreign mercenaries when the ruling class was preoccupied with commerce ",
			"after": " The chief executive was the Doge who theoretically held his elective office for life In practice several Doges were forced by pressure from their oligarchical peers to resign the office and retire into monastic seclusion when they were felt to have been discredited by perceived political failure ",
