			"previous": " Oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele He had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates by about 1772 7 64 Scheele called the gas fire air because it was the only known supporter of combustion and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled Treatise on Air and Fire which he sent to his publisher in 1775 That document was published in 1777 68 ",
			"after": " In the meantime on August 1 1774 an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide HgO inside a glass tube which liberated a gas he named dephlogisticated air 7 He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it After breathing the gas himself he wrote The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards 27 Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled An Account of Further Discoveries in Air which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air 64 69 Because he published his findings first Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery ",
