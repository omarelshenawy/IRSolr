			"previous": " The 767 s fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at 16 5 feet 5 03 m 5 While it was narrower than previous wide body designs seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag 9 18 However the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide body unit load devices side by side 22 23 As a result a smaller container the LD2 24 was created specifically for the 767 25 The adoption of a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section 18 providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft 6 18 ",
			"after": " The 767 was the first Boeing wide body to be designed with a two crew digital glass cockpit 17 Cathode ray tube CRT color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly 17 Despite the promise of reduced crew costs United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three person cockpit citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft 26 The carrier maintained this position until July 1981 when a U S presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide body jets 26 27 A three crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models 28 Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three crew cockpits due to union demands it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured 28 29 The 767 s two crew cockpit was also applied to the 757 allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course 19 and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types 30 ",
