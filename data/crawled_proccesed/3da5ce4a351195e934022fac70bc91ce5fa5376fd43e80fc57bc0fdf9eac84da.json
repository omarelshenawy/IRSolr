			"previous": " The scientific subjects of Wright s paintings from this time were meant to appeal to the wealthy scientific circles in which he moved While never a member himself he had strong connections with the Lunar Society he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin as well as Josiah Wedgwood who later commissioned paintings from him 36 The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings which were held when the moon was full Like The Orrery Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates who already owned Wright s Gladiator An Aylesbury physician patron of the arts and hedonist Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club who despite his excesses lived to be over 90 Wright s account book shows a number of prices for the painting Pd 200 is shown in one place and 210 in another but Wright had written to Bates asking for 130 stating that the low price might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum 37 Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded Wright only notes in his account book that he received 30 in part payment 38 ",
			"after": " Wright exhibited the painting at the Society of Artists exhibition in 1768 and it was re exhibited before Christian VII of Denmark in September the same year Viewers remarked that it was clever and vigorous 27 while Gustave Flaubert who saw it on a visit to England in 1865 66 considered it charmant de na vet et profondeur 26 It was popular enough that a mezzotint was engraved from it by Valentine Green which was published by John Boydell on 24 June 1769 38 and initially sold for 15 shillings This was reprinted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in increasingly weak impressions 39 Ellis Waterhouse called it one of the wholly original masterpieces of British art 40 ",
