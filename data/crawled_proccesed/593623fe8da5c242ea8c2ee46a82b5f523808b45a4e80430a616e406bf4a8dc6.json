			"previous": " The fact that a monopoly has a downward sloping demand curve means that the relationship between total revenue and output for a monopoly is much different than that of competitive companies 27 Total revenue equals price times quantity A competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve meaning that total revenue is proportional to output 27 Thus the total revenue curve for a competitive company is a ray with a slope equal to the market price 27 A competitive company can sell all the output it desires at the market price For a monopoly to increase sales it must reduce price Thus the total revenue curve for a monopoly is a parabola that begins at the origin and reaches a maximum value then continuously decreases until total revenue is again zero 28 Total revenue has its maximum value when the slope of the total revenue function is zero The slope of the total revenue function is marginal revenue So the revenue maximizing quantity and price occur when MR 0 For example assume that the monopoly s demand function is P 50 2Q The total revenue function would be TR 50Q 2Q2 and marginal revenue would be 50 4Q Setting marginal revenue equal to zero we have",
