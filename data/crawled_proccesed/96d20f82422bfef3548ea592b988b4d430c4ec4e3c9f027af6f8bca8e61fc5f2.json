			"previous": " In the 1924 season Yorkshire completed a hat trick of championships 27 under Geoffrey Wilson and Sutcliffe enjoyed probably his best season to date scoring 2 142 runs at 48 68 with 6 centuries including a highest score of 255 not out against Essex 16 He made his Test debut on Saturday 14 June 1924 playing for England against South Africa at Edgbaston and opening the innings with Jack Hobbs In this First Test which England won by an innings they recorded their first century partnership for England by putting on 136 before Sutcliffe was out for 64 28 In the Second Test at Lord s Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored 268 before Sutcliffe was out for 122 his maiden Test century Hobbs went on to make 211 and England again won by an innings 29 In the whole series Sutcliffe scored 303 runs at 75 75 30 ",
			"after": " As early as July Sutcliffe was one of ten players named to tour Australia in the winter of 1924 25 under the leadership of Arthur Gilligan At first Hobbs declined the tour but then changed his mind when it was decided his wife would accompany him The importance of this to Sutcliffe was that his partnership with Hobbs could continue at the very highest level of cricket where the presence of Hobbs was ultimately the key factor in Sutcliffe s major success on the tour which established him as a world class player 31 Sutcliffe said he had some initial difficulty in adjusting to Australian conditions specifically the strong light which affected his timing He also reckoned that the pitches were a good four yards faster than in England His remedy was to play straight and by hitting the ball back down the pitch He said later that he sacrificed many of his best shots but it paid off in the end 32 This is shown by his overall performance as although England lost the series 4 1 Sutcliffe scored 734 runs in the five Tests at an average of 81 55 with 4 centuries 2 half centuries and a highest score of 176 In the whole tour he scored 1 250 runs at 69 44 with 5 centuries and a highest score of 188 33 ",
