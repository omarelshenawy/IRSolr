			"after": " By mid September 1939 Freud s cancer of the jaw was causing him increasingly severe pain and had been declared to be inoperable The last book he read Balzac s La Peau de Chagrin prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty and a few days later he turned to his doctor friend and fellow refugee Max Schur reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness Schur you remember our contract not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense When Schur replied that he had not forgotten Freud said I thank you and then Talk it over with Anna and if she thinks it s right then make an end of it Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father s death but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud s death on 23 September 1939 90 ",
