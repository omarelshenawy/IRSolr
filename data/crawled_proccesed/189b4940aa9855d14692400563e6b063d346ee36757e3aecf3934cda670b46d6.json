			"previous": " Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor as was usual in Victorian theatres Gilbert Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support They were therefore able to choose their own cast of performers rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre They chose talented actors most of whom were not well known stars and did not command high fees and to whom they could teach a more naturalistic style of performance than was commonly used at the time They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers 6 The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience as critic Herman Klein wrote we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which the Gilbertian quips and absurdities were said and done For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird eccentric yet intensely human beings They conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight 7 ",
			"after": " The success of The Sorcerer paved the way for another collaboration by Gilbert and Sullivan Carte agreed on terms for a new opera with the Comedy Opera Company and Gilbert began work on H M S Pinafore before the end of 1877 8 Gilbert s father had been a naval surgeon and the nautical theme of the opera appealed to him 9 He drew on several of his earlier Bab Ballad poems many of which also have nautical themes including Captain Reece 1868 and General John 1867 10 Some of the characters also have prototypes in the ballads Dick Deadeye is based on a character in Woman s Gratitude 1869 an early version of Ralph Rackstraw can be seen in Joe Go Lightly 1867 with its sailor madly in love with the daughter of someone who far outranks him and Little Buttercup is taken almost wholesale from The Bumboat Woman s Story 1870 11 12 On 27 December 1877 while Sullivan was on holiday on the French Riviera Gilbert sent him a plot sketch accompanied by the following note 13 ",
