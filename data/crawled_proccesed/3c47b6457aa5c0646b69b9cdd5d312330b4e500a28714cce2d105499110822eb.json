			"previous": " The final Shuttle flight of 1995 STS 74 began with the November 12 launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis and delivered the Russian built Docking Module to Mir along with a new pair of solar arrays and other hardware upgrades for the station The Docking Module was designed to provide more clearance for Shuttles in order to prevent any collisions with Mir s solar arrays during docking a problem which had been overcome during STS 71 by relocating the station s Kristall module to a different location on the station The module attached to Kristall s docking port prevented the need for this procedure on further missions During the course of the flight nearly 1 000 pounds 450 kg of water were transferred to Mir and experiment samples including blood urine and saliva were moved to Atlantis for return to Earth 16 24 25 26 ",
