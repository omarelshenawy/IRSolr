			"after": " The turbofan or fanjet is a type of airbreathing jet engine that is widely used in aircraft propulsion The word turbofan is a portmanteau of turbine and fan the turbo portion refers to a gas turbine engine which takes mechanical energy from combustion 1 and the fan a ducted fan that uses the mechanical energy from the gas turbine to accelerate air rearwards Thus whereas all the air taken in by a turbojet passes through the turbine through the combustion chamber in a turbofan some of that air bypasses the turbine A turbofan thus can be thought of as a turbojet being used to drive a ducted fan with both of those contributing to the thrust The ratio of the mass flow of air bypassing the engine core compared to the mass flow of air passing through the core is referred to as the bypass ratio The engine produces thrust through a combination of these two portions working in concert engines that use more jet thrust relative to fan thrust are known as low bypass turbofans conversely those that have considerably more fan thrust than jet thrust are known as high bypass Most commercial aviation jet engines in use today are of the high bypass type and most modern military fighter engines are low bypass citation needed Afterburners are not used on high bypass turbofan engines but may be used on either low bypass turbofan or turbojet engines ",
