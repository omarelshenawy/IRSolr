			"previous": " Changes in the materials used in parts can also improve fatigue life For example parts can be made from better fatigue rated metals Complete replacement and redesign of parts can also reduce if not eliminate fatigue problems Thus helicopter rotor blades and propellers in metal are being replaced by composite equivalents They are not only lighter but also much more resistant to fatigue They are more expensive but the extra cost is amply repaid by their greater integrity since loss of a rotor blade usually leads to total loss of the aircraft A similar argument has been made for replacement of metal fuselages wings and tails of aircraft 20 ",
