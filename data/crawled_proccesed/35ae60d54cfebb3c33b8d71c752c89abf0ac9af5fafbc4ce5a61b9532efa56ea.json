			"previous": " Early German turbojets had severe limitations on the amount of running they could do due to the lack of suitable high temperature materials for the turbines British engines such as the Rolls Royce Welland used better materials giving improved durability The Welland was type certificated for 80 hours initially later extended to 150 hours between overhauls as a result of an extended 500 hour run being achieved in tests 7 A few of the original fighters still exist with their original engines but many have been re engined with more modern engines with greater fuel efficiency and a longer TBO such as the reproduction Me 262 powered by General Electric J85s ",
			"after": " General Electric in the United States was in a good position to enter the jet engine business due to its experience with the high temperature materials used in their turbosuperchargers during World War II 8 ",
