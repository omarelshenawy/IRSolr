			"previous": " Crocodilians are excellent swimmers During aquatic locomotion the muscular tail undulates from side to side to drive the animal through the water while the limbs are held close to the body to reduce drag 18 26 When the animal needs to stop steer or manoeuvre in a different direction the limbs are splayed out 18 Crocodilians generally cruise slowly on the surface or underwater with gentle sinuous movements of the tail but when pursued or when chasing prey they can move rapidly 27 Crocodilians are less well adapted for moving on land and are unusual among vertebrates in having two different means of terrestrial locomotion the high walk and the low walk 13 Their ankle joints flex in a different way from those of other reptiles a feature they share with some early archosaurs One of the upper row of ankle bones the astragalus moves with the tibia and fibula The other the calcaneum is functionally part of the foot and has a socket into which a peg from the astragalus fits The result is that the legs can be held almost vertically beneath the body when on land and the foot can swivel during locomotion with a twisting movement at the ankle 28 ",
			"after": " The high walk of crocodilians with the belly and most of the tail being held off the ground is unique among living reptiles It somewhat resembles the walk of a mammal with the same sequence of limb movements left fore right hind right fore left hind 27 The low walk is similar to the high walk but without the body being raised and is quite different from the sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously but the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher Unlike most other land vertebrates when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb rather than the whole leg swings forward by this means stride length increases while stride duration decreases 29 ",
