			"after": " The Hammond organ was the first successful electric organ released in the 1930s It used mechanical rotating tonewheels to produce the sound waveforms Its system of drawbars allowed for setting volumes for specific sounds and it provided vibrato like effects The drawbars allow the player to choose volume levels of 0 8 for each of the members of the harmonic series starting from 16 By emphasizing certain harmonics from the overtone series desired sounds such as brass or string can be imitated Generally the older Hammond drawbar organs had only preamplifiers and were connected to an external amplified speaker The Leslie speaker which rotates to create a distinctive tremolo became the most popular The three most popular models of Hammond organs were the consoles the B 3 C 3 and A 100 Inside all three models the tone generators drawbars and keyboards were identical The B 3 cabinet stood on 4 legs the C 3 was an enclosed church model and the A100 series had built in amplifiers and speakers ",
