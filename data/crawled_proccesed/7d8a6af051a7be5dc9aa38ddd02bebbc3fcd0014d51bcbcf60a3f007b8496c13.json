			"previous": " If most of the Sea Harriers had been lost the GR 3s would have replaced them in air patrol duties even though the Harrier GR 3 was not designed for air defence operations as such the GR 3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air to air Sidewinder missiles 88 From 10 to 24 May 1982 prior to British forces landing in the Falklands a detachment of three GR 3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F 4 Phantom IIs arrived to take on this responsibility 94 During the Falklands War the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface to air missiles SAMs and small arms fire from the ground 95 In total four Harrier GR 3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire accidents or mechanical failure 96 More than 2 000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft 97 ",
			"after": " Following the Falklands war British Aerospace explored the Skyhook a new technique to operate Harriers from smaller ships Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re arming This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas 98 The system was marketed to foreign customers N 10 and it was speculated that Skyhook could be applied to large submarines such as the Russian Typhoon class but the system attracted no interest 100 ",
