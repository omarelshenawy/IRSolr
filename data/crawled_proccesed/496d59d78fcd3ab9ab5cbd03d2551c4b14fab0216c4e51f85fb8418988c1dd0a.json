			"after": " Few women competed in sports until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as social changes in Europe and North America favored increased female participation in society as equals with men Although women were permitted to participate in many sports relatively few showed interest and there was often disapproval of those who did The modern Olympics had female competitors from 1900 onward though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men Concern over the physical strength and stamina of women led to the discouragement of female participation in more physically intensive sports and in some cases led to less physically demanding female versions of male sports Thus netball was developed out of basketball and softball out of baseball ",
