			"after": " A logogram is a single written character which represents a complete grammatical word Most Chinese characters are classified as logograms  As each character represents a single word or more precisely a morpheme many logograms are required to write all the words of language The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are the major disadvantage of the logographic systems over alphabetic systems However since the meaning is inherent to the symbol the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages In practice this is only true for closely related languages like the Chinese languages as syntactical constraints reduce the portability of a given logographic system Japanese uses Chinese logograms extensively in its writing systems with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings However the semantics and especially the grammar are different enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic Chinese grammar though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend ",
