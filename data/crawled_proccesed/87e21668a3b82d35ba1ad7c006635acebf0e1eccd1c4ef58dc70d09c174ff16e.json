			"previous": " On 17 October 1933 aviation pioneer Hugo Junkers owner of the Junkers Aircraft Works was arrested Within a few days his company was expropriated by the regime In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and under the direction of Aviation Minister G ring production was immediately ramped up industry wide From a workforce of 3 200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932 the industry grew to employ a quarter of a million workers manufacturing over 10 000 technically advanced aircraft per year less than ten years later 226 ",
			"after": " An elaborate bureaucracy was created to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods with the intention of eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation s balance of payments The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles 227 As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit sharing agreement with IG Farben guaranteeing them a 5 per cent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich By 1936 Farben regretted making the deal as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government 228 ",
