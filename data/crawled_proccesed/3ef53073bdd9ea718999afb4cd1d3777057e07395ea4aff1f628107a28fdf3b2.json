			"after": " Discussion of the concepts of heaviness weight and lightness levity date back to the ancient Greek philosophers These were typically viewed as inherent properties of objects Plato described weight as the natural tendency of objects to seek their kin To Aristotle weight and levity represented the tendency to restore the natural order of the basic elements air earth fire and water He ascribed absolute weight to earth and absolute levity to fire Archimedes saw weight as a quality opposed to buoyancy with the conflict between the two determining if an object sinks or floats The first operational definition of weight was given by Euclid who defined weight as weight is the heaviness or lightness of one thing compared to another as measured by a balance 2 Operational balances rather than definitions had however been around much longer 6 ",
