			"previous": " The term Early Netherlandish art applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries 3 in the northern European areas controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy and later the Habsburg dynasty These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style In this political and art historical context the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of modern France Germany Belgium and the Netherlands 4 ",
			"after": " The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms Late Gothic is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the art of the Middle Ages 5 In the early 1900s the artists were variously referred to in English as the Ghent Bruges school or the Old Netherlandish school Flemish Primitives is a traditional art historical term borrowed from the French 6 that became popular after 1902 7 A and remains in use today especially in Dutch and German 5 In this context primitive does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting Erwin Panofsky preferred the term ars nova new art which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court 8 When the Burgundian dukes established centres of power in the Netherlands they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook 9 According to Otto P cht a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a revolution took place in painting a new beauty in art emerged one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world 9 ",
