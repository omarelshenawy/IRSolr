			"previous": " The inheritance of DNA is a complex process that varies between male and female individuals consequently this allows the study of separate female and male lineages using mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome DNA respectively 89 Mitochondrial DNA mtDNA for short and Y chromosome DNA differ from the DNA of diploid nuclear chromosomes in that they are not formed from the combination of both parent s genes Rather males inherit the Y chromosome directly from their fathers and both sexes inherit mtDNA directly from their mothers Consequently they preserve a genetic record from individual to individual that is altered only through mutation ",
			"after": " An examination of Y chromosome variation sampled in an east west transect across England and Wales These were compared with similar samples taken in Friesland and Norway Friesland was selected for the study due to it being regarded as a source location for Anglo Saxon migrants and because of the similarities between Old English and Frisian Samples from Norway were also compared as this is a source of the later Viking migrations It found that in England 50 to 100 of paternal genetic inheritance was derived from incomers originating in the Germanic coastlands of the North Sea 90 ",
