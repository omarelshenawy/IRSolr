			"previous": " While derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph parts of the causal structure can under certain assumptions be learned from statistical data The basic idea goes back to Sewall Wright s 1921 work 22 on path analysis A recovery algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl 1987 23 which rests on Wright s distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a directed acyclic graph DAG ",
			"after": " Type 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies i e and are independent given and are therefore indistinguishable within purely cross sectional data Type 3 however can be uniquely identified since and are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent Thus while the skeletons the graphs stripped of arrows of these three triplets are identical the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable The same distinction applies when and have common ancestors except that one must first condition on those ancestors Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and then orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed 21 24 25 26 ",
