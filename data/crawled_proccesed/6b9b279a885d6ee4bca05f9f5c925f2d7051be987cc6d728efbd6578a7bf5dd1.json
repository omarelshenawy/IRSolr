			"previous": " In some places they are mainly scavengers feeding on carrion as well as the associated maggots and carrion beetles With large bodied carrion which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook billed vultures they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means 58 Plant food includes cereal grains berries and fruit They prey on small invertebrates amphibians reptiles small mammals and birds 59 Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces and human food waste They store surplus food items especially those containing fat and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens 51 Ravens also raid the food caches of other species such as the Arctic fox 60 They sometimes associate with another canine the grey wolf as a kleptoparasite following to scavenge wolf kills in winter 61 Ravens are regular predators at bird nests brazenly picking off eggs nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re introduced 62 ",
			"after": " Common ravens nesting near sources of human garbage included a higher percentage of food waste in their diet birds nesting near roads consumed more road killed vertebrates and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source 63 In contrast a 1984 1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south western Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets though small mammals grasshoppers cattle carrion and birds were also eaten 64 ",
