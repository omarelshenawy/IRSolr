			"previous": " The first recipients of C 123 aircraft were USAF transport units soon followed by the United States Coast Guard USCG who used the aircraft for search and rescue missions and even the U S Air Force Demonstration Team the Thunderbirds would use C 123s for a time as a logistics support aircraft for transporting the team s ground crews and equipment The type would also be widely exported under various U S military assistance programs directly from USAF stocks ",
			"after": " The aircraft was nearly ignored by the USAF for service in Vietnam but a political rivalry with the U S Army and the Army s use of the CV 2 Caribou and later pre production order for the de Havilland Canada C 8 Buffalo led to a decision to deploy C 123s there To compete with the well performing CV 2 the USAF and Fairchild furthered development on the C 123 to allow it to do similar work on short runways This additional development increased the utility of the aircraft and its variants to allow it to perform a number of unique tasks including the HC 123B which operated with the USCG fitted with additional radar equipment for search and rescue missions through 1971 and the C 123J which were fitted with retractable skis for operations in Greenland and Alaska on compacted snow runways ",
