			"after": " In 2001 Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries Of the 81 Tyrannosaurus foot bones examined in the study one was found to have a stress fracture while none of the 10 hand bones were found to have stress fractures The researchers found tendon avulsions only among Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus An avulsion injury left a divot on the humerus of Sue the T rex apparently located at the origin of the deltoid or teres major muscles The presence of avulsion injuries being limited to the forelimb and shoulder in both Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex and functionally different from those of birds The researchers concluded that Sue s tendon avulsion was probably obtained from struggling prey The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions in general provide evidence for a very active predation based diet rather than obligate scavenging 149 ",
