			"previous": " Sherman started training race horses in 1979 1 Prior to 2014 Sherman had 10 graded stakes winners 9 four of whom trained in conjunction with his son Alan were Grade 1 stakes winners 6 These included Lykatill Hill who won back to back Governor s Handicaps at the California State Fair in 1996 and 1997 4 2011 Clement L Hirsch Stakes winner Ultra Blend Haimish Hy winner of the 2010 Hollywood Derby 2007 Citation Handicap winner Lang Field and Siren Lure winner of the 2006 Triple Bend Invitational Handicap 9 For many years he trained 50 horses at a time but downsized to about 17 in the 2010s 5 As of 2014 update his stable is located at Los Alamitos Race Course in Orange County California 4 Sherman s horses have started more than 12 000 races with more than 2 100 wins and 38 million of prize money 1 He has stated that no horse can be trained precisely the same way as another and credits his background as a jockey in helping him train I ve been around and I ve rode so many horses and I think because of that it s helped me tremendously 6 ",
			"after": " California Chrome owners Perry Martin and Steve Coburn chose Sherman to train their horse because he s old school He s a regular guy He can spend quality time with every horse 4 In December 2013 California Chrome won the King Glorious Stakes the final stakes race at Hollywood Park Racetrack the same track Sherman had his first win as a jockey 5 Sherman subsequently led the horse to a four race winning streak heading into the 2014 Kentucky Derby including a decisive win in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby That record made California Chrome the pre race favorite in the 2014 Kentucky Derby but there were still many doubters due to the horse s modest pedigree and Sherman s inexperience at the sport s highest stage 6 For Sherman it was his first horse as trainer in the Derby 4 ",
