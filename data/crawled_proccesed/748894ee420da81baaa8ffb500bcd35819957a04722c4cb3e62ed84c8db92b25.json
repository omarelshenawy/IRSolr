			"after": " Sound recording and reproduction is an electrical or mechanical inscription and re creation of sound waves such as spoken voice singing instrumental music or sound effects The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small microphone diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure acoustic sound waves and record them as a graphic representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a phonograph in which a stylus senses grooves on a record In magnetic tape recording the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying electric current which is then converted to a varying magnetic field by an electromagnet which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process with a bigger loudspeaker diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves Electronically generated sound waves may also be recorded directly from devices such as an electric guitar pickup or a synthesizer without the use of acoustics in the recording process other than the need for musicians to hear how well they are playing during recording sessions ",
