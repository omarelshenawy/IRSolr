			"previous": " The Gaelic Irish both men and women 28 took great pride in their long hair for example a person could be heavily fined for cutting a man s hair short against his will 29 When the Anglo Normans and the English colonized Ireland hair length came to signify one s allegiance Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage Likewise English colonists who wore their hair long in the back were deemed to be forsaking their role as English subjects and giving in to the Irish life Thus hair length was one of the most common ways of judging a true Englishman in this period Muslims in Christian areas were ordered to keep their hair short and parted as their longer style was considered rebellious and barbaric 30 ",
			"after": " The long hair tradition was widespread among English and French men in the 11th and 12th centuries though it was considered mostly because of endorsement of the Roman Catholic Church acceptable for men also to have shorter hair The tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle causing the people to follow Wulfstan a religious leader worried that those with longer hair would fight like women and be unable to protect England from foreign invasion This idea can be found in later military leaders as well such as those of the American Confederacy 31 Knights and rulers would also sometimes cut or pull out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning and a squire s hair was generally shorter than a knight s Married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon as this was normally reserved for the unwed although they were allowed to let it out in mourning to show their distressed state Through these centuries it was expected of Eastern Christians to wear long hair as well as long beards which was especially expected from clergy and monks ",
