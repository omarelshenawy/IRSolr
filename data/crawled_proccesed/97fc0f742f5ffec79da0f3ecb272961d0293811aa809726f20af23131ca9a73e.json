			"after": " The bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food but will eat heavily when prey is abundant During lean periods it will often prey on larger animals it can kill and return to feed on later The bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing it with a short chase or pounce Its preference is for mammals weighing about 1 5 to 12 5 lb 0 68 to 5 67 kg Its main prey varies by region In the eastern United States it is the eastern cottontail species and in the north it is the snowshoe hare When these prey species exist together as in New England they are the primary food sources of the bobcat In the far south the rabbits and hare are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source Birds up to the size of a swan are also taken along with their fledglings and eggs The bobcat is an opportunistic predator that unlike the more specialized Canadian lynx will readily vary its prey selection 26 Diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat s principal prey the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet 35 ",
