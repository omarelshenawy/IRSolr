			"previous": " Reliability modelling is the process of predicting or understanding the reliability of a component or system prior to its implementation Two types of analysis that are often used to model a complete system availability including effects from logistics issues like spare part provisioning transport and manpower behavior are Fault Tree Analysis and reliability block diagrams On component level the same type of analysis can be used together with others The input for the models can come from many sources Testing Earlier operational experience field data or data handbooks from the same or mixed industries can be used In all cases the data must be used with great caution as predictions are only valid in case the same product in the same context is used Often predictions are only made to compare alternatives ",
