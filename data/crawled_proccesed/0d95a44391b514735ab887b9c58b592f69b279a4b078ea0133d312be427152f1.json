			"previous": " The cockpit has two seats arranged in tandem outfitted with Martin Baker GRU 7A rocket propelled ejection seats rated from zero altitude and zero airspeed up to 450 knots 37 The canopy is spacious and fitted with four mirrors to provide effectively all round visibility Only the pilot has flight controls the flight instruments themselves are of a hybrid analog digital nature 15 The cockpit also features a head up display HUD to show primarily navigational information several other avionics systems such as communications and direction finders are integrated into the AWG 9 radar s display A significant feature of the F 14 was its Central Air Data Computer CADC designed by Garrett AiResearch that formed the onboard integrated flight control system It used a MOSFET based Large Scale Integration chipset the MP944 making it possibly the first microprocessor in history 38 ",
			"after": " The nose of the aircraft is large because it contains a two person crew and several bulky avionics systems The main element is the Hughes AN AWG 9 X band radar the antenna is a 36 in 91 cm wide planar array and has integrated Identification friend or foe antennas The AWG 9 has several search and tracking modes such as Track while scan TWS Range While Search RWS Pulse Doppler Single Target Track PDSTT and Jam Angle Track JAT a maximum of 24 targets can be tracked simultaneously and six can be engaged in TWS mode up to around 60 mi 97 km Cruise missiles are also possible targets with the AWG 9 which can lock onto and track small objects even at low altitude when in Pulse Doppler mode 15 For the F 14D the AWG 9 was replaced by the upgraded APG 71 radar The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System JTIDS Link 16 for data communications was added later on 39 ",
