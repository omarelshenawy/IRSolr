			"previous": " The scientific method seeks to explain the events of nature in a reproducible way 57 An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony also known as Occam s Razor and are generally expected to seek consilience fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena 58 This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought as proof that no tampering has occurred Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress 59 60 This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline in the observational sciences such as astronomy or geology a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships to avoid the correlation fallacy ",
			"after": " When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory it is either modified or discarded 61 If the hypothesis survived testing it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory This is a logically reasoned self consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis commonly a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses In that vein theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses In addition to testing hypotheses scientists may also generate a model based on observed phenomena This is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested 62 ",
