			"after": " Installation of vortex generators can usually bring about a slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane 4 and therefore reduce the required one engine inoperative climb performance The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements 8 An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a maximum zero fuel weight or if a maximum zero fuel weight is already specified as one of the airplane s limitations by specifying a new higher maximum zero fuel weight 8 For these reasons vortex generator kits for many light twin engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum zero fuel weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight 8 ",
