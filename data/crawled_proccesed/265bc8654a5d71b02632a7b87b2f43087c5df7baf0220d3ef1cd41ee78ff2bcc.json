			"after": " As with many Southern California rivers the Santa Ana is heavily polluted and used The main stem above Seven Oaks Dam is free flowing as are many of its upper tributaries Once the river enters the Inland Empire basin however much of its flow is diverted for municipal and agricultural water use Most of the flow in the river below the city of San Bernardino consists of effluent from 45 wastewater treatment plants and dry season urban runoff which is collected behind Prado Dam 64 Any flow that makes it downstream to Orange County is diverted by another pair of dams into approximately 1 100 acres 4 5 km2 of groundwater recharge basins providing approximately 218 000 acre feet 269 000 000 m3 of municipal water for the county every year or one third of its water supply 65 Downstream of that dam the river gathers further urban runoff before finally making it into the Pacific 16 The Santa Ana River is included on the U S Environmental Protection Agency s EPA list of 304 l toxic hot spots list of impaired waterways 64 ",
