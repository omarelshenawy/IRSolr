			"after": " The tigress is a solid cast statuette weighing 480 grams 17 oz and measuring 15 9 cm 6 3 in from head to tail She was designed to be soldered onto some other object as its handle traces of tin were found beneath her rear paws which have a smoothly concave curve 73 She looks most aesthetically pleasing when the serpentine curves of her head back rump and tail form a line at an angle of about 45 when the rear paws are flat allowing for their curve 74 Her gender is obvious as there are six engorged teats under her belly She is carefully decorated on her back but her underside is quite perfunctorily finished 75 Her stripes are represented by two engraved lines with a black niello inlay between them in most places not meeting the engraved lines Neither her elongated body nor the distribution of the stripes are accurate for the species she has a long dorsal stripe running from the skull along the spine to the start of the tail which is typical of tabby cats rather than tigers The figure has no stripes around her tail which thickens at the end suggesting a thick fur tip as in a lion s tail which tigers do not have although Roman art usually gives them one 75 ",
