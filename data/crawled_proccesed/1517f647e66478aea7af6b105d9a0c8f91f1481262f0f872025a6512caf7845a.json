			"after": " Mechanical or manually operated flight control systems are the most basic method of controlling an aircraft They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive Very early aircraft such as the Wright Flyer I Bl riot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube which only had a hinged pivoting rudder in addition to the warping operated pitch and roll controls 5 A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods tension cables pulleys counterweights and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system 6 ",
