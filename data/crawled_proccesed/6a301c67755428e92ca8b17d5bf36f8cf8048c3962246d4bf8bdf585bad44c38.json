			"previous": " On the evening of the 29 May the theatre was packed Gustav Linor reported Never has the hall been so full or so resplendent the stairways and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear 58 The evening began with Les Sylphides in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles 54 The Rite followed Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction and grew into a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in Augurs of Spring But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts it was not Stravinsky s music that did the shocking It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky 59 Marie Rambert who was working as an assistant to Nijinsky recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage 60 In his autobiography Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings The demonstrations he says grew into a terrific uproar which along with the on stage noises drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers 56 The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got carried away with excitement and began to beat rhythmically on top of my head though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first his own emotion being so great 61 ",
			"after": " Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions in the audience began attacking each other but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra Everything available was tossed in our direction but we continued to play on Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected possibly with the intervention of the police although this is uncorroborated Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II and by some accounts Maria Piltz s rendering of the final Sacrificial Dance was watched in reasonable silence At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers for Monteux and the orchestra and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening s programme continued 62 ",
