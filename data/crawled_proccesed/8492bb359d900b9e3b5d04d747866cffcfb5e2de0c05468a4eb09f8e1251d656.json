			"previous": " A prominent model was introduced by Piero Caldirola in 1980 In Caldirola s model one chronon corresponds to about 6 27 10 24 seconds for an electron 4 This is much longer than the Planck time which is only about 5 39 10 44 seconds The Planck time is a theoretical lower bound on the length of time that could exist between two connected events but it is not a quantization of time itself since there is no requirement that the time between two events be separated by a discrete number of Planck times For example ordered pairs of events A B and B C could each be separated by slightly more than 1 Planck time this would produce a measurement limit of 1 Planck time between A and B or B and C but a limit of 3 Planck times between A and C citation needed Additionally the Planck time is a universal quantization of time itself whereas the chronon is a quantization of the evolution in a system along its world line Consequently the value of the chronon like other quantized observables in quantum mechanics is a function of the system under consideration particularly its boundary conditions 5 The value for the chronon 0 is calculated from ",
			"after": " From this formula it can be seen that the nature of the moving particle being considered must be specified since the value of the chronon depends on the particle s charge and mass ",
