			"previous": " Several species of cockatoo can be serious agricultural pests 81 They are sometimes controlled by shooting poisoning or capture followed by gassing Non lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring habitat manipulation and the provision of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but in suburbia they may chew outdoor furniture door and window frames 51 soft decorative timbers such as Western Red Cedar are readily demolished 82 Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters 51 television antennae and satellite dishes 82 A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows 83 Galahs and red tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere 83 Outside Australia the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops 84 ",
			"after": " In 1995 the Government of the state of Victoria published a report on problems caused by long billed corellas sulphur crested cockatoos and galahs three species which along with the little corella have large and growing populations having benefited from anthropogenic changes to the landscape Subsequent to the findings and publication of the report these three species were declared unprotected by a Governor in Council Order under certain conditions and are allowed to be destroyed where serious damage is being caused by them to trees vineyards orchards recreational reserves and commercial crops 85 Damage covered by the report included not only that to cereal crops fruit and nut orchards and some kinds of vegetable crops but also to houses and communications equipment 86 The little corella is a declared pest of agriculture in Western Australia where it is an aviculturally introduced species The birds damage sorghum maize sunflower chickpeas and other crops They also defoliate amenity trees in parks and gardens dig for edible roots and corms on sports grounds and race tracks as well as chew wiring and household fittings 87 In South Australia where flocks can number several thousand birds and the species is listed as unprotected they are accused of defoliating red gums and other native or ornamental trees used for roosting damaging tarpaulins on grain bunkers wiring and flashing on buildings taking grain from newly seeded paddocks and creating a noise nuisance 88 ",
