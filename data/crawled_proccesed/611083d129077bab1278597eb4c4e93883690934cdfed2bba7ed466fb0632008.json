			"after": " When Richter resigned as head of the Vienna Philharmonic subscription concerts in September 1898 n 5 the concerts committee had unanimously chosen Mahler as his successor 78 The appointment was not universally welcomed the anti Semitic press wondered if as a non German Mahler would be capable of defending German music 79 Attendances rose sharply in Mahler s first season but members of the orchestra were particularly resentful of his habit of re scoring acknowledged masterpieces and of his scheduling of extra rehearsals for works with which they were thoroughly familiar 58 An attempt by the orchestra to have Richter reinstated for the 1899 season failed because Richter was not interested Mahler s position was weakened when in 1900 he took the orchestra to Paris to play at the Exposition Universelle The Paris concerts were poorly attended and lost money Mahler had to borrow the orchestra s fare home from the Rothschilds 80 81 In April 1901 dogged by a recurrence of ill health and wearied by more complaints from the orchestra Mahler relinquished the Philharmonic concerts conductorship 67 In his three seasons he had performed around 80 different works which included pieces by relatively unknown composers such as Hermann Goetz Wilhelm Kienzl and the Italian Lorenzo Perosi 80 ",
