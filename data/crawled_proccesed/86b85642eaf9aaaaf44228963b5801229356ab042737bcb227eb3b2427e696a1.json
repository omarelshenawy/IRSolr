			"after": " The king vulture inhabits an estimated 14 million km2 5 4 million mi2 between southern Mexico and northern Argentina 35 In South America it does not live west of the Andes 29 except in western Ecuador 36 north western Colombia and far north western Venezuela 37 It primarily inhabits undisturbed tropical lowland forests as well as savannas and grasslands with these forests nearby 38 It is often seen near swamps or marshy places in the forests 10 This bird is often the most numerous or only vulture present in primary lowland forests in its range but in the Amazon rainforest it is typically outnumbered by the greater yellow headed vulture while typically outnumbered by the lesser yellow headed turkey and American black vulture in more open habitats 39 King vultures generally do not live above 1500 m 5000 ft although are found in places at 2500 m 8000 ft altitude east of the Andes and have been rarely recorded up to 3300 m 10000 ft 26 They inhabit the emergent forest level or above the canopy 3 Pleistocene remains have been recovered from Buenos Aires Province in central Argentina over 700 km 450 mi south of its current range giving rise to speculation on the habitat there at the time which had not been thought to be suitable 40 ",
