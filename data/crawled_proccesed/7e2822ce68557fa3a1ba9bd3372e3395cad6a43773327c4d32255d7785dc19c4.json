			"previous": " Johnson left for London with his former pupil David Garrick on 2 March 1737 the day Johnson s brother died He was penniless and pessimistic about their travel but fortunately for them Garrick had connections in London and the two were able to stay with his distant relative Richard Norris 62 Johnson soon moved to Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene 63 On 12 July 1737 he wrote to Edward Cave with a proposal for a translation of Paolo Sarpi s The History of the Council of Trent 1619 which Cave did not accept until months later 64 In October 1737 Johnson brought his wife to London and he found employment with Cave as a writer for The Gentleman s Magazine 65 His assignments for the magazine and other publishers during this time were almost unparalleled in range and variety and so numerous so varied and scattered that Johnson himself could not make a complete list 66 The name Columbia a poetic name for America coined by Johnson first appears in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament in The Gentlemen s Magazine ",
			"after": " In May 1738 his first major work the poem London was published anonymously 67 Based on Juvenal s Satire III it describes the character Thales leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London 68 which is portrayed as a place of crime corruption and poverty Johnson could not bring himself to regard the poem as earning him any merit as a poet 69 Alexander Pope said that the author will soon be d terr unearthed dug up but this would not happen until 15 years later 67 ",
