			"previous": " On the campus of the University of Chicago in December 1967 25 years to the minute 27 after the team of physicists led by Enrico Fermi achieved the first controlled self sustaining nuclear chain reaction Moore s Nuclear Energy was unveiled on the site of what was once the university s football field stands in the rackets court beneath which the experiments had taken place 28 This 12 foot tall piece in the middle of a large open plaza is often thought to represent a mushroom cloud topped by a massive human skull but Moore s interpretation was very different He once told a friend that he hoped viewers would go around it looking out through the open spaces and that they may have a feeling of being in a cathedral 29 In Chicago Illinois Moore also commemorated science with a large bronze sundial locally named Man Enters the Cosmos 1980 which was commissioned to recognise the space exploration program 30 ",
			"after": " The last three decades of Moore s life continued in a similar vein several major retrospectives took place around the world notably a very prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the Forte di Belvedere overlooking Florence Following the pioneering documentary Henry Moore produced by John Read in 1951 he appeared in many films In 1964 for instance Moore was featured in the documentary 5 British Sculptors Work and Talk by American filmmaker Warren Forma By the end of the 1970s there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work The number of commissions continued to increase he completed Knife Edge Two Piece in 1962 for College Green near the Houses of Parliament in London According to Moore When I was offered the site near the House of Lords I liked the place so much that I didn t bother to go and see an alternative site in Hyde Park one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park The House of Lords site is quite different It is next to a path where people walk and it has a few seats where they can sit and contemplate it 31 ",
