			"previous": " Banff National Park is managed by Parks Canada under the National Parks Act which was passed in 1930 Over time park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development In 1964 a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics environmental groups became more influential leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy which emphasized conservation In 1988 the National Parks Act was amended making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority The amendment also paved the way for non governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court for breaches in adhering to the act In 1994 Parks Canada established revised Guiding Principles and Operating Policies which included a mandate for the Banff Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations 6 As with other national parks Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan On a provincial level the park area and the included communities other than the Town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as Improvement District No 9 Banff 40 ",
