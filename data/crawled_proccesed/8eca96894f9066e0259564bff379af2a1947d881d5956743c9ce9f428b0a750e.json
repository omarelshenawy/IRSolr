			"previous": " Johnson s thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism or elegance of style 187 Although a smaller edition of his Dictionary became the standard household dictionary Johnson s original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used especially in literary works To achieve this purpose Johnson included quotations from Bacon Hooker Milton Shakespeare Spenser and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields natural science philosophy poetry and theology These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context 188 ",
			"after": " Johnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature Instead he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature 189 When it came to Shakespeare s plays Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers it is to be imputed to the nature of his work which required the use of common colloquial language and consequently admitted many phrases allusive elliptical and proverbial such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them 190 ",
