			"after": " Stereophonic sound or more commonly stereo is a method of sound reproduction that creates an illusion of directionality and audible perspective This is usually achieved by using two or more independent audio channels through a configuration of two or more loudspeakers or stereo headphones in such a way as to create the impression of sound heard from various directions as in natural hearing 1 Thus the term stereophonic applies to so called quadraphonic and surround sound systems as well as the more common two channel two speaker systems It is often contrasted with monophonic or mono sound where audio is heard as coming from one position often centered in the sound field analogous to a visual field Stereo sound is now common in entertainment systems such as broadcast radio and TV recorded music and the cinema ",
