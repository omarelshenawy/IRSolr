			"previous": " The Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious city planning 74 In the early 17th century when immigration was at a peak a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half circles of canals with their ends emerging at the IJ bay Known as the Grachtengordel three of the canals were mostly for residential development the Herengracht where Heren refers to Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam ruling lords of Amsterdam and gracht means canal so the name can be roughly translated as Canal of the lords Keizersgracht Emperor s Canal and Prinsengracht Prince s Canal 75 The fourth and outermost canal is the Singelgracht which is often not mentioned on maps because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal Singel The canals served for defence water management and transport The defences took the form of a moat and earthen dikes with gates at transit points but otherwise no masonry superstructures 76 The original plans have been lost so historians such as Ed Taverne need to speculate on the original intentions it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental 77 ",
			"after": " Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east across the breadth of the layout like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian Geert Mak calls it and not from the centre outwards as a popular myth has it The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656 Subsequently the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly The eastern part of the concentric canal plan covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay has never been implemented In the following centuries the land was used for parks senior citizens homes theatres other public facilities and waterways without much planning 78 ",
