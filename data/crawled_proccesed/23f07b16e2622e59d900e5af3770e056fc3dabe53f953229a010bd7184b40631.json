			"after": " Pultrusion is a manufacturing method used to make strong lightweight composite materials In pultrusion material is pulled through forming machinery using either a hand over hand method or a continuous roller method as opposed to extrusion where the material is pushed through dies In fiberglass pultrusion fibers the glass material are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin They are then typically heat treated and cut to length Fiberglass produced this way can be made in a variety of shapes and cross sections such as W or S cross sections ",
