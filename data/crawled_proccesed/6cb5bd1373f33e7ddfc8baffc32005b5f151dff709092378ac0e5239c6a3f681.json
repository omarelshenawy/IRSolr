			"previous": " Antarctica is the coldest of Earth s continents The coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was 89 2 C 128 6 F at the Soviet now Russian Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983 47 For comparison this is 11 C 20 F colder than subliming dry ice at one atmosphere of partial pressure but since CO2 only makes up 0 039 of air temperatures of less than 150 C would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica Antarctica is a frozen desert with little precipitation the South Pole itself receives less than 10 cm 4 in per year on average Temperatures reach a minimum of between 80 C 112 F and 90 C 130 F in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between 5 C 41 F and 15 C 59 F near the coast in summer Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it Given the latitude long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world 48 ",
			"after": " East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent leaving the center cold and dry Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent ice there lasts for extended periods Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent where snowfalls of up to 1 22 metres 48 in in 48 hours have been recorded ",
