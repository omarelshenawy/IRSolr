			"after": " The scientific method involves the proposal and testing of hypotheses by deriving predictions from the hypotheses about the results of future experiments then performing those experiments to see whether the predictions are valid This provides evidence either for or against the hypothesis When enough experimental results have been gathered in a particular area of inquiry scientists may propose an explanatory framework that accounts for as many of these as possible This explanation is also tested and if it fulfills the necessary criteria see above then the explanation becomes a theory This can take many years as it can be difficult or complicated to gather sufficient evidence ",
