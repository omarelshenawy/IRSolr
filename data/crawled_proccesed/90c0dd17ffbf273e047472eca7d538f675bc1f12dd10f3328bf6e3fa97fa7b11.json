			"previous": " The abrupt end to Thucydides s narrative which breaks off in the middle of the year 411 BC has traditionally been interpreted as indicating that he died while writing the book although other explanations have been put forward ",
			"after": " Inferences about Thucydides s character can only be drawn with due caution from his book His sardonic sense of humour is evident throughout as when during his description of the Athenian plague he remarks that old Athenians seemed to remember a rhyme which said that with the Dorian War would come a great death Some claimed that the rhyme was actually about a death by famine or starvation limos Greek 18 and was only remembered as death by pestilence loimos Greek 19 due to the current plague Thucydides then remarks that should another Dorian War come this time attended with a great dearth the rhyme will be remembered as dearth and any mention of death forgotten 20 ",
