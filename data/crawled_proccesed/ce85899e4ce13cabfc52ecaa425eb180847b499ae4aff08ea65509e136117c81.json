			"previous": " Whitman wrote in the preface to the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it He believed there was a vital symbiotic relationship between the poet and society 106 This connection was emphasized especially in Song of Myself by using an all powerful first person narration 107 As an American epic it deviated from the historic use of an elevated hero and instead assumed the identity of the common people 108 Leaves of Grass also responded to the impact that recent urbanization in the United States had on the masses 109 ",
			"after": " Whitman was a vocal proponent of temperance and in his youth rarely drank alcohol He once stated he did not taste strong liquor until he was thirty 110 and occasionally argued for prohibition 111 One of his earliest long fiction works the novel Franklin Evans or The Inebriate first published November 23 1842 is a temperance novel 112 Whitman wrote the novel at the height of popularity of the Washingtonian movement though the movement itself was plagued with contradictions as was Franklin Evans 113 Years later Whitman claimed he was embarrassed by the book 114 and called it a damned rot 115 He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was under the influence of alcohol himself 116 Even so he wrote other pieces recommending temperance including The Madman and a short story Reuben s Last Wish 117 Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol enjoying local wines and champagne 118 ",
