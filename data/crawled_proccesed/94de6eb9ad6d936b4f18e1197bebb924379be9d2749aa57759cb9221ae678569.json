			"previous": " As already mentioned the lexicographical work of Zodhiates says that in the second of these two cases Mark 7 4 the verb baptizein indicates that after coming from the market the Pharisees washed their hands by immersing them in collected water 72 Balz Schneider understand the meaning of used in place of sprinkle to be the same as to dip or immerse 75 76 77 a verb used of the partial dipping of a morsel held in the hand into wine or of a finger into spilled blood 78 ",
			"after": " A possible additional use of the verb baptizein to relate to ritual washing is suggested by Peter Leithart 2007 who suggests that Paul s phrase Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead 79 relates to Jewish ritual washing 80 In Jewish Greek the verb baptizein baptized has a wider reference than just baptism and in Jewish context primarily applies to the masculine noun baptismos ritual washing 81 The verb baptizein occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of ritual washing baptismos Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity Naaman washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy etc 82 Additionally in the New Testament only the verb baptizein can also relate to the neuter noun baptisma baptism which is a neologism unknown in the Septuagint and other pre Christian Jewish texts 83 This broadness in the meaning of baptizein is reflected in English Bibles rendering wash where Jewish ritual washing is meant for example Mark 7 4 states that the Pharisees except they wash Greek baptize they do not eat 84 and baptize where baptisma the new Christian rite is intended ",
