			"after": " The American Historical Revue and Motion Picture Industry Exposition was open from July 2 to August 4 1923 The fair was located off of Figueroa Street in Exposition Park just to the east of the brand new Los Angeles Coliseum where every evening a complimentary show for exposition visitors Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs was given Admission to the fair was fifty cents though fairgoers could purchase a coin for a dollar at the box office and enter without further charge After the first week organizers realized the public was not interested in the historical theme but was there to see favorite movie stars Exhibitors accordingly greatly expanded the space devoted to movie attractions but the exposition was a financial failure Those in charge of the fair had hoped to attract a million visitors the actual attendance was about 300 000 many of whom were teenagers given complimentary admission in the final two weeks of the fair 18 19 20 With the fair flirting with insolvency throughout its run officials hoped the planned visit of President Warren Harding on August 6 would increase gate receipts but Harding fell ill in San Francisco and died on August 2 20 According to Pike in his article its effect on the industry was hard to measure However if Hollywood owes its current status in any way to the event then it was quite a success indeed 7 ",
