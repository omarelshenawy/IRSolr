			"previous": " Activity was reflected with a high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ACE rating of 177 1 ACE is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high ACEs ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength 2 ",
			"after": " Along a diffuse front a broad area of low pressure in association with an upper level low pressure was noted several hundred miles northeast of Puerto Rico on June 8 After reformation of a low level circulation it is estimated that Tropical Depression One developed at 18 00 UTC on June 11 while located about 535 mi 860 km southeast of Bermuda Initially the system resembled a subtropical cyclone due to its frontal characteristics After developing on June 11 the depression almost immediately began to drift a motion which lasted about 24 hours The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene at 12 00 UTC on June 12 3 ",
