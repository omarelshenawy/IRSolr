			"previous": " Surface mining is done by removing stripping surface vegetation dirt and if necessary layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits Techniques of surface mining include open pit mining which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground quarrying or gathering building materials from an open pit mine clarification needed strip mining which consists of stripping surface layers off to reveal ore seams underneath and mountaintop removal commonly associated with coal mining which involves taking the top of a mountain off to reach ore deposits at depth Most but not all placer deposits because of their shallowly buried nature are mined by surface methods Finally landfill mining involves sites where landfills are excavated and processed 29 ",
