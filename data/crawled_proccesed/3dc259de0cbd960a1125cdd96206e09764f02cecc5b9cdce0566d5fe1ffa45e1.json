			"previous": " For the next decade the Savoy Operas as the series came to be known after the theatre Carte later built to house them were Gilbert s principal activity The successful comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two several of them being among the longest running productions up to that point in the history of the musical stage 57 After Pinafore came The Pirates of Penzance 1879 Patience 1881 Iolanthe 1882 Princess Ida 1884 based on Gilbert s earlier farce The Princess The Mikado 1885 Ruddigore 1887 The Yeomen of the Guard 1888 and The Gondoliers 1889 Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works but he actually designed the costumes himself for Patience Iolanthe Princess Ida and Ruddigore 58 He insisted on precise and authentic sets and costumes which provided a foundation to ground and focus his absurd characters and situations 59 ",
			"after": " During this time Gilbert and Sullivan also collaborated on one other major work the oratorio The Martyr of Antioch premiered at the Leeds music festival in October 1880 Gilbert arranged the original epic poem by Henry Hart Milman into a libretto suitable for the music and it contains some original work During this period also Gilbert occasionally wrote plays to be performed elsewhere both serious dramas for example The Ne er Do Weel 1878 and Gretchen 1879 and humorous works for example Foggerty s Fairy 1881 However he no longer needed to turn out multiple plays each year as he had done before Indeed during the more than nine years that separated The Pirates of Penzance and The Gondoliers he wrote just three plays outside of the partnership with Sullivan 29 Only one of these works Comedy and Tragedy proved successful 60 ",
