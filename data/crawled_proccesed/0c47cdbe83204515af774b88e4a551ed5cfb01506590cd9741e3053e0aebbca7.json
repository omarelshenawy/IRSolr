			"previous": " An algebraic number is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation with rational coefficients for example every solution of say is an algebraic number Fields of algebraic numbers are also called algebraic number fields or shortly number fields Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields 81 Thus analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap the former is defined by its methods the latter by its objects of study ",
			"after": " The grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century when ideal numbers the theory of ideals and valuation theory were developed these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields For example in the field generated by the rationals and the number can be factorised both as and all of and are irreducible and thus in a na ve sense analogous to primes among the integers The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers by Kummer seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws 82 i e generalisations of quadratic reciprocity ",
