			"previous": " Gamma delta T cells T cells possess an alternative T cell receptor TCR as opposed to CD4 and CD8 T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells cytotoxic T cells and NK cells The conditions that produce responses from T cells are not fully understood Like other unconventional T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs such as CD1d restricted Natural Killer T cells T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity 58 On one hand T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype On the other hand the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors For example large numbers of human V 9 V 2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes and highly restricted V 1 T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells 51 ",
