			"previous": " Significant Tamil emigration began in the 18th century when the British colonial government sent many poor Tamils as indentured labourers to far off parts of the Empire especially Malaya South Africa Fiji Mauritius and the Caribbean At about the same time many Tamil businessmen also migrated to other parts of the British Empire particularly to Burma and East Africa 97 ",
			"after": " Many Tamils still live in these countries and the Tamil communities in Singapore Reunion Island Malaysia and South Africa have retained much of their original culture and language Many Malaysian children attend Tamil schools and a significant portion of Tamil children are brought up with Tamil as their first language In Singapore Mauritius and Reunion Tamil students learn Tamil as their second language in school with English as the first In Singapore to preserve the Tamil language the government has made it an official language despite Tamils comprising only about 5 of the population and has also introduced compulsory instruction of the language for Tamils Other Tamil communities such as those in South Africa and Fiji no longer speak Tamil as a first language but still retain a strong Tamil identity and are able to understand the language while most elders speak it as a first language 98 There is a very small Tamil community in Pakistan notably settled since the partition in 1947 99 ",
