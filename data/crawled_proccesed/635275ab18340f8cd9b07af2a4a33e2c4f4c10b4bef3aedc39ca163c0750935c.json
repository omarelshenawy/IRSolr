			"previous": " World War II fighters also increasingly featured monocoque construction which improved their aerodynamic efficiency while also adding structural strength Laminar flow wings which improved high speed performance also came into use on fighters such as the P 51 while the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the Messerschmitt Me 163 featured swept wings that dramatically reduced drag at high subsonic speeds ",
			"after": " Armament also advanced during the war The rifle caliber machine guns that were common on prewar fighters could not easily down the more rugged warplanes of the era Air forces began to replace or supplement them with cannons which fired explosive shells that could blast a hole in an enemy aircraft rather than relying on kinetic energy from a solid bullet striking a critical component of the aircraft such as a fuel line or control cable or the pilot Cannons could bring down even heavy bombers with just a few hits but their slower rate of fire made it difficult to hit fast moving fighters in a dogfight Eventually most fighters mounted cannons sometimes in combination with machine guns ",
