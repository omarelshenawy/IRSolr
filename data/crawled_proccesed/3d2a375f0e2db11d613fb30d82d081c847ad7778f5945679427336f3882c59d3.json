			"previous": " Europe is a peninsula that makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass 20 It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent 165 Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean Black and Caspian Seas to the south 166 Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas The southern regions are more mountainous while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps Pyrenees and Carpathians through hilly uplands into broad low northern plains which are vast in the east This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain and at its heart lies the North German Plain An arc of uplands also exists along the north western seaboard which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland and then continues along the mountainous fjord cut spine of Norway ",
			"after": " This description is simplified Sub regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features as does mainland Central Europe itself where the relief contains many plateaus river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend Sub regions like Iceland Britain and Ireland are special cases The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off ",
