			"previous": " Shakespeare s early classical and Italianate comedies containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences give way in the mid 1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies 92 A Midsummer Night s Dream is a witty mixture of romance fairy magic and comic lowlife scenes 93 Shakespeare s next comedy the equally romantic Merchant of Venice contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences 94 The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing 95 the charming rural setting of As You Like It and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare s sequence of great comedies 96 After the lyrical Richard II written almost entirely in verse Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s Henry IV parts 1 and 2 and Henry V His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes prose and poetry and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work 97 This period begins and ends with two tragedies Romeo and Juliet the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence love and death 98 and Julius Caesar based on Sir Thomas North s 1579 translation of Plutarch s Parallel Lives which introduced a new kind of drama 99 According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro in Julius Caesar the various strands of politics character inwardness contemporary events even Shakespeare s own reflections on the act of writing began to infuse each other 100 ",
			"after": " In the early 17th century Shakespeare wrote the so called problem plays Measure for Measure Troilus and Cressida and All s Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies 101 Many critics believe that Shakespeare s greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art The titular hero of one of Shakespeare s most famous tragedies Hamlet has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character especially for his famous soliloquy which begins To be or not to be that is the question 102 Unlike the introverted Hamlet whose fatal flaw is hesitation the heroes of the tragedies that followed Othello and King Lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement 103 The plots of Shakespeare s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves 104 In Othello the villain Iago stokes Othello s sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him 105 In King Lear the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear s youngest daughter Cordelia According to the critic Frank Kermode the play offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty 106 In Macbeth the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare s tragedies 107 uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn 108 In this play Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure His last major tragedies Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus contain some of Shakespeare s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T S Eliot 109 ",
