			"previous": " Concurrently with designing churches and building railways Sharpe was heavily involved in the civic life of Lancaster particularly in pioneering sanitary reform By political persuasion he was a Conservative and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association 128 He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841 a post he held for ten years and in 1843 was appointed the town council s representative on the local Police Commission He was also a visitor to the national schools and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year at that time a position more like that of a chief magistrate 129 130 Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town and resolved to improve it 129 The town was overcrowded it suffered from poor housing open sewers overflowing cesspits and a very poor water supply mainly from wells polluted by infiltration Many people suffered from typhus 131 and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera 132 The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title including cleansing lighting and watching the town 133 However there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849 133 The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health 134 ",
			"after": " Before during and after his mayoralty Sharpe played a major role in promoting sanitary reform often meeting considerable opposition and needing to use his oratorical political and persuasive skills to the full 135 A campaign to deal with the problems had been initiated in 1847 by two Lancaster doctors Thomas Howitt and Edward Denis de Vitre Sharpe joined them drawing extensively on his experience of having accompanied Professor Richard Owen born and educated in Lancaster on his tour of inspection of the town in 1844 136 In 1848 Robert Rawlinson also from Lancaster was appointed as local surveyor 137 and published a further report that recommended new sewers and drains and the construction of a waterworks 138 Although Sharpe agreed in principle with the report he was not satisfied with its details Later that year which was during his mayoralty he travelled to London with the town clerk and a former mayor to meet representatives of the General Board of Health including its chairman Lord Morpeth and its secretary Edwin Chadwick As a result of this meeting the Board of Health appointed James Smith from Scotland as an inspector and commissioned him to produce a further report on Lancaster s problems 139 Smith s investigation took place in January 1849 140 and his report was received in July 141 In his conclusions Smith noted that Lancaster was favourably situated to provide a healthy environment for its inhabitants and that this could be achieved by a complete and constant supply of pure and soft water and a thorough system of drainage and sewerage 141 Subsequently an Act of Parliament gave approval for these measures to be carried out 142 and in 1852 royal assent was given for the waterworks to be constructed 143 Delays disputes and controversies continued 144 until the waterworks was eventually opened in 1855 when work on the drainage and sewage systems was already under way This enabled underground pipes for the two systems to be laid simultaneously 145 Sharpe had played a significant part in arranging Queen Victoria s visit to Lancaster in October 1851 and with Paley designed four triumphal arches for the occasion He also took part in the proceedings on the day escorting the Queen Prince Albert and the Prince of Wales the future King Edward VII to the top of the castle tower 146 ",
