			"previous": " The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia 2 Each of the men is looking at the water in the words of Martin A Berger apparently lost in a contemplative moment 14 Eakins precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work They are from left to right Talcott Williams 1849 1928 Benjamin Fox c 1865 c 1900 John Laurie Wallace 1864 1953 Jesse Godley 1862 1889 Harry the dog Eakins Irish Setter c 1880 90 George Reynolds c 1839 89 and Eakins himself 14 The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill which was razed in 1873 It is the only sign of civilization in the work no shoes clothes or bath houses are visible 4 The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers skin tones contrast ",
			"after": " The composition is pyramidal The figure reclining at left leads the viewer s eye to the seated figure whose gesture in turn points to Godley at the apex of the compositional pyramid The diving figure at right leads to the swimming form of Eakins who painted himself into the scene and whose leftward movement directs attention back into the painting 3 16 Eakins enforces this pyramidal structure by manipulating the focus of the painting the center area containing the swimmers is extremely precise while the outer areas are diffuse with virtually no moderating zones in between 17 The lighting within the picture is unnatural too bright in some places and too dark in others although the effect which tends to accentuate the body lines of the swimmers is generally subtle 17 ",
