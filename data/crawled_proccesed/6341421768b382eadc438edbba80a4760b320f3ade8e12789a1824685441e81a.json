			"previous": " The history of the modern western feminist movements is divided into three waves 24 25 Each wave dealt with different aspects of the same feminist issues The first wave comprised women s suffrage movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries promoting women s right to vote The second wave was associated with the ideas and actions of the women s liberation movement beginning in the 1960s The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women The third wave is a continuation of and a reaction to the perceived failures of second wave feminism beginning in the 1990s 26 ",
			"after": " First wave feminism was a period of activity during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century In the UK and US it focused on the promotion of equal contract marriage parenting and property rights for women By the end of the nineteenth century activism focused primarily on gaining political power particularly the right of women s suffrage though some feminists were active in campaigning for women s sexual reproductive and economic rights as well 27 ",
