			"previous": " A function defined on an interval of the integers is usually called a sequence A sequence could be a finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a discrete dynamical system Such a discrete function could be defined explicitly by a list if its domain is finite or by a formula for its general term or it could be given implicitly by a recurrence relation or difference equation Difference equations are similar to a differential equations but replace differentiation by taking the difference between adjacent terms they can be used to approximate differential equations or more often studied in their own right Many questions and methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations For instance where there are integral transforms in harmonic analysis for studying continuous functions or analog signals there are discrete transforms for discrete functions or digital signals As well as the discrete metric there are more general discrete or finite metric spaces and finite topological spaces ",
