			"previous": " Franklin Township was surveyed in 1803 and settled in November 1805 when John Haymaker and his family moved west from Warren to the banks of the Cuyahoga River They were joined by John s brother George and their father Jacob Haymaker and their families early the next year and built a gristmill in 1807 5 Initial growth in the area was slow but eventually two small villages would develop due to the potential for power generated by the Cuyahoga River that could be used in gristmills and manufacturing The first village known as Franklin Mills or locally as the Lower Village developed mostly around the original Haymaker property In 1818 Joshua Woodard arrived in the area and began constructing buildings just north of the village forming the Upper Village that would come to be known briefly as Carthage 6 ",
			"after": " In the 1820s Franklin Mills was included in the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal P O Canal When construction began on the canal in the mid 1830s land speculation was rampant in many areas of northeast Ohio along the canal including Franklin Mills As a result an industrial and business region was established along the east side of the river in what is now downtown Kent Factories and mills were either planned or constructed along the Cuyahoga River some of which either were never built or ultimately failed due mostly to effects of the Panic of 1837 A lock and attached arch dam however was completed in 1836 7 The canal officially opened in 1840 but would only operate into the 1860s By the 1870s the canal was completely shut down 8 ",
