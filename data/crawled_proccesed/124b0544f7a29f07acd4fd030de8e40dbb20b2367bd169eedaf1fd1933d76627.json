			"previous": " The building is cantilevered into a section of 420 million year old limestone bedrock 110 feet 34 m underground It uses 4 foot 1 2 m wide stilt like pillars that were drilled beneath the building Every 30 feet 9 1 m around its perimeter steel reinforced concrete was poured into these holes to form the structural support 10 On top of these caisson shafts and pillars an 8 400 short ton 7 600 t concrete pad foundation was built to support the building s spine 10 The building has 241 caissons and the majority of the caissons only descend 75 feet 23 m into hard clay However 57 of them go an additional 35 feet 11 m into the ground including 6 feet 1 8 m of bedrock 1 The concrete spine uses five I beam shaped walls and exterior columns narrowing to two as the building rises Each floor is separated by a concrete slab and stainless steel glass and aluminum panels are attached to each floor 10 50 000 short tons 45 000 t of reinforcing steel bars called rebar support the hotel 42 105 The extensive use of concrete makes the building more fireproof Of the 600 million construction budget 130 million was earmarked for the James McHugh Construction Co who handled the 180 000 cubic yard 140 000 m3 concrete only portion of the job 77 ",
			"after": " Two earlier business decisions by the Chicago Sun Times led to substantial savings of time and money during the Trump Tower s construction The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb shelter thickness to withstand a Cold War attack and thus did not have to be broken down and rebuilt Furthermore the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum based to soy based ink which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew 1 ",
