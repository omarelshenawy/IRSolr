			"previous": " With the exception of the walrus which has five to six year long inter birth intervals female pinnipeds enter estrous shortly after they give birth 119 All species go through delayed implantation wherein the embryo remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the uterus Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable 119 120 Gestation in seals including delayed implantation typically lasts a year 119 For most species birthing takes place in the spring and summer months 121 Typically single pups are born 119 twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates 120 Pups of most species are born precocial 119 ",
			"after": " Mother pinnipeds have different strategies for maternal care and lactation Phocids such as elephant seals grey seals and hooded seals remain on land or ice and fast during their relatively short lactation period four days for the hooded seal and five weeks for elephant seals The milk of these species consist of up to 60 fat allowing the young to grow fairly quickly In particular northern elephant seal pups gain 4 kg 9 lb each day before they are weaned Some pups may try to steal extra milk from other nursing mothers and gain weight more quickly than others Alloparenting occurs in these fasting species 119 while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups some do accept alien pups with their own 122 ",
