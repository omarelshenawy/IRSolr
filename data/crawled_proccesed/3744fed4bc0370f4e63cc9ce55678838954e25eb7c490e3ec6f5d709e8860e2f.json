			"previous": " After the debut of the first stretched 767s Boeing sought to address airline requests for even more capacity by proposing larger models including a partial double deck version informally named the Hunchback of Mukilteo from a town near Boeing s Everett factory with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage 48 49 In 1986 the manufacturer announced the 767 X a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin but received little interest 49 By 1988 the 767 X had evolved into an all new twinjet which revived the 777 designation 49 Until the 777 s 1995 debut the 767 300 and 767 300ER remained Boeing s second largest wide bodies behind the 747 46 ",
			"after": " Buoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval 767 sales accelerated in the mid to late 1980s with 1989 being the most prolific year with 132 firm orders 40 45 By the early 1990s the wide body twinjet had become its manufacturer s annual best selling aircraft despite a slight decrease due to economic recession 40 During this period the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe 50 By the end of the decade 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined 51 The 767 also propelled the growth of point to point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes 20 52 Taking advantage of the aircraft s lower operating costs and smaller capacity operators added non stop flights to secondary population centers thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights 20 The increase in the number of cities receiving non stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point to point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional hub and spoke model 20 52 ",
