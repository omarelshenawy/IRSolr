			"previous": " The 707 820 was a proposed intercontinental stretched variant of the 707 320B It was to be powered by four Pratt Whitney JT3D 15 turbofan engines and would have had a 10 foot 3 0 m extension in wingspan Two variations were proposed the 707 820 505 model and the 707 820 506 model The 505 model would have had a fuselage 45 feet 14 m longer than the 707 320B and would have carried 209 passengers in mixed class configuration and 260 passengers in all economy configuration The 506 model would have had a fuselage 55 feet 17 m longer than the 707 320B and would have carried 225 passengers in mixed class configuration and 279 passengers in all economy configuration Like the 707 620 the 707 820 was also set to compete with the stretched DC 8s The design was being pitched to American TWA BOAC and Pan Am at the time of its proposal in early 1965 33 The 707 820 would have cost 10 000 000 in US currency 31 Just like the 707 620 the 707 820 would have required a massive structural redesign to the wing and gear structures The 707 820 was also cancelled in 1966 in favor of the 747 32 ",
