			"previous": " The Panavia Tornado is a multirole twin engined aircraft designed to excel at low level penetration of enemy defences The mission envisaged during the Cold War was the delivery of conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe this dictated several significant features of the design Variable wing geometry allowing for minimal drag during the critical low level dash towards a well prepared enemy had been desired from the project s start Advanced navigation and flight computers including the then innovative fly by wire system greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low level flight and eased control of the aircraft 44 45 For long range bombing missions the Tornado has a retractable refuelling probe 46 ",
			"after": " As a multirole aircraft the Tornado is capable of undertaking more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance maritime patrol duties or dedicated electronic countermeasures ECM were phased out either by standard Tornados or modified variants such as the Tornado ECR The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV which was stretched and armed with long range anti aircraft missiles to serve in the interceptor role 47 ",
