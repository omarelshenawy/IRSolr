			"previous": " Because of the differences in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms such as between bacteria and humans this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics 87 88 For example the enzyme nicotinamidase which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid is a target for drug design as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria 29 ",
			"after": " The coenzyme NAD was first discovered by the British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906 89 They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts this heat stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler Chelpin 90 In 1936 the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions 91 ",
