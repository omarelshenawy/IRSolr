			"previous": " One of the most widespread groups of mammals rodents can be found on every continent except Antarctica They are the only terrestrial placental mammals that have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands e g the Polynesian rat 3 Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat from cold tundra where they can live under snow to hot deserts Some species such as tree squirrels and New World porcupines are arboreal while some such as gophers and mole rats live almost completely underground where they build complex burrow systems Others dwell on the surface of the ground but may have a burrow into which they can retreat Beavers and muskrats are known for being semi aquatic 1 but the rodent best adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea 20 Rodents have also thrived in human created environments such as agricultural and urban areas 21 ",
			"after": " Though some species are common pests for humans rodents also play important ecological roles 1 Some rodents are considered keystone species and ecosystem engineers in their respective habitats In the Great Plains of North America the burrowing activities of prairie dogs play important roles in soil aeration and nutrient redistribution raising the organic content of the soil and increasing the absorption of water They maintain these grassland habitats 22 and some large herbivores like bison and pronghorn prefer to graze near prairie dog colonies due to the increased nutritional quality of forage 23 Prairie dogs can however also contribute to regional and local biodiversity loss increased seed depredation and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs 22 Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants which usually cannot thrive without them As such these rodents may play a role in maintaining healthy forests 24 ",
