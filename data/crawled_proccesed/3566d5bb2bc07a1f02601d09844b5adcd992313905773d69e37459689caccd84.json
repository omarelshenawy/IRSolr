			"previous": " Harrison studied the instrument until 1968 when an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to put down the instrument and return to guitar playing He commented I decided I should get back to the guitar because I m not getting any better at it and I m not going to be a great sitar player because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier 277 ",
			"after": " By the mid 1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism introducing it to the other Beatles 278 During the filming of Help in the Bahamas they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga Swami Vishnu devananda who gave each of them a signed copy of his book The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga 279 Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions he made a pilgrimage to Bombay with his wife Pattie where he studied sitar met several gurus and visited various holy places 280 In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi 280 Harrison s use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism He commented For me it was like a flash The first time I had acid it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me and I realized a lot of things I didn t learn them because I already knew them but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them From the moment I had that I wanted to have it all the time these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas and Ravi s music 112 ",
