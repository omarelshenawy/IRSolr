			"previous": " In high cycle fatigue situations materials performance is commonly characterized by an S N curve also known as a W hler curve This is a graph of the magnitude of a cyclic stress S against the logarithmic scale of cycles to failure N ",
			"after": " S N curves are derived from tests on samples of the material to be characterized often called coupons where a regular sinusoidal stress is applied by a testing machine which also counts the number of cycles to failure This process is sometimes known as coupon testing Each coupon test generates a point on the plot though in some cases there is a runout where the time to failure exceeds that available for the test see censoring Analysis of fatigue data requires techniques from statistics especially survival analysis and linear regression ",
