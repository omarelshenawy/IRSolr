			"after": " The first generation of jet fighters comprised the initial subsonic jet fighter designs introduced late in World War II and in the early post war period They differed little from their piston engined counterparts in appearance and many employed unswept wings Guns remained the principal armament The need to obtain a decisive advantage in maximum speed pushed the development of turbojet powered aircraft forward Top speeds for fighters rose steadily throughout World War II as more powerful piston engines were developed and was approaching transonic flight speeds where the efficiency of propellers drops off making further speed increases nearly impossible ",
