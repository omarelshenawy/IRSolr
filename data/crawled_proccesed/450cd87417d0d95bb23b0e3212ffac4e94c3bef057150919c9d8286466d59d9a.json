			"previous": " Mountfort was born in Birmingham an industrial town in the Midlands of England the son of perfume manufacturer and jeweller Thomas Mountfort and his wife Susanna n e Woolfield As a young adult he moved to London where he was an early pupil of George Gilbert Scott from 1841 46 He also studied architecture under the Anglo Catholic 1 architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter whose medieval Gothic style of design was to have a lifelong influence on Mountfort 2 After completion of his training in 1848 Mountfort practised architecture in London He married Emily Elizabeth Newman on 20 August 1850 and 18 days later the couple emigrated to New Zealand 3 They were some of the first settlers to the province of Canterbury arriving on one of the famed First Four Ships the Charlotte Jane on 16 December 1850 4 These first settlers known as The Pilgrims 5 have their names engraved on marble plaques in Cathedral Square Christchurch in front of the cathedral that Mountfort helped to design 6 ",
			"after": " Mountfort arrived in Canterbury full of ambition and drive to begin designing in 1850 as one of a wave of settlers encouraged to immigrate to the new colony of New Zealand by the British Government 7 8 With him and his wife from England came also his brother Charles his sister Susannah and Charles wife all five of them aged between 21 and 26 Life in New Zealand at first was hard and disappointing Mountfort found that there was little call for architects Christchurch was little more than a large village of basic wooden huts on a windswept plain The new migr s architectural life in New Zealand had a disastrous beginning His first commission in New Zealand was the Church of the Most Holy Trinity in Lyttelton built in 1852 by Isaac Luck 9 10 The building proved vulnerable to high winds and was considered unsafe It was demolished in 1857 9 This calamity was attributed to the use of unseasoned wood and his lack of knowledge of the local building materials Whatever the cause the result was a crushing blow to his reputation 4 A local newspaper called him a half educated architect whose buildings have given anything but satisfaction he being evidently deficient in all knowledge of the principles of construction though a clever draughtsman and a man of some taste 2 ",
