			"previous": " Many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation Human level pattern recognition language comprehension and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data such as scents and sounds as well as high level tasks such as strategic planning currently require human expertise In many cases the use of humans is more cost effective than mechanical approaches even where automation of industrial tasks is possible Overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to post scarcity economics ",
