			"after": " Mineral extraction sites such as the Dolaucothi gold mine was probably first worked by the Roman army from c 75 and at some later stage passed to civilian operators The mine developed as a series of opencast workings mainly by the use of hydraulic mining methods They are described by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History in great detail Essentially water supplied by aqueducts was used to prospect for ore veins by stripping away soil to reveal the bedrock If veins were present they were attacked using fire setting and the ore removed for crushing and comminution The dust was washed in a small stream of water and the heavy gold dust and gold nuggets collected in riffles The diagram at right shows how Dolaucothi developed from c 75 through to the 1st century When opencast work was no longer feasible tunnels were driven to follow the veins The evidence from the site shows advanced technology probably under the control of army engineers ",
