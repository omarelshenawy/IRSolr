			"after": " The term cartographic modeling was probably coined by Dana Tomlin in his PhD dissertation and later in his book which has the term in the title Cartographic modeling refers to a process where several thematic layers of the same area are produced processed and analyzed Tomlin used raster layers but the overlay method see below can be used more generally Operations on map layers can be combined into algorithms and eventually into simulation or optimization models ",
