			"previous": " At the end of the run up the bowler will bring his or her lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as straight as possible This aids in generating speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure placed on the joint by this action Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers for example the English pace bowler David Lawrence was sidelined for many months after splitting his kneecap in two The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the front off their shoes to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe The bowler will then bring their bowling arm up over their head and release the ball at the height appropriate to where they want the ball to pitch Again the arm must be straight although this is a stipulation of the laws of cricket rather than an aid to speed Bending the elbow and chucking the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman s wicket and get them out ",
			"after": " Fast bowlers tend to have an action which leaves them either side on or chest on at the end of the run up A chest on bowler has chest and hips aligned towards the batsman at the instant of back foot contact while a side on bowler has chest and hips aligned at ninety degrees to the batsman at the instant of back foot contact West Indian bowler Malcolm Marshall was a classic example of a chest on bowler while Australian pace bowler Dennis Lillee used a side on technique to great effect ",
