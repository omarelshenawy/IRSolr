			"previous": " A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 online in December 2012 identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest warming regions on Earth The researchers present a complete temperature record from Antarctica s Byrd Station and assert that it reveals a linear increase in annual temperature between 1958 and 2010 by 2 4 1 2 C 127 ",
			"after": " Each year a large area of low ozone concentration or ozone hole grows over Antarctica This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008 when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December 128 The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 129 and has tended to increase over the years of observation The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere which decompose the ozone into other gases 130 ",
