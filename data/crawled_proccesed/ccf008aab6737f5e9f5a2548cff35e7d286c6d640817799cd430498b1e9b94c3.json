			"previous": " Selection whether natural or artificial changes the frequency of morphs within a population this occurs when morphs reproduce with different degrees of success A genetic or balanced polymorphism usually persists over many generations maintained by two or more opposed and powerful selection pressures 8 Diver 1929 found banding morphs in Cepaea nemoralis could be seen in pre fossil shells going back to the Mesolithic Holocene 11 12 Apes have similar blood groups to humans this suggests rather strongly that this kind of polymorphism is quite ancient at least as far back as the last common ancestor of the apes and man and possibly even further ",
			"after": " The relative proportions of the morphs may vary the actual values are determined by the effective fitness of the morphs at a particular time and place The mechanism of heterozygote advantage assures the population of some alternative alleles at the locus or loci involved Only if competing selection disappears will an allele disappear However heterozygote advantage is not the only way a polymorphism can be maintained Apostatic selection whereby a predator consumes a common morph whilst overlooking rarer morphs is possible and does occur This would tend to preserve rarer morphs from extinction ",
