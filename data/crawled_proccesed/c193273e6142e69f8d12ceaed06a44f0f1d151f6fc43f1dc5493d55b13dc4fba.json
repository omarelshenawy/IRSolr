			"previous": " Next the bill is sent by the house where it is being debated to one of several different committees The Standing Orders outline the general mandate for all committees allowing them to review bills as they pertain to relevant departments the program and policy plans as well as the projected expenditures and the effectiveness of the implementation thereof for the same departments and the analysis of the performance of those departments 26 Most often bills end up before a standing committee which is a body of members or senators who specialise in a particular subject such as foreign affairs and who may hear testimony from ministers and experts debate the bill and recommend amendments The bill may also be committed to the Committee of the Whole a body consists of as the name suggests all the members of the chamber in question Finally the bill could be referred to an ad hoc committee established solely to review the piece of legislation in question Each chamber has their own procedure for dealing with this with the Senate establishing special committees that function like most other committees and the House of Commons establishing legislative committees the chair of the latter being appointed by the speaker of the House of Commons and is normally one of his deputies Whichever committee is used any amendments proposed by the committee are considered by the whole house in the report stage Furthermore additional amendments not proposed by the committee may also be made ",
