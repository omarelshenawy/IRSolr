			"after": " The integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands Local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads The outside of the skin is shed periodically more or less in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin 33 Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial Lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages 50 ",
