			"previous": " As the number of condors grew attention began to focus on releasing some back into the wild In 1988 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California Only females were released to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States The experiment was a success and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re released in South America 37 California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon 20 Though the birth rate remains low in the wild their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive reared adolescents ",
			"after": " The California condor conservation project may be one of the most expensive species conservation projects in United States history 60 costing over 35 million including 20 million in federal and state funding since World War II 61 As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around 2 0 million per year 61 However nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors In 2003 the first nestling fledged in the wild since 1981 50 In March 2006 a pair of California condors released by Ventana Wildlife Society attempted to nest in a hollow tree near Big Sur California This was the first time in more than 100 years in which a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California 62 As of November 2011 there were 394 individuals living including 205 in the wild 2 3 and the rest in the San Diego Wild Animal Park the Los Angeles Zoo the Oregon Zoo and the World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise Idaho As of October 2010 the wild condor population in its name state of California reached 100 individuals and 73 wild condors in Arizona 59 As of May 2012 the number of living individuals has reached 405 with 179 living in captivity 63 By June 2014 using data from the National Park Service the condor population had reached 439 225 in the wild and 214 in captivity 64 Official statistics from the October 2014 USFWS record an overall population of 425 of which 219 are wild and 206 are captive 4 ",
