			"previous": " At the South Pole the firn ice transition depth is at 122 m with a CO2 age of about 100 years Gases involved in ozone depletion CFCs chlorocarbons and bromocarbons were measured in firn and levels were almost zero at around 1880 except for CH3Br which is known to have natural sources 16 Similar study of Greenland firn found that CFCs vanished at a depth of 69 m CO2 age of 1929 17 ",
			"after": " Analysis of the Upper Fremont Glacier ice core showed large levels of chlorine 36 that definitely correspond to the production of that isotope during atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons This result is interesting because the signal exists despite being on a glacier and undergoing the effects of thawing refreezing and associated meltwater percolation 18 36Cl has also been detected in the Dye 3 ice core Greenland 19 and in firn at Vostok 20 ",
