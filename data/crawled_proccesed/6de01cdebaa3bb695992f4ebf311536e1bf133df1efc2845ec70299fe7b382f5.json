			"after": " An alloy is a mixture of either pure or fairly pure chemical elements which forms an impure substance admixture that retains the characteristics of a metal An alloy is distinct from an impure metal such as wrought iron in that with an alloy the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements at least one of which being a metal This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy The other constituents may or may not be metals but when mixed with the molten base they will be soluble dissolving into the mixture ",
