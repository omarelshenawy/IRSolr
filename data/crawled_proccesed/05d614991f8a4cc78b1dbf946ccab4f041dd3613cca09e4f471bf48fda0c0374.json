			"previous": " To determine the statistical relevance of the analysis an average is determined so that points gradients outside of any immediate measurement can be included to determine their predicted behavior This is due to the limitations of the applied statistic and data collection methods and interpolation is required to predict the behavior of particles points and locations that are not directly measurable ",
			"after": " Interpolation is the process by which a surface is created usually a raster dataset through the input of data collected at a number of sample points There are several forms of interpolation each which treats the data differently depending on the properties of the data set In comparing interpolation methods the first consideration should be whether or not the source data will change exact or approximate Next is whether the method is subjective a human interpretation or objective Then there is the nature of transitions between points are they abrupt or gradual Finally there is whether a method is global it uses the entire data set to form the model or local where an algorithm is repeated for a small section of terrain ",
