			"previous": " For repairable systems it is obtained from failure rate and mean time to repair MTTR and test interval This measure may not be unique for a given system as this measure depends on the kind of demand In addition to system level requirements reliability requirements may be specified for critical subsystems In most cases reliability parameters are specified with appropriate statistical confidence intervals ",
			"after": " The purpose of reliability testing is to discover potential problems with the design as early as possible and ultimately provide confidence that the system meets its reliability requirements  Reliability testing may be performed at several levels and there are different types of testing Complex systems may be tested at component circuit board unit assembly subsystem and system levels 20 1 The test level nomenclature varies among applications For example performing environmental stress screening tests at lower levels such as piece parts or small assemblies catches problems before they cause failures at higher levels Testing proceeds during each level of integration through full up system testing developmental testing and operational testing thereby reducing program risk However testing does not mitigate unreliability risk ",
