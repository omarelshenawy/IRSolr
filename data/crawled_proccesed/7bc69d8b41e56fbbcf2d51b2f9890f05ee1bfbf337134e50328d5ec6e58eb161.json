			"after": "  Jack the Ripper is the best known pseudonym given to an unidentified serial killer active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888 The name originated in a letter by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media Attacks ascribed to the Ripper typically involved women prostitutes from the slums whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888 and extremely disturbing letters from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard Mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders and because of media treatment of the events the public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer Jack the Ripper Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper An investigation into a series of brutal killings in Whitechapel up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888 but the legend of Jack the Ripper solidified As the murders were never solved the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research folklore and pseudohistory The term ripperology was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases There are over one hundred theories about the Ripper s identity and the murders have inspired multiple works of fiction ",
