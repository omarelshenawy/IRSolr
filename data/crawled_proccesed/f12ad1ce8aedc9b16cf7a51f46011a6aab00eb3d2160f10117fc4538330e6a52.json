			"previous": " The German philosopher Immanuel Kant 1724 1804 has formulated an individualist definition of enlightenment similar to the concept of bildung Enlightenment is man s emergence from his self incurred immaturity 7 He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding but from a lack of courage to think independently Against this intellectual cowardice Kant urged Sapere aude Dare to be wise In reaction to Kant German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder 1744 1803 argued that human creativity which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms is as important as human rationality Moreover Herder proposed a collective form of bildung For Herder Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity and sense of common destiny to a people 8 ",
