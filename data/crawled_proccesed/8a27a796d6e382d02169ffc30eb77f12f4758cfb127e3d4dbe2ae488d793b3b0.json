			"previous": " Although Triceratops are commonly portrayed as herding animals there is currently little evidence that they lived in herds While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to hundreds or thousands of individuals to date there is only one documented bonebed dominated by Triceratops bones a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles It may be significant that only juveniles were present 38 Another more recent find may reveal that Triceratops lived in small family groups In 2012 a group of three Triceratops in relatively complete condition each of varying sizes from a full grown adult to a small juvenile were found in Wyoming near Newcastle The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring or two females and a juvenile they were caring for The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from Tyrannosaurus particularly on the largest specimen with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from Tyrannosaurus teeth 39 ",
			"after": " For many years Triceratops finds were known only from solitary individuals 38 These remains are very common for example Bruce Erickson a paleontologist of the Science Museum of Minnesota has reported having seen 200 specimens of T prorsus in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana 40 Similarly Barnum Brown claimed to have seen over 500 skulls in the field 13 79 Because Triceratops teeth horn fragments frill fragments and other skull fragments are such abundant fossils in the Lancian faunal stage of the late Maastrichtian late Cretaceous 66 mya Period of western North America it is regarded as among the dominant herbivores of the time if not the most dominant herbivore In 1986 Robert Bakker estimated it as making up 5 6ths of the large dinosaur fauna at the end of the Cretaceous 41 438 Unlike most animals skull fossils are far more common than postcranial bones for Triceratops suggesting that the skull had an unusually high preservation potential 42 ",
