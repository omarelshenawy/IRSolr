			"previous": "  Modern Chinese has many homophones thus the same spoken syllable may be represented by many characters depending on meaning A single character may also have a range of meanings or sometimes quite distinct meanings occasionally these correspond to different pronunciations Cognates in the several varieties of Chinese are generally written with the same character They typically have similar meanings but often quite different pronunciations In other languages most significantly today in Japanese characters are used to represent Chinese loanwords to represent native words independent of the Chinese pronunciation and as purely phonetic elements based on their pronunciation in the historical variety of Chinese from which they were acquired These foreign adaptations of Chinese pronunciation are known as Sinoxenic pronunciations and have been useful in the reconstruction of Middle Chinese ",
			"after": " Chinese characters represent words of the language using several strategies A few characters including some of the most commonly used were originally pictograms which depicted the objects denoted or simple ideograms in which meaning was expressed iconically Some other words were expressed by compound ideograms but the vast majority were written using the rebus principle in which a character for a similarly sounding word was either simply borrowed or more commonly extended with a disambiguating semantic marker to form a phono semantic compound character 8 ",
