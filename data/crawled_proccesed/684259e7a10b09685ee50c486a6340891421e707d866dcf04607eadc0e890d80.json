			"previous": " Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight legged Dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding Rowett s Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard drawn up by Rowett L H Twadell and Norman Ellmore in 1887 18 The Beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club AKC in 1885 19 In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide ",
			"after": " On its formation the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889 and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896 16 The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type and the Beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended After the war the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time and registrations fell to an all time low A few breeders notably Reynalton Kennels managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II the breed was once again doing well Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered 20 ",
