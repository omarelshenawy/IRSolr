			"previous": " Dials with faces perpendicular to the ground and which face directly South North East or West are called vertical direct dials 28 29 It is widely believed and stated in respectable publications that a vertical dial cannot receive more than twelve hours of sunlight a day no matter how many hours of daylight there are 30 However there is an exception Vertical sundials in the tropics which face the nearer pole e g north facing in the zone between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer can actually receive sunlight for more than 12 hours from sunrise to sunset for a short period around the time of the summer solstice For example at latitude 20 degrees North on June 21 the sun shines on a north facing vertical wall for 13 hours 21 minutes 31 Vertical sundials which do not face directly South in the northern hemisphere may receive significantly less than twelve hours of sunlight per day depending on the direction they do face and on the time of year For example a vertical dial that faces due East can tell time only in the morning hours in the afternoon the sun does not shine on its face Vertical dials that face due East or West are polar dials which will be described below Vertical dials that face North are uncommon because they tell time only during the spring and summer and do not show the midday hours except in tropical latitudes and even there only around midsummer For non direct vertical dials those that face in non cardinal directions the mathematics of arranging the style and the hour lines becomes more complicated it may be easier to mark the hour lines by observation but the placement of the style at least must be calculated first such dials are said to be declining dials 32 33 34 ",
			"after": " Vertical dials are commonly mounted on the walls of buildings such as town halls cupolas and church towers where they are easy to see from far away In some cases vertical dials are placed on all four sides of a rectangular tower providing the time throughout the day The face may be painted on the wall or displayed in inlaid stone the gnomon is often a single metal bar or a tripod of metal bars for rigidity If the wall of the building faces toward the South but does not face due South the gnomon will not lie along the noon line and the hour lines must be corrected Since the gnomon s style must be parallel to the Earth s axis it always points true North and its angle with the horizontal will equal the sundial s geographical latitude on a direct south dial its angle with the vertical face of the dial will equal the colatitude or 90 minus the latitude 35 ",
