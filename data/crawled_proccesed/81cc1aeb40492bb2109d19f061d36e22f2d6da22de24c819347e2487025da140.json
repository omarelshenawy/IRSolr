			"previous": " A majority of Grenadine citizens 82 2 are descendants of the African slaves brought by the English and French few of the indigenous Carib and Arawak population survived the French purge at Sauteurs A small percentage of descendants of indentured workers from India were brought to Grenada mainly from the North Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh between May 1 1857 January 10 1885 Today Grenadians of Indian descent comprise the second largest ethnic group There is also a small community of French and English descendants The rest of the population is of mixed descent 13 2 ",
			"after": " Grenada like many of the Caribbean islands is subject to a large amount of migration with a large number of young people wanting to leave the island to seek life elsewhere With 110 000 people living in Grenada estimates and census data suggest that there are at least that number of Grenadian born people in other parts of the Caribbean such as Barbados and Trinidad and at least that number again in First World countries Popular migration points for Grenadians further north include New York City Toronto the United Kingdom in particular London and Yorkshire see Grenadians in the UK and sometimes Montreal or as far south as Australia This means that probably around a third of those born in Grenada still live there ",
