			"previous": " Historically generative proposals made focus a feature bound to a single word within a sentence Chomsky and Halle 18 formulated a Nuclear Stress Rule that proposed there to be a relation between the main stress of a sentence and a single constituent Since this constituent is prominent sententially in a way that can contrast with lexical stress this was originally referred to as nuclear stress The purpose of this rule was to capture the intuition that within each sentence there is one word in particular that is accented more prominently due to its importance this is said to form the nucleus of that sentence ",
			"after": " Focus was later suggested to be a structural position at the beginning of the sentence or on the left periphery in Romance languages such as Italian as the lexical head of a Focus Phrase or FP following the X bar theory of phrase structure Jackendoff 19 Selkirk 14 15 Rooth 20 21 Krifka 22 Schwarzschild 16 argue that focus consists of a feature that is assigned to a node in the syntactic representation of a sentence Because focus is now widely seen as corresponding between heavy stress or nuclear pitch accent this feature is often associated with the phonologically prominent element s of a sentence ",
