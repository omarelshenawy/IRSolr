			"previous": " This technology was also predicted by US Army General Hap Arnold who wrote in 1943  The development of the world s first practical design for an ICBM A9 10 intended for use in bombing New York and other American cities was undertaken in Nazi Germany by the team of Wernher von Braun under Projekt Amerika The ICBM A9 A10 rocket initially was intended to be guided by radio but was changed to be a piloted craft after the failure of Operation Elster The second stage of the A9 A10 rocket was tested a few times in January and February 1945 The progenitor of the A9 A10 was the German V 2 rocket also designed by von Braun and widely used at the end of World War II to bomb British and Belgian cities All of these rockets used liquid propellants Following the war von Braun and other leading German scientists were relocated to the United States to work directly for the US Army through Operation Paperclip developing the IRBMs ICBMs and launchers ",
			"after": " In the immediate post war era the US and USSR both started rocket research programs based on the German wartime designs especially the V 2 In the US each branch of the military started its own programs leading to considerable duplication of effort In the USSR rocket research was centrally organized although several teams worked on different designs Early designs from both countries were short range missiles like the V 2 but improvements quickly followed ",
