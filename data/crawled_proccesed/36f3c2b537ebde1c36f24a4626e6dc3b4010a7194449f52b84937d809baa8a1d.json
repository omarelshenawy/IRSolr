			"previous": " Located on top of this ring are three proteins that have an S1 RNA binding domain RBD Two proteins in addition have a K homology KH domain 7 In eukaryotes three different S1 proteins are bound to the ring whereas in archaea either one or two different S1 proteins can be part of the exosome although there are always three S1 subunits attached to the complex 11 ",
			"after": " This ring structure is very similar to that of the proteins RNase PH and PNPase In bacteria the protein RNase PH which is involved in tRNA processing forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical RNase PH proteins 12 In the case of PNPase which is a phosphorolytic RNA degrading protein found in bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic organisms two RNase PH domains and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome 13 Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure these complexes are thought to be evolutionarily related and have a common ancestor 14 In bacteria a separate RNase PH protein exists that is involved in transfer RNA processing which has been shown to adopt a similar six membered ring structure but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits 15 The RNase PH like exosome proteins PNPase and RNase PH all belong to the RNase PH family of RNases and are phosphorolytic exoribonucleases meaning that they use inorganic phosphate to remove nucleotides from the 3 end of RNA molecules 7 ",
