			"after": " In 1801 the usual meeting was delayed causing Mint Director Elias Boudinot to complain to President John Adams that depositors were anxious for an audit so the Mint could release coins struck from their bullion Numismatist Fred Reed suggested that the delay was probably due to poor weather making it difficult for officials to travel from the new capital of Washington D C to Philadelphia for the assay 4 5 In response on March 3 1801 Congress changed the designation of officials required to attend to the district judge of Pennsylvania the attorney for the United States in the district of Pennsylvania and the commissioner of loans for the State of Pennsylvania 6 The meeting finally took place on April 27 1801 The 1806 and 1815 sessions were delayed because of outbreaks of disease in Philadelphia the one in 1812 was held a month late because of a heavy snowstorm which prevented the commissioners from reaching the Mint 7 No meeting took place in 1817 a fire had damaged the Philadelphia Mint in January 1816 and no gold or silver awaited the commission 8 In 1818 Congress substituted the Collector of the Port of Philadelphia for the Pennsylvania loans commissioner as a member of the Assay Commission 9 With the Coinage Act of 1834 Congress removed the automatic disqualification of Mint officers in the event of an unfavorable assay leaving the decision to the president 10 ",
