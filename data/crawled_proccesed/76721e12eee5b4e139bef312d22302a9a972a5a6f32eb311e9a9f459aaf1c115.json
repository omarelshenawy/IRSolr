			"previous": " When a 1916 fire destroyed M A C s nine year old engineering hall there was a movement to have the entire program absorbed by the University of Michigan 32 Lansing automobile magnate Ransom E Olds however solidified the program on the East Lansing campus with a gift of 100 000 in 1917 for a new engineering building to be erected directly upon the foundations of the burned hall 33 The donation the College s first significant private gift for a building resulted in Olds Hall The original building is still standing but now houses MSU s University Relations division as well as classroom space ",
			"after": " In 1914 the United States Congress passed the Smith Lever Act which provided federal funding for a system of state cooperative extension service Like T C Abbot s initial Farmers Institutes these extension services spread college based knowledge about agriculture and related issues to citizens around the state Such extension services served as the third prong of the Land Grant college mission of education research and public service With this new mandate the College looked to expand its curriculum beyond agriculture and engineering By 1925 the institution had expanded enough that it petitioned the state of Michigan to remove the word agriculture from its name but the University of Michigan opposed the name change As a compromise the state government decided to call it Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science M S C However the College s athletic teams were still known as the Aggies Thus M S C held a contest to find a new nickname They decided to call the teams the Michigan Staters Local sports writers for the Lansing State Journal and the Capital News went through the losing entries to find a shorter and more heroic name They decided on the Spartans By coincidence Justin Morrill had once compared the Land Grant colleges to the schools of ancient Sparta 34 With a heroic name and a historic precedent the Spartans quickly caught on as the teams new nickname Within a few years the College changed the lyrics of the Fight Song to reflect the name change of the College and its sports teams ",
