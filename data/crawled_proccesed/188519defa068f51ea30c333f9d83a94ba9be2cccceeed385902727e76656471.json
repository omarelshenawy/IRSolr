			"after": " Although the Pallava records can be traced from the 2nd century AD they did not rise to prominence as an imperial dynasty until the 6th century 43 They transformed the institution of the kingship into an imperial one and sought to bring vast amounts of territory under their direct rule The Pallavas were followers of Hinduism though for a short while one of their kings embraced Jainism and later converted to Hinduism 44 The Bhakti movement in Hinduism was founded at this time and rose along with the growing influence of Jainism and Buddhism 45 The Pallavas pioneered the building of large ornate temples in stone which formed the basis of the Dravidian temple architecture They came into conflict with the Kannada Chalukyas of Badami During this period The great Badami Chalukya King Pulakesi II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and defeated the Pallavas in several battles 46 Pallava Narasimhavarman however reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily 47 However a later Chalukya King Vikramaditya II took revenge by repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava Nandivarman II and the annexation of Kanchipuram 48 The Pallava dynasty was overthrown in the 9th century by the imperial Kannada Rashtrakutas who ruled from Gulbarga King Krishna III the last great Rashtrakuta king consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country Tondaimandalam while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon 49 ",
