			"after": " An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil on canvas painting by Joseph Wright of Derby part of a series of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s The Air Pump departed from previous painting conventions by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical and religious significance Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment but while his paintings were recognized as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated The picture has been owned by the National Gallery since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art The painting depicts a natural philosopher a forerunner of the modern scientist recreating one of Robert Boyle s air pump experiments in which a bird is deprived of oxygen before a varied group of onlookers The group exhibit different reactions but for most scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer s participation in the outcome ",
