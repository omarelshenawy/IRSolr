			"previous": " Four degrees of albinism have been described The most common form is termed partial albinism in which local areas of the bird s body such as certain feathers are lacking the pigment melanin The white areas may be symmetrical with both sides of the bird showing a similar pattern In imperfect albinism the pigment is partially inhibited in the skin eyes or feathers but is not absent from any of them Incomplete albinism is the complete absence of pigment from the skin eyes or feathers but not all three 10 ",
			"after": " A completely albino bird is the most rare The eyes in this case are pink or red because blood shows through in the absence of pigment in the irises The beak legs and feet are very pale or white Albino adults are rare in the wild because their eyesight is poor resulting in greater risk of predation 11 They are likely easier targets for predators because their colour distinguishes them from their environment Falconers have observed that their trained birds are likely to attack a white pigeon in a flock because it is conspicuous A complete albino often has weak eyesight and brittle wing and tail feathers which may reduce its ability to fly In flocks albinos are often harassed by their own species Such observations have been made among red winged blackbirds barn swallows and African penguins In a nesting colony of the latter three unusual juveniles one black headed one white headed and one full albino were shunned and abused by companions 10 ",
