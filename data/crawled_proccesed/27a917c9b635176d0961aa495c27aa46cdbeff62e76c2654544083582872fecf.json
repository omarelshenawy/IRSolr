			"after": " Modern birds are well known for communicating using primarily visual and auditory signals and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups suggests that visual communication has always been important to dinosaur biology However the evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain In 2008 paleontologist Phil Senter examined the evidence for vocalization in Mesozoic animal life including dinosaurs 91 Senter found that contrary to popular depictions of roaring dinosaurs in motion pictures it is likely that most Mesozoic dinosaurs were not capable of creating any vocalizations though the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines could have functioned as resonance chambers used for a wide range of vocalizations 92 93 To draw this conclusion Senter studied the distribution of vocal organs in modern reptiles and birds He found that vocal cords in the larynx probably evolved multiple times among reptiles including crocodilians which are able to produce guttural roars Birds on the other hand lack a larynx Instead bird calls are produced by the syrinx a vocal organ found only in birds and which is not related to the larynx meaning it evolved independently from the vocal organs in reptiles The syrinx depends on the air sac system in birds to function specifically it requires the presence of a clavicular air sac near the wishbone or collar bone This air sac leaves distinctive marks or opening on the bones including a distinct opening in the upper arm bone humerus While extensive air sac systems are a unique characteristic of saurischian dinosaurs the clavicular air sac necessary to vocalize does not appear in the fossil record until the enantiornithines one exception Aerosteon probably evolved its clavicular air sac independently of birds for reasons other than vocalization 91 ",
