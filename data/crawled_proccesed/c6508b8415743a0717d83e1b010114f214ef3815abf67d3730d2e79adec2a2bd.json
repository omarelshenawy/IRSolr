			"previous": " After the Battle of Fort Sumter Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander in chief using unprecedented powers He expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions In addition Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict 190 ",
			"after": " The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln and dominated his time and attention From the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue Conversely the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery 191 On August 6 1861 Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort In practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy 192 ",
