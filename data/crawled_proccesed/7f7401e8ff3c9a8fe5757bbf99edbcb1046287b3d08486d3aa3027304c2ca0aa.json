			"previous": " A great imperial expedition under Leo Phocas and Romanos I Lekapenos ended with another crushing Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Achelous in 917 and the following year the Bulgarians were free to ravage northern Greece Adrianople was plundered again in 923 and a Bulgarian army laid siege to Constantinople in 924 Simeon died suddenly in 927 however and Bulgarian power collapsed with him Bulgaria and Byzantium entered a long period of peaceful relations and the Empire was now free to concentrate on the eastern front against the Muslims 83 In 968 Bulgaria was overrun by the Rus under Sviatoslav I of Kiev but three years later John I Tzimiskes defeated the Rus and re incorporated Eastern Bulgaria into the Byzantine Empire 84 ",
			"after": " Bulgarian resistance revived under the rule of the Cometopuli dynasty but the new emperor Basil II r 976 1025 made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal 85 Basil s first expedition against Bulgaria however resulted in a humiliating defeat at the Gates of Trajan For the next few years the emperor would be preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans The war dragged on for nearly twenty years The Byzantine victories of Spercheios and Skopje decisively weakened the Bulgarian army and in annual campaigns Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds 85 At the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 the Bulgarians were annihilated their army was captured and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded with the hundredth man left with one eye so he could lead his compatriots home When Tsar Samuil saw the broken remains of his once gallant army he died of shock By 1018 the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered and the country became part of the Empire 85 This victory restored the Danube frontier which had not been held since the days of the emperor Heraclius 79 ",
