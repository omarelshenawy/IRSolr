			"previous": " Brookwood was one of the few cemeteries to permit burials on Sundays which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without the need to take a day off work 79 As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance 78 80 ",
			"after": " While the majority of burials conducted by the LNC around 80 were pauper funerals on behalf of London parishes 77 the LNC also reached agreement with a number of societies guilds religious bodies and similar organisations The LNC provided dedicated sections of the cemetery for these groups on the basis that those who had lived or worked together in life could remain together after death 82 Although the LNC was never able to gain the domination of London s funeral industry for which its founders had hoped it was very successful at targeting specialist groups of artisans and trades to the extent that it became nicknamed the Westminster Abbey of the middle classes 83 A large number of these dedicated plots were established ranging from Chelsea Pensioners and the Ancient Order of Foresters to the Corps of Commissionaires and the LSWR 84 The Nonconformist cemetery also includes a Parsee burial ground established in 1862 which as of 2011 update remains the only Zoroastrian burial ground in Europe 85 Dedicated sections in the Anglican cemetery were also reserved for burials from those parishes which had made burial arrangements with the LNC 54 ",
