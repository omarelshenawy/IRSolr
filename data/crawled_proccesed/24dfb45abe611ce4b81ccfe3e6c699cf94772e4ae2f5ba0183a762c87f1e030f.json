			"previous": " Combined with the poached elements both new specimens represent almost the entire skeleton of Deinocheirus as MPC D 100 127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae most caudal vertebrae and the right forelimb MPC D 100 128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae the ilium a partial ischium and most of the left hindlimb In 2014 the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee Barsbold Currie Yoshitsugu Kobayashi Hang Jae Lee Lee Godefroit Escuilli and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig 1 A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with Spinosaurus another sail backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912 Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists and Spinosaurus was shown to have been quite different from other spinosaurids The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives 9 ",
			"after": " When Deinocheirus was only known from the original forelimbs its taxonomic relationship was difficult to determine and several hypotheses were proposed 9 Osm lska and Roniewicz initially concluded that Deinocheirus did not belong in any already named theropod family so they created a new monotypic family Deinocheiridae placed in the infraorder Carnosauria This was due to the large size and thick walled limb bones but they also found some similarities with Ornithomimus and to a lesser extent Allosaurus 6 In 1971 John Ostrom first proposed that Deinocheirus belonged with the Ornithomimosauria while noting that it contained both ornithomimosaurian and non ornithomimosaurian characters 1 9 In 1976 Rhinchen Barsbold named the order Deinocheirosauria which was to include the supposedly related genera Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus A relationship between Deinocheirus and the long armed therizinosaurs was supported by some later writers but they are not considered to be closely related today 12 ",
