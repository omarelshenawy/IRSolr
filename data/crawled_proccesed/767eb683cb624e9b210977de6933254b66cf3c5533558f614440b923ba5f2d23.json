			"previous": " where the sign indicates parts per thousand 33 Because the PDB standard contains an unusually high proportion of 13 C note 6 most measured 13C values are negative ",
			"after": " For marine organisms the details of the photosynthesis reactions are less well understood and the 13C values for marine photosynthetic organisms are dependent on temperature At higher temperatures CO 2 has poor solubility in water which means there is less CO 2 available for the photosynthetic reactions Under these conditions fractionation is reduced and at temperatures above 14 C the 13C values are correspondingly higher while at lower temperatures CO 2 becomes more soluble and hence more available to marine organisms 34 The 13C value for animals depends on their diet An animal that eats food with high 13C values will have a higher 13C than one that eats food with lower 13C values 33 The animal s own biochemical processes can also impact the results for example both bone minerals and bone collagen typically have a higher concentration of 13 C than is found in the animal s diet though for different biochemical reasons The enrichment of bone 13 C also implies that excreted material is depleted in 13 C relative to the diet 37 ",
