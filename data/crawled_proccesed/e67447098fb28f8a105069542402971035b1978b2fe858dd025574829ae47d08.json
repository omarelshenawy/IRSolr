			"previous": " The detonation was initially planned for 04 00 but was postponed because of rain and lightning from early that morning It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation 84 A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04 45 59 and the final twenty minute countdown began at 05 10 read by Samuel Allison 85 By 05 30 the rain had gone 59 There were some communication problems The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B 29s was shared with the Voice of America and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio Texas 81 ",
