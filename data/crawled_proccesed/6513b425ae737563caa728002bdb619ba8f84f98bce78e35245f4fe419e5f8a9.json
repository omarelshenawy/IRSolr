			"previous": " Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden Modern incarnations of Walter s turtles may be found in the form of BEAM robotics 35 ",
			"after": " The first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate This ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry 36 Devol sold the first Unimate to General Motors in 1960 and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in Trenton New Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them 37 Devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry 38 ",
