			"after": " In the 1940s beavers were brought from northern Manitoba in Canada to the island of Tierra Del Fuego in southern Chile and Argentina for commercial fur production However the project failed and the beavers ten pairs were released into the wild Having no natural predators in their new environment they quickly spread throughout the island and to other islands in the region reaching a number of 100 000 individuals within just 50 years They are now considered a serious invasive species in the region due to their massive destruction of forest trees and efforts are being made for their eradication 48 The drastically different ecosystem has led to substantial environmental damage as the ponds created by the beavers have no ecological purpose wetlands do not form there as they do in the beavers native territory and there are no native large predators citation needed They have also been found to cross salt water to islands northward a possible encroachment on the mainland has naturalists highly concerned ",
