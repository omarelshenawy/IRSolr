			"previous": " The Viet Minh were willing to accept French rule to end Chinese occupation Ho and others had fears of the Chinese based on China s historic domination and occupation of Vietnam The French negotiated a deal with the Chinese where pre war French concessions in Chinese ports such as Shanghai were traded for Chinese cooperation in Vietnam The French landed a military force at Haiphong in early 1946 Negotiations then took place about the future for Vietnam as a state within the French Union These talks eventually failed and the Viet Minh fled into the countryside to wage guerrilla war In 1946 Vietnam created its first constitution ",
			"after": " The British had supported the French in fighting the Viet Minh armed militias from the religious Cao i and H a H o sects and the B nh Xuy n organized crime groups which were all individually seeking power in the country In 1948 as part of a post colonial solution the French re installed Bao Dai as head of state of Vietnam under the French Union The Viet Minh were militarily ineffective in the first few years of the war and could do little more than harass the French in remote areas of Indochina ",
