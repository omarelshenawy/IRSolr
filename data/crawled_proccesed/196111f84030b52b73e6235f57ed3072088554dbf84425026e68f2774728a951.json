			"previous": " The champagne gene produces diluted color and the gold champagne body color light skin light eyes and ivory mane and tail associated with the American Cream Draft are produced by the action of the champagne gene on a chestnut base coat 6 7 In the adult horse the skin is pink with abundant dark freckles or mottling 8 and the eyes are hazel or amber The eyes of champagne foals are blue at birth darkening as they age and a foal s skin is bright pink 9 The breed registry describes foals eyes as almost white 2 which is consistent with the nature of the champagne blue foal eye which is creamier than other types of blue eye 10 ",
			"after": " Champagne is a dominant trait based on a mutation in the SLC36A1 gene 9 The mapping of the gene was announced in 2008 and the American Cream Draft cross was among the breeds studied 11 The authors of this study noted that it was difficult to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous animals thus distinguishing champagne from incomplete dominant dilutions such as the cream gene However they noted that homozygotes may have less mottling or a slightly lighter hair color than heterozygotes 11 Anecdotal reports also note mild differences including lighter freckling skin and hair coat though eye color remains the same 12 ",
