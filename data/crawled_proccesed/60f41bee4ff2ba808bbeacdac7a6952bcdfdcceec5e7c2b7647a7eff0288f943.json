			"previous": " A mirror on the back wall reflects the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings and by Palomino as King Philip IV 10 and Queen Mariana 11 The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Vel zquez as he paints them while their daughter watches and that the painting therefore shows their view of the scene ",
			"after": " Of the nine figures depicted five are looking directly out at the royal couple or the viewer Their glances along with the king and queen s reflection affirm the royal couple s presence outside the painted space 24 Alternatively art historians H W Janson and Joel Snyder suggest that the image of the king and queen is a reflection from Vel zquez s canvas the front of which is obscured from the viewer 30 31 Other writers say the canvas Vel zquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Vel zquez and is about the same size as Las Meninas Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Vel zquez 32 ",
