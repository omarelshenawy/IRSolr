			"previous": " Because grid computing systems described below can easily handle embarrassingly parallel problems modern clusters are typically designed to handle more difficult problems problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often This requires a high bandwidth and more importantly a low latency interconnection network Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing such as the Cray Gemini network 29 As of 2014 most current supercomputers use some off the shelf standard network hardware often Myrinet InfiniBand or Gigabit Ethernet ",
			"after": " A massively parallel processor MPP is a single computer with many networked processors MPPs have many of the same characteristics as clusters but MPPs have specialized interconnect networks whereas clusters use commodity hardware for networking MPPs also tend to be larger than clusters typically having far more than 100 processors 30 In a MPP each CPU contains its own memory and copy of the operating system and application Each subsystem communicates with the others via a high speed interconnect 31 ",
