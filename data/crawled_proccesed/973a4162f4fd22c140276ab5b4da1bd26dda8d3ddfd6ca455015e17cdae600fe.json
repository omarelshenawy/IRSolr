			"previous": " By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe Albrecht D rer emulated van Eyck s precision 39 Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide ranging influences Hieronymus Bosch active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters 40 He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature human existence and perspective while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences His better known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck s Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych Bosch followed his own muse tending instead towards moralism and pessimism His paintings especially the triptychs are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period 40 41 ",
			"after": " The Reformation brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background 42 Pieter Bruegel the Elder one of the few who followed Bosch s style is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors His work retains many 15th century conventions but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological and his genre scenes were complex with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism 42 43 ",
