			"after": " The taxonomic history of lemurs dates back to 1758 when Carl Linnaeus first classified them and the taxonomy remains controversial today with approximately 70 to 100 species and subspecies recognized depending on how the term species is defined Having undergone their own independent evolution on Madagascar lemurs have diversified to fill many niches normally filled by other types of mammals They include the smallest primates in the world and once included some of the largest Since the arrival of humans approximately 2 000 years ago lemurs have become restricted to 10 of the island or approximately 60 000 square kilometres 23 000 sq mi and many face extinction Concerns over lemur conservation have affected lemur taxonomy since distinct species receive increased conservation attention compared to subspecies ",
