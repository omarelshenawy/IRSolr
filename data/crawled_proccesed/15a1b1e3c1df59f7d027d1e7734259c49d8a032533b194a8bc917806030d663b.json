			"after": " Both East Slavs and Byzantines consistently made a clear distinction between Varangians and Kylfings and Byzantines distinguished between them in the same manner as they separated Franks from Saracens According to Holm such separations are indicative of clear ethnic differences between the two groups Additionally both East Slavic and Byzantine sources explicitly associate the Varangians with Baltic region which they called Varangia and in Arabic the Baltic Sea was called Bahr Varank i e the Varangian Sea There are no comparable connections when they mention the Kylfings Another difference is the fact that the Byzantine sources connect the word varangoi with rh s in order to make it clear that the rh s varangoi and the varangoi originate in Baltic just like the rh s but do not establish the same associations for the koulpingoi 18 ",
