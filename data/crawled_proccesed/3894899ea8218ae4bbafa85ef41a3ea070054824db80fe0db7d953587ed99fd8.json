			"previous": " Almost from the start of its stewardship the Park Service sought to move the bell from Independence Hall to a structure where it would be easier to care for the bell and accommodate visitors The first such proposal was withdrawn in 1958 after considerable public protest 69 The Park Service tried again as part of the planning for the 1976 United States Bicentennial The Independence National Historical Park Advisory Committee proposed in 1969 that the bell be moved out of Independence Hall as the building could not accommodate the millions expected to visit Philadelphia for the Bicentennial 70 In 1972 the Park Service announced plans to build a large glass tower for the bell at the new visitors center at South Third Street and Chestnut Street two blocks east of Independence Hall at a cost of 5 million but citizens again protested the move Instead in 1973 the Park Service proposed to build a smaller glass pavilion for the bell at the north end of Independence Mall between Arch and Race Streets Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo agreed with the pavilion idea but proposed that the pavilion be built across Chestnut Street from Independence Hall which the state feared would destroy the view of the historic building from the mall area 71 Rizzo s view prevailed and the bell was moved to a glass and steel Liberty Bell Pavilion about 200 yards 180 m from its old home at Independence Hall as the Bicentennial year began 72 ",
			"after": " During the Bicentennial members of the Procrastinator s Club of America jokingly picketed the Whitechapel Bell Foundry with signs We got a lemon and What about the warranty The foundry told the protesters that it would be glad to replace the bell so long as it was returned in the original packaging 10 In 1958 the foundry then trading under the name Mears and Stainbank Foundry had offered to recast the bell and was told by the Park Service that neither it nor the public wanted the crack removed 69 The foundry was called upon in 1976 to cast a full size replica of the Liberty Bell known as the Bicentennial Bell which was presented to the United States by the British monarch Queen Elizabeth II 73 and was housed in the tower once intended for the Liberty Bell at the former visitor center on South Third Street 74 The bell was removed and placed in storage in January 2013 75 in preparation for the demolition of the visitor center future location of the Museum of the American Revolution 76 ",
