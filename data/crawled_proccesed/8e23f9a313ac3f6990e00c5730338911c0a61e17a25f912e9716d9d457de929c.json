			"after": " The proteasome subcomponents are often referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient denoted S The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome which is about 2000 kilodaltons kDa in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially the same manner as the 19S particle the 11S may play a role in degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus 14 ",
