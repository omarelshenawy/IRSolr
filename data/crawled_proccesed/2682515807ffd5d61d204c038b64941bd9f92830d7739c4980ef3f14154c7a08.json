			"previous": " After the war the Marine Corps fell into a depression that ended with the appointment of Archibald Henderson as its fifth Commandant in 1820 Under his tenure the Corps took on expeditionary duties in the Caribbean the Gulf of Mexico Key West West Africa the Falkland Islands and Sumatra Commandant Henderson is credited with thwarting President Jackson s attempts to combine and integrate the Marine Corps with the Army 38 Instead Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps in 1834 stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service to the Navy 39 This would be the first of many times that the existence of the Corps was challenged ",
			"after": " Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service in the Seminole Wars of 1835 personally leading nearly half of the entire Corps two battalions to war A decade later in the Mexican American War 1846 1848 the Marines made their famed assault on Chapultepec Palace in Mexico City which would be later celebrated by the phrase From The Halls of Montezuma in Marines hymn In the 1850s the Marines would see further service in Panama and Asia escorting Matthew Perry s East India Squadron on its historic trip to the Far East 40 ",
