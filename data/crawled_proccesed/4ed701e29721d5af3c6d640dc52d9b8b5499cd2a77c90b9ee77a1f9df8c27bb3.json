			"previous": " G ricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820 where it was shown at William Bullock s Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly London from June 10 until the end of the year and viewed by about 40 000 visitors 51 The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in French art In part this was due to the manner of the painting s exhibition in Paris it had initially been hung high in the Salon Carr a mistake that G ricault recognised when he saw the work installed but in London it was placed close to the ground emphasising its monumental impact There may have been other reasons for its popularity in England as well including a degree of national self congratulation 53 the appeal of the painting as lurid entertainment 53 and two theatrical entertainments based around the events on the raft which coincided with the exhibition and borrowed heavily from G ricault s depiction 54 From the London exhibition G ricault earned close to 20 000 francs which was his share of the fees charged to visitors and substantially more than he would have been paid had the French government purchased the work from him 55 After the London exhibition Bullock brought the painting to Dublin early in 1821 but the exhibition there was far less successful in large part due to a competing exhibition of a moving panorama The Wreck of the Medusa by the Marshall brothers firm which was said to have been painted under the direction of one of the survivors of the disaster 56 ",
			"after": " The Raft of the Medusa was championed by the curator of the Louvre comte de Forbin who purchased it from G ricault s heirs after his death in 1824 for the museum where the painting now dominates its gallery 13 The display caption tells us that the only hero in this poignant story is humanity 3 ",
