			"previous": " What already has been observed directly in many systems are the lower non relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion only possible with a high concentration of matter in the center Currently the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales For active galaxies farther away the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies ",
			"after": " Gravitation from supermassive black holes in the center of many galaxies is thought to power active objects such as Seyfert galaxies and quasars ",
