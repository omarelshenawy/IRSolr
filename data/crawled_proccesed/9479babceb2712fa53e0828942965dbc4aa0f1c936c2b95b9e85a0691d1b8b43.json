			"previous": " In nuclear energy applications xenon is used in bubble chambers 165 probes and in other areas where a high molecular weight and inert nature is desirable A by product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon 133 and xenon 135 The detection of these isotopes is used to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties 166 as well as to confirm nuclear test explosions by states such as North Korea 167 ",
			"after": " Liquid xenon is being used in calorimeters 168 for measurements of gamma rays as well as a medium for detecting hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles or WIMPs When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus it is predicted to impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation Liquid xenon is useful for this type of experiment due to its high density which makes dark matter interaction more likely and permits a quiet detector due to self shielding ",
