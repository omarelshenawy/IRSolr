			"previous": " The temple s inner chambers centered on the sanctuary of the temple s primary god which typically lay along the axis near the back of the temple building and in pyramid temples directly against the pyramid base The sanctuary was the focus of temple ritual the place where the divine presence manifested most strongly The form in which it manifested itself varied In Aten temples and traditional solar shrines the object of ritual was the sun itself or a benben stone representing the sun worshipped in a court open to the sky 100 In many mortuary temples the inner areas contained statues of the deceased pharaoh or a false door where his ba was believed to appear to receive offerings 101 ",
			"after": " In most temples however the focus was the cult image a statue of the temple god which that god s ba was believed to inhabit while interacting with humans The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos a cabinet like shrine that housed the divine image or a model barque containing the image within its cabin which was used to carry the image during festival processions To emphasize the sanctuary s sacred nature it was kept in total darkness 102 Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay at the very back of the building in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms 95 ",
