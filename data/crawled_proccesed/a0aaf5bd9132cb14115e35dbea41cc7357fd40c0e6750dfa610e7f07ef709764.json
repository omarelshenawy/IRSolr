			"previous": " Species that are morphologically similar to the broad billed parrot such as the hyacinth macaw and the palm cockatoo may provide insight into its ecology Anodorhynchus macaws which are habitual ground dwellers eat very hard palm nuts 5 Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this Similarly in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings 5 Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius and that the broad billed parrot with its macaw like beak depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds 26 Many types of palms and palm like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad billed parrot may have eaten including Latania loddigesii Mimusops maxima Sideroxylon grandiflorum Diospyros egrettorium and Pandanus utilis 5 ",
			"after": " On the basis of radiographs D T Holyoak claimed that the mandible of the broad billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested that it would have fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds 27 As evidence he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered which he attributed to its delicateness 28 G A Smith however pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of strong jawed parrots based on radiographs Cyanorhamphus Melopsittacus Neophema and Psephotus actually have weak jaws in life and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength 29 Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot the hyacinth macaw which cracks open palm nuts with ease It is therefore probable that the broad billed parrot fed in the same manner 30 ",
