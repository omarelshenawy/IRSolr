			"after": " A primary feature of the Rosetta home graphical user interface GUI is a screensaver which shows a current workunit s progress during the simulated protein folding process In the upper left of the current screensaver the target protein is shown adopting different shapes conformations in its search for the lowest energy structure Depicted immediately to the right is the structure of the most recently accepted On the upper right the lowest energy conformation of the current decoy is shown below that is the true or native structure of the protein if it has already been determined Three graphs are included in the screensaver Near the middle a graph for the accepted model s free energy is displayed which fluctuates as the accepted model changes A graph of the accepted model s root mean square deviation RMSD which measures how structurally similar the accepted model is to the native model is shown far right On the right of the accepted energy graph and below the RMSD graph the results from these two functions are used to produce an energy vs RMSD plot as the model is progressively refined 11 ",
