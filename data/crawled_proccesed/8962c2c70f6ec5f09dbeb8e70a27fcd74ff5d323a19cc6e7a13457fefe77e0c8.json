			"previous": " The typical Chinese navigational compass was in the form of a magnetic needle floating in a bowl of water 32 According to Needham the Chinese in the Song Dynasty and continuing Yuan Dynasty did make use of a dry compass although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass 33 Evidence of this is found in the Shilin guangji Guide Through the Forest of Affairs published in 1325 by Chen Yuanjing although its compilation had taken place between 1100 and 1250 33 The dry compass in China was a dry suspension compass a wooden frame crafted in the shape of a turtle hung upside down by a board with the lodestone sealed in by wax and if rotated the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction 33 Although the European compass card in box frame and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by Japanese pirates in the 16th century who had in turn learned of it from Europeans 34 the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century 35 However according to Kreutz there is only a single Chinese reference to a dry mounted needle built into a pivoted wooden tortoise which is dated to between 1150 and 1250 and claims that there is no clear indication that Chinese mariners ever used anything but the floating needle in a bowl until the 16th century 32 ",
