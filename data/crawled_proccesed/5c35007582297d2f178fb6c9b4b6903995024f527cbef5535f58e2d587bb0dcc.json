			"after": " Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School Wheelock had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution primarily because its location was far from tribal territories In seeking to expand the school into a college Wheelock relocated it to Hanover in the Province of New Hampshire The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter The Royal Governor of New Hampshire John Wentworth provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13 1769 issued the charter in the name of King George III establishing the College That charter created a college for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading writing all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School s unspent trust funds Named for William Legge 2nd Earl of Dartmouth an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock s earlier efforts but who in fact opposed creation of the College and never donated to it Dartmouth is the nation s ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule 16 The College granted its first degrees in 1771 17 ",
