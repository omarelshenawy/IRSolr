			"previous": " When Tyrannosaurus rex was first discovered the humerus was the only element of the forelimb known 66 For the initial mounted skeleton as seen by the public in 1915 Osborn substituted longer three fingered forelimbs like those of Allosaurus 67 However a year earlier Lawrence Lambe described the short two fingered forelimbs of the closely related Gorgosaurus 68 This strongly suggested that Tyrannosaurus rex had similar forelimbs but this hypothesis was not confirmed until the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex forelimbs were identified in 1989 belonging to MOR 555 the Wankel rex 69 The remains of Sue also include complete forelimbs 20 Tyrannosaurus rex arms are very small relative to overall body size measuring only 1 metre 3 3 ft long and some scholars have labelled them as vestigial However the bones show large areas for muscle attachment indicating considerable strength This was recognized as early as 1906 by Osborn who speculated that the forelimbs may have been used to grasp a mate during copulation 70 It has also been suggested that the forelimbs were used to assist the animal in rising from a prone position 63 ",
			"after": " Another possibility is that the forelimbs held struggling prey while it was killed by the tyrannosaur s enormous jaws This hypothesis may be supported by biomechanical analysis Tyrannosaurus rex forelimb bones exhibit extremely thick cortical bone which have been interpreted as evidence that they were developed to withstand heavy loads The biceps brachii muscle of a full grown Tyrannosaurus rex was capable of lifting 199 kilograms 439 lb by itself other muscles such as the brachialis would work along with the biceps to make elbow flexion even more powerful The M biceps muscle of T rex was 3 5 times as powerful as the human equivalent A Tyrannosaurus rex forearm had a limited range of motion with the shoulder and elbow joints allowing only 40 and 45 degrees of motion respectively In contrast the same two joints in Deinonychus allow up to 88 and 130 degrees of motion respectively while a human arm can rotate 360 degrees at the shoulder and move through 165 degrees at the elbow The heavy build of the arm bones strength of the muscles and limited range of motion may indicate a system evolved to hold fast despite the stresses of a struggling prey animal In the first detailed scientific description of Tyrannosaurus forelimbs paleontologists Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that Tyrannosaurus rex was an obligate scavenger 71 ",
