			"previous": " The resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor 8 that turns light into discrete signals The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor the larger the value that is read for that pixel Depending on the physical structure of the sensor a color filter array may be used which requires demosaicing to recreate a full color image The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera s pixel count In a typical sensor the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns For example a 1 000 by 1 000 pixel sensor would have 1 000 000 pixels or 1 megapixel ",
			"after": " Since the first digital backs were introduced there have been three main methods of capturing the image each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters ",
