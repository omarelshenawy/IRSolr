			"previous": " Perpetuating the religious family cult with many descendants was coupled with the notion that producing more children offered the family a layer of protection reinforcing its power in the community 142 More children meant better odds of extending a family s power through marriage alliance with other prominent families as well as better odds of having a child occupying a prestigious administrative post in government 143 Hymes notes that elite families used such standards as official standing or wealth prospects for office length of pedigree scholarly renown and local reputation in choosing both sons in law and daughters in law 144 Since official promotion was considered by examination degree as well as recommendation to office by a superior a family that acquired a significant amount of sons in law of high rank in the bureaucracy ensured kinship protection and prestigious career options for its members 145 Those who came from noteworthy families were treated with dignity and a wider family influence meant a better chance for an individual to secure his own fortunes 141 No one was better prepared for society than one who gained plenty of experience in dealing with the members of his extended family as it was common for upper class families to have several generations living in the same household 146 However one did not even have to share the same bloodline with others in order to build more social ties in their community This could be done by accepting any number of artificial blood brothers in a ceremony assuring mutual obligations and shared loyalty 141 ",
			"after": " In Song society governed by the largely unaltered Tang era legal code the act of primogeniture was not practiced in Chinese inheritance of property and in fact was illegal 150 When the head of a family died his offspring equally divided the property 150 This law was implemented in the Tang dynasty in order to challenge the powerful aristocratic clans of the northwest and to prevent the rise of a society domineered by landed nobility 150 If an official family did not produce another official within a few generations the future prospects of that family remaining wealthy and influential became uncertain 151 Thus the legal issues of familial inheritance had profound effects upon the rest of society ",
