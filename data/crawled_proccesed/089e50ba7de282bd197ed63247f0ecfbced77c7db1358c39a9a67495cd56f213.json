			"previous": " Following the surrender of New France to the United Kingdom in the 1763 Treaty of Paris Canada was governed according to the Royal Proclamation issued by King George III in that same year To this law was added the Quebec Act by which the power to make ordinances was granted to a Governor in Council both bodies appointed by the British monarch in London In 1791 the Province of Quebec was divided into Upper and Lower Canada each with an elected legislative assembly an appointed legislative council and the relevant governor mirroring the parliamentary structure at Westminster During the War of 1812 American troops set fire to the buildings of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in York now Toronto In 1841 the British government united the two Canadas into the Province of Canada with a single legislature composed of again an assembly council and governor general the 84 members of the lower chamber were equally divided amongst the two former provinces though Lower Canada had a higher population The governor still held significant personal influence over Canadian affairs until 1848 when responsible government was implemented in Canada The actual site of the parliament shifted on a regular basis From 1841 to 1844 it sat in Kingston where the present Kingston General Hospital now stands from 1844 until the 1849 fire that destroyed the building the legislature was in Montreal and after a few years of alternating between Toronto and Quebec City In 1866 the legislature was finally moved to Ottawa Queen Victoria having chosen that city as Canada s capital in 1857 ",
			"after": " The modern day Parliament of Canada came into existence in 1867 in which year the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland passed the British North America Act 1867 uniting the provinces of New Brunswick Nova Scotia and Canada with the Province of Canada split into Quebec and Ontario into a single federation called the Dominion of Canada Though the form of the new federal legislature was again nearly identical to the parliament of the United Kingdom the decision to retain this model was made with heavy influence from the just concluded American Civil War which indicated to many Canadians the faults of the American federal system with its relatively powerful states and a less powerful federal government The British North America Act limited the powers of the provinces providing that all subjects not explicitly delegated to them by that document remain within the authority of the federal parliament while simultaneously giving the provinces unique powers in certain agreed upon areas of funding ",
