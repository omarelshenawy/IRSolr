			"after": " The visual quality of silent movies especially those produced in the 1920s was often high However there is a widely held misconception that these films were primitive and barely watchable by modern standards 6 This misconception comes as a result of silent films being played back at wrong speed and their deteriorated condition Many silent films exist only in second or third generation copies often copied from already damaged and neglected film stock 5 ",
