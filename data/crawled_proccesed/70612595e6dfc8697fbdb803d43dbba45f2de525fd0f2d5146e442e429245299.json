			"after": " Palm wine called bunuk or bounouk in the Jola language is an alcoholic drink derived from the natural fermentation of palm sap so is not strictly a wine which is produced by the fermentation of grapes The recent partial Islamization of the region has not challenged its consumption Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men Supported by a strap the harvester climbs the tree cuts the bud and holds out a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated calabash or more recently a bottle The alcohol content of palm wine develops throughout the day The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city Many Jola proverbs attest the popularity of the drink such as Bunuk abajut birto which means With palm wine one never stands up or Ulako kumusaet j gabulaju which means Sit down don t spill the palm wine 114 ",
