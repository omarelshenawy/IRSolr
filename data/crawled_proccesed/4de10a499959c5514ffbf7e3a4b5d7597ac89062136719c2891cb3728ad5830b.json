			"after": " With the coming of the Communist Revolution in 1949 new interpretations again surfaced The establishment of the new revolutionary regime prompted another re evaluation of the First Emperor this time in accordance with Maoist thought The new interpretation given of Qin Shi Huang was generally a combination of traditional and modern views but essentially critical This is exemplified in the Complete History of China which was compiled in September 1955 as an official survey of Chinese history The work described the First Emperor s major steps toward unification and standardisation as corresponding to the interests of the ruling group and the merchant class not the nation or the people and the subsequent fall of his dynasty as a manifestation of the class struggle The perennial debate about the fall of the Qin Dynasty was also explained in Marxist terms the peasant rebellions being a revolt against oppression a revolt which undermined the dynasty but which was bound to fail because of a compromise with landlord class elements ",
