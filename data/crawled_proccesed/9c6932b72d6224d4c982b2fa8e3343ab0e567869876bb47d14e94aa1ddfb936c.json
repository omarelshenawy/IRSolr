			"after": " Adult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks trunks and size but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as wolves cave hyenas and large felines The tusks may also have been used in intra species fighting such as territorial fights or fights over mates Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females and to intimidate rivals Because of their curvature the tusks were not suitable for stabbing but may have been used for hitting as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail enabling its use as a flyswatter similar to the tail on modern elephants As in modern elephants the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb like organ with many functions It was used for manipulating objects and in social interactions 45 The well preserved foot of the adult male Yukagir mammoth shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion Like modern elephants woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large fleshy pads behind the toes 33 ",
