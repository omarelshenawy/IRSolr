			"previous": " In polygynous species males will try to monopolize and mate with multiple females As with monogamy polygyny in rodents can come in two forms defense and non defense Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow bellied marmots California ground squirrels Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson s ground squirrels Males with territories are known as resident males and the females that live within the territories are known as resident females In the case of marmots resident males do not appear to ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding In species with non defense polygyny males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize These males establish dominance hierarchies with the high ranking males having access to the most females This occurs in species like Belding s ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species 66 ",
			"after": " Promiscuity in which both males and females mate with multiple partners also occurs in rodents In species such as the white footed mouse females give birth to litters with multiple paternities Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles In the Cape ground squirrel the male s testes can be 20 percent of its head body length 66 Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy polygyny and promiscuity 66 ",
