			"previous": " In the early 1860s four young painters Claude Monet Pierre Auguste Renoir Alfred Sisley and Fr d ric Bazille met while studying under the academic artist Charles Gleyre They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid century they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio as was the usual custom 4 By painting in sunlight directly from nature and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the Realism of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school A favourite meeting place for the artists was the Caf Guerbois on Avenue de Clichy in Paris where the discussions were often led by douard Manet whom the younger artists greatly admired They were soon joined by Camille Pissarro Paul C zanne and Armand Guillaumin 5 ",
			"after": " During the 1860s the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style 6 In 1863 the Salon jury rejected Manet s The Luncheon on the Grass Le d jeuner sur l herbe primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting 7 The jury s severely worded rejection of Manet s painting appalled his admirers and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists ",
