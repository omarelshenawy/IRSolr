			"previous": " A similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel Fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading ",
			"after": " A magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole which is approximately 1 000 miles from the true geographic North Pole A magnetic compass s user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation Variation is defined as the angle between the direction of true geographic north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914 103 Deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself Mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation hence they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing They then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again graphing their results In this way correction tables could be created which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations ",
