			"after": " For decades after Libby performed the first radiocarbon dating experiments the only way to measure the 14 C in a sample was to detect the radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms 45 In this approach what is measured is the activity in number of decay events per unit mass per time period of the sample 46 This method is also known as beta counting because it is the beta particles emitted by the decaying 14 C atoms that are detected 49 In the late 1970s an alternative approach became available directly counting the number of 14 C and 12 C atoms in a given sample via accelerator mass spectrometry usually referred to as AMS 45 AMS counts the 14 C 12 C ratio directly instead of the activity of the sample but measurements of activity and 14 C 12 C ratio can be converted into each other exactly 46 For some time beta counting methods were more accurate than AMS but as of 2014 AMS is more accurate and has become the method of choice for radiocarbon measurements 50 51 In addition to improved accuracy AMS has two further significant advantages over beta counting it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting and it is much faster an accuracy of 1 can be achieved in minutes with AMS which is far quicker than would be achievable with the older technology 52 ",
