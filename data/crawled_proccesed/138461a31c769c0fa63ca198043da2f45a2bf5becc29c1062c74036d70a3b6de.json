			"after": " Lesbian is a term most widely used in the English language to describe sexual and romantic desire between females Lesbian as a concept is used to differentiate women with a shared sexual orientation and the concept is a 20th century construct Throughout history women have not had the freedom or independence to pursue homosexual relationships where men have However they also have not met the same harsh punishment in some societies as homosexual men In the past lesbian relationships were sometimes regarded as harmless unless the participants attempted to pursue privileges traditionally enjoyed by their peers As a result little in history has been documented to give an accurate description of how female homosexuality has been expressed When early sexologists in the late 19th century began to categorize and describe homosexual behavior hampered by a lack of knowledge about lesbianism or women s sexuality they distinguished lesbians as women who did not adhere to female gender roles and designated them mentally ill Women in homosexual relationships responded to this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States Women exhibit sexual fluidity some women who engage in homosexual behavior may reject identifying as lesbian or as bisexuall Greater understanding of women s sexuality has led to three components to identifying lesbians sexual behavior sexual desire or sexual identity ",
