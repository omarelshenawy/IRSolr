			"previous": " Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City for example was created by John Taylor Johnston a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum But despite all this at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status ",
			"after": " There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold It is necessary to present something more than mere objects 53 said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art video art and conceptual art The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind or was simply an idea it could not be bought and sold Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid 1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form have endeavored to undermine the art object qua object 54 ",
