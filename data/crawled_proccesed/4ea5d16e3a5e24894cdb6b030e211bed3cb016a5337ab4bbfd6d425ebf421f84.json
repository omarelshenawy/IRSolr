			"previous": " Modern evidence indicates that even non avian dinosaurs and birds thrived in cooler temperate climates and that at least some early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means aided by the animals bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species Evidence of endothermy in Mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica as well as analysis of blood vessel structures within fossil bones that are typical of endotherms Scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved 108 ",
			"after": " In saurischian dinosaurs higher metabolisms were supported by the evolution of the avian respiratory system characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton making them hollow 109 Early avian style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism which is essential for animals that are active but too large to get rid of all the excess heat through their skin 110 ",
