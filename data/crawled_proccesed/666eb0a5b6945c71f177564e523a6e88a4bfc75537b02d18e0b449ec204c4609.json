			"after": " Alcibiades was a prominent Athenian statesman orator and general The last famous member of an aristocratic family that fell from prominence after the Peloponnesian War he played a major role in the second half of that conflict as a strategic advisor military commander and politician During the course of the Peloponnesian War Alcibiades changed his allegiance on several occasions In his native Athens in the early 410s BC he advocated for an aggressive foreign policy and was a prominent proponent of the Sicilian Expedition but fled to Sparta after his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him In the years that he served Sparta Alcibiades played a crucial role in Athens undoing the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision Once restored to his native city however he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens He favored unconventional tactics frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege Alcibiades military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state currently held his allegiance but his capacity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long and by the end of the war that he had helped rekindle in the early 410s his days of political relevance were a bygone memory ",
