			"previous": " Often the stoichiometry matrix is combined with the rate vector and the species vector to form a compact equation describing the rates of change of the molecular species  where the rows correspond to S1 S2 S3 S4 and S5 respectively Note that the process of converting a reaction scheme into a stoichiometry matrix can be a lossy transformation for example the stoichiometries in the second reaction simplify when included in the matrix This means that it is not always possible to recover the original reaction scheme from a stoichiometry matrix ",
			"after": " Gas stoichiometry is the quantitative relationship ratio between reactants and products in a chemical reaction with reactions that produce gases Gas stoichiometry applies when the gases produced are assumed to be ideal and the temperature pressure and volume of the gases are all known The ideal gas law is used for these calculations Often but not always the standard temperature and pressure STP are taken as 0 C and 1 bar and used as the conditions for gas stoichiometric calculations ",
