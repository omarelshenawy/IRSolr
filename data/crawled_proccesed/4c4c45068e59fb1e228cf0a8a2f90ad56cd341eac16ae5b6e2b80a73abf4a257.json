			"previous": " As flight speed builds up after take off the ram rise in the intake starts to have a significant effect upon nozzle pressure temperature and intake airflow causing nozzle gross thrust to climb more rapidly This term now starts to offset the still increasing ram drag eventually causing net thrust to start to increase In some engines the net thrust at say Mach 1 0 sea level can even be slightly greater than the static thrust Above Mach 1 0 with a subsonic inlet design shock losses tend to decrease net thrust however a suitably designed supersonic inlet can give a lower reduction in intake pressure recovery allowing net thrust to continue to climb in the supersonic regime ",
