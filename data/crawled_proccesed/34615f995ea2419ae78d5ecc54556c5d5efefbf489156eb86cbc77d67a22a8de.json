			"previous": " As many as 13 now extinct species of macaw have variously been suggested to have lived on the Caribbean islands but many of these were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species Only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains the Cuban macaw and the Saint Croix macaw Ara autochthones which is known only from subfossils 9 Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both in historic times by Europeans and natives and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans Historical records of macaws on these islands therefore may not have represented distinct endemic species it is also possible that they were escaped or feral foreign macaws that had been transported to the islands 9 All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times 8 The identity of these macaws is only likely to be further resolved through fossil finds and examination of contemporary reports and artwork 2 ",
			"after": " The Jamaican red macaw Ara gossei was named by Walter Rothschild in 1905 on the basis of a description of a specimen shot in 1765 It was described as being similar to the Cuban macaw mainly differing in having a yellow forehead Some researchers believe the specimen described may have been a feral Cuban macaw 2 A stylised 1765 painting of a macaw by Lt L J Robins published in a volume called The Natural History of Jamaica matches the Cuban macaw and may show a specimen that had been imported there however it has also been claimed that the painting shows the Jamaican red macaw 9 10 ",
