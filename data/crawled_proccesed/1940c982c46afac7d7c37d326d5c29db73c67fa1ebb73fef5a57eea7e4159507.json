			"previous": " More than 30 000 artifacts from Kronan have been salvaged and cataloged ranging from bronze cannons of up to four tonnes to small eggshell fragments 63 There have been several discoveries of considerable importance and some of unique historical and archaeological value One of the first finds was a small table cabinet with nine drawers containing navigational instruments pipe cleaning tools cutlery and writing utensils which most likely belonged to one of the officers 64 As a flagship Kronan carried a large amount of cash in the form of silver coins Besides wages for the crew a war chest was required for large unforeseen expenses In 1982 a collection of 255 gold coins was found most of them ducats The origin of the individual coins varied considerably with locations such as Cairo Reval modern day Tallinn and Seville Another 46 ducats were found in 2000 65 The coin collection is probably the largest gold treasure ever encountered on Swedish soil though it was not enough to cover large expenses which has led to the assumption that they were the personal property of Admiral Lorentz Creutz 66 In 1989 more than 900 silver coins were found in the remains of the orlop at the time the largest silver coin collection ever discovered in Sweden In 2005 a much larger cache of nearly 6 200 coins was uncovered and in 2006 yet another with more than 7 000 coins 67 The silver treasure of 2005 consisted almost entirely of 4 re coins minted in 1675 which represented over 1 of the entire production of 4 re coins of that year 68 ",
			"after": " Several musical instruments have been found including a trumpet three violins and a viola da gamba all expensive objects that probably belonged to either the officers or the trumpeters One of the trumpeters on board was a member of the admiral s musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine German made instruments belonged to him Another remnant of the officers personal stores was discovered in 1997 consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices including ginger plums grapes and cinnamon quills 69 ",
