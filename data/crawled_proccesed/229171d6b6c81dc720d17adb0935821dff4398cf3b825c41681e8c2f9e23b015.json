			"after": " Jardine planned to use Verity to contain the batsmen and prevent them scoring runs while the fast bowlers rested 53 However Verity was not expected to be a big success on the tour The good batting conditions the aggressive Australian approach to playing spin bowlers and Verity s lack of experience led critics to dismiss his potential contribution to the English bowling attack 54 but Verity had a successful start to the tour Assisted by overnight rain he took seven for 37 including the wicket of Don Bradman against a Combined XI comprising some of the best Australian players 55 56 In the following game against South Australia Verity took eight wickets including five for 42 in the second innings 57 By now the press had begun to pay attention to Verity s achievements and former Australian batsman Clem Hill expressed his admiration for Verity 58 59 Selected for the first Test on the strength of his early tour performances Verity bowled just 17 overs in the game mainly being used to give the fast bowlers a rest He did not take any wickets and Verity himself believed he had bowled poorly 60 England won the match using Bodyline tactics which had first been used earlier in the tour 61 After the Test the tourists travelled to Tasmania to play two matches against the state team Verity played in the second and although rain interrupted play restricting Verity to five overs he scored his first half century in first class cricket 27 62 However he was left out of the team for the second Test and was replaced by Bill Bowes England played four fast bowlers but Jardine had misjudged the playing surface the Australian spinners were very effective on a slow paced pitch and Australia levelled the series 63 64 ",
