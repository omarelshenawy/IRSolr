			"previous": " Following the Norman conquest of England Poole rapidly grew into a busy port as the importance of Wareham declined 10 The town was part of the manor of Canford but does not exist as an identifiable entry in the Domesday Book 11 The earliest written mention of Poole occurred on a document from 1196 describing the newly built St James s Chapel in La Pole 12 The Lord of the Manor Sir William Longsp e sold a charter of liberties to the burgesses of Poole in 1248 to raise funds for his participation in the Seventh Crusade 7 Consequently Poole gained a small measure of freedom from feudal rule and acquired the right to appoint a mayor and hold a court within town Poole s growing importance was recognised in 1433 when it was awarded staple port status by King Henry VI enabling the port to begin exporting wool and in turn granting a licence for the construction of a town wall 13 In 1568 Poole gained further autonomy when it was granted legal independence from Dorset and made a county corporate by the Great Charter of Elizabeth I 14 During the English Civil War Poole s puritan stance and its merchants opposition to the ship money tax introduced by King Charles I led to the town declaring for Parliament 15 Poole escaped any large scale attack and with the Royalists on the brink of defeat in 1646 the Parliamentary garrison from Poole laid siege to and captured the nearby Royalist stronghold at Corfe Castle 16 17 ",
			"after": " Poole established successful commerce with the North American colonies in the 16th century including the important fisheries of Newfoundland 14 The trade with Newfoundland grew steadily to meet the demand for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe Poole s share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century The trade was a three cornered route ships sailed to Newfoundland with salt and provisions then carried dried and salted fish to Europe before returning to Poole with wine olive oil and salt 18 By the early 18th century Poole had more ships trading with North America than any other English port and vast wealth was brought to Poole s merchants 19 This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town where many of the medieval buildings were replaced with Georgian mansions and terraced housing 18 20 The end of the Napoleonic Wars and the conclusion of the War of 1812 ended Britain s monopoly over the Newfoundland fisheries and other nations took over services provided by Poole s merchants at a lower cost Poole s Newfoundland trade rapidly declined and within a decade most merchants had ceased trading 21 22 ",
