			"previous": " The training of the boys was rigorous The regimen of one singing school in Rome c 1700 consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces one hour practising trills one hour practising ornamented passaggi one hour of singing exercises in their teacher s presence and in front of a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces and one hour of literary study all this moreover before lunch After half an hour would be devoted to musical theory another to writing counterpoint an hour copying down the same from dictation and another hour of literary study During the remainder of the day the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing and to compose vocal music either sacred or secular depending on their inclination 10 This demanding schedule meant that if sufficiently talented they were able to make a debut in their mid teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match ",
			"after": " In the 1720s and 1730s at the height of the craze for these voices it has been estimated that upwards of 4 000 boys were castrated annually in the service of art 11 Many came from poor homes and were castrated by their parents in the hope that their child might be successful and lift them from poverty this was the case with Senesino There are though records of some young boys asking to be operated on to preserve their voices e g Caffarelli who was from a wealthy family his grandmother gave him the income from two vineyards to pay for his studies 12 Caffarelli was also typical of many castrati in being famous for tantrums on and off stage and for amorous adventures with noble ladies 13 Some as described by Casanova preferred gentlemen noble or otherwise 14 Modern endocrinology would suggest that the castrati s much vaunted sexual prowess was more the stuff of legend than reality in addition to lacking a hormonal but not a socio psychological sex drive a castrato s remaining genitalia will not develop in size 15 Only a small percentage of boys castrated to preserve their voices had successful careers on the operatic stage the better also rans sang in cathedral or church choirs but because of their marked appearance and the ban on their marrying there was little room for them in society outside a musical context 16 ",
