			"after": " One example of a quantum interference phenomenon that arises from superposition is the double slit experiment The photon state is a superposition of two different states one of which corresponds to the photon having passed through the left slit and the other corresponding to passage through the right slit The relative phase of those two states has a value which depends on the distance from each of the two slits Depending on what that phase is the interference is constructive at some locations and destructive in others creating the interference pattern By the analogy with coherence in other wave phenomena a superposed state can be referred to as a coherent superposition ",
