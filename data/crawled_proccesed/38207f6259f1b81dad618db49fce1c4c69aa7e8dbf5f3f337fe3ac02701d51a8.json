			"previous": " The party s nominal Deputy Leader was Rudolf Hess but he had no real power in the party By the early 1930s the senior leaders of the party after Hitler were Himmler Goebbels and G ring Beneath the Leadership Corps were the party s regional leaders the Gauleiters each of whom commanded the party in his Gau region Joseph Goebbels began his ascent through the party hierarchy as Gauleiter of Berlin Brandenburg in 1926 Streicher was Gauleiter of Franconia where he published his antisemitic newspaper Der St rmer Beneath the Gauleiter were lower level officials the Kreisleiter county leaders Zellenleiter cell leaders and Blockleiter block leaders This was a strictly hierarchical structure in which orders flowed from the top and unquestioning loyalty was given to superiors Only the SA retained some autonomy Being composed largely of unemployed workers many SA men took the Nazis socialist rhetoric seriously At this time the Hitler salute borrowed from the Italian fascists and the greeting Heil Hitler were adopted throughout the party ",
			"after": " The Nazis contested elections to the national parliament the Reichstag and to the state legislatures the Landtags from 1924 although at first with little success The National Socialist Freedom Movement polled 3 of the vote in the December 1924 Reichstag elections and this fell to 2 6 in 1928 State elections produced similar results Despite these poor results and despite Germany s relative political stability and prosperity during the later 1920s the Nazi Party continued to grow This was partly because Hitler who had no administrative ability left the party organization to the head of the secretariat Philipp Bouhler the party treasurer Franz Xaver Schwarz and business manager Max Amann The party had a capable propaganda head in Gregor Strasser who was promoted to national organizational leader in January 1928 These men gave the party efficient recruitment and organizational structures The party also owed its growth to the gradual fading away of competitor nationalist groups such as the German National People s Party DNVP As Hitler became the recognized head of the German nationalists other groups declined or were absorbed ",
