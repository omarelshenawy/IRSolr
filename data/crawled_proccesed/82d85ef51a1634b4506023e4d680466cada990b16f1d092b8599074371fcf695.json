			"previous": " An area of current investigation in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations 206 This research addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features 207 These studies have shown that evolution can alter development to produce new structures such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals 208 It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles 209 It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes 210 ",
			"after": " Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation When the interaction is between pairs of species such as a pathogen and a host or a predator and its prey these species can develop matched sets of adaptations Here the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species These changes in the second species then in turn cause new adaptations in the first species This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution 211 An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough skinned newt and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator the common garter snake In this predator prey pair an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake 212 ",
