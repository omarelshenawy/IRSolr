			"previous": " Archaeological evidence shows that Senecio had been rebuilding the defences of Hadrian s Wall and the forts beyond it and Severus s arrival in Britain prompted the enemy tribes to sue for peace immediately The emperor had not come all that way to leave without a victory however and it is likely that he wished to provide his teenage sons Caracalla and Geta with first hand experience of controlling a hostile barbarian land ",
			"after": " An invasion of Caledonia led by Severus and probably numbering around 20 000 troops moved north in 208 or 209 crossing the Wall and passing through eastern Scotland on a route similar to that used by Agricola Harried by punishing guerrilla raids by the northern tribes and slowed by an unforgiving terrain Severus was unable to meet the Caledonians on a battlefield The emperor s forces pushed north as far as the River Tay but little appears to have been achieved by the invasion as peace treaties were signed with the Caledonians By 210 Severus had returned to York and the frontier had once again become Hadrian s Wall He assumed the title Britannicus but the title meant little with regard to the unconquered north which clearly remained outside the authority of the Empire Almost immediately another northern tribe the Maeatae again went to war Caracalla left with a punitive expedition but by the following year his ailing father had died and he and his brother left the province to press their claim to the throne ",
