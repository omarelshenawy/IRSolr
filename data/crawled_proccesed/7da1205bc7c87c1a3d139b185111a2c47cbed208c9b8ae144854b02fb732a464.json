			"after": " Starfish are keystone species in their respective marine communities Their relatively large sizes diverse diets and ability to adapt to different environments makes them ecologically important 61 The term keystone species was in fact first used by Robert Paine in 1966 to describe a starfish Pisaster ochraceus 62 When studying the low intertidal coasts of Washington state Paine found that predation by P ochraceus was a major factor in the diversity of species Experimental removals of this top predator from a stretch of shoreline resulted in lower species diversity and the eventual domination of Mytilus mussels which were able to outcompete other organisms for space and resources 63 Similar results were found in a 1971 study of Stichaster australis on the intertidal coast of the South Island of New Zealand S australis was found to have removed most of a batch of transplanted mussels within two or three months of their placement while in an area from which S australis had been removed the mussels increased in number dramatically overwhelming the area and threatening biodiversity 64 ",
