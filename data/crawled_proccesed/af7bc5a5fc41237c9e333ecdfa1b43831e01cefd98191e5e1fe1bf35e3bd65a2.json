			"previous": " Heavy usage of the new generation of drum machines such as the Oberheim DMX and Roland 808 models was a characteristic of many 1980s songs To this day the 808 kickdrum is traditionally used by hip hop producers Over time sampling technology became more advanced however earlier producers such as Marley Marl used drum machines to construct their beats from small excerpts of other beats in synchronisation in his case triggering 3 Korg sampling delay units through an 808 Later samplers such as the E mu SP 1200 allowed not only more memory but more flexibility for creative production This allowed the filtration and layering different hits and with a possibility of re sequencing them into a single piece ",
