			"previous": " The single seat F 15C and two seat F 15D models entered production in 1978 and conducted their first flights in February and June of that year 30 These models were fitted with the Production Eagle Package PEP 2000 which included 2 000 lb 900 kg of additional internal fuel provisions for exterior conformal fuel tanks and an increased maximum takeoff weight of up to 68 000 lb 30 700 kg 31 The increased takeoff weight allows internal fuel a full weapons load conformal fuel tanks and three external fuel tanks to be carried The APG 63 radar uses a programmable signal processor PSP enabling the radar to be reprogrammable for additional purposes such as the addition of new armaments and equipment The PSP was the first of its kind in the world and the upgraded APG 63 radar was the first radar to use it Other improvements included strengthened landing gear a new digital central computer 32 and an overload warning system which allows the pilot to fly up to 9 g at all weights 30 ",
			"after": " The F 15 Multistage Improvement Program MSIP was initiated in February 1983 with the first production MSIP F 15C produced in 1985 Improvements included an upgraded central computer a Programmable Armament Control Set allowing for advanced versions of the AIM 7 AIM 9 and AIM 120A missiles and an expanded Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR 56C radar warning receiver and ALQ 135 countermeasure set The final 43 F 15Cs included the Hughes APG 70 radar developed for the F 15E these are sometimes referred as Enhanced Eagles Earlier MSIP F 15Cs with the APG 63 were upgraded to the APG 63 V 1 to improve maintainability and to perform similar to the APG 70 Existing F 15s were retrofitted with these improvements 33 ",
