			"after": " At Christmas 1085 William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout the kingdom organised by counties It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder grouped by owners The listings describe the holding who owned the land before the Conquest its value what the tax assessment was and usually the number of peasants ploughs and any other resources the holding had Towns were listed separately All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086 when the Anglo Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath a renewal of their oaths of allegiance 135 William s exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear but it probably had several purposes such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation 2 ",
