			"after": " Guinea pigs called cuy cuye or cur were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes Traditionally the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands but since the 1960s it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people 152 It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador mainly in the Sierra and Colombia 153 Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals such as pigs and cattle 154 moreover they can be raised in an urban environment Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large scale municipal fairs 155 Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken 7 156 The animal may be served fried chactado or frito broiled asado or roasted al horno and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee 157 Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy a soup dish 157 Pachamanca or huatia a process similar to barbecueing is also popular and is usually served with corn beer chicha in traditional settings 157 ",
