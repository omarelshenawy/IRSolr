			"previous": " William sent an advance party to prepare the city for his entrance to celebrate his victory and found a castle in the words of William s biographer William of Poitiers certain fortifications were completed in the city against the restlessness of the huge and brutal populace For he William realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the Londoners 53 At the time London was the largest town in England the foundation of Westminster Abbey and the old Palace of Westminster under Edward the Confessor had marked it as a centre of governance and with a prosperous port it was important for the Normans to establish control over the settlement 57 The other two castles in London Baynard s Castle and Montfichet s Castle were established at the same time 61 The fortification that would later become known as the Tower of London was built onto the south east corner of the Roman town walls using them as prefabricated defences with the River Thames providing additional protection from the south 53 This earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade and probably had accommodation suitable for William 62 ",
			"after": " Most of the early Norman castles were built from timber but by the end of the 11th century a few including the Tower of London had been renovated or replaced with stone 61 Work on the White Tower which gives the whole castle its name 12 is usually considered to have begun in 1078 however the exact date is uncertain William made Gundulf Bishop of Rochester responsible for its construction although it may not have been completed until after William s death in 1087 12 The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England and was the strongest point of the early castle It also contained grand accommodation for the king 63 At the latest it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there 19 nb 2 Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower he was also the first person to escape from it using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine He was held in luxury and permitted servants but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors After plying them with drink when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber and out of the Tower The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft 65 ",
