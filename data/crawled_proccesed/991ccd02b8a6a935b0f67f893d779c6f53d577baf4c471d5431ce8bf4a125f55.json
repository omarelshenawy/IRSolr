			"previous": " A major development of this period was the appearance of stellate star shaped shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti In all three cases the shrine is a 16 pointed uninterrupted star a ground plan not found anywhere else in India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32 pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India 43 ",
			"after": " The stellate plan found popularity in the soapstone constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32 pointed interrupted types No temples of the 6 12 or 24 pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India with the exception of the unique temple at Dambal which can be described either as a 24 pointed uninterrupted plan or a 48 pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees 44 The upper tiers of the seven tiered superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents 45 The Doddabasappa Temple and the Somesvara Temple at Lakshmeshwara are examples of extreme variants of a basic dravida articulation These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of traditional methods 46 ",
