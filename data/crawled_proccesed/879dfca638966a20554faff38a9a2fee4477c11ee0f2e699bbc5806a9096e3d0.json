			"previous": " The processes required to extract titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly it is not possible to reduce the ore in the normal manner by heating in the presence of carbon as that produces titanium carbide 34 Pure metallic titanium 99 9 was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at 700 800 C in the Hunter process 4 Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it could be produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride TiCl4 with calcium 37 Eight years later he refined this process by using magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process 37 Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes e g FFC Cambridge the Kroll process is still used for commercial production 4 5 ",
			"after": " Titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer discovered the iodide or crystal bar process in 1925 by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal 38 ",
