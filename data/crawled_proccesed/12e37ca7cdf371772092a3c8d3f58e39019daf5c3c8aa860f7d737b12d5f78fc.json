			"previous": " The primary characteristics of this sub generation are the application of advanced digital avionics and aerospace materials modest signature reduction primarily RF stealth and highly integrated systems and weapons These fighters have been designed to operate in a network centric battlefield environment and are principally multirole aircraft Key weapons technologies introduced include beyond visual range BVR AAMs Global Positioning System GPS guided weapons solid state phased array radars helmet mounted sights and improved secure jamming resistant datalinks Thrust vectoring to further improve transient maneuvering capabilities has also been adopted by many 4 5th generation fighters and uprated powerplants have enabled some designs to achieve a degree of supercruise ability Stealth characteristics are focused primarily on frontal aspect radar cross section RCS signature reduction techniques including radar absorbent materials RAM L O coatings and limited shaping techniques ",
			"after": "  Half generation designs are either based on existing airframes or are based on new airframes following similar design theory as previous iterations however these modifications have introduced the structural use of composite materials to reduce weight greater fuel fractions to increase range and signature reduction treatments to achieve lower RCS compared to their predecessors Prime examples of such aircraft which are based on new airframe designs making extensive use of carbon fibre composites include the Eurofighter Typhoon Dassault Rafale and Saab JAS 39 Gripen ",
