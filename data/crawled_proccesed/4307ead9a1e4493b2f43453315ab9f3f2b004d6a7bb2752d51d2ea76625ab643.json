			"previous": " The term represents the momentum thrust which remains constant at a given throttle setting whereas the term represents the pressure thrust term At full throttle the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude the pressure thrust term increases At the surface of the Earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30 depending on the engine design This reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude ",
