			"previous": " Rail services both long distance and commuter used to focus on the former railway station on Moorhouse avenue Commuter trains were progressively cancelled in the 1960s and 1970s The last such service between Christchurch and Rangiora ceased in 1976 After the reduction in services a new Christchurch railway station was established at Addington Junction The Main North Line railway travels northwards via Kaikoura to Picton and is served by the TranzCoastal passenger train while the Main South Line heads to Invercargill via Dunedin and was used by the Southerner until its cancellation in 2002 The most famous train to depart Christchurch is the TranzAlpine which travels along the Main South Line to Rolleston and then turns onto the Midland Line passes through the Southern Alps via the Otira Tunnel and terminates in Greymouth on the West Coast This trip is often regarded as one of the ten great train journeys in the world for the amazing scenery through which it passes The TranzAlpine service is primarily a tourist service and carries no significant commuter traffic ",
