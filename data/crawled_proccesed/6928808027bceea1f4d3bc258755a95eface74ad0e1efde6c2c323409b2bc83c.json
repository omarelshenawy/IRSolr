			"after": " This project involves transcluding AFD discussions in category specific pages that makes it easier for people find a topic they have knowledge and interest in In the past and still in most cases presently these discussions are organized solely by date At one time this level of structure was adequate because there were sufficiently few deletions that a person could review most of them on a daily basis while still contributing as a Wikipedian However Articles for deletion has grown far beyond human scale with a throughput now approaching 1 000 pages per week and rising quickly This has the effect of separating deletion debates from the healthy process of encyclopedia building It is hoped that a workable system for categorized deletion which will bring deletion debates to the attention of editors active in relevant topical areas will alleviate these problems ",
