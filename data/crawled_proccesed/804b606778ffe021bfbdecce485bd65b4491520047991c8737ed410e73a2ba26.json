			"previous": " In 1844 a French Swiss botanist by the name of Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle who created the first Code of Botanical Nomenclature proposed a division of the genus into three sections based on floral morphology He placed in the section Orcheosanthus those species with purple deeply bilabiate corollas with 5 sub equal lobes a short floral tube and a large spur not protruding past this tube He included four species in this section all of them from Mexico P oblongiloba P orchidioides P caudata and P moranensis He excluded P macrophylla H B K on the grounds that it was a dubious species 22 ",
			"after": " The section Orcheosanthus grew as Charles Morren described P flos mulionis in 1872 Eugene Fournier added P sodalium in 1873 and Sander proposed P bakeriana in 1881 2 In 1879 1888 however botanist William Hemsley after studying multiple specimens in herbariums and in culture came to the conclusion that all the taxa placed in the section Orcheosanthus up to that point belonged to the same single species Due to doubts as to the identity of the original two species described by H B K Hemsley decided to use the name P caudata Schltdl for his conglomerate species This name has been indiscriminately applied to members of the complex ever since 23 ",
