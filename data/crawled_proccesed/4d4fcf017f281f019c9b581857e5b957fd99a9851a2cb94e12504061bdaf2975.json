			"previous": " A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young She then graduates to digging and other nest work and later to defending the nest and foraging These changes are sometimes fairly sudden and define what are called temporal castes An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes 56 57 ",
			"after": " Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate Contrary to popular belief some ant nests have multiple queens while others may exist without queens Workers with the ability to reproduce are called gamergates and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies colonies with queens are said to be queen right 58 The winged male ants called drones emerge from pupae along with the breeding females although some species such as army ants have wingless queens and do nothing in life except eat and mate ",
