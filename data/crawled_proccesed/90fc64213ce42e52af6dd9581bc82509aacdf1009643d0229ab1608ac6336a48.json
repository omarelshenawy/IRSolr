			"after": " Wood was undoubtedly the primary material of choice for Viking artists being relatively easy to carve inexpensive and abundant in northern Europe The importance of wood as an artistic medium is underscored by chance survivals of wood artistry at the very beginning and end of the Viking period namely the Oseberg ship burial carvings of the early 9th century and the carved decoration of the Urnes Stave Church from the late 11th century As summarised by Graham Campbell These remarkable survivals allow us to form at least an impression of what we are missing from original corpus of Viking art although wooden fragments and small scale carvings in other materials such as antler amber and walrus ivory provide further hints The same is inevitably true of the textile arts although weaving and embroidery were clearly well developed crafts 3 ",
