			"after": " On many high performance military aircraft the canopy is an integral part of the ejection seat system The pilot cannot be ejected from the aircraft until the canopy is no longer in the path of the ejection seat In most ejection seat equipped aircraft the canopy is blown upwards and rearwards by explosive charges The relative wind then blows the canopy away from the ejection path However on some aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas AV 8B Harrier II the pilot may be forced to eject when in a hover or when going too slow for the relative wind to move the canopy out of the path of the ejection seat In that situation the pilot could possibly impact the canopy when ejecting To overcome that possibility some aircraft have a thin cord of plastic explosive zig zagging across the canopy over the pilot s head In the event of an ejection the explosive cord is activated first shattering the canopy Then the ejection seat and pilot are launched through the shattered canopy ",
