			"previous": " Northern Ireland was created as a division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and until 1972 it was a self governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom was not neutral during the Second World War and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941 Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south One James Joseph Magennis received the Victoria Cross for valour ",
			"after": " Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter communal violence Nationalists mainly Roman Catholic wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic whereas unionists mainly Protestant wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines meaning that the Government of Northern Ireland elected by first past the post from 1929 was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party Over time the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment 79 80 81 ",
