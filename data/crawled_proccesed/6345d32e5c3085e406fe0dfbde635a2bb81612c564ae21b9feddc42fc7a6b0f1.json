			"previous": " The soft mound at the front of the vulva is formed by fatty tissue covering the pubic bone and is called the mons pubis The term mons pubis is Latin for pubic mound and it is gender nonspecific There is however a variant term that specifies gender in human females the mons pubis is often referred to as the mons veneris Latin for mound of Venus or mound of love The mons pubis separates into two folds of skin called the labia majora literally major or large lips The cleft between the labia majora is called the pudendal cleft or cleft of Venus and it contains and protects the other more delicate structures of the vulva The labia majora meet again at a flat area between the pudendal cleft and the anus called the perineum The color of the outside skin of the labia majora is usually close to the overall skin color of the individual although there is considerable variation The inside skin and mucous membrane are often pink or brownish After the onset of puberty the mons pubis and the labia majora become covered by pubic hair This hair sometimes extends to the inner thighs and perineum but the density texture color and extent of pubic hair coverage vary considerably due to both individual variation and cultural practices of hair modification or removal ",
			"after": " The labia minora are two soft folds of skin within the labia majora While labia minora translates as minor or small lips often the minora are of considerable size and may protrude outside the majora Much of the variation among vulvas lies in the significant differences in the size shape and color of the labia minora ",
