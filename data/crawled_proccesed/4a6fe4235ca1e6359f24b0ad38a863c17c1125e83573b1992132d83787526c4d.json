			"after": " The hairpin filter is another structure that uses parallel coupled lines In this case each pair of parallel coupled lines is connected to the next pair by a short link The U shapes so formed give rise to the name hairpin filter In some designs the link can be longer giving a wide hairpin with 4 impedance transformer action between sections 57 58 The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle which produces a large discontinuity and a smooth bend which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available The lumped element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped impedance discontinuity 37 Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph at the top of the article 45 59 ",
