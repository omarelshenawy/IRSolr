			"previous": " Swedish and Danish are considered to have been the same dialect Old East Norse up until the 12th century However some scholars speculate that there might have been certain dialect differences within the Nordic language area as early as the Proto Nordic period 10 The term Swedish is not mentioned specifically in any source until the first half of the 14th century 10 and no standard spoken language had developed in either Sweden or Denmark before 1500 although some scholars argue that there may have been tendencies towards a more formal courteous language among the aristocracy 11 ",
			"after": " Scanian appeared in writing before 1200 12 at a time when Swedish and Danish had yet to be codified and the long struggle between Sweden and Denmark over the right to claim the Old Scanian manuscripts as an early form of either of the two national state languages has led to some odd twists and turns Two Scanian fragments dated to around 1325 were initially claimed to be younger Old Swedish but further research in modern times has claimed that the language was not Swedish but Scanian During the 20th century the fragments were thus relabeled early Old Danish by Scandinavian linguists and as explained by Danish linguist Britta Olrik Frederiksen the fragments are now thought to represent as such a newly claimed territory for the history of the Danish language 13 Like the Scanian Law one of the fragments a six leaf fragment catalogued as SKB A 120 is written in the runic alphabet The place of writing according to Frederiksen has been tentatively identified as the Cistercian monastery at Herrevad Abbey in Scania The fragment contains a translation of Mary s lament at the cross The other fragment catalogued as SKB A 115 is a bifolium with just over a hundred metrical lines of knittelvers a translation from Latin of the apocryphal gospel Evangelium Nicodemi about Christ s descent into hell and resurrection 13 ",
