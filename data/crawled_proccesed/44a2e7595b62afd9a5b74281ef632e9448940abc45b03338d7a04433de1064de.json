			"previous": " Ultimately the high winged CX HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747 although technologies developed for their bid had an influence 24 The original design included a full length double deck fuselage with eight across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven across seating and two aisles on the upper deck 25 However concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design 1 The cockpit was therefore placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight loading door could be included in the nose cone this design feature produced the 747 s distinctive bulge 26 In early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit and this was initially specified as a lounge area with no permanent seating 27 ",
			"after": " One of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be conceived was the high bypass turbofan engine 28 The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C 5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later 29 30 Pratt Whitney was also working on the same principle and by late 1966 Boeing Pan Am and Pratt Whitney agreed to develop a new engine designated the JT9D to power the 747 30 ",
