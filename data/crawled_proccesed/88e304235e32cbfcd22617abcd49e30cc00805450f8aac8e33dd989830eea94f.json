			"previous": " The Jordan River is the Utah Lake s only outflow and originates at the northern end of the lake between the cities of Lehi and Saratoga Springs It then meanders north through the north end of Utah Valley for approximately 8 miles 13 km until it passes through a gorge in the Traverse Mountains known as the Jordan Narrows The Utah National Guard base at Camp Williams lies on the western side of the river through much of the Jordan Narrows 6 7 The Turner Dam located 41 8 miles 67 3 km from the river s mouth or at river mile 41 8 and within the boundaries of the Jordan Narrows is the first of two dams of the Jordan River The Turner dam diverts water to the right or easterly into the East Jordan Canal and to the left or westerly toward the Utah and Salt Lake Canal Two pumping stations situated next to the Turner Dam divert water to the west into the Provo Reservoir Canal Utah Lake Distribution Canal and Jacob Welby Canal The Provo Reservoir Canal runs north through Salt Lake County Jacob Welby runs south through Utah County and the Utah Lake Distribution Canal runs both north and south eventually leading back into Utah Lake 8 Outside the narrows the river reaches the second dam known as the Joint Dam which is 39 9 miles 64 2 km from the river s mouth The Joint Dam diverts water to the east for the Jordan and Salt Lake City Canal and to the west for the South Jordan Canal 9 10 11 ",
			"after": " The river then flows through the middle of the Salt Lake Valley initially moving through the city of Bluffdale and then forming the border between the cities of Riverton and Draper 6 The river then enters the city of South Jordan where it merges with Midas Creek from the west Upon leaving South Jordan the river forms the border between the cities of West Jordan on the west and Sandy and Midvale on the east From the west Bingham Creek enters in West Jordan Dry Creek an eastern tributary combines with the main river in Sandy The river then forms the border between the cities of Taylorsville and West Valley City on the west and Murray and South Salt Lake on the east The river flows underneath Interstate 215 in Murray Little and Big Cottonwood Creeks enter from the east in Murray 21 7 miles 34 9 km and 20 6 miles 33 2 km from the mouth respectively Mill Creek enters on the east in South Salt Lake 17 3 miles 27 8 km from the mouth The river runs through the middle of Salt Lake City where the river travels underneath Interstate 80 a mile west of downtown of Salt Lake City and again underneath Interstate 215 in the northern portion of Salt Lake City Interstate 15 parallels the river s eastern flank throughout Salt Lake County At 16 miles 26 km from the mouth the river enters into the Surplus Canal channel The Jordan River physically diverts from the Surplus Canal through four gates and heads north with the Surplus Canal heading north west Parley s Emigration Red Butte Creeks converge from the east through an underground pipe 14 2 miles 22 9 km from the mouth 6 City Creek also enters via an underground pipe 11 5 miles 18 5 km from the river s mouth The length of the river and the elevation of its mouth varies year to year depending on the fluctuations of the Great Salt Lake caused by weather conditions The lake has an average elevation of 4 200 feet 1 300 m which can deviate by 10 feet 3 0 m 3 The Jordan River then continues for 9 to 12 miles 14 to 19 km with Salt Lake County on the west and North Salt Lake and Davis County on the east until it empties into the Great Salt Lake 6 7 10 ",
