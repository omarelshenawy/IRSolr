			"previous": " Munitions are commonly stored on the lower decks because they are highly explosive should the compartment they are in be breached Usually this is below the water line so that the area can be flooded in case of emergency ",
			"after": " As runways at sea aircraft carriers have a flat top flight deck which launches and recovers aircraft Aircraft launch forward into the wind and are recovered from astern The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier for example the fact that it is a ship means that a full length runway would be costly to construct and maintain This affects take off procedure as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift This either requires a thrust boost a vertical component to its velocity or a reduced take off load to lower mass The differing types of deck configuration as above influence the structure of the flight deck The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself ",
