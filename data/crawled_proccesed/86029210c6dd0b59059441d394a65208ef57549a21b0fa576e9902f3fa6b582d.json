			"previous": " Following the war one important research avenue was trying to increase the design bandwidth of wide band filters The approach used at the time and still in use today was to start with a lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five see Band pass filters below for an explanation of Q In 1957 Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype 17 This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave corresponding to a Q of about 1 3 Some of Young s procedures in that paper were empirical but later 18 exact solutions were published Young s paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article The capacitive gap filter figure 8 and the parallel coupled lines filter figure 9 are examples of directly coupled resonators 15 ",
			"after": " The introduction of printed planar technologies greatly simplified the manufacture of many microwave components including filters and microwave integrated circuits then became possible It is not known when planar transmission lines originated but experiments using them were recorded as early as in 1936 19 The inventor of printed stripline however is known this was Robert M Barrett who published the idea in 1951 20 This caught on rapidly and Barrett s stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats especially triplate and microstrip The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate 21 ",
