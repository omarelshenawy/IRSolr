			"previous": " The language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 1700s Although most colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867 a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left 48 Sizable Russian speaking communities also exist in North America especially in large urban centers of the U S and Canada such as New York City Philadelphia Boston Los Angeles Nashville San Francisco Seattle Spokane Toronto Baltimore Miami Chicago Denver and Cleveland In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers and live in ethnic enclaves especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s Only about 25 of them are ethnic Russians however Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach Brooklyn in New York City were Russian speaking Jews Afterward the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians According to the United States Census in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850 000 individuals living in the United States 49 ",
