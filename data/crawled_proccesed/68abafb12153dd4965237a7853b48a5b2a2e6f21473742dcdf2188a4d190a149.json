			"previous": " Hearing is important for a nocturnal bird of prey and as with other owls the tawny owl s two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing A passage through the skull links the eardrums and small differences in the time of arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward improving sensitivity to sounds from below 8 Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound and are supported by a movable fold of skin the pre aural flap 12 ",
			"after": " The internal structure of the ear which has large numbers of auditory neurons gives an improved ability to detect low frequency sounds at a distance which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation 12 The tawny owl s hearing is ten times better than a human s 12 and it can hunt using this sense alone in the dark of a woodland on an overcast night but the patter of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively 8 ",
