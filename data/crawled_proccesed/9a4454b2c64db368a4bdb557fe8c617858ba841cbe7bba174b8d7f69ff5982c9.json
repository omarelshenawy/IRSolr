			"previous": " In many species only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein For example only about 1 5 of the human genome consists of protein coding exons with over 50 of human DNA consisting of non coding repetitive sequences 88 The reasons for the presence of so much noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in genome size or C value among species represent a long standing puzzle known as the C value enigma 89 However some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional non coding RNA molecules which are involved in the regulation of gene expression 90 ",
			"after": " Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes 58 92 An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation 93 These sequences are usually just molecular fossils although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence 94 ",
