			"previous": " Triceratops species possessed a sturdy build with strong limbs short hands with three hooves each and short feet with four hooves each 10 Although certainly quadrupedal the posture of these dinosaurs has long been the subject of some debate Originally it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head 13 This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons both physical and digital seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling as in the modern rhinoceros 10 20 21 22 ",
			"after": " The hands and forearms of Triceratops retained a fairly primitive structure compared to other quadrupedal dinosaurs such as thyreophorans and many sauropods In those two groups the forelimbs of quadrupedal species were usually rotated so that the hands faced forward with palms backward pronated as the animals walked Triceratops like other ceratopsians and the related quadrupedal ornithopods walked with most of their fingers pointing out and away from the body the primitive condition for dinosaurs also retained by bipedal forms like the theropods In Triceratops the weight of the body was carried by only the first three fingers of the hand while digits 4 and 5 were vestigial and lacked claws or hooves 10 The phalangeal formula is 2 3 4 3 1 meaning that the innermost finger of the forelimb has two bones the next has three etc 23 ",
