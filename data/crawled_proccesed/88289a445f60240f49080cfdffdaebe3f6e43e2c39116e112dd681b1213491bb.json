			"previous": " The Scottish Government conducted a three month long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011 and the analysis was published in July 2012 166 Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales Scotland considered both civil and religious same sex marriage Whilst the Scottish Government is in favour of same sex marriage it stated that no religious body would be forced to hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted 167 The Scottish Consultation received more than 77 000 responses and on 27 June 2013 the Government published the Bill 168 In order to preserve the freedom of both religious groups and individual clergy the Scottish Government believed it necessary for changes to be made to the Equality Act 2010 and communicated with the UK Government on this matter thus the first same sex marriages in Scotland did not occur until this had taken place 169 Although the Scottish bill concerning same sex marriage had been published the Australian reported that LGBT rights campaigners celebrating outside the UK parliament on 15 July 2013 for the clearance of the Marriage Same Sex Couples Bill in the House of Lords declared that they would continue the campaign to extend same sex marriage rights to both Scotland and Northern Ireland 170 rather than solely Northern Ireland where there are no plans to introduce such legislation On 4 February 2014 the Scottish Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation legalising same sex marriage in that country 171 The bill received Royal Assent as the Marriage and Civil Partnership Scotland Act 2014 on 12 March 2014 172 173 The law took effect on 16 December 2014 with the first same sex weddings occurring for those converting their civil partnerships into marriage 174 175 Malcolm Brown and Joe Schofield from Tullibody Central Lowlands were scheduled to be the first to be declared husband and husband just after midnight on 31 December following a Humanist ceremony but they were superseded by couples marrying on 16 December Nonetheless Brown and Schofield were married on Hogmanay 176 ",
			"after": "  On 26 June 2013 the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional for the federal government of the United States to deny federal benefits of marriage to married same sex couples if it is recognized or performed in a state that allows same sex marriage 177 Same sex couples can legally marry in thirty six states Alaska Arizona California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas 178 Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Montana Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin and Wyoming as well as the District of Columbia St Louis Missouri and twenty two Native American tribes receive state level benefits with the exception of Kansas 179 180 181 182 On March 20 2015 U S territory Puerto Rico announced intent to reverse the previous challenge to the district court seeking Puerto Rico s recognition of a same sex marriage performed in Massachusetts Conde v Garcia Padilla Assisted by Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund the women filed the appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals after the case was dismissed in October 2014 183 In the brief the governor of Puerto Rico and several other cabinet members write Because Puerto Rico s marriage ban impermissibly burdens Plaintiffs rights to the equal protection of the laws and the fundamental right to marry we have decided to cease defending its constitutionality 184 ",
