			"previous": " Since The Idler did not occupy all Johnson s time he was able to publish his philosophical novella Rasselas on 19 April 1759 The little story book as Johnson described it describes the life of Prince Rasselas and Nekayah his sister who are kept in a place called the Happy Valley in the land of Abyssinia The Valley is a place free of problems where any desire is quickly satisfied The constant pleasure does not however lead to satisfaction and with the help of a philosopher named Imlac Rasselas escapes and explores the world to witness how all aspects of society and life in the outside world are filled with suffering They return to Abyssinia but do not wish to return to the state of constantly fulfilled pleasures found in the Happy Valley 116 Rasselas was written in one week to pay for his mother s funeral and settle her debts it became so popular that there was a new English edition of the work almost every year References to it appear in many later works of fiction including Jane Eyre Cranford and The House of the Seven Gables Its fame was not limited to English speaking nations Rasselas was immediately translated into five languages French Dutch German Russian and Italian and later into nine others 117 ",
			"after": " By 1762 however Johnson had gained notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing the contemporary poet Churchill teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long promised edition of Shakespeare He for subscribers baits his hook and takes your cash but where s the book 118 The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare and after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762 he was able to dedicate most of his time towards this goal 118 Earlier that July the 24 year old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of 300 in appreciation for the Dictionary 39 While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life 119 The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials he was told by Bute that the pension is not given you for anything you are to do but for what you have done 120 ",
