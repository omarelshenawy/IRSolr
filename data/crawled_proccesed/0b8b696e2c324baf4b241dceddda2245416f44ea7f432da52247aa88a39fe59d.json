			"previous": " Longacre s first important commission were plates for S F Bradford s Encyclopedia in 1820 an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales 5 Longacre then agreed to engrave illustrations for Joseph and John Sanderson s Biographies of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence published in nine volumes between 1820 and 1827 Although the venture was marked by criticism of the writing sales were good enough that the project was completed Numismatic writer Richard Snow suggests that the books sold on the strength of the quality of Longacre s illustrations Longacre also completed a series of studies of actors in their roles in 1826 for The American Theatre 6 ",
			"after": " With lessons learned from the Sanderson series Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects He was on the point of launching this project having invested 1 000 of his own money equal to 23 623 today in preparation when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series In October 1831 he wrote to Herring and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839 Herring was an artist but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre who travelled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life He again sketched Jackson who was by now president as well as former president James Madison both in July 1833 He met many of the political leaders of the day who were impressed by his portraits Among these advocates was the former vice president South Carolina Senator John C Calhoun 7 In July 1832 Niles Register described a Longacre engraving one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art 5 ",
