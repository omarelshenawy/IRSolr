			"previous": " The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18 1868 as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587 49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur India 8 9 This line was initially assumed to be sodium On October 20 of the same year English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum which he named the D3 Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium 10 He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun helios 11 12 ",
