			"previous": " More than one run can be scored from a single hit but while hits worth one to three runs are common the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary The batsmen do not need to run if the ball reaches or crosses the boundary ",
			"after": " Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of overthrows by a fielder returning the ball If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was non striker is now the striker Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team s total ",
