			"after": " In one case he sent Xu Fu a Zhifu islander with ships carrying hundreds of young men and women in search of the mystical Penglai mountain 62 They were sent to find Anqi Sheng a 1 000 year old magician whom Qin Shi Huang had supposedly met in his travels and who had invited him to seek him there 70 These people never returned perhaps because they knew that if they returned without the promised elixir they would surely be executed Legends claim that they reached Japan and colonized it 68 It is also possible that the book burning a purge on what could be seen as wasteful and useless literature was in part an attempt to focus the minds of the Emperor s best scholars on the alchemical quest Some of the executed scholars were those who had been unable to offer any evidence of their supernatural schemes This may have been the ultimate means of testing their abilities if any of them had magic powers then they would surely come back to life when they were let out again 71 Since the great emperor was afraid of death and evil spirits he had workers build a series of tunnels and passage ways to each of his palaces he owned over 200 because traveling unseen would supposedly keep him safe from the evil spirits ",
