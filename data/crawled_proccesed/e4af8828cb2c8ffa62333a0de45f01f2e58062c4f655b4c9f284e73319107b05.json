			"previous": " In Part II of his Summa Theologica medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas ranked various unnatural vices sex acts resulting in venereal pleasure rather than procreation by degrees of sinfulness concluding that the most grievous is the sin of bestiality 62 Some Christian theologians extend Matthew s view that even having thoughts of adultery is sinful to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful ",
			"after": " There are a few references in Hindu scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of Life events on the exterior of the temple complex at Khajuraho The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally 63 According to the Hindu tradition of erotic painting and sculpture having sex with an animal is believed to be actually a human having sex with a God incarnated in the form of an animal 64 However the Hindu scriptures like the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana having sex with animals especially the cow leads one to Hell where the person is tormented by rubbing their bodies on trees with razor sharp thorns 65 ",
