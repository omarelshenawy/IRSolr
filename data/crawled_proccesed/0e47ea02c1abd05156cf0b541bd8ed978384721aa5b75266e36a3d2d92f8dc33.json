			"previous": " The vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor compression refrigeration system ",
			"after": " The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram 45 as shown in Figure 2 In this cycle a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor From point 1 to point 2 the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4 the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature Between points 4 and 5 the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve also called a throttle valve where its pressure abruptly decreases causing flash evaporation and auto refrigeration of typically less than half of the liquid ",
