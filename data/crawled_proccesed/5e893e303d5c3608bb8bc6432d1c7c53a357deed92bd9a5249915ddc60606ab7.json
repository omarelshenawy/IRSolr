			"after": " Funerary art varied greatly across Chinese history Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by tomb robbers For a long time literary references to jade burial suits were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers Knowledge of pre dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at Sanxingdui and other sites Very large tumuli could be erected and later mausoleums Several special large shapes of Shang dynasty bronze ritual vessels were probably made for burial only large numbers were buried in elite tombs while other sets remained above ground for the family to use in making offerings in ancestor veneration rituals The Tomb of Fu Hao c BCE 1200 is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context 55 ",
