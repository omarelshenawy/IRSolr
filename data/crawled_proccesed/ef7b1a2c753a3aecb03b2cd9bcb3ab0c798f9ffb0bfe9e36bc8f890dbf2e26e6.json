			"previous": " As in the first world war Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed 52 53 Sweden was under German influence for much of the war as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades 52 The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany 54 and therefore made some concessions 55 Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war However Sweden supported Norwegian resistance and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps The Swedish government also unofficially supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to Finland ",
			"after": " Toward the end of the war Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees among them several thousand Jews from Nazi occupied Europe were saved partly because of the Swedish involvement in rescue missions at the internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees primarily from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states 54 The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues may have saved up to 100 000 Hungarian Jews 56 Nevertheless both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis war efforts even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation 54 ",
