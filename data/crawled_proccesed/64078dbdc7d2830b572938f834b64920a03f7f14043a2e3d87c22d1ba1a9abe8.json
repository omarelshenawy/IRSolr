			"after": " Here two directional microphones are at the same place typically pointing at an angle between 90 and 135 to each other 58 The stereo effect is achieved through differences in sound pressure level between two microphones A difference in levels of 18 dB 16 to 20 dB is needed for hearing the direction of a loudspeaker Due to the lack of differences in time of arrival phase ambiguities the sonic characteristic of X Y recordings has less sense of space and depth when compared to recordings employing an A B setup When two figure eight microphones are used facing 45 with respect to the sound source the X Y setup is called a Blumlein Pair The sonic image produced is realistic ",
