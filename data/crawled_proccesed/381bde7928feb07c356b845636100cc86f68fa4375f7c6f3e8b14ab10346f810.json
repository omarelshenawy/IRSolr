			"previous": " Crocus sativus thrives in the Mediterranean maquis an ecotype superficially resembling the North American chaparral and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi arid lands It can nonetheless survive cold winters tolerating frosts as low as 10 C 14 F and short periods of snow cover 17 21 Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as Kashmir where annual rainfall averages 1 000 1 500 mm 39 59 in saffron growing regions in Greece 500 mm or 20 in annually and Spain 400 mm or 16 in are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops 22 and rabbits rats and birds cause damage by digging up corms Nematodes leaf rusts and corm rot pose other threats Yet Bacillus subtilis inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield 23 ",
