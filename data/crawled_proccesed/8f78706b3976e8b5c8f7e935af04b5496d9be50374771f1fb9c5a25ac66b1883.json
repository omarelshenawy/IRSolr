			"previous": " Scholar officials and gentry also distinguished themselves through their intellectual pursuits While some such as Shen Kuo 1031 1095 and Su Song 1020 1101 dabbled in every known field of science study and statecraft Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry art collecting and antiquarianism 49 Yet even this pursuit could turn into a scholarly one It was the official historian poet and essayist Ouyang Xiu 1007 1072 who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology 50 Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study in order to aid his work in astronomy mathematics and recording ancient musical measures 51 The scholar official and historian Zeng Gong 1019 1083 reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits for the good of the community such as writing local histories or gazetteers 52 In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal ",
