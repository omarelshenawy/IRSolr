			"after": " The flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the Pilot Jack It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag never intended as a civil jack A book clarification needed issued to British consuls in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the Red Ensign for merchant shipping In 1970 the white bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship as a jack if desired This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping Registration etc Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which in Section 4 Subsection 1 prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty s Ships except the Red Ensign the Union flag commonly known as the Union Jack with a white border and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts However Section 2 regards the British flag and states that The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign without any defacement or modification and subject to a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced Red Ensign no other colours 67 The ultimate determination of legality however is that many civil vessels routinely fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition making it the de facto Civil Jack citation needed ",
