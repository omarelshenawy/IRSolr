			"previous": " In the wake of the First World War the council s Markets Committee began a programme of gradually buying back all the privately owned stalls with the intention of encouraging demobilised servicemen to work on the market Within a few years the market was entirely publicly owned and the council took responsibility for the upkeep of the market 44 The city also bought out and closed many of the 30 or more inns in the area transferring their licences to the growing suburbs 49 ",
			"after": " Meanwhile the Guildhall designed to serve the post plague city with a population of around 6 000 was hopelessly inadequate as the administrative centre of a major modern city As an interim solution the row of buildings dividing the upper and main markets had mostly been taken into public ownership and converted into civic offices 44 and in January 1914 the 1860 fish market had also been enlarged and converted into offices The Liberal welfare reforms of the early 20th century and the Local Government Act 1929 had greatly increased the role of local government in public health and welfare and by the 1930s Norwich council was suffering from a severe lack of office space 44 ",
