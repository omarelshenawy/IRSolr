			"after": " In many ways USA Today is set up to break the typical newspaper layout Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left hand quarter of each section as reefers front page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages 10 sometimes using sentence length blurbs to describe stories inside As a national newspaper USA Today cannot focus on the weather for any one city Therefore the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps and temperature lists for the entire United States and many cities throughout the world with data provided by The Weather Channel meteorologists In the bottom left hand corner of the weather page is a graphic called Weather Focus which explains various meteorological phenomena On some days the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event On Mondays the Money section uses its back page to present an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly monthly and weekly movements against the S P 500 Like most national papers USA Today does not carry comic strips ",
