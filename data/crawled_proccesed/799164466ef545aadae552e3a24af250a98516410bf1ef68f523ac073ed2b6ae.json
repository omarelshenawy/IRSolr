			"previous": " While the negotiations over the state taking control of burials were ongoing an alternative proposal was being drawn up by Richard Broun and Richard Sprye note 3 Broun and Sprye intended to use the emerging technology of mechanised land transport to provide a final solution to the problem of London s dead 23 They envisaged buying a single very large tract of land around 23 miles 37 km from London in Brookwood near Woking Surrey to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis 1 At this distance the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city s growth greatly reducing any potential hazards from miasma 28 In the 18th century this land had been nicknamed the Waste of Woking 29 and with poor quality gravel soil it was of little use in farming and thus available very cheaply 30 The London and South Western Railway LSWR which had connected London to Woking in 1838 would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply 23 Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains each carrying 50 60 bodies travelling from London to the new Necropolis in the early morning or late at night and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral 31 Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day 32 ",
			"after": " Broun calculated that a 1 500 acre 2 3 sq mi 6 1 km2 site would accommodate a total of 5 830 500 individual graves in a single layer 23 The legislation authorising Brookwood Cemetery did not permit mass graves at the site and burials were restricted to one family per grave 23 If the practice of only burying a single family in each grave were abandoned and the traditional practice for pauper burials of ten burials per grave were adopted the site was capable of accommodating 28 500 000 bodies 23 Assuming 50 000 deaths per year and presuming that families would often choose to share a grave Broun calculated that even with the prohibition of mass graves it would take over 350 years to fill a single layer of the cemetery 35 Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London Broun and Sprye argued that the railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries all of which required a slow and expensive horse drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site 35 ",
