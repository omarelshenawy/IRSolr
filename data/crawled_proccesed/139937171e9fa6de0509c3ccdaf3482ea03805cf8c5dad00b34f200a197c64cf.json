			"previous": " In 1947 Fred Smye president of Avro advised Herbert James Symington of TCA that they could not meet the fixed price contract Symington s response was to pull out of the project perhaps due to having successfully taken delivery of their new Canadair North Stars C D Howe stepped in and offered 1 5 million to continue the project at a slower pace 5 At about the same time Rolls Royce told Avro that the civil certification of the Avon could not be guaranteed in time for the Jetliner s rollout This in turn would lead to higher operational and maintenance costs Nevertheless Avro continued with its plan to build the jet selecting four Rolls Royce Derwents to replace the two Avons 4 ",
			"after": " Chief Designer James C Floyd was upset by these developments but in the end found a number of advantages of the four engine layout The main advantage was that an engine out situation the aircraft would lose only of its thrust rather than which made power tolerances easier to meet In particular the asymmetry in thrust originally called for a powered rudder to correct for yaw in the case of an engine out but with four engines it was found the yaw was so small it could be corrected easily with just the manual trim controls 6 ",
