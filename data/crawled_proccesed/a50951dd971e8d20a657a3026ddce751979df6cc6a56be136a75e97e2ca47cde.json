			"previous": " Classical Latin was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes as opposed to the Vulgar Latin which is the generic term of the colloquial sociolects of Latin spoken across the Roman Empire by uneducated and less educated classes The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to Gaul Iberia or Dacia was not identical to the Latin of Cicero and differed from it in vocabulary syntax and grammar 22 Some literary works with low register language from the Classical Latin period give a glimpse into the world of early Vulgar Latin The works of Plautus and Terence being comedies with many characters who were slaves preserve some early basilectal Latin features as does the recorded speech of the freedmen in the Cena Trimalchionis by Petronius Arbiter At the third Council of Tours in 813 priests were ordered to preach in the vernacular language either in the rustica lingua romanica Vulgar Latin or in the Germanic vernaculars since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin Catholic Church continued to use Latin at present and the name of the form of Latin is named Ecclesiastical Latin which is regarded a modernized standard dialect of Latin based on simplified Classical Latin with some lexical variations a simplified syntax in some cases and commonly an Italianized pronunciation ",
