			"after": " In topology knot theory is the study of mathematical knots While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope a mathematician s knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone In mathematical language a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3 dimensional Euclidean space R3 in topology a circle isn t bound to the classical geometric concept but to all of its homeomorphisms Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself known as an ambient isotopy these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself ",
