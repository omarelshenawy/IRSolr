			"previous": " Although attention has tended to concentrate on the Middle East s Fertile Crescent archaeology in the Americas East Asia and Southeast Asia indicates that agricultural systems using different crops and animals may in some cases have developed there nearly as early The development of organised irrigation and the use of a specialised workforce by the Sumerians began about 5500 BC Stone was supplanted by bronze and iron in implements of agriculture and warfare Agricultural settlements had until then been almost completely dependent on stone tools In Eurasia copper and bronze tools decorations and weapons began to be commonplace about 3000 BC After bronze the Eastern Mediterranean region Middle East and China saw the introduction of iron tools and weapons ",
			"after": " The Americas developed metallurgy for decorative objects but did not use metal extensively for utilitarian purposes No evidence of melting smelting or casting has been found in the prehistoric Americas However little archaeological research has so far been done in Peru and nearly all the khipus recording devices in the form of knots used by the Incas were burned in the Spanish conquest of Peru As late as 2004 entire cities were still being unearthed ",
