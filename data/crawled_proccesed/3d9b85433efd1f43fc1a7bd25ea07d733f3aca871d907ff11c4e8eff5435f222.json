			"previous": " Wall conduction in situ technologies use heating elements or heating pipes placed within the oil shale formation The Shell in situ conversion process Shell ICP uses electrical heating elements for heating the oil shale layer to between 650 and 700 F 340 and 370 C over a period of approximately four years 46 The processing area is isolated from surrounding groundwater by a freeze wall consisting of wells filled with a circulating super chilled fluid 21 28 Disadvantages of this process are large electrical power consumption extensive water use and the risk of groundwater pollution 47 The process was tested since the early 1980s at the Mahogany test site in the Piceance Basin 1 700 barrels 270 m3 of oil were extracted in 2004 at a 30 by 40 foot 9 1 by 12 2 m testing area 28 46 48 ",
			"after": " In the CCR Process proposed by American Shale Oil superheated steam or another heat transfer medium is circulated through a series of pipes placed below the oil shale layer to be extracted The system combines horizontal wells through which steam is passed and vertical wells which provide both vertical heat transfer through refluxing of converted shale oil and a means to collect the produced hydrocarbons Heat is supplied by combustion of natural gas or propane in the initial phase and by oil shale gas at a later stage 10 49 ",
