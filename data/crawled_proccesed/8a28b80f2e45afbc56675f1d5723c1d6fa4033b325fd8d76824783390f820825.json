			"previous": " An even checkerboard plot model dominates the green landscape during the rainy season which becomes more austere after harvest The rice fields differ only in terms of soil type and location 110 Where mangroves are populous such as in Carabane the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide Rice farmers must therefore build levees dig ditches and create ponds The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of the rainy season when the basins are emptied The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil ",
