			"previous": " Boeing had considered larger capacity versions of the 747 several times during the 1990s and 2000s 5 The 747 500X and 600X proposed at the 1996 Farnborough Airshow would have stretched the 747 and used a 777 derived wing 5 but did not attract enough interest to enter development In 2000 Boeing offered the 747X and 747X Stretch derivatives as alternatives to the Airbus A3XX This was a more modest proposal than the previous 500X and 600X The 747X would increase the 747 s wingspan to 229 ft 69 8 m by adding a segment at the root 6 The 747X was to carry 430 passengers up to 8 700 nmi 16 100 km The 747X Stretch would be extended to 263 ft 80 2 m long allowing it to carry 500 passengers up to 7 800 nmi 14 400 km 6 However the 747X family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production Some of the ideas developed for the 747X were used on the 747 400ER 7 ",
			"after": " After the 747X program Boeing continued to study improvements to the 747 The 747 400XQLR Quiet Long Range was meant to have an increased range of 7 980 nmi 14 780 km with better fuel efficiency and reduced noise 8 Changes studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767 400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction 9 Although the 747 400XQLR did not move to production many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced ",
