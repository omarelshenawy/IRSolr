			"after": " Albrecht Altdorfer is regarded as one of the founders of Western landscape art 29 He was a painter etcher architect and engraver and the leader of the Danube school of German art As evidenced by such paintings as Saint George and the Dragon 1510 and Allegory 1531 much of Altdorfer s work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them 30 The Battle of Alexander at Issus epitomises this facet of his style With reference to St George and the Dragon in particular art historian Mark W Roskill comments that The accessory material of landscape in Altdorfer s work is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates with the sense of a sequestered and inhospitable environment 31 Inspired by his travels around the Austrian Alps and the Danube River 32 Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all including Landscape with a Footbridge c 1516 and Danube Landscape near Regensburg c 1522 25 These were the first pure landscapes since antiquity 33 Most of Altdorfer s landscapes were made with a vertical format in contrast with the modern conception of the genre The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer s Flemish contemporary Joachim Patinir and his followers 34 ",
