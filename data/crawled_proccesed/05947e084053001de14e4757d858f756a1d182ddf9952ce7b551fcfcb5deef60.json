			"previous": " Prince Ivan III introduced Renaissance architecture to Russia by inviting a number of architects from Italy who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them while in general following the traditional designs of the Russian architecture In 1475 the Bolognese architect Aristotele Fioravanti came to rebuild the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin damaged in an earthquake Fioravanti was given the 12th century Vladimir Cathedral as a model and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness proportion and symmetry ",
			"after": " In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal Terem Palace within the Kremlin with Aloisio da Milano being the architect of the first three floors Aloisio da Milano as well as the other Italian architects also greatly contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers The small banqueting hall of the Russian Tsars called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story is the work of two Italians Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario and shows a more Italian style In 1505 an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow He may have been the Venetian sculptor Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne He built 12 churches for Ivan III including the Cathedral of the Archangel a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style It is believed that the Cathedral of the Metropolitan Peter in Vysokopetrovsky Monastery another work of Aleviz Novyi later served as an inspiration for the so called octagon on tetragon architectural form in the Moscow Baroque of the late 17th century ",
