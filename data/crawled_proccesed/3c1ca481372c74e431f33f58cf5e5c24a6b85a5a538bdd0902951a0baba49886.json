			"previous": " The giant otter has lost as much as 80 of its South American range 64 While still present in a number of north central countries giant otter populations are under considerable stress The IUCN lists Bolivia Brazil Colombia Ecuador French Guiana Guyana Paraguay Peru Suriname and Venezuela as current range countries 2 Given local extinctions the species range has become discontinuous 12 Total population numbers are difficult to estimate An IUCN study in 2006 suggested 1 000 to 5 000 otters remain 2 Populations in Bolivia were once widespread but the country became a black spot on distribution maps after poaching between the 1940s and 1970s a relatively healthy but still small population of 350 was estimated in the country in 2002 33 The species has likely been extirpated from southern Brazil but in the west of the country decreased hunting pressure in the critical Pantanal has led to very successful recolonization an estimate suggests 1 000 or more animals in the region 64 69 ",
			"after": " In 2006 most of this species lived in the Brazilian Amazon and its bordering areas 2 A significant population lives in the wetlands of the central Araguaia River and in particular within Cant o State Park which with its 843 oxbow lakes and extensive flooded forests and marshlands is one of the best habitat patches for this species in Brazil 42 ",
