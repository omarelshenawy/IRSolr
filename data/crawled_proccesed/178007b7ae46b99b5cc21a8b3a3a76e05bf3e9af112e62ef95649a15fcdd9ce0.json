			"previous": " If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees and one of the other angles is known the third is thereby fixed because the three angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees The two acute angles therefore add up to 90 degrees they are complementary angles The shape of a triangle is completely determined except for similarity by the angles Once the angles are known the ratios of the sides are determined regardless of the overall size of the triangle If the length of one of the sides is known the other two are determined These ratios are given by the following trigonometric functions of the known angle A where a b and c refer to the lengths of the sides in the accompanying figure ",
