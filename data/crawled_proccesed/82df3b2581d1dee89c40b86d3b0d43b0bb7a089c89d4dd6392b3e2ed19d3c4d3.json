			"previous": " A study of nine different bivalves with widespread distributions in tropical marine waters concluded that the mussel Trichomya hirsuta most nearly reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals Pb Cd Cu Zn Co Ni and Ag in its environment In this species there was a linear relationship between the sedimentary levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc 94 In the Persian Gulf the Atlantic pearl oyster Pinctada radiata is considered to be a useful bioindicator of heavy metals 95 ",
			"after": " Crushed shells available as a by product of the seafood canning industry can be used to remove pollutants from water It has been found that as long as the water is maintained at an alkaline pH crushed shells will remove cadmium lead and other heavy metals from contaminated waters by swapping the calcium in their constituent aragonite for the heavy metal and retaining these pollutants in a solid form 96 The rock oyster Saccostrea cucullata has been shown to reduce the levels of copper and cadmium in contaminated waters in the Persian Gulf The live animals acted as biofilters selectively removing these metals and the dead shells also had the ability to reduce their concentration 97 ",
