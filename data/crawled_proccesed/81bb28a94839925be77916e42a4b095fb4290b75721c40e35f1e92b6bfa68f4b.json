			"after": " General relativity GR is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915 According to general relativity the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape ",
