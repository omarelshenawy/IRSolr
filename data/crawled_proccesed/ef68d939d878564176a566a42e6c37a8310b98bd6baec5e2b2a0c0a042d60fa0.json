			"previous": " Rationalism is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge Empiricism is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience over other evidence as the source of knowledge Rationalism claims that every possible object of knowledge can be deduced from coherent premises without observation Empiricism claims that at least some knowledge is only a matter of observation For this Empiricism often cites the concept of tabula rasa where individuals are not born with mental content and that knowledge builds from experience or perception Epistemological solipsism is the idea that the existence of the world outside the mind is an unresolvable question ",
			"after": " Parmenides fl 500 BC argued that it is impossible to doubt that thinking actually occurs But thinking must have an object therefore something beyond thinking really exists Parmenides deduced that what really exists must have certain properties for example that it cannot come into existence or cease to exist that it is a coherent whole that it remains the same eternally in fact exists altogether outside time This is known as the third man argument Plato 427 347 BC combined rationalism with a form of realism The philosopher s work is to consider being and the essence ousia of things But the characteristic of essences is that they are universal The nature of a man a triangle a tree applies to all men all triangles all trees Plato argued that these essences are mind independent forms that humans but particularly philosophers can come to know by reason and by ignoring the distractions of sense perception ",
