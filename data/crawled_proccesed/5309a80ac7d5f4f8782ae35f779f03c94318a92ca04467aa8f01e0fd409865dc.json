			"after": " One popular hypothesis suggested that pinnipeds are diphyletic descended from two ancestral lines with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears and phocids sharing one with Musteloidea However morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin 11 Nevertheless there is some dispute as to whether pinnipeds are more closely related to bears or musteloids as some studies support the former theory 17 18 19 and others the latter 14 20 21 Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago mya during the Eocene 22 Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut Canada Like a modern otter Puijila had a long tail short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers However its limbs and shoulders were more robust and Puijila likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds The researchers who found Puijila placed it in a clade with Potamotherium traditionally considered a mustelid and Enaliarctos Of the three Puijila was the least specialized for aquatic life The discovery of Puijila in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase 23 ",
