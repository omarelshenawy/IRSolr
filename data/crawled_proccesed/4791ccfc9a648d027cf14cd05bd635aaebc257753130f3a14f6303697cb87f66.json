			"previous": " The Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn Spanish colonial silver coins which until then had circulated widely in the United States These small cents were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced By 1858 Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production The high points on both sides of the coin the eagle s head and the wreath opposed each other and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper nickel alloy Mint Engraver James B Longacre designer of the Flying Eagle cent was instructed to develop alternative designs He produced one showing a slimmer eagle which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath Although this would have cured the production problem the design was not liked 4 Mint Director James Ross Snowden suggested a head of Columbus as an obverse design but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin b 5 ",
			"after": " In 1858 the Mint tested new designs for the cent 6 Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse a scrawny eagle pattern and the Indian Head design mated with four different wreaths for the reverse Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns the sets were also sold to collectors c 7 8 The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April as on the twelfth of that month a Mr Howard wrote to Snowden that I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint with a head resembling that of the three dollar piece and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath and asking to purchase a specimen 9 Other numismatists also sought pieces R Coulton Davis a Philadelphia druggist with ties to the Mint wrote to Snowden in June informing him of a favorable story in a Boston newspaper and Augustus B Sage wrote to the Mint Director the same month asking for a specimen for himself and one for the newly founded American Numismatic Society d 9 ",
