			"previous": " Many of the trees in Aliso Creek s riparian zone were cut down in the Spanish Mission period to construct buildings ships and other projects According to the Flood Protection Corridor Program of the Costa Machado Water Act of 2000 Aliso Creek was one of the few streams that contained water most of the year even during the pre development period There are documents describing explorers mooring their ships outside the mouth of the river and harvesting large timbers from the river area Such large timbers could only be available from a relatively lush environment in which water was somewhat plentiful 4 Some trees survived into the early 20th century then a second decline of unknown cause began either erosion or floods in the creek were responsible for their destruction or the water table has lowered out of reach of the trees roots The water table began a drastic decline in the 1960s after the watershed began to become urbanized 37 ",
