			"previous": " Liniers was succeeded by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros a few months later who pardoned the mutineers to reduce political conflicts Cisneros allowed free trade as well as instructed by the Junta of Seville which benefited British merchants Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy moral values social usages religious practices and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy As a result Cisneros closed trade again restoring the Spanish monopsony A group of hacendados owners of haciendas who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo asked Moreno to defend them Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners a report that represented the export interest of the landowners encouraged free trade and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony It is considered the most comprehensive economic report from the time of the viceroyalty It represented the new European economic ideas and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled Several authors have questioned Moreno s authorship of the paper considering it instead an update of another previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers 19 This report as well as Moreno s prestige in the colonial society helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros Yet secretly Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy ",
			"after": " Mariano Moreno had several contacts with groups seeking the removal of Cisneros but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution which considered the fall of the Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta At the time Moreno was still loyal to lzaga He attended the May 22 open Cabildo but according to the father of Vicente Fidel L pez and the father in law of Bartolom Mitre both direct witness he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate 20 He voted for Saavedra s proposal to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre captain of hussars proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government with five men appointed as counselors Moreno among them However nobody else voted for that proposal and it was the only one that included him 21 Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25 which was given to the Cabildo The reasons of Moreno s inclusion in the list are unclear as with all other members of the Junta A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists 22 ",
