			"previous": " A merging draft BioCode was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas but has yet to be formally adopted 65 The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997 its originally planned implementation date of January 1 2000 has passed unnoticed A revised BioCode that instead of replacing the existing codes would provide a unified context for them was proposed in 2011 66 67 68 However the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode which does not include viral classification ",
			"after": " Ecology studies the distribution and abundance of living organisms and the interactions between organisms and their environment 69 The habitat of an organism can be described as the local abiotic factors such as climate and ecology in addition to the other organisms and biotic factors that share its environment 70 One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible even on small scales A microscopic bacterium in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna For any species behaviors can be co operative competitive parasitic or symbiotic Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem ",
