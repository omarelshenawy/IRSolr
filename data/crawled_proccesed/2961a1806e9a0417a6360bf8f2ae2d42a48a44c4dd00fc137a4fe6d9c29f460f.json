			"previous": " As 1967 began many American pacifists and radicals did not look favorably on emigration to Canada as a means of resisting the Vietnam War 30 For some this reflected a core conviction that effective war resistance requires self sacrifice 31 32 For others it was a matter of strategy emigration was said to be less useful than going to jail 33 or deserting the military 34 or was said to abet the war by siphoning off the opposition 30 At first Students for a Democratic Society and many Quaker draft counselors opposed promoting the Canadian alternative 35 and Canada s largest counseling group the Anti Draft Programme of the Student Union for Peace Action SUPA 36 whose board consisted largely of Quakers and radicals 36 was sympathetic to such calls for prudence 37 In January 1967 its spokesman warned an American audience that immigration was difficult and that the Programme was not willing to act as baby sitters for Americans after they arrived He added that he was tired of talking to the press 38 ",
			"after": " When Mark Satin was hired as director of the Programme in April 1967 he attempted to change its culture He also tried to change the attitude of the war resistance movement toward emigration His efforts continued after SUPA collapsed and he co founded the Toronto Anti Draft Programme with largely the same board of directors in October 1967 39 Instead of praising self sacrifice he emphasized the importance of self preservation and self development to social change 40 Rather than sympathizing with pacifists and radicals strategic concerns he rebutted them telling The New York Times that massive emigration of draft age Americans could help end the war 41 and telling another reporter that going to jail was bad public relations 20 ",
