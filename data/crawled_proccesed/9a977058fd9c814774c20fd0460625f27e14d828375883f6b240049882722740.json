			"previous": " NASA has flown other VTOL craft such as the Bell XV 15 research craft 1977 as have the Soviet Navy and Luftwaffe Sikorsky tested an aircraft dubbed the X Wing which took off in the manner of a helicopter The rotors would become stationary in mid flight and function as wings providing lift in addition to the static wings Boeing X 50 is a Canard Rotor Wing prototype that utilizes a similar concept 6 ",
			"after": " A different British VTOL project was the gyrodyne where a rotor is powered during take off and landing but which then freewheels during flight with separate propulsion engines providing forward thrust Starting with the Fairey Gyrodyne this type of aircraft later evolved into the much larger twin engined Fairey Rotodyne that used tipjets to power the rotor on take off and landing but which then used two Napier Eland turboprops driving conventional propellers mounted on substantial wings to provide propulsion the wings serving to unload the rotor during horizontal flight The Rotodyne was developed to combine the efficiency of a fixed wing aircraft at cruise with the VTOL capability of a helicopter to provide short haul airliner service from city centres to airports ",
