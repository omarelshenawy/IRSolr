			"previous": " In the 1960s and early 1970s some parts of Bath were unsympathetically redeveloped resulting in the loss of some 18th and 19th century buildings This process was largely halted by a popular campaign which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson s The Sack of Bath 96 Controversy has revived perodically most recently with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House a neo Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board to make way for a new bus station This is part of the Southgate redevelopment in which an ill favoured 1960s shopping precinct bus station and multi story car park were demolished and replaced by a new area of mock Georgian shopping streets 97 98 As a result of this and other changes notably plans for abandoned industrial land along the Avon the city s status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009 99 The decision was made let Bath keep its status but UNESCO has asked to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development 100 saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered 101 It also demands that Bath do more to attract world class architecture in new developments 101 ",
