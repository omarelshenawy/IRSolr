			"previous": " The coastal belt below the Great Escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the Limpopo Lowveld which merges into the Mpumalanga Lowveld below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment 57 This is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment 55 The Kruger National Park located in in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa occupies a large portion of the Lowveld covering 19 633 square kilometres 7 580 sq mi 58 South of the Lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters KwaZulu Natal Province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid The KwaZulu Natal Lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment or Drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over 3 000 m 9 800 ft 59 The climate at the foot of this part of the Drakensberg is temperate ",
