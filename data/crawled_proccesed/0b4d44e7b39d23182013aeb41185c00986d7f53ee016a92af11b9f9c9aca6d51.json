			"previous": " Continuing land reclamation and control of the Parrett was a long running cycle of neglect followed by improvement Work was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the middle Ages by Glastonbury Abbey 47 Abbot Michael s survey of 1234 showed 722 acres 292 ha of meadow recovered around the island of Sowy and from the accounts in the Abbey s rent books this had increased to 972 acres 393 ha by 1240 47 Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett These included Southlake Wall Burrow Wall and Lake Wall 47 The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence 36 47 After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century much of the former abbey lands came under the control of the Crown particularly King s Sedgemoor which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey with Henry VI s Courts of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage and various Commissions responsible for land improvements 48 Further reclamation work was carried out over the next 500 years In 1597 50 acres 20 ha of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary a few years later 140 acres 57 ha near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments and three further reclamations totalling 110 acres 45 ha were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660 48 Kings James I Charles I and Charles II continued to improve King s Sedgemoor 48 ",
			"after": " Attempts were also made to improve navigation on the lower river Between 1677 and 1678 Sir John Moulton cut a new channel at Vikings Creek on the Horsey Levels to remove a large meander the old river bed soon silted up providing 120 acres 49 ha of new land 48 49 A further scheme was proposed in 1723 to improve navigation shorten the journey time for boats and recover land by obtaining an Act of Parliament to make an artificial cut across the Steart Peninsula 48 Eventually after much debate the cut was not made due to lack of land owner support and concerns over costs and risks 48 The English Civil War put a stop to most reclamation work however in 1764 a clyse was built at Dunball to contain tidal influences on a run off stream near King s Sedgemoor 48 Extensive land recovery was undertaken in the Somerset Levels by land owners between 1770 and the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 as part of a general scheme of agricultural improvements 50 This included improvements to the Brue Valley and to King s Sedgemoor 50 The latter involved the connection of various drainage schemes into a new hand dug channel connected to the clyse at Dunball the King s Sedgemoor Drain 50 Further drainage improvements were needed in the 19th century which involved the use of mechanical pumping engines originally steam powered but later powered by electricity 51 In January 1940 further improvements were funded by the Ministry of Supply during the Second World War as Priority War Work during the construction of Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater This involved doubling the width of the King s Sedgemoor Drain at its western end and the excavation of the River Huntspill In the longer term this provided a drain for the Brue valley but in war time the scheme provided a guaranteed daily supply of 4 500 000 imperial gallons 20 000 m3 of water for the ROF 52 ",
