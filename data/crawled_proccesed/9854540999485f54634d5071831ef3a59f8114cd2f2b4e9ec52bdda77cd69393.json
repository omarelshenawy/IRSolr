			"previous": " Author Santiago Fouz Hern ndez commented in his book Madonna s Drowned Worlds that to him the song felt like a trepiditation of Madonna s thoughts about what might be termed girlhood and on a broadscale on feminity 8 Christopher P Andersen author of Madonna Unauthorized described Dear Jessie as a wistfully psychedelic confection of carousels and pink elephants adding that the song harkens back to the lullabies your mother must have sang to you 9 Robin Anne Reid author of Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Overviews complimented the fact that although the sort of fantasies that Madonna conjures might trend towards the kinky and sexual she can also delve into a world of mermaids fountains of youth leprechauns and magic lanterns as is evident by Dear Jessie 10 ",
			"after": " Lucy O Brien author of Madonna Like an Icon characterized the song as harkening back to a childlike innocence but felt that Madonna overdid the elaborate fantasy imagery O Brien preferred Madonna s later attempts to sing lullaby like songs on her 1994 and 2003 albums Bedtime Stories and American Life 7 Edna Gunderson from USA Today called the song a sugary lullaby while opining that it would not go down as one of Madonna s well remembered songs 11 The Chicago Tribune s Ian Blair described the track as bouncy and praised the soothing quality of the music s composition 12 Richard Harrington from The Washington Post deduced that with the song Madonna was harkening back to her own maternal emotions the feelings she could not receive from her own mother due to her untimely death 13 Reviewing the Like a Prayer album Mike Mentos from Los Angeles Daily News was not impressed with Dear Jessie and commented that Madonna s voice possesses neither the control power nor emotion to carry neo baroque experiments like Dear Jessie and Oh Father 14 ",
