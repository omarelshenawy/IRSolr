			"after": " Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the Microsporidia unicellular parasites of animals and protists are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi living within the tissue of another species 102 125 One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi that is they are each other s closest evolutionary relative 126 Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group 42 ",
