			"previous": " The first nationwide government funded school system in China was established in the year 3 AD under Emperor Ping of Han 9 BC 5 AD 76 During the Northern Song dynasty the government gradually reestablished an official school system after it was heavily damaged during the preceding Five Dynasties period 77 Government established schools soon eclipsed the role of private academies by the mid 11th century 78 79 At the apex of higher education in the school system were the central schools located in the capital city the Guozijian the Taixue and several vocational schools 80 The first major reform effort to rebuild prefectural and county schools was initiated by Chancellor Fan Zhongyan 989 1052 in the 1040s Before this time the bulk of funds allotted for the establishment of prefectural and county schools was left up to private financing and minimal amount of government funding Fan s reform effort started the trend of greater government financing at least for prefectural schools 81 Major expansion of educational facilities was initiated by Emperor Huizong who used funds originally allotted for disaster relief and food price stabilizing to fund new prefectural and county schools and demoted officials who neglected to repair rebuild and maintain these government schools 82 The historian John W Chaffe states that by the early 12th century the state school system had 1 500 000 acres 6 100 km2 of land that could provide for some 200 000 student residents living in dormitories 83 After the widespread destruction of schools during the Jurchen invasions from the 1120s to 1140s Emperor Gaozong of Song r 1127 1162 issued an edict to restore prefectural schools in 1142 and county schools in 1148 although the county schools by and large were reconstructed by the efforts of local county officials private fundraising 84 ",
			"after": " By the late 12th century many critics of the examination system and government run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies 78 During the course of the Southern Song the academy became a viable alternative to the state school system 85 Even those that were semi private or state sponsored were still seen as independent of the state s influence and their teachers uninterested in larger nationwide issues 85 One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the Yuelu Academy founded in 976 during the reign of Emperor Taizu r 960 976 The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the Hanlin Academy 86 established during the Tang dynasty The Neo Confucian Donglin Academy established in 1111 was founded upon the staunch teaching that adulterant influences of other ideologies such as Buddhism should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian school 87 This belief hearkened back to the writings of the Tang essayist prose stylist and poet Han Yu 768 824 who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values 88 Although the White Deer Grotto Academy of the Southern Tang 937 976 had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song the Neo Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi 1130 1200 reinvigorated it 85 ",
