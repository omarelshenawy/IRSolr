			"previous": " The scene takes place in Hog Lane part of the slum district of St Giles with the church of St Giles in the Fields in the background Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of Gin Lane and First Stage of Cruelty The picture shows Huguenots leaving the French Church in what is now Soho The Huguenot refugees had arrived in the 1680s and established themselves as tradesmen and artisans particularly in the silk trade and the French Church was their first place of worship Hogarth contrasts their fussiness and high fashion with the slovenliness of the group on the other side of the road the rotting corpse of a cat that has been stoned to death lying in the gutter that divides the street is the only thing the two sides have in common c The older members of the congregation wear traditional dress while the younger members wear the fashions of the day The children are dressed up as adults the boy in the foreground struts around in his finery while the boy with his back to the viewer has his hair in a net bagged up in the French style 17 ",
			"after": " At the far right a black man fondles the breasts of a woman distracting her from her work 18 her pie dish tottering like her virtue 19 Confusion over whether the law permitted slavery in England and pressure from abolitionists meant that by the mid eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners but the status of this man is not clear 20 The black man the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of Mars Venus and Cupid which would have appeared in the pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping In front of the couple a boy has set down his pie to rest but the plate has broken spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin The boy s features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin s first version of the Rape of the Sabine Women now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 21 but the boy crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved ",
