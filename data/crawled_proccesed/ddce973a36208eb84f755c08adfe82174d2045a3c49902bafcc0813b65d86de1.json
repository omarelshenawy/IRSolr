			"previous": " A somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of ferry boats links the two shores There are four ferries each situated approximately midway between two bridges Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 or 30 metres To cross the river the ferryman orients the boat around 45 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven requiring no outside energy source 1 ",
