			"previous": " Early Neolithic villages show evidence of the ability to process grain and the Near East is the ancient home of the ancestors of wheat barley and peas There is evidence of the cultivation of figs in the Jordan Valley as long as 11 300 years ago and cereal grain production in Syria approximately 9 000 years ago During the same period farmers in China began to farm rice and millet using man made floods and fires as part of their cultivation regimen 10 Fiber crops were domesticated as early as food crops with China domesticating hemp cotton being developed independently in Africa and South America and the Near East domesticating flax 12 The use of soil amendments including manure fish compost and ashes appears to have begun early and developed independently in several areas of the world including Mesopotamia the Nile Valley and Eastern Asia 13 ",
