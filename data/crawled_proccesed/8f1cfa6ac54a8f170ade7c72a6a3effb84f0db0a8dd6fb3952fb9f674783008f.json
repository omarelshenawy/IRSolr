			"previous": " Edmontosaurus itself was coined in 1917 by Lawrence Lambe for two partial skeletons found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation formerly the lower Edmonton Formation along the Red Deer River of southern Alberta Canada 45 These rocks are older than the rocks in which Claosaurus annectens was found 9 The Edmonton Formation lends Edmontosaurus its name 32 The type species E regalis regal or more loosely king sized 32 is based on NMC 2288 consisting of a skull articulated vertebrae up to the sixth tail vertebra ribs partial hips an upper arm bone and most of a hind limb It was discovered in 1912 by Levi Sternberg The second specimen paratype NMC 2289 consists of a skull and skeleton lacking the beak most of the tail and part of the feet It was discovered in 1916 by George F Sternberg Lambe found that his new dinosaur compared best to Diclonius mirabilis specimens now assigned to Edmontosaurus annectens and drew attention to the size and robustness of Edmontosaurus 45 Initially Lambe only described the skulls of the two skeletons but returned to the genus in 1920 to describe the skeleton of NMC 2289 2 The postcrania of the type specimen remains undescribed still in its plaster jackets 6 ",
			"after": " Two more species that would come to be included with Edmontosaurus were named from Canadian remains in the 1920s but both would initially be assigned to Thespesius Gilmore named the first Thespesius edmontoni in 1924 T edmontoni also came from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation It was based on NMC 8399 another nearly complete skeleton lacking most of the tail NMC 8399 was discovered on the Red Deer River in 1912 by a Sternberg party 3 Its forelimbs ossified tendons and skin impressions were briefly described in 1913 and 1914 by Lambe who at first thought it was an example of a species he d named Trachodon marginatus 46 but then changed his mind 47 The specimen became the first dinosaur skeleton to be mounted for exhibition in a Canadian museum Gilmore found that his new species compared closely to what he called Thespesius annectens but left the two apart because of details of the arms and hands He also noted that his species had more vertebrae than Marsh s in the back and neck but proposed that Marsh was mistaken in assuming that the annectens specimens were complete in those regions 3 ",
