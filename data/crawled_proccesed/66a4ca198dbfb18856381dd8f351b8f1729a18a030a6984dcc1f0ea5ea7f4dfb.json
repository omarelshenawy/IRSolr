			"previous": " At the lower end of Grand Canyon the Colorado widens into Lake Mead the largest reservoir in the continental United States formed by Hoover Dam on the border of Arizona and Nevada Situated southeast of metropolitan Las Vegas the dam is an integral component for management of the Colorado River controlling floods and storing water for farms and cities in the lower Colorado River basin 27 Below the dam the river passes under the Mike O Callaghan Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge which at nearly 900 feet 270 m above the water is the highest concrete arch bridge in the Western Hemisphere 28 and then turns due south towards Mexico defining the Arizona Nevada and Arizona California borders ",
			"after": " After leaving the confines of the Black Canyon the river emerges from the Colorado Plateau into the Lower Colorado River Valley LCRV a desert region dependent on irrigation agriculture and tourism and also home to several major Indian reservations 29 The river widens here to a broad moderately deep waterway averaging 500 to 1 000 feet 150 to 300 m wide and reaching up to 1 4 mile 400 m across with depths ranging from 8 to 60 feet 2 to 20 m 30 31 Before channelization of the Colorado in the 20th century the lower river was subject to frequent course changes caused by seasonal flow variations Joseph C Ives who surveyed the lower river in 1861 wrote that the shifting of the channel the banks the islands the bars is so continual and rapid that a detailed description derived from the experiences of one trip would be found incorrect not only during the subsequent year but perhaps in the course of a week or even a day 32 ",
