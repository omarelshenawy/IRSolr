			"after": " The turbojet is an airbreathing jet engine usually used in aircraft It consists of a gas turbine with a propelling nozzle The gas turbine has an air inlet a compressor a combustion chamber and a turbine that drives the compressor The compressed air from the compressor is heated by the fuel in the combustion chamber and then allowed to expand through the turbine The turbine exhaust is then expanded in the propelling nozzle where it is accelerated to high speed to provide thrust 1 Two engineers Frank Whittle in the United Kingdom and Hans von Ohain in Germany developed the concept independently into practical engines during the late 1930s ",
