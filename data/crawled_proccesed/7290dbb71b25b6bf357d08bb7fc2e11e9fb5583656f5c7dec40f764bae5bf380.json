			"after": " The Boeing B 29 Superfortress is a four engine propeller driven heavy bomber designed by Boeing that was flown primarily by the United States toward the end of World War II and during the Korean War It was one of the largest aircraft to have seen service during World War II and a very advanced bomber for its time with features such as a pressurized cabin an electronic fire control system and a quartet of remote controlled machine gun turrets operated by the fire control system in addition to its defensive tail gun installation The name Superfortress was derived from that of its well known predecessor the B 17 Flying Fortress Although designed as a high altitude strategic bomber and initially used in this role against the Empire of Japan these attacks proved to be disappointing as a result the B 29 became the primary aircraft used in the American firebombing campaign and was used extensively in low altitude night time incendiary bombing missions One of the B 29 s final roles during World War II was carrying out the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ",
