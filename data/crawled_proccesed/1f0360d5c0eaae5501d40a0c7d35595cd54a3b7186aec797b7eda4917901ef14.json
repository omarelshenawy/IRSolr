			"after": " Although punk rock was a significant social and musical phenomenon it achieved less in the way of record sales being distributed by small specialty labels such as Stiff Records 171 or American radio airplay as the radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as disco and album oriented rock 172 Punk rock had attracted devotees from the art and collegiate world and soon bands sporting a more literate arty approach such as Talking Heads and Devo began to infiltrate the punk scene in some quarters the description new wave began to be used to differentiate these less overtly punk bands 173 Record executives who had been mostly mystified by the punk movement recognized the potential of the more accessible new wave acts and began aggressively signing and marketing any band that could claim a remote connection to punk or new wave 174 Many of these bands such as the Cars and the Go Go s can be seen as pop bands marketed as new wave 175 other existing acts including the Police the Pretenders and Elvis Costello used the new wave movement as the springboard for relatively long and critically successful careers 176 while skinny tie bands exemplified by the Knack 177 or the photogenic Blondie began as punk acts and moved into more commercial territory 178 ",
