			"previous": " An autopsy also known as a postmortem examination or an obduction is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a person s death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present It is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist ",
			"after": " Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death or for research purposes Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices ",
