			"previous": " The classification of several lemur taxa has elicited particular debate Most significantly the placement of the aye aye has been controversial since its introduction to Western science in 1782 and it has been a topic of debate until very recently 1 37 43 Arguing against Darwin s theory of natural selection Richard Owen claimed in 1863 that the aye aye s distinct characteristics including its ever growing incisors and unique highly flexible middle finger are so perfectly adapted for their uses in extractive foraging that they could not have evolved gradually through natural selection 44 More recently the aye aye s placement has posed problems for the rafting hypothesis for the primate colonization of Madagascar If this species does not form a monophyletic group with the rest of the lemurs then multiple colonization events would have had to occur to explain the occurrence of lemurs on Madagascar 1 ",
			"after": " Until Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866 early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye aye genus Daubentonia was a primate rodent or marsupial 43 45 46 47 In the late eighteenth century for example the aye aye was classified under the squirrel genus Sciurus 48 By emphasizing its primate features such as its postorbital bar stereoscopic vision and opposable hallux over its rodent like teeth Owen demonstrated its affinity with other primates 43 49 In 1996 Ankel Simons demonstrated that the shape and arrangement of the aye aye s diminutive deciduous incisors indicate that this genus has a shared ancestry with the toothcombed primates 50 However the placement of the aye aye within the primates remained problematic until very recently The karyotype of the aye aye is noticeably different from that of its closest relatives the lorises and the rest of the lemurs with a diploid chromosome count of 2n 30 51 Based on its anatomy researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid a sister group to all strepsirrhines and an indeterminate taxon within the primates 52 In 1931 Schwarz labeled the aye aye as an offshoot of Indriidae claiming that all lemurs were monophyletic 53 whereas Reginald Innes Pocock had previously placed the aye aye outside of the lemurs 54 In that same year Anthony and Coupin classified the aye aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes a sister group to the other strepsirrhines Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye aye formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs 55 despite molecular tests that had shown Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuroidea 56 ",
