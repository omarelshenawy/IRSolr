			"after": " The most important staple of Aztec cuisine was maize corn a crop that was so important to Aztec society that it played a central part in their mythology Just like wheat in Europe or rice in most of East Asia it was the food without which a meal was not a meal It came in an inestimable number of varieties varying in color texture size and prestige and was eaten as tortillas tamales or atolli maize gruel The other constants of Aztec food were salt and chili peppers and the basic definition of Aztec fasting was to abstain from these two flavorers The other major foods were beans and New World varieties of the grains amaranth or pigweed and chia The combination of maize and these basic foods would have provided the average Aztec with a very well rounded diet without any significant deficiencies in vitamins or minerals The processing of maize called nixtamalization the cooking of maize grains in alkaline solutions also drastically increased the nutritional value of the common staple ",
