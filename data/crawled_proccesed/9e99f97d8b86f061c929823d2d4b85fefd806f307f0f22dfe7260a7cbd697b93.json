			"previous": " Canted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet s excellent high angle of attack ability include oversized horizontal stabilators oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons large full length leading edge slats and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right The Hornet s normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle HARV NASA used the F 18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle of attack alpha of 65 70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes 16 F A 18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA s F 15S MTD ",
			"after": " The Hornet was among the first aircraft to heavily use multi function displays which at the switch of a button allow a pilot to perform either fighter or attack roles or both This force multiplier ability gives the operational commander more flexibility to employ tactical aircraft in a fast changing battle scenario It was the first Navy aircraft to incorporate a digital multiplexing avionics bus enabling easy upgrades 8 ",
