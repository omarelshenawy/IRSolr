			"after": " During repairs following the Qantas Flight 32 engine failure incident cracks were discovered in fittings within the wings As a result of the discovery EASA issued an Airworthiness Directive in January 2012 affecting 20 A380 aircraft that had accumulated over 1 300 flights 100 A380s with under 1 800 flight hours were to be inspected within 6 weeks or 84 flights aircraft with over 1 800 flight hours were to be examined within four days or 14 flights 101 102 103 Fittings found to be cracked were being replaced following the inspections to maintain structural integrity 104 On 8 February 2012 the checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation The problem is considered to be minor and is not expected to affect operations 105 EADS acknowledged that the cost of repairs would be over 130 million to be borne by Airbus The company said the problem was traced to stress and material used for the fittings 106 Additionally major airlines are seeking compensation from Airbus for revenue lost as a result of the cracks and subsequent grounding of fleets 107 Airbus has switched to a different type of aluminium alloy so aircraft delivered from 2014 onwards should not have this issue 108 ",
