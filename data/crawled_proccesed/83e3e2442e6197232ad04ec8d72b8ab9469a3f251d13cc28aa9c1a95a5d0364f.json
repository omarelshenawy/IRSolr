			"previous": " In the book What Engineers Know and How They Know It 32 Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research First it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner ",
			"after": " Examples are the use of numerical approximations to the Navier Stokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft or the use of Miner s rule to calculate fatigue damage Second engineering research employs many semi empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research one example being the method of parameter variation citation needed ",
