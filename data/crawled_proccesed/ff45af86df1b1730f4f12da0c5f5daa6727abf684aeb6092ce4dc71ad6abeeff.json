			"previous": " Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about 9 8 billion USD with expenses at about 10 4 billion creating a structural deficit of 775 million about 7 9 of the budget 171 The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 15 consecutive years starting in 2000 Throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments This practice eroded Puerto Rico s treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973 u 173 ",
			"after": " Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of 71B or about 70 of Puerto Rico s gross domestic product This sparked an ongoing government debt crisis after Puerto Rico s general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non investment grade junk status by three credit rating agencies In terms of financial control almost 9 6 or about 1 5 billion of Puerto Rico s central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service v Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years ",
