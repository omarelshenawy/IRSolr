			"previous": " The first successful flight test of a Scramjet was performed by Russia in 1991 It was an axisymmetric hydrogen fueled dual mode scramjet developed by Central Institute of Aviation Motors CIAM Moscow in the late 1970s The scramjet ight was own captive carry atop the SA 5 surface to air missile that included an experiment ight support unit known as the Hypersonic Flying Laboratory HFL Kholod 3 Then from 1992 to 1998 an additional 6 flight tests of the axisymmetric high speed scramjet demonstrator were conducted by CIAM together with France and then with NASA USA 4 5 Maximum flight velocity greater than Mach 6 4 was achieved and Scramjet operation during 77 seconds was demonstrated These flight test series also provided insight into autonomous hypersonic flight controls ",
			"after": " In the 2000s significant progress was made in the development of hypersonic technology particularly in the field of scramjet engines ",
