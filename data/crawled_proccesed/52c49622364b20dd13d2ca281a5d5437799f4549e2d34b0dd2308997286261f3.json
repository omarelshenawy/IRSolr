			"previous": " It could be that no special explanation is required the slow process of evolution simply required 4 billion years to accumulate the necessary adaptations Indeed there does seem to be a slow increase in the maximum level of complexity seen over this time with more and more complex forms of life evolving as time progresses with traces of earlier semi complex life such as Nimbia found in the 610 million year old Twitya formation 92 and possibly older rocks dating to 770 million years ago 93 possibly displaying the most complex morphology of the time ",
			"after": " The alternative train of thought is that it was simply not advantageous to be large until the appearance of the Ediacarans the environment favoured the small over the large Examples of such scenarios today include plankton whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms But for large size never to be favourable the environment would have to be very different indeed ",
