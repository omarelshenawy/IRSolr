			"previous": " The mechanical properties of iron and its alloys can be evaluated using a variety of tests including the Brinell test Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests 6 7 However the mechanical properties of iron are significantly affected by the sample s purity pure research purpose single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium 5 and the purest industrially produced iron 99 99 has a hardness of 20 30 Brinell 8 An increase in the carbon content of the iron will initially cause a significant corresponding increase in the iron s hardness and tensile strength Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0 6 carbon content although this produces a metal with a low tensile strength 9 ",
			"after": " Because of its significance for planetary cores the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively The form of iron that is stable under standard conditions can be subjected to pressures up to ca 15 GPa before transforming into a high pressure form as described in the next section ",
