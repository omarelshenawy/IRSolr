			"previous": " Aliso Creek rises in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains near the community of Portola Hills part of Lake Forest and at the boundary of the Cleveland National Forest The Loma Ridge rises about 1 500 feet 460 m above the creek s headwaters which are at an elevation of 2 300 feet 700 m 2 There is no pond lake or spring at the creek s ultimate source it starts out as a small seasonal gully that courses southwards through a small valley with relatively little development The creek then continues generally southwest for 19 miles 31 km to the Pacific Ocean at Laguna Beach collecting water from seven major tributaries and over forty minor drains and streams For much of its course the creek is channelized and confined by urban development It only flows freely in several stretches in its far upper and lower course 11 Passing south of several residential areas on the foothills to the north Aliso Creek and El Toro Road run parallel for much of the creek s length upstream from Interstate 5 Flowing southwest in a small ravine along the right side of the road the creek soon passes underneath the twin bridges of California State Route 241 and receives from the right an unnamed northern fork At this confluence the creek turns more to the south then crosses under El Toro Road and bisects another residential area As it enters the city of Lake Forest it receives from the right Munger Creek and from the left English Canyon Creek a larger tributary which drains part of the city of Mission Viejo 16 miles 26 km from the mouth 2 11 12 13 ",
			"after": " The creek crosses under Trabuco Road and Jeronimo Road the latter was once the site of a stream gauge It makes a bend to the southeast then veers back south entering a large gulch and crossing beneath Interstate 5 The creek then enters a culvert beneath Paseo de Valencia then crosses under Laguna Hills Drive and cascades under Moulton Parkway through the community of Laguna Hills It then swings to the southeast and receives the Aliso Hills Channel which enters from the left 13 miles 21 km from the mouth The Aliso Hills Channel drains much of eastern Laguna Hills western Mission Viejo and southeastern Lake Forest 2 11 12 13 From the confluence the gradient of the creek flattens sharply and the stream enters a broad and shallow valley that runs between Aliso Creek Road on the west and Alicia Parkway on the east It passes under California State Route 73 which crosses the valley on an earthfill and a bridge segment The creek receives from the right the Dairy Fork 9 miles 14 km from the mouth which drains parts of southern Laguna Hills and northeastern Aliso Viejo The southwest flowing Dairy Fork once flowed in a prominent canyon that was filled in the 1960s and 1970s to build the city of Aliso Viejo State Route 73 now runs above the former canyon 2 11 12 13 ",
