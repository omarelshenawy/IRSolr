			"previous": " All undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements GIRs 162 The Science Requirement generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors comprises two semesters of physics two semesters of calculus one semester of chemistry and one semester of biology There is a Laboratory Requirement usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major The Humanities Arts and Social Sciences HASS Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities arts and social sciences including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division Under the Communication Requirement two of the HASS classes plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be communication intensive 163 including substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation 164 Finally all students are required to complete a swimming test non varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes 162 ",
			"after": " Most classes rely on a combination of lectures recitations led by associate professors or graduate students weekly problem sets p sets and tests Although keeping up with the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to drinking from a fire hose 165 166 the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to that at other national research universities 167 The pass no record grading system relieves some of the pressure for first year undergraduates For each class taken in the fall term freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed or otherwise not have any record of it In the spring term passing grades A B C appear on the transcript while non passing grades are again not recorded 168 Grading had previously been pass no record all freshman year but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year 169 Also freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities such as Experimental Study Group Concourse or Terrascope 168 ",
