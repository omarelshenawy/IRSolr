			"previous": " The ballet was first shown in the United States on 11 April 1930 when Massine s 1920 version was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia under Leopold Stokowski with Martha Graham dancing the role of the Chosen One 81 The production moved to New York where Massine was relieved to find the audiences receptive a sign he thought that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously 82 The first American designed production in 1937 was that of the Modern Dance exponent Lester Horton whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances 82 ",
			"after": " In 1944 Massine began a new collaboration with Roerich who before his death in 1947 completed a number of sketches for a new production which Massine brought to fruition at La Scala Milan in 1948 81 This heralded a number of significant postwar European productions Mary Wigman in Berlin 1957 followed Horton in highlighting the erotic aspects of virgin sacrifice as did Maurice B jart in Brussels 1959 B jart s representation replaced the culminating sacrifice with a depiction of what the critic Robert Johnson describes as ceremonial coitus 82 The Royal Ballet s 1962 production choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan and designed by Sidney Nolan was first performed on 3 May and was a critical triumph It has remained in the company s repertoire for more than 50 years after its revival in May 2011 the Daily Telegraph s critic Mark Monahan called it one of the Royal Ballet s greatest achievements 83 Moscow first saw The Rite in 1965 in a version choreographed for the Bolshoi Ballet by Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasiliev This production was shown in Leningrad four years later at the Maly Opera Theatre 84 and introduced a storyline that provided the Chosen One with a lover who wreaks vengeance on the elders after the sacrifice Johnson describes the production as a product of state atheism Soviet propaganda at its best 82 ",
