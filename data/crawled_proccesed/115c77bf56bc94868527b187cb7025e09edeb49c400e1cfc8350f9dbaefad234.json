			"after": " The tanker aircraft flies straight and level and extends the hose drogue which is allowed to trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces The pilot of the receiver aircraft extends his probe if required and uses normal flight controls to fly the refueling probe directly into the basket This requires a closure rate of approximately two knots walking speed in order to establish solid probe drogue coupling and push the hose several feet into the HDU Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow or occasionally leaking fuel Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse oscillation in the hose severing the probe tip Another significant danger is that the drogue may hit the recipient aircraft and damage it instances have occurred in which the drogue has shattered the canopy of a fighter aircraft causing great danger to its pilot ",
