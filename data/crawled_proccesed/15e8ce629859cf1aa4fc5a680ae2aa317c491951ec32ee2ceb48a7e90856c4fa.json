			"after": " The Vikings were equipped with the technologically superior longships for purposes of conducting trade however another type of ship the knarr wider and deeper in draft were customarily used The Vikings were competent sailors adept in land warfare as well as at sea and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets usually with near impunity The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates Chroniclers paid little attention to other aspects of medieval Scandinavian culture This slant was accentuated by the absence of contemporary primary source documentation from within the Viking Age communities themselves Little documentary evidence was available until later when Christian sources began to contribute As historians and archaeologists have developed more resources to challenge the one sided descriptions of the chroniclers a more balanced picture of the Norsemen has become apparent ",
