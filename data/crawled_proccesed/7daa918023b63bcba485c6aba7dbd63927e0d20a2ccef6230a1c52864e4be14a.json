			"previous": " There are many applications for boundary layer wind tunnel modeling For example understanding the impact of wind on high rise buildings factories bridges etc can help building designers construct a structure that stands up to wind effects in the most efficient manner possible Another significant application for boundary layer wind tunnel modeling is for understanding exhaust gas dispersion patterns for hospitals laboratories and other emitting sources Other examples of boundary layer wind tunnel applications are assessments of pedestrian comfort and snow drifting Wind tunnel modeling is accepted as a method for aiding in Green building design For instance the use of boundary layer wind tunnel modeling can be used as a credit for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED certification through the U S Green Building Council ",
			"after": " Wind tunnel tests in a boundary layer wind tunnel allow for the natural drag of the Earth s surface to be simulated For accuracy it is important to simulate the mean wind speed profile and turbulence effects within the atmospheric boundary layer Most codes and standards recognize that wind tunnel testing can produce reliable information for designers especially when their projects are in complex terrain or on exposed sites ",
