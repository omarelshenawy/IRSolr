			"after": " Two red keto carotenoid pigments canthaxanthin and adonirubin are responsible for the redness in the red capped robin s plumage 17 The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves and hence need to obtain them from their food Carotenoids are costly to metabolise and are also required for use in immune function hence birds need to be in good condition to have enough left for use in red feathers This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates 18 A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males who had greater reproductive success and were in better condition moulted into a brighter plumage the following year However male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season 17 Adult males can breed at one year of age and may do so while yet in non breeding plumage 19 but they are less successful at reproducing at this age 17 The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley Western Australia in 1990 20 ",
