			"after": " The city state of Athens is where western theatre originated 4 It was part of a broader culture of theatricality and performance in classical Greece that included festivals religious rituals politics law athletics and gymnastics music poetry weddings funerals and symposia 5 Participation in the city state s many festivals and attendance at the City Dionysia as an audience member or even as a participant in the theatrical productions in particular was an important part of citizenship 6 Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the rhetoric of orators evidenced in performances in the law court or political assembly both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary 7 The Greeks also developed the concepts of dramatic criticism acting as a career and theatre architecture 8 The theatre of ancient Greece consisted of three types of drama tragedy comedy and the satyr play 9 The origins of theatre in ancient Greece according to Aristotle 384 322 BCE the first theoretician of theatre are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus The performances were given in semi circular auditoria cut into hillsides capable of seating 10 000 20 000 people The stage consisted of a dancing floor orchestra dressing room and scene building area skene Since the words were the most important part good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount The actors always men wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented and each might play several parts 10 Athenian tragedy the oldest surviving form of tragedy is a type of dance drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city state 11 Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE it flowered during the 5th century BCE from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period 12 No tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived 13 We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides 14 The origins of tragedy remain obscure though by the 5th century BCE it was institution alised in competitions agon held as part of festivities celebrating Dionysus the god of wine and fertility 15 As contestants in the City Dionysia s competition the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama playwrights were required to present a tetralogy of plays though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play 16 The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE official records didaskaliai begin from 501 BCE when the satyr play was introduced 17 Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from Greek mythology though The Persians which stages the Persian response to news of their military defeat at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE is the notable exception in the surviving drama 18 When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of drama to survive 19 More than 130 years later the philosopher Aristotle analysed 5th century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of dramatic theory his Poetics c 335 BCE ",
