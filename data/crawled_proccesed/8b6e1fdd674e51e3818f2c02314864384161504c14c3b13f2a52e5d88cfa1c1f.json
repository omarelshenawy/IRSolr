			"after": " In physics a magnetic field is the relativistic part of an electric field as Einstein explained in 1905 When an electric charge is moving from the perspective of an observer the electric field of this charge due to space contraction is no longer seen by the observer as spherically symmetric due to non radial time dilation and it must be computed using the Lorentz transformations One of the products of these transformations is the part of the electric field which only acts on moving charges and we call it the magnetic field ",
