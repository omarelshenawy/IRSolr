			"previous": " Animals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of tree squirrels The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation eastern gray squirrel Sciurus carolinensis Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger fox squirrel Sciurus niger and the much smaller southern flying squirrel Glaucomys volans More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the red squirrel Tamiasciurus hudsonicus whereas the Appalachian northern flying squirrel Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel is confined to northern hardwood and spruce fir forests ",
			"after": " As familiar as squirrels are the eastern cottontail rabbit Silvilagus floridanus and the white tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the eastern wolf Canis lupus lycaon and the North American cougar This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests as well as destruction of agricultural crops Other deer include the moose Alces alces found only in the north and the elk Cervus canadensis which although once extirpated is now making a comeback through transplantation in the southern and central Appalachians In Quebec the Chic Chocs host the only population of caribou Rangifer tarandus south of the St Lawrence River An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying or snowshoe hare Lepus americanus However these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small ",
