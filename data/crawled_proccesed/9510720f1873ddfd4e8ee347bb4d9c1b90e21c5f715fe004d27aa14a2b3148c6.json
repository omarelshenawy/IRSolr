			"previous": " In a finished product such a change is to be prevented or delayed Failure of safety critical polymer components can cause serious accidents such as fire in the case of cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines Chlorine induced cracking of acetal resin plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties especially in the USA in the 1990s Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked vulnerable polymers in the plastic plumbing a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a serious stress concentration ",
			"after": " Polymer oxidation has caused accidents involving medical devices One of the oldest known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage If cracking occurs in the engine compartment electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire ",
