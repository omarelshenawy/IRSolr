			"previous": " In 1962 the Defense Department standardized military aircraft designations generally along Air Force lines Consequently the F8U became the F 8 with the original F8U 1 redesignated F 8A  The first fleet squadron to fly the Crusader was VF 32 at NAS Cecil Field Florida in 1957 deploying to the Mediterranean late that year on Saratoga VF 32 renamed the squadron the Swordsmen in keeping with the Crusader theme The Pacific Fleet received the first Crusaders at NAS Moffett Field in Northern California and the VF 154 Grandslammers named in honor of the new 1 000 mph jets and subsequently renamed the Black Knights began their F 8 operations Later in 1957 in San Diego VMF 122 accepted the first Marine Corps Crusaders citation needed ",
			"after": " The Crusader became a day fighter operating off the aircraft carriers At the time U S Navy carrier air wings had gone through a series of day and night fighter aircraft due to rapid advances in engines and avionics Some squadrons operated aircraft for very short periods before being equipped with a newer higher performance aircraft The Crusader was the first post Korean War aircraft to have a relatively long tenure with the fleet and like the USAF Republic F 105 Thunderchief a contemporary design might have stayed in service longer if not for the Vietnam war and resulting attrition from combat and operational losses ",
