			"previous": " The first recorded encounter between whites and coastal southwestern Oregon Indians occurred in 1792 when British explorer George Vancouver anchored off Cape Blanco about 30 miles 48 km north of the mouth of the Rogue River and Indians visited the ship in canoes 32 In 1826 Alexander Roderick McLeod of the Hudson s Bay Company HBC led an overland expedition from HBC s regional headquarters in Fort Vancouver to as far south as the Rogue 32 ",
			"after": " In 1827 an HBC expedition led by Peter Skene Ogden made the first direct contact between whites and the inland Rogue River natives when he crossed the Siskiyou Mountains to look for beaver 33 Friction between Indians and whites was relatively minor during these early encounters however in 1834 an HBC expedition led by Michel Laframboise was reported to have killed 11 Rogue River natives and shortly thereafter a party led by an American trapper Ewing Young shot and killed at least two more 32 The name Rogue River apparently began with French fur trappers who called the river La Riviere aux Coquins because they regarded the natives as rogues coquins 1 n 1 In 1835 Rogue River people killed four whites in a party of eight who were traveling from Oregon to California Two years later two of the survivors and others on a cattle drive organized by Young killed the first two Indians they met north of the Klamath River 32 ",
