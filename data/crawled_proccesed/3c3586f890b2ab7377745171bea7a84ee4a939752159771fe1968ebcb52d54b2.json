			"after": " Some portions of the armies of Germanic peoples who occupied Europe from the 3rd century AD had always been mounted and some armies such as those of the Ostrogoths comprised mainly cavalry However it was the Franks who came to dominate Western and Central Europe after the fall of Rome and they generally fielded armies composed of large masses of infantry with an infantry elite the comitatus which often rode to battle on horseback rather than marching on foot Riding to battle had two key advantages it reduced fatigue particularly when the elite soldiers wore armour as was increasingly the case in the centuries after the fall of the Western Roman empire and it gave the soldiers more mobility to react to the raids of the enemy particularly the Muslim invasions which reached Europe in 711 So it was that the armies of the Frankish ruler and warlord Charles Martel which defeated the Umayyad Arab invasion at the Battle of Tours in 732 were still largely infantry armies the elites riding to battle but dismounting to fight providing a hard core for the levy of the infantry warbands ",
