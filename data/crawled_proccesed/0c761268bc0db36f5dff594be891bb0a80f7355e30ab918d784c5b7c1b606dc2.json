			"after": " Madonna s first performance of Girl Gone Wild was on The MDNA Tour 2012 as the concert s opening track The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk along with dancer Derrell Bullock who assisted as supervisor According to Faulk Madonna asked Bullock to experiment with the concept of girl gone wild and come up with a routine and style of his own He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day The singer also wanted to experiment with the concept of Catholic church along with monks and gargoyles Her message behind it was that of freedom people getting to do whatever they wanted to Four dancers from Brooklyn adept at bone breaking dance were enlisted as backup crew for the performance Young recalled that they could create these abstract very animalistic shapes What they can do with their arms is unbelievable Anything that most people can do in front of their bodies they do it behind their bodies The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video Most of them refused to abide by it resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show The dancers complied and learned the choreography 88 ",
