			"previous": " In flash memory each memory cell resembles a standard MOSFET except the transistor has two gates instead of one On top is the control gate CG as in other MOS transistors but below this there is a floating gate FG insulated all around by an oxide layer The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field e g Applied voltage or UV as in EPROM Counter intuitively placing electrons on the FG sets the transistor to the logical 0 state Once the FG is charged the electrons in it screen partially cancel the electric field from the CG thus increasing the threshold voltage VT1 of the cell with no charged FG to a higher threshold voltage VT2 This means that a higher voltage must be applied to the CG to make the channel conductive In order to read a value from the transistor an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages VT1 VT2 is applied to the CG If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage the FG must not be charged if it were we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2 and hence a logical 1 is stored in the gate If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage it indicates that the FG is charged and hence a logical 0 is stored in the gate The presence of a logical 0 or 1 is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing across the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG In a multi level cell device which stores more than one bit per cell the amount of current flow is sensed rather than simply its presence or absence in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG ",
