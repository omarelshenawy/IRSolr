			"previous": " The fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events By synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events Among historians a typical need to is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another For example the Chronicon of Eusebius 325 A D is one of the major works of historical synchronism This work has two sections The first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms Chaldean Assyrian Median Lydian Persian Hebrew Greek Peloponnesian Asian and Roman The second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns The image to the right shows two pages from the second section ",
			"after": " By comparing the parallel columns the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous or how many years separated two different events To place all the events on the same time scale Eusebius used an Anno Mundi A M era meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Pentateuch According to the computation Eusebius used this occurred in 5199 B C The Chronicon of Eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events Subsequent chronographers such as George Syncellus died circa 811 analyzed and elaborated on the Chronicon by comparing with other chronologies The last great chronographer was Joseph Justus Scaliger 1540 1609 who reconstructed the lost Chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works De emendatione temporum 1583 and Thesaurus temporum 1606 Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works 5 Scaliger invented the concept of the Julian Day which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers citation needed ",
