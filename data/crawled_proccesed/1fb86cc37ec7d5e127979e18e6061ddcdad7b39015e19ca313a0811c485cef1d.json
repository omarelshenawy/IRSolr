			"previous": " In the late 1950s the Soviet Union started the development of a new series of large cruisers that would put the Royal Navy at serious risk After studying the problem the RN decided to respond in a non linear fashion and instead of producing a series of new cruisers themselves they would introduce a new strike aircraft with the performance needed to guarantee successful attacks on the Soviet fleet The winning design was the Blackburn Buccaneer which had an emphasis on low altitude performance i e to evade enemy radar as opposed to outright speed ",
			"after": " Flying at low altitude in denser air requires much more fuel the air fuel mixture in a jet engine needs to be kept very close to a constant value to burn properly and more air requires proportionally more fuel This presented a serious problem for aircraft such as the Buccaneer which would have had very short range unless the engines were optimised for low level flight The early pre production versions powered by the de Havilland Gyron Junior also proved to be dangerously underpowered ",
