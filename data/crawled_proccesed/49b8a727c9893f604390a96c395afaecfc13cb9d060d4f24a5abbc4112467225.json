			"previous": " The principal entrance hall reception and family bedrooms were placed on the first floor above a low semi basement containing service rooms The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south These staircases have since been replaced by simpler designs ",
			"after": " The second floor has a matching fenestration with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below The very latest innovation sash windows was used on both floors The semi basement and attic storey used the more old fashioned mullioned and transomed windows indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi basement and attic floors This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight when not required was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of Coleshill House in Berkshire The contemporary social commentator of the day Roger North lauded back stairs of which Belton has two examples 5 and 14 on plan as one of the most important inventions of his day 25 ",
