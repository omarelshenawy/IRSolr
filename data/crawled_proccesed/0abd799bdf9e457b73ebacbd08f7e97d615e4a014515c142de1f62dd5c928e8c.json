			"previous": " The theatre organ or cinema organ was designed to accompany silent movies Like a symphonic organ it is made to replace an orchestra However it includes many more gadgets such as percussion and special effects to provide a more complete array of options to the theatre organist Theatre organs tend not to take nearly as much space as standard organs relying on extension and higher wind pressures to produce a greater variety of tone and larger volume of sound from fewer pipes ",
			"after": " This extension is called unification meaning that instead of one pipe for each key at all pitches the higher octaves of pitch and in some cases lower octaves are achieved by merely adding 12 pipes one octave to the top and or bottom of a given division Assuming there are sixty one keys on an organ manual a common number in concert organs and in North America a classical organ has for diapason stops at 8 4 and 2 pitch 183 pipes 61 plus 61 plus 61 The same chorus of diapasons on a theatre organ has only 85 pipes 61 plus 12 plus 12 Some ranks such as the Tibia Clausa with up to 97 pipes allow the organist to draw stops at 16 8 4 2 and mutations from a single rank of pipes ",
