			"previous": " The white stork is a large bird It has a length of 100 115 cm 39 45 in nb 1 15 and a standing height of 100 125 cm 39 49 in The wingspan is 155 215 cm 61 85 in and its weight is 2 3 4 5 kg 5 1 9 9 lb 16 17 Like all storks it has long legs a long neck and a long straight pointed beak 11 The sexes are identical in appearance except that males are larger than females on average 8 The plumage is mainly white with black flight feathers and wing coverts the black is caused by the pigment melanin 18 The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays 19 The irises are dull brown or grey and the peri orbital skin is black The adult has a bright red beak and red legs 8 the colouration of which is derived from carotenoids in the diet In parts of Spain studies have shown that the pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish Procambarus clarkii and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings in contrast to the duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere 20 ",
			"after": " As with other storks the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar 21 In flapping flight its wingbeats are slow and regular It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched In contrast it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting 22 Moulting has not been extensively studied but appears to take place throughout the year with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season 19 ",
