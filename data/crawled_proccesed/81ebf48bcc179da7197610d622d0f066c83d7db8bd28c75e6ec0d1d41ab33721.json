			"after": " The main threat to crocodilians around the world is human activity including hunting and habitat destruction Early in the 1970s more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded driving down the majority of crocodilian populations in some cases almost to extinction Starting in 1973 CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals such as the skins of crocodiles This proved to be problematic in the 1980s as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa and it was legal to hunt them At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983 it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell the lawfully hunted skins In the late 1970s crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries started from eggs taken from the wild By the 1980s farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians By 2000 skins from twelve crocodilian species whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed were traded by thirty countries and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished 118 ",
