			"previous": " In the Soviet Union both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 making preparations for large offensives in central Russia On 4 July 1943 Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge Within a week German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets deeply echeloned and well constructed defences 205 and for the first time in the war Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success 206 This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which combined with previous Italian failures resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month 207 Also in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40 000 people ",
