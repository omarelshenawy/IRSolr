			"previous": " In the 1960s the C SF came under increased scrutiny from government overseers and conservation groups Critics maintained its size was comparable to the Tennessee Valley Authority s dam building projects during the Great Depression and that the construction had run into the billions of dollars without any apparent resolution or plan 19 The projects of the C SF have been characterized as part of crisis and response cycles that ignored the consequence for the full system assumed certainty of the future and succeeded in solving the momentary crisis but set in motion conditions that exaggerate future crises 20 The last project to build a canal to straighten the winding floodplain of the Kissimmee River that had historically fed Lake Okeechobee which in turn fed the Everglades began in 1962 Marjory Stoneman Douglas later wrote that the C SF projects were interrelated stupidity crowned by the C 38 canal 21 Designed to replace a meandering 90 mile 140 km river with a 52 mile 84 km channel the canal was completed in 1971 and cost 29 million It supplanted approximately 45 000 acres 180 km2 of marshland with retention ponds dams and vegetation 22 Loss of habitat has caused the region to experience a drastic decrease of waterfowl wading birds and game fish 23 The reclaimed floodplains were taken over by agriculture bringing fertilizers and insecticides that washed into Lake Okeechobee Even before the canal was finished conservation organizations and sport fishing and hunting groups were calling for the restoration of the Kissimmee River 22 ",
			"after": " Arthur R Marshall led the efforts to undo the damage According to Douglas Marshall was successful in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to Florida Bay including the atmosphere climate and limestone as a single organism Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation organizations the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for politicians Douglas observed Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding hearts category forever 24 At the insistent urging of Marshall newly elected Governor Bob Graham announced the formation of the Save Our Everglades campaign in 1983 and in 1985 Graham lifted the first shovel of backfill for a portion of the C 38 canal 25 Within a year the area was covered with water returning to its original state 26 Graham declared that by the year 2000 the Everglades would resemble its predrainage state as much as possible 25 The Kissimmee River Restoration Project was approved by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 The project was estimated to cost 578 million to convert only 22 miles 35 km of the canal the cost was designed to be divided between the state of Florida and the U S government with the state being responsible for purchasing land to be restored 27 A project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers explained in 2002 What we re doing on this scale is going to be taken to a larger scale when we do the restoration of the Everglades 28 The entire project is estimated to be completed by 2011 27 ",
