			"previous": " The 18th century in the central highlands was characterized by increasing population density and consequent famines aggravated by warring among the principalities of Imerina At the turn of the 19th century King Andrianampoinimerina 1787 1810 successfully united these fractious Merina groups under his rule then used slaves and forced labor exacted in lieu of taxes for those without means to offer material payment to systematically work the irrigated rice fields around Antananarivo In this way he ensured regular grain surpluses that were sufficient to consistently feed the entire population and export products for trade with other regions of the island Marketplaces were established across the island to serve as central trading points for designated commodities such as smoked and dried seafood and meats dried maize salt dried cassava and various fruits 24 Rice cakes including mofo gasy muf as and menakely men kel were also sold by market vendors 25 By this period coastal cuisine had likewise evolved early 19th century voyagers reported eating dishes on le Sainte Marie prepared with curry powder including a spiced rice resembling biryani and drinking coffee and tea 26 Andrianampoinimerina s son Radama I succeeded in uniting nearly the entire island under his rule and established the Kingdom of Madagascar A line of Merina monarchs would continue to govern the island until its colonization by the French in 1896 27 ",
			"after": " Under the Kingdom of Madagascar plantations were established for the production of crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France Cloves were imported and planted in 1803 and coconuts which had been relatively sparse on the island were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil Similarly coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19th century when more intensive cultivation for export began 28 Vanilla later to become one of Madagascar s premiere export crops was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests The technique of hand pollination critical to higher vanilla yields was introduced 30 years later 29 Nonetheless vanilla remained a marginal crop until the end of the monarchy 30 ",
