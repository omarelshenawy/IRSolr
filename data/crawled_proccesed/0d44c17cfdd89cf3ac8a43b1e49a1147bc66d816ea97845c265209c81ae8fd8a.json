			"previous": " From that it can be seen that the proper time between two events indicated by an unaccelerated clock present at both events compared with the synchronized coordinate time measured in all other inertial frames is always the minimal time interval between those events However the interval between two events can also correspond to the proper time of accelerated clocks present at both events Under all possible proper times between two events the proper time of the unaccelerated clock is maximal which is the solution to the twin paradox 14 ",
			"after": " The formula for determining time dilation in special relativity is  where t is the time interval between two co local events i e happening at the same place for an observer in some inertial frame e g ticks on his clock known as the proper time t is the time interval between those same events as measured by another observer inertially moving with velocity v with respect to the former observer v is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving clock c is the speed of light and the Lorentz factor conventionally denoted by the Greek letter gamma or is",
