			"previous": " The C 17 is powered by four Pratt Whitney F117 PW 100 turbofan engines which are based on the commercial Pratt and Whitney PW2040 used on the Boeing 757 Each engine is rated at 40 400 lbf 180 kN of thrust The engine s thrust reversers direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward reducing the chances of foreign object damage by ingestion of runway debris and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle reverse for added drag in maximum rate descents In vortex surfing tests performed by C 17s up to 10 fuel savings were reported 54 ",
