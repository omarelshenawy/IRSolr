			"after": " The twisted airfoil aerofoil shape of an aircraft propeller was pioneered by the Wright brothers While some earlier engineers had attempted to model air propellers on marine propellers the Wrights realized that a propeller is essentially the same as a wing and were able to use data from their earlier wind tunnel experiments on wings The Wrights introduced a twist along the length of the blades This was necessary to maintain a more uniform angle of attack of the blade along its length 2 Their original propeller blades had an efficiency of about 82 3 compared to the 90 of modern propellers 4 Mahogany was the wood preferred for propellers through World War I but wartime shortages encouraged use of walnut oak cherry and ash 5 ",
