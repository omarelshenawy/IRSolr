			"previous": " Having formulated the relativistic geometric version of the effects of gravity the question of gravity s source remains In Newtonian gravity the source is mass In special relativity mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energy momentum tensor which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress that is pressure and shear 29 Using the equivalence principle this tensor is readily generalized to curved space time Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor which describes a particular class of tidal effects the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest and then fall freely In special relativity conservation of energy momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy momentum tensor is divergence free This formula too is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved manifold counterparts covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry With this additional condition the covariant divergence of the energy momentum tensor and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation is zero the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein s field equations ",
