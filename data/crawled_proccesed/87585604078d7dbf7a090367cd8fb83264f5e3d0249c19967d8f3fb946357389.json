			"after": " In computing and optical disc recording technologies an optical disc OD is a flat usually circular disc which encodes binary data bits in the form of pits binary value of 0 or off due to lack of reflection when read and lands binary value of 1 or on due to a reflection when read on a special material often aluminium 1 on one of its flat surfaces The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate usually polycarbonate which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer The encoding pattern follows a continuous spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4 000 RPM or more depending on the drive type disc format and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves 2 3 This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material usually lacquer The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself Unlike the 3 inch floppy disk most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches fingerprints and other environmental problems ",
