			"previous": " That Anthony had remained unmarried gave her an important business advantage in this work A married woman at that time had the legal status of feme covert which among other things excluded her from signing contracts her husband could do that for her if he chose As Anthony had no husband she was a feme sole and could freely sign contracts for convention halls printed materials etc 91 Using fees she earned by lecturing she paid off the debts she had accumulated while supporting The Revolution With the press treating her as a celebrity she proved to be a major draw 92 Over her career she estimated that she averaged 75 to 100 speeches per year Travel conditions in the earlier days were sometimes appalling Once she gave a speech from the top of a billiard table On another occasion her train was snowbound for days and she survived on crackers and dried fish 93 ",
			"after": " Both Anthony and Stanton joined the lecture circuit about 1870 usually traveling from mid autumn to spring The timing was right because the nation was beginning to discuss women s suffrage as a serious matter Occasionally they traveled together but most often not Lecture bureaus scheduled their tours and handled the travel arrangements which generally involved traveling during the day and speaking at night sometimes for weeks at a time including weekends Their lectures brought new recruits into the movement who strengthened suffrage organizations at the local state and national levels Their journeys during that decade covered a distance that was unmatched by any other reformer or politician 94 Anthony s other suffrage work included organizing national conventions lobbying Congress and state legislatures and participating in a seemingly endless series of state suffrage campaigns ",
