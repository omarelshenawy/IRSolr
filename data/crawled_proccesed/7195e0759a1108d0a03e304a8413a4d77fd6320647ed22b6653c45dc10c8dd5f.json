			"previous": " In 1877 Marsh received a letter from Arthur Lakes a schoolteacher in Golden Colorado Lakes reported that he had been hiking in the mountains near the town of Morrison when he and his friend H C Beckwith discovered massive bones embedded in the rock Lakes further advised that the bones were apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some gigantic saurian 29 While awaiting Marsh s reply Lakes dug up more colossal bones and sent them to New Haven As Marsh was slow to respond Lakes also sent a shipment of bones to Cope ",
			"after": " When Marsh responded to Lakes he paid the prospector 100 urging him to keep the finds a secret Learning that Lakes had corresponded with Cope Marsh sent his field collector Benjamin Mudge to Morrison to secure Lakes services Marsh published a description of Lakes discoveries in the American Journal of Science on July 1 and before Cope could publish his own interpretation of the finds Lakes wrote to him that the bones should be shipped to Marsh a severe insult to Cope 30 ",
