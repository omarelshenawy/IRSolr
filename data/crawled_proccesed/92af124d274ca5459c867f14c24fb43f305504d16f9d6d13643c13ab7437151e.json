			"previous": " The cane toad Bufo marinus is a very adaptable species native to South and Central America In the 1930s it was introduced into Puerto Rico and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region as a biological pest control agent 180 In 1935 3000 toads were liberated in the sugar cane fields of Queensland Australia in an attempt to control cane beetles such as Dermolepida albohirtum the larvae of which damage and kill the canes Initial results in many of these countries were positive but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments They bred freely competed with native species of frogs ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates had few predators in their adopted habitats and poisoned pets carnivorous birds and mammals In many of these countries they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them 181 ",
