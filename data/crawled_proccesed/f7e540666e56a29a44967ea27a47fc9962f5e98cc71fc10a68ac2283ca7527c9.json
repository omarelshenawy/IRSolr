			"previous": " Unlike many Western cultures that of Mesoamerica is generally lacking in sarcophagi with a few notable exceptions such as that of Pacal the Great or the now lost sarcophagus from the Olmec site of La Venta Instead most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and in Oaxaca funerary urns holding the ashes of the deceased Two well known examples of Mesoamerican grave goods are those from Jaina Island a Maya site off the coast of Campeche and those associated with the Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition The tombs of Mayan rulers can only normally be identified by inferences drawn from the lavishness of the grave goods and with the possible exception of vessels made from stone rather than pottery these appear to contain no objects specially made for the burial 79 ",
