			"previous": " Dublin was established as a Viking settlement in the 10th century and despite a number of rebellions by the native Irish it remained largely under Viking control until the Norman invasion of Ireland was launched from Wales in 1169 15 The King of Leinster Diarmait Mac Murchada enlisted the help of Strongbow the Earl of Pembroke to conquer Dublin Following Mac Murrough s death Strongbow declared himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city In response to Strongbow s successful invasion King Henry II of England reaffirmed his sovereignty by mounting a larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself Lord of Ireland 16 Around this time the county of the City of Dublin was established along with certain liberties adjacent to the city proper This continued down to 1840 when the barony of Dublin City was separated from the barony of Dublin Since 2001 both baronies have been redesignated the City of Dublin ",
			"after": " Dublin Castle which became the centre of Norman power in Ireland was founded in 1204 as a major defensive work on the orders of King John of England 17 Following the appointment of the first Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1229 the city expanded and had a population of 8 000 by the end of the 13th century Dublin prospered as a trade centre despite an attempt by King Robert I of Scotland to capture the city in 1317 16 It remained a relatively small walled medieval town during the 14th century and was under constant threat from the surrounding native clans In 1348 the Black Death a lethal plague which had ravaged Europe took hold in Dublin and killed thousands over the following decade 18 19 ",
