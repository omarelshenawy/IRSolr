			"previous": " In 1906 the commissioning of HMS Dreadnought brought about the obsolescence of all existing battleships Dreadnought by scrapping the secondary battery was able to carry ten 12 inch 305 mm guns rather than four She could fire eight heavy guns broadside as opposed to four from a pre dreadnought and six guns ahead as opposed to two 44 The move to an all big gun design was a logical conclusion of the increasingly long engagement ranges and heavier secondary batteries of the last pre dreadnoughts Japan and the USA had designed ships with a similar armament before Dreadnought but were unable to complete them before the British ship 45 It was felt that because of the longer distances at which battles could be fought only the largest guns were effective in battle and by mounting more 12 inch guns Dreadnought was two to three times more effective in combat than an existing battleship 46 ",
			"after": " The armament of the new breed of ships was not their only crucial advantage Dreadnought used steam turbines for propulsion giving her a top speed of 21 knots against the 18 knots typical of the pre dreadnought battleships Able both to outgun and outmaneuver their opponents the dreadnought battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs 4 ",
