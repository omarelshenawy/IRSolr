			"previous": " After she received Billboard s Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium 112 Carey parted from Columbia and signed a 100 million five album recording contract with Virgin Records EMI Records 113 Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project 113 She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres in order to go hand in hand with the film s setting 114 She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives Just a few months later in July 2001 it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown She had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked 115 and her relationship with the Latin icon Luis Miguel ended 116 not in citation given In an interview the following year she said I was with people who didn t really know me and I had no personal assistant I d do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night if that 117 Due to the pressure from the media her heavy work schedule and the split from Miguel Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings 118 On July 19 2001 Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live TRL 119 As the show s host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men s shirt and began a striptease in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble 119 While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance Carey s appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention 118 Only days later Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website I m trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don t feel that I should be doing music right now What I d like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video All I really want is to just be me and that s what I should have done in the first place I don t say this much but guess what I don t take care of myself 119 Following the quick removal of the messages Berger commented that Carey had been obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly when she posted the letters 120 ",
			"after": " On July 26 she was suddenly hospitalized citing extreme exhaustion and a physical and emotional breakdown 121 Carey was inducted at an un disclosed hospital in Connecticut and remained hospitalized and under doctor s care for two weeks followed by an extended absence from the public 121 Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey s publicized breakdown and hospitalization Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter as well as its soundtrack of the same name 120 Consequently critics suggested that in delaying Glitter hype for the project would have largely subsided and would possibly hurt both ticket and album sales 122 not in citation given When discussing the project s weak commercial reaction Carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release its postponement as well as the soundtrack having been released on September 11 123 Critics panned Glitter as well as its accompanying soundtrack both were unsuccessful commercially 124 not in citation given The accompanying soundtrack album Glitter became Carey s lowest selling album to that point The St Louis Post Dispatch dismissed it as an absolute mess that ll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that while not always critically heralded was at least nearly consistently successful 125 Following the negative cloud that was ensuing Carey s personal life at the time as well as the project s poor reception her 100 million five album record deal with Virgin Records EMI Records was bought out for 50 million 113 126 Soon after Carey flew to Capri Italy for a period of five months in which she began writing material for her new album stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year 118 Carey later said that her time at Virgin was a complete and total stress fest I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money I learned a big lesson from that 127 Later that year she signed a contract with Island Records valued at more than 24 million 128 and launched the record label MonarC To add further to Carey s emotional burdens her father with whom she had little contact since childhood died of cancer that year 129 ",
