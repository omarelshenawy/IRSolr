			"previous": " Missionary and explorer David Livingstone reached Lake Malawi then Lake Nyasa in 1859 and identified the Shire Highlands south of the lake as an area suitable for European settlement As the result of Livingstone s visit several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s the African Lakes Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions and a small mission and trading settlement was established at Blantyre in 1876 and a British Consul took up residence there in 1883 The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so to prevent Portuguese occupation the British government sent Harry Johnston as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction 15 ",
