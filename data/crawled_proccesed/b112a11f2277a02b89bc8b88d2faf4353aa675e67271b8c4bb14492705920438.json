			"previous": " A class of ultralight sailplanes including some known as microlift gliders and some as airchairs has been defined by the FAI based on a maximum weight They are light enough to be transported easily and can be flown without licensing in some countries Ultralight gliders have performance similar to hang gliders but offer some additional crash safety as the pilot can be strapped in an upright seat within a deformable structure Landing is usually on one or two wheels which distinguishes these craft from hang gliders Several commercial ultralight gliders have come and gone but most current development is done by individual designers and home builders ",
			"after": " Foot launched aircraft had been flown by Lilienthal and at the meetings at Wasserkuppe in the 1920s However the innovation that led to modern hang gliders was in 1951 when Francis Rogallo and Gertrude Rogallo applied for a patent for a fully flexible wing with a stiffening structure The American space agency NASA began testing in various flexible and semi rigid configurations of this Rogallo wing in 1957 in order to use it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules Charles Richards and Paul Bikle developed the concept producing a wing that was simple to build which was capable of slow flight and as gentle landing Between 1960 1962 Barry Hill Palmer used this concept to make foot launched hang gliders followed in 1963 by Mike Burns who built a kite hang glider called Skiplane In 1963 John W Dickenson began commercial production 7 ",
