			"previous": " The Moscow Machinery Plant No 30 located at Khodynka near where the Ilyushin design office and the prototype had been built was chosen to manufacture the aircraft 2 During 1957 the plant began to reduce its production of the Ilyushin Il 14 and prepare to build the production aircraft designated IL 18A 2 The Il 18A was only different from the prototype in minor details mainly internal configuration to increase the seating from 75 to 89 2 ",
			"after": " The first production aircraft were powered by the Kuznetsov NK 4 but the engines were plagued with problems so the Council of Ministers decreed in July 1958 that all production from November 1958 would use the Ivchenko AI 20 and earlier production would be re engined 2 Only 20 IL 18As were built before production changed to the improved Il 18B this new variant had a higher gross weight the nose was re designed with a larger radome which increased the length by 20 cm 2 The first Il 18B flew on 30 September 1958 powered by the AI 20 a VIP variant was also built as the IL 18S for the Soviet Air Force 2 From April 1961 a TG 18 Auxiliary Power Unit was fitted for ground starting rather than the bank of lead acid batteries some aircraft were modified to allow the APU to be run in flight 2 ",
