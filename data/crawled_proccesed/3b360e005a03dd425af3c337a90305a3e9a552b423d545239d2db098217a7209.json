			"previous": " A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach 157 This approach views restore as a fourth component to the common reduce reuse recycle motto Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects 157 ",
			"after": " The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free 158 In general as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality technical innovation and alternative products However this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system 159 As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons 158 ",
