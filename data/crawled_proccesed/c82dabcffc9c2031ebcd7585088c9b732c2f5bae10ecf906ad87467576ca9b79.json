			"after": " Greeley had earlier clashed with Anthony and Stanton by insisting that their New York campaign should focus on the rights of African Americans rather than also including women s issues When they refused he threatened to end his newspaper s support for their work 33 Soon he began to attack the women s movement Responding to Greeley s repeated claim that the best women he knew did not want to vote Stanton and Anthony arranged for it to be announced from the floor of the convention that Mrs Horace Greeley had signed the petition in favor of women s suffrage 34 The History of Woman Suffrage whose authors include Stanton and Anthony said This campaign cost us the friendship of Horace Greeley and the support of the New York Tribune heretofore our most powerful and faithful allies 35 ",
