			"previous": " During the five years which followed the First Siege of Kruj Albania was allowed some respite as the new sultan set out to conquer the last vestiges of the Byzantine Empire but a battle did take place in 1452 when another Ottoman army sent to Albania was defeated again by Skanderbeg s forces During this period skirmishes between Skanderbeg and the Dukagjin family which had been dragging on for years were put to an end by a reconciliatory intervention of the Pope and in 1454 a peace treaty between them was finally reached 88 ",
			"after": " In November 1453 Skanderbeg informed King Alfonso that he had conquered some territories and a castle and Alfonso replied some days later that soon Ramon d Ortaf would return to continue the war against the Ottomans and promised more troops and supplies In the beginning of 1454 Skanderbeg and the Venetians 89 informed King Alfonso and the Pope about a possible Ottoman invasion and asked for help The Pope sent 3 000 ducats while Alfonso sent 500 infantry and a certain amount of money 90 along with a message directed to Skanderbeg 91 Meanwhile the Venetian Senate was resenting Skanderbeg s alliance with the Kingdom of Naples an old enemy of the Republic Frequently they delayed their tributes to Skanderbeg and this was long a matter of dispute between the parties with Skanderbeg threatening war on Venice at least three times during the 1448 1458 period and Venice conceding in a conciliatory tone 92 ",
