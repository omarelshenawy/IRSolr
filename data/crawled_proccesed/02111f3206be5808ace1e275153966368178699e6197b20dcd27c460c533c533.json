			"previous": " The inventions of Thomas Savery and the Scottish engineer James Watt gave rise to modern mechanical engineering The development of specialized machines and their maintenance tools during the industrial revolution led to the rapid growth of mechanical engineering both in its birthplace Britain and abroad 3 ",
			"after": " John Smeaton was the first self proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the father of civil engineering He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges canals harbours and lighthouses He was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist Smeaton designed the third Eddystone Lighthouse 1755 59 where he pioneered the use of hydraulic lime a form of mortar which will set under water and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse His lighthouse remained in use until 1877 and was dismantled and partially rebuilt at Plymouth Hoe where it is known as Smeaton s Tower He is important in the history rediscovery of and development of modern cement because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain hydraulicity in lime work which led ultimately to the invention of Portland cement ",
