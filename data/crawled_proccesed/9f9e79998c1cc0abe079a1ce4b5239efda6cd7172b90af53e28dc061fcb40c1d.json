			"previous": " In 1824 the French physicist Fran ois Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields termed Arago s rotations which by manually turning switches on and off Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor 20 21 22 23 In the 1880s many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors 24 because AC s advantages in long distance high voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC Practical rotating AC induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887 In 1888 the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris s research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 In 1888 Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two phase four stator pole motor types one with a four pole rotor forming a non self starting reluctance motor another with a wound rotor forming a self starting induction motor and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887 however also described a shorted winding rotor induction motor George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla s patents employed Tesla to develop them and assigned C F Scott to help Tesla Tesla leaving for other pursuits in 1889 23 30 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars 24 but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride Colorado in 1891 45 46 47 Steadfast in his promotion of three phase development Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky invented the three phase cage rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three limb transformer in 1890 This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications 48 49 However he claimed that Tesla s motor was not practical because of two phase pulsations which prompted him to persist in his three phase work 50 Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893 these early Westinghouse motors were two phase motors with wound rotors until B G Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor 37 The General Electric Company began developing three phase induction motors in 1891 37 By 1896 General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross licensing agreement for the bar winding rotor design later called the squirrel cage rotor 37 Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower HP induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7 5 HP motor in 1897 37 ",
