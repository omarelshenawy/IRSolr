			"previous": " Drag Extraction is the lightest and simplest egress system available and has been used on many experimental aircraft Halfway between simply bailing out and using explosive eject systems Drag Extraction uses the airflow past the aircraft or spacecraft to move the aviator out of the cockpit and away from the stricken craft on a guide rail Some operate like a standard ejector seat by jettisoning the canopy then deploying a drag chute into the airflow That chute pulls the occupant out of the aircraft either with the seat or following release of the seat straps who then rides off the end of a rail extending far enough out to help clear the structure In the case of the Space Shuttle the astronauts would have ridden a long curved rail blown by the wind against their bodies then deployed their chutes after free falling to a safe altitude ",
			"after": " Encapsulated Seat egress systems were developed for use in the B 58 Hustler and B 70 Valkyrie supersonic bombers These seats were enclosed in an air operated clamshell which permitted the aircrew to escape at airspeeds and altitudes high enough to otherwise cause bodily harm These seats were designed to allow the pilot to control the plane even with the clamshell closed and the capsule would float in case of water landings ",
