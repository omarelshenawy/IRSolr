			"previous": " The trend during World War I had been towards larger destroyers with heavier armaments A number of opportunities to fire at capital ships had been missed during the War because destroyers had expended all their torpedoes in an initial salvo The British V and W classes of the late war had sought to address this by mounting six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts instead of the four or two on earlier models The V and W s set the standard of destroyer building well into the 1920s ",
			"after": " The next major innovation came with the Japanese Fubuki class or special type designed in 1923 and delivered in 1928 The design was initially noted for its powerful armament of six five inch 127 mm guns and three triple torpedo mounts The second batch of the class gave the guns high angle turrets for anti aircraft warfare and the 24 inch 61 cm oxygen fueled Long Lance Type 93 torpedo The later Hatsuharu class of 1931 further improved the torpedo armament by storing its reload torpedoes close at hand in the superstructure allowing reloading within 15 minutes ",
