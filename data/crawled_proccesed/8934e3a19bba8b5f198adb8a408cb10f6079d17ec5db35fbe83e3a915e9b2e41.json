			"after": " The pale crag martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight although it will occasionally feed on the ground Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory flying back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills 10 Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns 33 When not breeding they may also hunt low over open ground The insects caught depend on what is locally available but may include mosquitoes flies Hymenoptera ants and beetles This martin often feeds alone but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant 10 such as agricultural areas wetlands and sewage works The pale crag martin drinks in flight as it skims the water surface 27 although at least some of its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes 34 Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry rocky areas in which the pale crag martin nests so there is little competition for food 27 ",
