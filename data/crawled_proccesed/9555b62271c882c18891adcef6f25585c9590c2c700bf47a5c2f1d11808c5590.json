			"previous": " Though BOAC had ordered modified Comet 4s it viewed the type as an intermediate rather than a long term type In 1956 BOAC ordered 15 Boeing 707s These were oversized and underpowered for BOAC s medium range Empire MRE African and Asian routes which involved destinations with hot and high airports that reduced aircraft performance notably between Karachi and Singapore and could not lift a full load from high altitude airports like Kano or Nairobi Several companies proposed a suitable replacement De Havilland offered the DH 118 a development of the Comet 5 project while Handley Page proposed the HP 97 based on their V bomber the Victor After carefully considering the routes Vickers offered the VC10 7 Crucially Vickers was the only firm willing to launch its design as a private venture instead of relying on government financing 8 ",
			"after": " The VC10 was a new design but used some production ideas and techniques as well as the Conway engines developed for the V 1000 and VC7 It had a generous wing equipped with wide chord Fowler flaps and full span leading edge slats for good take off and climb performance its rear engines gave an efficient clean wing and reduced cabin noise 9 The engines were also further from the runway surface than an underwing design an important factor in operations from rough runways such as those common in Africa wide low pressure tyres were also adopted with this same concern in mind 10 The VC10 was capable of landing and taking off at slower speeds than the rival 707 and its engines could produce considerably more thrust providing good hot and high performance and was considered to be a safer aircraft 11 ",
