			"previous": " Before the arrival of the first settlers in Ireland about 9 000 years ago the land was largely covered by forests of oak ash elm hazel yew and other native trees 33 The growth of blanket bog and the extensive clearing of woodland to facilitate farming are believed to be the main causes of deforestation during the following centuries Today about 12 of Ireland is forested of which a significant majority is composed of mainly non native coniferous plantations for commercial use 34 Ideal soil conditions high rainfall and a mild climate give Ireland the highest growth rates for forests in Europe Hedgerows which are traditionally used to define land boundaries are an important substitute for woodland habitat providing refuge for native wild flora and a wide range of insect bird and mammal species 35 ",
			"after": " Agriculture accounts for about 64 of the total land area 36 This has resulted in limited land to preserve natural habitats in particular for larger wild mammals with greater territorial requirements 37 The long history of agricultural production coupled with modern agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use has placed pressure on biodiversity 2 ",
