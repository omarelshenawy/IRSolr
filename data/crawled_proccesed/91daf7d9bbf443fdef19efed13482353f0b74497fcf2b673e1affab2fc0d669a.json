			"after": " During the first half of the 1930s various Soviet publications questioned the known historical facts regarding the age of the Cathedral The publications stressed that the medieval building had undergone major reconstructions and that little of the original Byzantine style cathedral was preserved This wave of questioning led to the demolition of the monastery and its replacement with a new administrative centre for the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic previously located in the city of Kharkiv Before its demolition June 8 July 9 1934 the structure was carefully studied by T M Movchanivskyi and K Honcharev from the recently purged and re organized Institute of Material Culture of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences On the basis of their survey the cathedral was declared to belong primarily to the Ukrainian Baroque style rather than to the twelfth century as was previously thought and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value This conclusion backed up the Soviet authorities plans to demolish the entire monastery Local historians archaeologists and architects agreed to the monastery s demolition although reluctantly Only one professor Mykola Makarenko refused to sign the demolition act he later died in a Soviet prison 1 nb 4 ",
