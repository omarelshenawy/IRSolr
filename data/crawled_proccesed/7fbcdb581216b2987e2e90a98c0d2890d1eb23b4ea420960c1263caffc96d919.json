			"previous": " These suggest that after the sacking of Jerusalem by Antiochus IV in 168 BCE at least part of the City of David to the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a fortified Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem 17 More than a citadel it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived 23 This is also supported by archaeological evidence including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE and are uncharacteristic of Second Temple era Jewish burial practices yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in Acre Ptolemais 41 50 51 ",
			"after": " Even were the name Acra applied to an entire Hellenistic quarter rather than to only a fortress a citadel certainly would have stood within that compound to billet the Macedonian garrison which we are told occupied it 34 It was normal for a Hellenistic city to have a fortified stronghold at or near the highest point of its walled area 19 Thus whether a part of a larger enclave or independent of its surroundings a citadel probably did stand at the northern tip of the City of David just south of the Temple Mount Archaeologists have tried to use finds from excavations conducted in the area to pinpoint this citadel s precise location ",
