			"after": " The F 22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar Measures to reduce radar cross section include airframe shaping such as planform alignment of edges fixed geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line of sight of the engine faces from any exterior view use of radar absorbent material RAM and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return The F 22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye 148 The aircraft s flat thrust vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing heat seeking surface to air or air to air missiles 149 Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight 150 ",
