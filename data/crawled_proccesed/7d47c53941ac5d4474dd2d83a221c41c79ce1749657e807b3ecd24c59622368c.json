			"previous": " A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any Cauchy sequence has a limit such a vector space is called complete Roughly a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits For example the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval 0 1 equipped with the topology of uniform convergence is not complete because any continuous function on 0 1 can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials by the Weierstrass approximation theorem 51 In contrast the space of all continuous functions on 0 1 with the same topology is complete 52 A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors vn converges to v if and only if",
			"after": " Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given respectively by a norm and an inner product Their study a key piece of functional analysis focusses on infinite dimensional vector spaces since all norms on finite dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence 53 The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1 norm and norm on R2 as the unit balls enclose each other a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm In the infinite dimensional case however there will generally be inequivalent topologies which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data ",
