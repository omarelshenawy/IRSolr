			"previous": " The Swazi economy is very closely linked to the economy of South Africa from which it receives over 90 of its imports and to which it sends about 70 of its exports Swaziland s other key trading partners are the United States and the EU from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports under the African Growth and Opportunity Act AGOA to the US and for sugar to the EU Under these agreements both apparel and sugar exports did well with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment Textile exports grew by over 200 between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50 over the same period ",
			"after": " The continued vibrancy of the export sector is threatened by the removal of trade preferences for textiles the accession to similar preferences for East Asian countries and the phasing out of preferential prices for sugar to the EU market Swaziland will thus have to face the challenge of remaining competitive in a changing global environment A crucial factor in addressing this challenge is the investment climate ",
