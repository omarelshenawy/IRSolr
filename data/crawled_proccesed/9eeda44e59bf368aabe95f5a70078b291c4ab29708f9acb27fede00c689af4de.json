			"after": " This species is considered Vulnerable by the IUCN due to its highly fragmented distribution dwindling population and habitat destruction 19 It is considered to be less common and more threatened than the closely related grey necked rockfowl 25 The stronghold of the species is in Sierra Leone and southern Guinea where the bird is still locally common if difficult to locate 13 It is estimated that only 2 500 to 10 000 white necked rockfowl survive with the population dwindling and spread out over a known 32 sites however most individuals studying this species believe that the population is far fewer than the 10 000 maximum 19 20 Many of its colonies are currently approaching the minimum population size necessary to guarantee long term viability against inbreeding 19 The primary threat is the commercial destruction of its habitat for timber 19 Although the white necked rockfowl is capable of withstanding some disturbance of the nearby habitat as demonstrated by one colony surviving after it was completely surrounded by a cocoa plantation habitat disturbance is far more likely to negatively impact on breeding success 12 19 Most of the remaining colonies in Guinea Sierra Leone and C te d Ivoire are on protected land while Liberia and Ghana s colonies are mostly unprotected 19 In part to protect this species Sierra Leone recently upgraded its protection of the Gola forest by turning it into its second national park Gola National Park and has announced that the country intends to work with Liberia to form a trans national park protecting the Gola rainforest 29 In return for lost logging rights Sierra Leone has compensated locals with road and school renovations additional training for police officers and construction of churches and a mosque 30 Liberia has also expressed a desire to expand its national park system which would help protect the species 19 In Guinea the bird s forests are being logged to provide land for rice farming to help support farmers immigrating from the country s drier north 13 ",
