			"previous": " Andrei N Tupolev 1 continued to improve the Tu 144 with upgrades and changes on the Tu 144 prototype While both Concorde and the Tu 144 prototype had ogival delta wings the Tu 144 s wing lacked Concorde s conical camber Production Tu 144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including such conical camber citation needed and they added a simple but practical device two small retractable canard surfaces one on either side of the forward section on the aircraft to increase lift at low speeds ",
			"after": " Moving the elevons downward in a delta wing aircraft increases the lift force but also pitches its nose downward The canards cancel out this nose downwards moment thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu 144s to 315 333 km h 196 207 mph 170 180 kn still faster than that of Concorde 2 The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu 144LL test flights as 315 335 km h 196 208 mph 170 181 kn however these were approach speeds exercised during test flights specifically intended to study landing effects at maximum possible range of speeds regardless of how hard and stable the landing can be As to regular landings FAA circular lists Tu 144S approach speed as 329 km h 204 mph 178 kn as opposed to Concorde s approach speed of 300 km h 190 mph 160 kn based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies 3 It is open to argument how stable the Tu 144S was at the listed airspeed In any event when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu 144D to a Tu 144LL standard the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu 144LL final approach speed on the order of 360 km hr depending on fuel weight 4 Brian Calvert Concorde s technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287 296 km h 178 184 mph 155 160 kn 5 The lower landing speed compared to Tu 144 is due to Concorde s more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise aeronautics performance a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well 6 ",
