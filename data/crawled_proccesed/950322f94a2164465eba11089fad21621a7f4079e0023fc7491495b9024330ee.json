			"previous": " Converting from mpg or to L 100 km or vice versa involves the use of the reciprocal function which is not distributive Therefore the average of two fuel economy numbers gives different values if those units are used because one of the functions is reciprocal thus not linear If two people calculate the fuel economy average of two groups of cars with different units the group with better fuel economy may be one or the other However from the point of energy used as a shared method of measure the result shall be the same in both the cases ",
