			"previous": " Selecting a point on the plot net thrust is calculated as follows  As an engine is throttled back there will be a variation of SFC with net thrust because of changes in the engine cycle e g lower overall pressure ratio and variations in component performance e g compressor efficiency When plotted the resultant curve is known as a thrust SFC loop A family of these curves can be generated at Sea Level Standard Day conditions over a range of flight speeds A Husk Plot RHS can be developed using this family of curves The net thrust scale is simply relabeled where is relative ambient pressure whilst the SFC scale is relabeled where is relative ambient temperature The resulting plot can be used to estimate engine net thrust and SFC at any altitude flight speed and climate for a range of throttle setting ",
