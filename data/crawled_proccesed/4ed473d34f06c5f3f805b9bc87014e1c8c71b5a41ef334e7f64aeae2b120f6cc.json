			"previous": " Weinman s obverse bears a resemblance to Oscar Roty s Sower design for French coins according to numismatic historian Roger Burdette Weinman has taken the ideal of a nineteenth century provincial figure and turned it into an American icon a 24 Burdette ties both the appearance of the head of Liberty and of the branches which she carries to Baltimore s Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument designed by Weinman 25 The sculptor may also have drawn inspiration from a 1913 bust he did of his tenant Elsie Stevens wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens Elsie Stevens is generally believed to have been a model for Weinman s Mercury dime her daughter Holly wrote in 1966 that her mother had been the model for both coins 26 The reverse is similar to Weinman s medal for the American Institute of Architects although the sculptor replaced the laurel on the medal with a pine sapling Weinman s work on the medal had been widely admired for the power of the depicted eagle 25 ",
			"after": " Breen in his comprehensive volume on US coins said of the half dollar Ms Liberty wears the American flag anticipating a rebellious counterculture by half a century 27 Though admiring the piece generally he noted that Liberty is striding towards the east that is towards war torn Europe and wrote she points into the sky at nothing visible perhaps aiming a warning at German warplanes 27 Breen objects to the use of the mountain pine on the reverse calling it not particularly American nor especially notable except for an ability to thrive near the tree line 27 ",
