			"previous": " At first human activity had not posed a significant threat to the Puerto Rican amazon The Ta no hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population 21 In the past two hundred years however many factors have led to a drastic decrease in the birds numbers agricultural development the construction of roads hydroelectric development and the adoption of young chicks as pets 22 Especially during the latter half of the 19th century most of Puerto Rico s virgin forests a historical habitat of the species were cleared for agricultural development primarily for the production of sugar cotton corn and rice The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible 23 As agriculture expanded the amazon s habitat disappeared further and its population declined ",
			"after": " The species was historically found in mature or old growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations and in holes cliffs and other diverse habitats at lower elevations The species could be found at medium elevations in the Guajataca State Forest until 1910 and the Rio Abajo State Forest until the 1920s and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest until the 1930s 24 Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the Luquillo forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island s coast to find food 14 At the same time the species was extirpated from Puerto Rico s smaller islands Culebra Vieques and Mona and became restricted to five locations two in karst limestone areas two in high montane rainforests and one in mangrove forest at the foot of the El Yunque National Forest One of these karst regions located in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico was identified as a haven for the species In particular a region named Valle de las Cotorras Valley of the Parrots located between San Sebasti n and Morovis was home to a sizable population Some amazons survived in small pockets of degraded forest but these proved insufficient to support large colonies Eventually their natural habitat was reduced to the Cordillera Central and undisturbed forest areas and by 1940 they were only to be found in primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest The species is currently found at elevations between 396 and 823 m 1 299 and 2 700 ft Since the species requires mature forests with open cavity trees for reproduction it does not occur in dwarf and secondary forests ",
