			"previous": " Maltese historian Giovanni Francesco Abela states that following their conversion to Christianity at the hand of St Paul the Maltese retained their Christian religion despite the Fatimid invasion 146 Abela s writings describe Malta as a divinely ordained bulwark of Christian European civilization against the spread of Mediterranean Islam 147 The native Christian community that welcomed Roger I of Sicily 28 was further bolstered by immigration to Malta from Italy in the 12th and 13th centuries ",
			"after": " For centuries the Church in Malta was subordinate to the Diocese of Palermo except when it was under Charles of Anjou who appointed bishops for Malta as did on rare occasions the Spanish and later the Knights Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese As a result of the Norman and Spanish periods and the rule of the Knights Malta became the devout Catholic nation that it is today It is worth noting that the Office of the Inquisitor of Malta had a very long tenure on the island following its establishment in 1530 the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798 after the Knights capitulated to the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte During the period of the Republic of Venice several Maltese families emigrated to Corfu Their descendants account for about two thirds of the community of some 4000 Catholics that now live on that island ",
