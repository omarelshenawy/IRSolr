			"previous": " When the airplane produces lift another drag component comes in Induced drag symbolized comes about due to a modification on the pressure distribution due to the trailing vortex system that accompanies the lift production Induced drag tends to be the most important component for airplanes during take off or landing flight Other drag component namely wave drag comes about from shock waves in transonic and supersonic flight speeds The shock waves induce changes in the boundary layer and pressure distribution over the body surface It is worth noting that not only viscous effects but also shock waves induce irreversible phenomena and as a consequence they can be measured through entropy changes along the domain as well The figure below is a summary of the various aspects previously discussed ",
