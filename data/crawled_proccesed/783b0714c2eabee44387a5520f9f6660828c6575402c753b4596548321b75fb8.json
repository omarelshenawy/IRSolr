			"previous": " In 1684 there was a major reorganisation of the French infantry and again in 1701 to fit in with Louis XIV s plans and the War of the Spanish Succession This reshuffle created many of the modern regiments of the French Army and standardised their equipment and tactics The army of the Sun King tended to wear grey white coats with coloured linings There were exceptions and the foreign troops recruited from outside France wore red Swiss Irish or blue Germans Scots while the French Guards wore blue In addition to these regiments of the line the Maison du Roi provided several elite units the Swiss Guards French Guards and the Regiments of Musketeers being the most famous The white grey coated French Infantry of the line Les Blancs with their Charleville muskets were a feared foe on the battlefields of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fighting in the Nine Years War the Wars of Spanish and Austrian Succession the Seven Years War and the American Revolution ",
			"after": " The revolution split the army with the main mass losing most of its officers to aristocratic flight or guillotine and becoming demoralised and ineffective The French Guard joined the revolt and the Swiss Guards were massacred during the storming of the Tuileries palace The remnants of the royal army were then joined to the revolutionary militias known as sans culottes and the National Guard a more middle class militia and police force to form the French Revolutionary Army ",
