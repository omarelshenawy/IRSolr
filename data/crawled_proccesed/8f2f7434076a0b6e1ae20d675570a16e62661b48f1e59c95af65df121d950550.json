			"previous": " Between the 8th and 11th centuries raiders and colonists from Scandinavia mainly Danish and Norwegian plundered western Europe including the British Isles 78 These raiders came to be known as the Vikings the name is believed to derive from Scandinavia where the Vikings originated 79 80 The first raids in the British Isles were in the late 8th century mainly on churches and monasteries which were seen as centres of wealth 79 81 The Anglo Saxon Chronicle reports that the holy island of Lindisfarne was sacked in 793 82 The raiding then virtually stopped for around forty years but in about 835 it started becoming more regular 83 ",
			"after": " In the 860s instead of raids the Danes mounted a full scale invasion In 865 an enlarged army arrived that the Anglo Saxons described as the Great Heathen Army This was reinforced in 871 by the Great Summer Army 83 Within ten years nearly all of the Anglo Saxon kingdoms fell to the invaders Northumbria in 867 East Anglia in 869 and nearly all of Mercia in 874 77 83 Kingdoms centres of learning archives and churches all fell before the onslaught from the invading Danes Only the Kingdom of Wessex was able to survive 83 In March 878 the Anglo Saxon King of Wessex Alfred with a few men built a fortress at Athelney hidden deep in the marshes of Somerset 85 He used this as a base from which to harry the Vikings In May 878 he put together an army formed from the populations of Somerset Wiltshire and Hampshire which defeated the Viking army in the Battle of Edington 85 The Vikings retreated to their stronghold and Alfred laid siege to it 85 Ultimately the Danes capitulated and their leader Guthrum agreed to withdraw from Wessex and to be baptised The formal ceremony was completed a few days later at Wedmore 85 86 There followed a peace treaty between Alfred and Guthrum which had a variety of provisions including defining the boundaries of the area to be ruled by the Danes which became known as the Danelaw and those of Wessex 87 The Kingdom of Wessex controlled part of the Midlands and the whole of the South apart from Cornwall which was still held by the Britons while the Danes held East Anglia and the North 88 ",
