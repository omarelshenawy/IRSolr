			"previous": " In Malagasy culture lemurs and animals in general have souls ambiroa which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if killed in a cruel fashion Because of this lemurs like many other elements of daily life have been a source of taboos known locally as fady which can be based around stories with four basic principles A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan They may also believe that a lemur s spirit may get revenge Alternatively the animal may appear as a benefactor Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities good or bad onto human babies 164 In general fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden but can include events that bring bad luck 82 ",
			"after": " One example of lemur fady told around 1970 comes from Ambatofinandrahana in the Fianarantsoa Province According to the account a man brought a lemur home in a trap but alive His children wanted to keep the lemur as a pet but when the father told them it was not a domestic animal the children asked to kill it After the children tortured the lemur it eventually died and was eaten A short time later all the children died of illness As a result the father declared that anyone who tortures lemurs for fun shall be destroyed and have no descendants 164 ",
