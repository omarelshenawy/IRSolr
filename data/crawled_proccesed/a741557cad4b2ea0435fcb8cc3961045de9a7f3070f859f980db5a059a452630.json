			"previous": " In the 1840s and 50s the issue of accepting slavery in the guise of rejecting slave owning bishops and missionaries split the nation s largest religious denominations the Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian churches into separate Northern and Southern denominations 58 Industrialization meant that seven European immigrants out of eight settled in the North The movement of twice as many whites leaving the South for the North as vice versa contributed to the South s defensive aggressive political behavior 59 ",
			"after": " Historically southern slave holding states because of their low cost manual labor had little perceived need for mechanization and supported having the right to sell cotton and purchase manufactured goods from any nation Northern states which had heavily invested in their still nascent manufacturing could not compete with the full fledged industries of Europe in offering high prices for cotton imported from the South and low prices for manufactured exports in return Thus northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while southern planters demanded free trade 60 ",
