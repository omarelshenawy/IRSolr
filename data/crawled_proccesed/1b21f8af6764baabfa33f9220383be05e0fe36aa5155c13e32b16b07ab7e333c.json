			"previous": " Some aircraft such as the Fokker Spin and model gliders lack any type of lateral control Those aircraft use a higher amount of dihedral than conventional aircraft Deflecting the rudder gives yaw and a lot of differential wing lift giving a yaw induced roll moment This type of control system is most commonly seen in the Flying Flea family of small aircraft and on simpler 2 function pitch and yaw control glider models or 3 function pitch yaw and throttle control model powered aircraft such as radio controlled versions of Old Timer free flight engine powered model aircraft ",
