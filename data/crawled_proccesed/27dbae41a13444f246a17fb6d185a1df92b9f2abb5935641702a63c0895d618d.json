			"previous": " Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth s gravity This causes a slow but steady leakage of the atmosphere into space Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases 159 The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth s atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is believed to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere 160 Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth 161 In the current oxygen rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape Instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere 162 ",
			"after": " The main part of the Earth s magnetic field is generated in the core the site of a dynamo process that converts kinetic energy of fluid convective motion into electrical and magnetic field energy The field extends outwards from the core through the mantle and up to Earth s surface where it is to rough approximation a dipole The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth s geographic poles At the equator of the magnetic field the magnetic field strength at the surface is 3 05 10 5 T with global magnetic dipole moment of 7 91 1015 T m3 163 The convection movements in the core are chaotic the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment This causes field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700 000 years ago 164 165 ",
