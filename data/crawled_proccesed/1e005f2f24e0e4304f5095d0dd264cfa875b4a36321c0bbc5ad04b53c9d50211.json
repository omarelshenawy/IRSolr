			"previous": " The sixty one year reign of the Kangxi Emperor was the longest of any Chinese emperor Kangxi s reign is also celebrated as the beginning of an era known as the High Qing during which the dynasty reached the zenith of its social economic and military power Kangxi s long reign started when he was eight years old upon the untimely demise of his father To prevent a repeat of Dorgon s dictatorial monopolizing of power during the regency the Shunzhi Emperor on his deathbed hastily appointed four senior cabinet ministers to govern on behalf of his young son The four ministers Sonin Ebilun Suksaha and Oboi were chosen for their long service but also to counteract each other s influences Most important the four were not closely related to the imperial family and laid no claim to the throne However as time passed through chance and machination Oboi the most junior of the four achieved such political dominance as to be a potential threat Even though Oboi s loyalty was never an issue his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him into an escalating conflict with the young emperor In 1669 Kangxi through trickery disarmed and imprisoned Oboi a significant victory for a fifteen year old emperor over a wily politician and experienced commander ",
			"after": " The early Manchu rulers also established two foundations of legitimacy which help to explain the stability of their dynasty The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo Confucian culture which they adopted from earlier dynasties 43 Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar official elites gradually came to terms with each other The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials Imperial patronage of Kangxi Dictionary demonstrated respect for Confucian learning while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values The second major source of stability was the Central Asian aspect of their Manchu identity which allowed them to appeal to Mongol Tibetan and Uighur constituents The Qing rulers were simultaneously emperors to the Han Chinese khans to the Mongols and presented themselves as Buddhist sage rulers patrons of Tibetan Buddhism for the newly conquered areas of Central Asia 44 The Kangxi Emperor also welcomed to his court Jesuit missionaries who had first come to China under the Ming Missionaries including Tom s Pereira Martino Martini Johann Adam Schall von Bell Ferdinand Verbiest and Antoine Thomas held significant positions as military weapons experts mathematicians cartographers astronomers and advisers to the emperor The relationship of trust was however lost in the later Chinese Rites controversy ",
