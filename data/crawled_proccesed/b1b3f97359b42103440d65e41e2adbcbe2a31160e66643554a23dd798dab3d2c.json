			"previous": " The libretto of H M S Pinafore relied on stock character types many of which were familiar from European opera and some of which grew out of Gilbert s earlier association with the German Reeds the heroic protagonist tenor and his love interest soprano the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue contralto the baffled lyric baritone the girl s father and a classic villain bass baritone Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter singing character With the success of H M S Pinafore the D Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented and each opera would make use of these stock character types Before The Sorcerer Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer Gilbert no longer hired stars he created them He and Sullivan selected the performers writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars ",
			"after": " The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer John Wellington Wells would become the ruler of the Queen s navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H M S Pinafore then join the army as Major General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance and so on Similarly Mrs Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore then into Ruth the piratical maid of all work in Pirates Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years becoming stars of the Victorian stage These included George Grossmith the principal comic Rutland Barrington the lyric baritone Richard Temple the bass baritone and Jessie Bond the mezzo soprano soubrette ",
