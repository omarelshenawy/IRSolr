			"previous": " Most groups considered in the first stage of the development of group theory were concrete having been realized through numbers permutations or matrices It was not until the late nineteenth century that the idea of an abstract group as a set with operations satisfying a certain system of axioms began to take hold A typical way of specifying an abstract group is through a presentation by generators and relations ",
			"after": " A significant source of abstract groups is given by the construction of a factor group or quotient group G H of a group G by a normal subgroup H Class groups of algebraic number fields were among the earliest examples of factor groups of much interest in number theory If a group G is a permutation group on a set X the factor group G H is no longer acting on X but the idea of an abstract group permits one not to worry about this discrepancy ",
