			"previous": " The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency of all the modes is called the dominant mode Between cutoff and the next highest mode this is the only mode it is possible to transmit which is why it is described as dominant Any spurious modes generated are rapidly attenuated along the length of the guide and soon disappear Practical filter designs are frequently made to operate in the dominant mode 12 ",
			"after": " In circular waveguide the dominant mode is TE11 u and is shown in figure 2 The next highest mode is TM01 v The range over which the dominant mode is guaranteed to be spurious mode free is less than that in rectangular waveguide the ratio of highest to lowest frequency is approximately 1 3 in circular waveguide compared to 2 0 in rectangular guide 14 ",
