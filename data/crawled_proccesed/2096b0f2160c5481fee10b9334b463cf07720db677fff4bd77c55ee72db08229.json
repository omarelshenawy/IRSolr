			"previous": " Material assigned to Plateosaurus has been found at over 50 localities in Germany mainly along the Neckar and Pegnitz river valleys Switzerland Frick and France 17 Three localities are of special importance because they yielded specimens in large numbers and of unusually good quality near Halberstadt in Saxony Anhalt Germany Trossingen in Baden W rttemberg Germany and Frick 12 Between the 1910s and 1930s excavations in a clay pit in Saxony Anhalt revealed between 39 and 50 skeletons that belonged to Plateosaurus along with teeth and a small number of bones of the theropod Liliensternus and two skeletons and some fragments of the turtle Proganochelys 12 Some of the plateosaur material was assigned to P longiceps a species described by palaeontologist Otto Jaekel in 1914 18 but now considered a junior synonym of P engelhardti Most of the material found its way to the Museum f r Naturkunde in Berlin where much of it was destroyed during World War II 17 The Halberstadt quarry today is covered by a housing development 17 ",
			"after": " The second major German locality with P engelhardti finds a quarry in Trossingen in the Black Forest was worked repeatedly in the 20th century 17 Between 1911 and 1932 excavations during six field seasons led by German palaeontologists Eberhard Fraas 1911 1912 Friedrich von Huene 1921 23 2 19 and finally Reinhold Seemann 1932 revealed a total of 35 complete or partially complete skeletons of Plateosaurus as well as fragmentary remains of approximately 70 more individuals 17 The large number of specimens from Swabia had already caused German palaeontologist Friedrich August von Quenstedt to nickname the animal Schw bischer Lindwurm Swabian lindworm or Swabian dragon B Much of the Trossingen material was destroyed in 1944 when the Naturaliensammlung in Stuttgart predecessor to the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart SMNS burnt to the ground after an Allied bombing raid Luckily however a 2011 study by SMNS curator Rainer Schoch found that at least from the finds of Seemann s 1932 excavation the scientifically most valuable material is still available C ",
