			"previous": " Small aircraft typically do not have thrust reversal systems except in specialized applications On the other hand large aircraft those weighing more than 12 500 lb almost always have the ability to reverse thrust citation needed Reciprocating engine turboprop and jet aircraft can all be designed to include thrust reversal systems ",
			"after": " Propeller driven aircraft generate reverse thrust by changing the angle of their controllable pitch propellers so that the propellers direct their thrust forward This reverse thrust feature became available with the development of controllable pitch propellers which change the angle of the propeller blades to make efficient use of engine power over a wide range of conditions Single engine aircraft tend not to have reverse thrust However single engine turboprop aircraft such as the PAC P 750 XSTOL 6 Cessna 208 Caravan and Pilatus PC 6 Porter do have this feature available citation needed ",
