			"previous": " The term archaeoastronomy was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity at the suggestion of Euan MacKie in 1973 15 but as a topic of study it may be much older depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined Clive Ruggles 16 says that Heinrich Nissen working in the mid nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer Rolf Sinclair 17 says that Norman Lockyer working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries could be called the father of archaeoastronomy Euan MacKie 18 would place the origin even later stating the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of Alexander Thom in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s ",
			"after": " In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer Gerald Hawkins who proposed that Stonehenge was a Neolithic computer 19 inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed 20 but this was not the case for Alexander Thom s work whose survey results of megalithic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles 21 Euan MacKie recognizing that Thom s theories needed to be tested excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter s prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom s long alignment hypothesis Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site led him to check Thom s geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay also with a positive result MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom s conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain 22 In contrast a re evaluation of Thom s fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom s claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence 23 Nevertheless Thom s legacy remains strong Krupp 24 wrote in 1979 Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo astronomical fieldwork and interpretation and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy 25 26 ",
