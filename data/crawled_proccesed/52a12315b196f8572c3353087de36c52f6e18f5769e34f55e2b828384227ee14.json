			"previous": " The fifth generation was ushered in by the Lockheed Martin Boeing F 22 Raptor in late 2005 Currently the cutting edge of fighter design fifth generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network centric combat environment and to feature extremely low all aspect multi spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques They have multifunction AESA radars with high bandwidth low probability of intercept LPI data transmission capabilities The Infra red search and track sensors incorporated for air to air combat as well as for air to ground weapons delivery in the 4 5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances These sensors along with advanced avionics glass cockpits helmet mounted sights not currently on F 22 and improved secure jamming resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi platform multi sensor data fusion for vastly improved situational awareness while easing the pilot s workload 21 Avionics suites rely on extensive use of very high speed integrated circuit VHSIC technology common modules and high speed data buses Overall the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth generation fighters with a first look first shot first kill capability ",
			"after": " The AESA radar offers unique capabilities for fighters and it is also quickly becoming essential for Generation 4 5 aircraft designs as well as being retrofitted onto some fourth generation aircraft In addition to its high resistance to ECM and LPI features it enables the fighter to function as a sort of mini AWACS providing high gain electronic support measures ESM and electronic warfare EW jamming functions ",
