			"previous": " Wage gaps have been identified for many races within the United States however research has found that the size and causes of the wage gap differs by race 7 For instance the median black male worker earns 74 percent as much as the median white male worker while the median Hispanic male worker earns only 63 percent as much 3 To understand more fully and accurately the subject of the racial wage gap in the United States it is useful to look at different races individually to understand the causes and outcomes that are unique to them ",
			"after": " The Civil Rights Act of 1964 which forbade employers from discriminating on the basis of race 2 was one of the earliest and greatest influences on the black white wage gap The act along with the economic prosperity of the 1960s contributed to rising black wages increased education for blacks and increased returns to education 4 Indeed in 1940 black men s weekly wages were only 48 4 percent of white men s wages In 1990 black men s wages were 75 percent of white men s a 60 percent improvement over five decades 12 ",
