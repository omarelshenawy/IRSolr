			"previous": " From the 11th century newly incorporated features were either based on the traditional dravida plan of the Badami Chalukyas as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at Pattadakal or were further elaborations of this articulation The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components visible as a more crowded decoration as can be seen in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district 32 ",
			"after": " The architects in the Karnataka region seem to have been inspired by architectural developments in northern India This is evidenced by the fact that they incorporated decorative miniature towers multi aedicular towers depicting superstructures of the Sekhari and Bhumija types supported on pilasters almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India The miniature towers represented shrines which in turn represented deities Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections 33 Well known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple both at Lakkundi 34 ",
