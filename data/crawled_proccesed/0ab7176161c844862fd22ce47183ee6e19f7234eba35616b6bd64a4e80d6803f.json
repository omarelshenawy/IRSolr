			"previous": " The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is Giraffatitan brancai previously classified as a species of Brachiosaurus Its remains were discovered in Tanzania between 1907 and 1912 Bones from several similar sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the Museum f r Naturkunde Berlin 62 this mount is 12 meters 39 ft tall and 21 8 22 5 meters 72 74 ft long 63 64 and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30000 and 60000 kilograms 70000 and 130000 lb The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 meter 89 ft long Diplodocus which was discovered in Wyoming in the United States and displayed in Pittsburgh s Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907 65 ",
			"after": " There were larger dinosaurs but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils Most of the largest herbivorous specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later and include the massive Argentinosaurus which may have weighed 80000 to 100000 kilograms 90 to 110 short tons some of the longest were the 33 5 meters 110 ft long Diplodocus hallorum 8 formerly Seismosaurus and the 33 meters 108 ft long Supersaurus 66 and the tallest the 18 meters 59 ft tall Sauroposeidon which could have reached a sixth floor window The heaviest and longest of them all may have been Amphicoelias fragillimus known only from a now lost partial vertebral neural arch described in 1878 Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone the animal may have been 58 meters 190 ft long and weighed over 120000 kg 260000 lb 8 The largest known carnivorous dinosaur was Spinosaurus reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters 52 to 60 ft and weighing in at 8150 kg 18000 lb 67 Other large carnivorous theropods included Giganotosaurus Carcharodontosaurus and Tyrannosaurus 68 Therizinosaurus and Deinocheirus were among the tallest of the theropods ",
