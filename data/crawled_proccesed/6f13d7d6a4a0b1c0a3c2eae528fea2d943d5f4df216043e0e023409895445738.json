			"after": " Marsh rice rats are active during the night and for this reason are rarely seen although they may be among the most common small mammals in part of their range They will build nests of sedge and grass about 13 cm 5 in large which are placed under debris near shrubs in short burrows or high in aquatic vegetation They may also use old nests of marsh wrens Cistothorus palustris red winged blackbirds Agelaius phoeniceus muskrats Ondatra zibethicus or round tailed muskrats Neofiber alleni Marsh rice rats sometimes make large runways or dig burrows 146 They are accomplished and willing swimmers easily swimming for more than 10 m 30 ft under water 147 and will often seek safety in the water when alarmed 148 Rice rats in the Florida Keys occasionally climb in vegetation but never higher than 90 cm 3 ft 149 Marsh rice rats are very clean and extensively groom themselves perhaps to keep their fur water repellent 150 They are aggressive towards conspecifics and emit high pitched squeaks while fighting 74 In dense vegetation the perceptual range the distance from which an animal can detect a patch of suitable habitat of marsh rice rats is less than 10 m 33 ft 151 When released outside of their natural wetland habitat marsh rice rats generally move either upwind or downwind anemotaxis perhaps in order to move in a straight line which is an efficient strategy to find suitable habitat 152 ",
