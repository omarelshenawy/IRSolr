			"after": " Although genes contain all the information an organism uses to function the environment plays an important role in determining the ultimate phenotypes an organism displays This is the complementary relationship often referred to as nature and nurture The phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genes and the environment An interesting example is the coat coloration of the Siamese cat In this case the body temperature of the cat plays the role of the environment The cat s genes code for dark hair thus the hair producing cells in the cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair But these dark hair producing proteins are sensitive to temperature i e have a mutation causing temperature sensitivity and denature in higher temperature environments failing to produce dark hair pigment in areas where the cat has a higher body temperature In a low temperature environment however the protein s structure is stable and produces dark hair pigment normally The protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder such as its legs ears tail and face so the cat has dark hair at its extremities 60 ",
