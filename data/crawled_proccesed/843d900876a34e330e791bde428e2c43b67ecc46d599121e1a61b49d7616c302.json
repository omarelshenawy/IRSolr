			"previous": " In August 1974 the first RB 199 powered flight of a prototype Tornado occurred the engine completed its qualification tests in late 1978 101 The final production standard engine met both reliability and performance standards though the development cost had been higher than predicted in part due to the ambitious performance requirements 102 At the time of the Tornado s introduction to service the turbine blades of the engine suffered from a shorter life span than desired which was rectified by the implementation of design revisions upon early production engines 103 Several uprated engines were developed and used on both the majority of Tornado ADVs and Germany s Tornado ECRs 104 105 The DECU Digital Engine Control Unit 106 is the current engine control unit for RB 199 engines superseding the analogue MECU Main Engine Control Unit also known as CUE 107 ",
