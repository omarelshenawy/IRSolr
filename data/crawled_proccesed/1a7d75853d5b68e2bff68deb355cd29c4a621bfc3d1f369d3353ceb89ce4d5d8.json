			"after": " As part of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 Congress authorized an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project A report known as the Restudy written by the U S Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District was submitted to Congress in 1999 It cited indicators of harm to the system a 50 reduction in the original Everglades diminished water storage harmful timing of water release an 85 to 90 decrease in wading bird populations over the past 50 years and the decline of output from commercial fisheries Bodies of water including Lake Okeechobee the Caloosahatchee River St Lucie estuary Lake Worth Lagoon Biscayne Bay Florida Bay and the Everglades reflected drastic water level changes hypersalinity and dramatic changes in marine and freshwater ecosystems The Restudy noted the overall decline in water quality over the past 50 years was caused by loss of wetlands that act as filters for polluted water 64 It predicted that without intervention the entire South Florida ecosystem would deteriorate Canals took roughly 170 billion US gallons 640 Gl of water to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico daily so there was no opportunity for water storage yet flooding was still a problem 65 Without changes to the current system the Restudy predicted water restrictions would be necessary every other year and annually in some locations It also warned that revising some portions of the project without dedicating efforts to an overall comprehensive plan would be insufficient and probably detrimental 66 ",
