			"after": " Johannesburg s suburbs are the product of urban sprawl and are regionalised into north south east and west and they generally have different personalities While the Central Business District and the immediate surrounding areas were formerly desirable living areas the spatial accommodation of the suburbs has tended to see a flight from the city and immediate surrounds The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life The immediate city suburbs include Yeoville a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some townships The suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the native African middle class The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city and some residential areas have become commercialised particularly around the area of Sandton stretching north towards Midrand a half way point between Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria ",
