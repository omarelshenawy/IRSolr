			"previous": " As the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the United States Department of Defense DoD in 1976 17 18 The United States Navy USN which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing 19 McDonnell Douglas modified two AV 8As with new wings revised intakes redesigned exhaust nozzles and other aerodynamic changes the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes 20 21 Designated YAV 8B the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978 at the hands of Charles Plummer The aircraft performed three vertical take offs and hovered for seven minutes at Lambert St Louis International Airport 22 The second aircraft followed on 19 February 1979 but crashed that November due to engine flameout the pilot ejected safely 21 23 Flight testing of these modified AV 8s continued into 1979 17 The results showed greater than expected drag hampering the aircraft s maximum speed Further refinements to the aerodynamic profile yielded little improvement 21 Positive test results in other areas including payload range and V STOL performance led to the award of a development contract in 1979 The contract stipulated a procurement of 12 aircraft initially followed by a further 324 2 24 ",
			"after": " Between 1978 and 1980 the DoD and USN repeatedly attempted to terminate the AV 8B program There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues At the time the USN wanted to procure A 18s for its ground attack force and to cut costs pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly designed F 18 fighter instead of the AV 8B to fulfill the role of close air support both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole F A 18 Hornet 25 Despite these bureaucratic obstacles in 1981 the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five year defense plan The USN declined to participate in the procurement citing the limited range and payload compared with conventional aircraft 26 ",
