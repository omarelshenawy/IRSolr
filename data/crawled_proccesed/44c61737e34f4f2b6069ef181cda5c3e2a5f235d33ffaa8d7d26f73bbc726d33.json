			"previous": " Lindwall returned to England in 1953 the site of his triumph five years earlier Lindwall was to exhibit performances that were rated higher than during the Invincibles tour Roland Perry wrote that Lindwall reached his zenith producing a sustained sensational season of brilliant powerful and intelligent fast bowling 65 In the tour matches leading up to the Test Lindwall set about gaining a psychological advantage over England s leading batsmen In doing so he could leave them in a poor state leading up to the Test potentially curtailing their ability to win matches In a match against Yorkshire Lindwall bowled Hutton with an inswinger yorker something he had developed the previous year During a match against the country champions Surrey at The Oval Lindwall came across Peter May who was regarded as the best young English batsman to emerge from the post war era Lindwall s first over to May consisted of three inswingers and three outswingers leaving him perplexed and uncertain about his position at top level cricket Although Lindwall did not dismiss May he regarded it as his best over at any level of cricket The unsettled May was bowled in the following over by Ron Archer Lindwall s performances saw him regarded as the finest fast bowler of his time 65 ",
			"after": " After Australia had been bowled out for 249 in the first innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge 21 65 Lindwall s high paced swing yielded 5 57 and cut England down for 144 However Australia were then bowled out for only 123 leaving England 228 for victory They were 1 120 with Lindwall wicketless as rain curtailed the match 21 65 In the Second Test at Lord s England had reached 1 177 at stumps on the second day in reply to Australia s 346 The following day Lindwall yorked rising star Tom Graveney and took 5 66 to restrict England to a lead of 26 runs In Australia s second innings Lindwall scored the fastest half century in Ashes history He took just 48 minutes to reach the mark with two sixes and five fours 66 The match was drawn with Lindwall taking 2 26 in the second innings 21 Lindwall had helped to reduce England to 3 12 at stumps on the fourth day after removing Don Kenyon and Hutton with the new ball but defiant batting on the final day saved the English 66 The Third Test was again drawn due to heavy rain with Lindwall failing to pass double figures in either innings and taking 2 30 in the first innings Hassett won the toss for the fourth consecutive Test at Headingley and sent England into bat In front of his home crowd in Yorkshire Hutton was yorked second ball from a pacy inswinging yorker Lindwall produced a display of fast and accurate pace bowling taking 5 54 from 35 overs as England managed only 169 67 After Australia took a 97 run lead Lindwall took 3 104 to help leave the tourists with a victory target of 177 This was not before dour English all rounder Trevor Bailey attempted to stone wall an Australian victory by batting for over four hours for 38 runs Along with Miller the pair took 14 wickets between them displaying their pivotal role in Australia s bowling attack 68 especially in the absence of the injured Johnston who was unavailable for most of the tour 69 Hutton ordered Bedser and Bailey to bowl leg theory from a long run sending balls down the leg side to prevent the Australians from scoring England held on for a draw with Australia 30 runs short when time ran out 67 70 The teams met at The Oval for the deciding Test and Australia could manage 275 after winning the toss with Lindwall striking a quickfire 62 noted for an array of off drives to top score and push the total to respectability 71 Lindwall then took 4 70 but it was not enough to prevent England taking a 31 run lead Australia collapsed for 162 in the second innings with the Surrey spin twins of Jim Laker and Tony Lock taking nine wickets between them This left England 132 to win something they achieved with eight wickets intact Lindwall was unable to remove any of the Englishmen 21 70 ",
