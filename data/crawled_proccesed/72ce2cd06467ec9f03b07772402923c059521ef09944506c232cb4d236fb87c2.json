			"previous": " The peregrine falcon hunts most often at dawn and dusk when prey are most active but also nocturnally in cities particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent Nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as yellow billed cuckoo black necked grebe virginia rail and common quail 59 The peregrine requires open space in order to hunt and therefore often hunts over open water marshes valleys fields and tundra searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air 61 Large congregations of migrants especially species that gather in the open like shorebirds can be quite attractive to hunting peregrines Once prey is spotted it begins its stoop folding back the tail and wings with feet tucked 19 Prey is typically struck and captured in mid air the peregrine falcon strikes its prey with a clenched foot stunning or killing it with the impact then turns to catch it in mid air 61 If its prey is too heavy to carry a peregrine will drop it to the ground and eat it there If they miss the initial strike peregrines will chase their prey in a twisting flight 62 Although previously thought rare several cases of peregrines contour hunting i e using natural contours to surprise and ambush prey on the ground have been reported and even rare cases of prey being pursued on foot In addition peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests from birds such as kittiwakes 63 Prey is plucked before consumption 48 ",
			"after": " The peregrine falcon is sexually mature at one to three years of age but in healthy populations they breed after two to three years of age A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics precise spirals and steep dives 15 The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid air To make this possible the female actually flies upside down to receive the food from the male s talons ",
