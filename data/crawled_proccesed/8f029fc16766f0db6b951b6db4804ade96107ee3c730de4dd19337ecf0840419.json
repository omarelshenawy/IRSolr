			"previous": " The Su 27 had the Soviet Union s first operational fly by wire control system based on the Sukhoi OKB s experience with the T 4 bomber project Combined with relatively low wing loading and powerful basic flight controls it makes for an exceptionally agile aircraft controllable even at very low speeds and high angle of attack In airshows the aircraft has demonstrated its maneuverability with a Cobra Pugachev s Cobra or dynamic deceleration briefly sustained level flight at a 120 angle of attack ",
			"after": " The naval version of the Flanker the Su 27K or Su 33 incorporates canard aeronautics for additional lift force reducing takeoff distances These canards have also been incorporated in some Su 30s the Su 35 and the Su 37 ",
