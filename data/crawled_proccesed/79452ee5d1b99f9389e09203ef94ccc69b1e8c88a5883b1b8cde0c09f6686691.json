			"previous": " Kunisaki put his mine up for sale asking 6 million to recoup his expenses Even though mine profits had been poor over the decades prices of precious gems were very high at the time due to the worldwide oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s Four individuals or groups seriously considered Kunisaki s offer 78 Relying heavily upon Delmer Brown s expertise Harry C Bullock and J R Edington formed the limited partnership American Yogo Sapphire Limited becoming the 14th American company to work the Yogo dike Bullock and Brown had Yogo mine experience as they had worked with di Suvero Bullock s plan included mining cutting making jewelry and marketing the whole spectrum of the business They paid the 6 million asked by Kunisaki and then raised another 7 2 million in funding by October 1981 Brown located quality gemcutters in Thailand and set up the American Yogo Sapphire Company there Brown also set up a thorough computerized security system that tracked gems from the mine to the gemcutters 78 Bigger roughs were sent to American cutters specialty cuts were done in Germany a few cuts were done in Hong Kong and the vast majority were done in Thailand 79 American Yogo Sapphire Limited secured a 5 million line of credit with Citibank Desiring a more modern name American Yogo Sapphire Limited changed its name to Intergem Limited in early 1982 Intergem marketed the Yogo as the Royal American Sapphire Their first line of jewelry appeared in mid 1982 first marketed regionally in the American west and later at the national level Intergem also developed a system of authorized dealers 78 and found success in its first four years with sales over 3 million in 1984 alone 80 ",
			"after": " Intergem rocked the gem trade by marketing the Yogo as the world s only guaranteed untreated sapphire By 1982 the practice of routinely heat treating gems had become a major issue in the industry 78 At the time 95 percent of all the world s sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires known as geuda and heated them to an artificial blue 81 A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95 percent accuracy Intergem s marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry 81 82 In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated Intergem s strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch 80 ",
