			"previous": " Many laboratory techniques exist for the determination of melting points A Kofler bench is a metal strip with a temperature gradient range from room temperature to 300 C Any substance can be placed on a section of the strip revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point Differential scanning calorimetry gives information on melting point together with its enthalpy of fusion ",
			"after": " A basic melting point apparatus for the analysis of crystalline solids consists of an oil bath with a transparent window most basic design a Thiele tube and a simple magnifier The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath The oil bath is heated and stirred and with the aid of the magnifier and external light source melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed In large small devices the sample is placed in a heating block and optical detection is automated ",
