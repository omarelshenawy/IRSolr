			"previous": " Webster retains his high prestige in recent historiography Baxter argues that his nationalistic view of the union as one and inseparable with liberty homie the union to triumph over the states rights Confederacy making it his greatest contribution 33 However Bartlett emphasizing Webster s private life says his great oratorical achievements were in part undercut by his improvidence with money his excessively opulent lifestyle and his numerous conflict of interest situations 34 Remini points out that Webster s historical orations taught Americans their history before textbooks were widely available 35 Webster was godlike in his articulation of American nationalism Remini agrees but his negative traits ruined his presidential ambition He lacked the necessary modesty and his overpowering desire for the White House and his craving for money was unbecoming to a statesman of his caliber in a nation committed to republicanism and fearful of corruption ",
			"after": " Webster s Reply to Hayne in 1830 was generally regarded as the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress and was a stock exercise for oratory students for 75 years 2  Ralph Waldo Emerson who had criticized Webster following the Seventh of March address remarked in the immediate aftermath of his death that Webster was the completest man and that nature had not in our days or not since Napoleon cut out such a masterpiece Others like Henry Cabot Lodge and John F Kennedy noted Webster s vices especially the perpetual debt against which he as Lodge reports employed checks or notes for several thousand dollars in token of admiration from his friends This was of course utterly wrong and demoralizing but Mr Webster came after a time to look upon such transactions as natural and proper He seems to have regarded the merchants and bankers of State Street very much as a feudal baron regarded his peasantry It was their privilege and duty to support him and he repaid them with an occasional magnificent compliment 24 ",
