			"previous": " As a direct result of indiscriminate breeding practices as of 2001 only a few thousand purebred Marwaris existed 21 Research studies have been conducted to examine the genetics of the Marwari and its relationship to other Indian and non Indian horse breeds Six different breeds have been identified in India the Marwari Kathiawari Spiti pony Bhutia pony Manipuri Pony and Zanskari These six are distinct from each other in terms of unique performance traits and different agroclimactic conditions in the various areas of India where they originated A 2005 study was conducted to identify past genetic bottlenecks in the Marwari The study found that in the DNA of the horses tested there was no evidence of a genetic bottleneck in the breed s history However since the population has decreased rapidly in past decades bottlenecks may have occurred that were not identified in the study 21 In 2007 a study was conducted to assess genetic variation among all Indian horse breeds except the Kathiawari Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA the Marwari was found to be the most genetically distinct breed of the five studied and was most distant from the Manipuri none of the breeds were found to have close genetic ties to the Thoroughbred The Marwari was distinguishable from the other breeds in terms of both physical characteristics mainly height and environmental adaptability The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries the Marwari are closely associated with the Arabian horse while the four other breeds are supposedly descended from the Tibetan pony 22 ",
