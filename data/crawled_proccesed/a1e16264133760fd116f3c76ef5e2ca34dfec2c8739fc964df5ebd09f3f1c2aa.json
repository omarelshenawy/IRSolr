			"previous": " Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977 Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek energetic former self Hugely overweight his mind dulled by the pharmacopoeia he daily ingested he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts 268 In Alexandria Louisiana the singer was on stage for less than an hour and was impossible to understand 269 Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge he was unable to get out of his hotel bed and the rest of the tour was cancelled 269 Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health he stuck to most touring commitments In Rapid City South Dakota he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk according to Presley historian Samuel Roy and unable to perform any significant movement 270 Guralnick relates that fans were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment but it all seemed to go right past Elvis whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books 271 A cousin Billy Smith recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes 272 Way Down Presley s last single issued during his lifetime came out on June 6 His final concert was held in Indianapolis at Market Square Arena on June 26 ",
