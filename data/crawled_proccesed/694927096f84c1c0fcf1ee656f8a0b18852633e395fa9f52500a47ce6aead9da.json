			"previous": " Sharpe s early Gothic Revival works were pre archaeological including Holy Trinity Blackburn built in 1837 46 for Revd JW Whittaker 52 Hughes expresses the opinion that this church is Sharpe s pi ce de resistance 53 it contains a mongrel mix of Gothic styles 54 C Simultaneously Sharpe was involved in the design of about twelve more churches in Northwest England which increasingly incorporated more correct Gothic features 55 In 1841 he obtained a contract to build three churches and associated structures vicarages and schools for the Weaver Navigation Trustees at Weston Point Runcorn Castle Northwich and Winsford All three were in Cheshire and built between 1841 and 1844 56 Between 1835 and 1842 Sharpe designed about 30 new churches in Lancashire and Cheshire all to a low budget and all to a degree pre archaeological 57 In 1843 Sharpe was able to fulfil his promise to build a church for the Earl of Derby this was St Mary Knowsley which was completed and consecrated the following year 58 It is described by Hughes as one of Sharpe s loveliest creations 59 About the same time he designed a new steeple for St Michael Kirkham 60 the steeple and St Mary s Church contained much more in the way of correct Gothic features and both were praised by the Camden Society in The Ecclesiologist 61 ",
			"after": " In the early 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher his future brother in law to build a church near Fletcher s home in Little Bolton Fletcher was the owner of a coal mine at Ladyshore Little Lever overlooking the River Irwell and the Manchester Bolton Bury Canal He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make refractory bricks for furnaces and suggested its use for building the church as it was much cheaper than stone Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built in whole or in part from this material terracotta St Stephen and All Martyrs Lever Bridge 1842 44 62 As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like Sharpe himself called this church and its two successors the pot churches a nickname that has stuck The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness its sturdiness as a building material and the fact that it could be moulded into almost any shape It could therefore be used for walls towers arches and arcades in a church for the detailed decoration of capitals and pinnacles and also as at St Stephen s for the furnishings such as the altar pulpit font organ case and the pew ends Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls St Stephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta 63 D The following year a second church was built using the same material Trinity Church Rusholme south of Manchester 1845 46 built and paid for by Thomas Carill Worsley who lived at nearby Platt Hall In this case although the exterior is in terracotta the interior is of plastered brick The church was consecrated in June 1846 although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete including the heating seating and floor tiling 1 64 65 E ",
