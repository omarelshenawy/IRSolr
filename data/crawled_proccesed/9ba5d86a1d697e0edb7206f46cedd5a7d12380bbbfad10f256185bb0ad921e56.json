			"previous": " In recognition of the resemblance of the teeth to those of the iguana Mantell named his new genus Iguanodon or iguana tooth from iguana and the Greek word odon odontos or tooth 4 Based on isometric scaling he estimated that the creature might have been up to 18 metres 60 ft long more than the 12 metres 40 ft length of Megalosaurus 12 His initial idea for a name was Iguana saurus Iguana lizard but his friend William Daniel Conybeare suggested that that name was more applicable to the iguana itself so a better name would be Iguanoides Iguana like or Iguanodon 44 45 He neglected to add a specific name to form a proper binomial so one was supplied in 1829 by Friedrich Holl I anglicum which was later amended to I anglicus 46 ",
			"after": " A more complete specimen of similar animal was discovered in a quarry in Maidstone Kent in 1834 lower Lower Greensand Formation which Mantell soon acquired He was led to identify it as an Iguanodon based on its distinctive teeth The Maidstone slab was utilized in the first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of Iguanodon but due to its incompleteness Mantell made some mistakes the most famous of which was the placement of what he thought was a horn on the nose 47 The discovery of much better specimens in later years revealed that the horn was actually a modified thumb Still encased in rock the Maidstone skeleton is currently displayed at the Natural History Museum in London The borough of Maidstone commemorated this find by adding an Iguanodon as a supporter to their coat of arms in 1949 48 This specimen has become linked with the name I mantelli a species named in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in place of I anglicus but it actually comes from a different formation than the original I mantelli I anglicus material 45 The Maidstone specimen also known as Gideon Mantell s Mantel piece and formally labelled NHMUK 3741 49 50 was subsequently excluded from Iguanodon It is classified as cf Mantellisaurus by McDonald 2012 51 as cf Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis by Norman 2012 49 and made the holotype of a separate species Mantellodon carpenteri by Paul 2012 50 ",
