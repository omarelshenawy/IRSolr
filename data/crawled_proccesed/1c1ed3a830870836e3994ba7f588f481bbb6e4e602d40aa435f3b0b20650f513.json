			"previous": " In sailboats keels use the forward motion of the boat to generate lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind The rudimentary purpose of the keel is to convert the sideways motion of the wind when it is abeam into forward motion A secondary purpose of the keel is to provide ballast ",
			"after": " Keels are different from centreboards and other types of foils in that keels are made of heavy materials to provide ballast to stabilize the boat Keels may be fixed or non movable or they may retract to allow sailing in shallower waters Retracting keels may pivot a swing keel or slide upwards to retract and are usually retracted with a winch due to the weight of the ballast Since the keel provides far more stability when lowered than when retracted due to the greater moment arm involved the amount of sail carried is generally reduced when sailing with the keel retracted ",
