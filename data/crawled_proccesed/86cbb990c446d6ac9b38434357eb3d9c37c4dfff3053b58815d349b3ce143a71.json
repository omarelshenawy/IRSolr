			"after": " Females start to breed when they reach sexual maturity typically in their second year At this point they become fertile once a year producing multiple ova while in heat 93 As prey is most abundant in spring and early summer the devil s reproductive cycle starts in March or April so that the end of the weaning period coincides with the maximisation of food supplies in the wild for the newly roaming young devils 94 Occurring in March mating takes places in sheltered locations during both day and night Males fight over females in the breeding season and female devils will mate with the dominant male 44 95 Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21 day period and copulation can take five days one instance of a couple being in the mating den for eight days has been recorded 95 Devils are not monogamous and females will mate with several males if not guarded after mating males also reproduce with several females during a season 44 95 Females have been shown to be selective in an attempt to ensure the best genetic offspring 95 for example fighting off the advances of smaller males 35 Males often keep their mates in custody in the den or take them along if they need to drink lest they engage in infidelity 95 Males can produce up to 16 offspring over their lifetime while females average four mating seasons and 12 offspring 95 Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and make the species insulated against high mortality 96 The pregnancy rate is high 80 of two year old females were observed with newborns in their pouches during the mating season 95 More recent studies of breeding place the mating season between February and June as opposed to between February and March 34 ",
