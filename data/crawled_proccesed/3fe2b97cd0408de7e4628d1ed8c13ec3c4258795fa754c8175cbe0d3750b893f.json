			"previous": " The above double integral is the generalized distance functional between two plymer conformation is a spatial parameter and is pseudo time This means that is the polymer string conformation at time and is parameterized along the string length by Similarly is the trajectory of an infinitesimal segment of the string during transformation of the entire string from conformation to conformation The term with cofactor is a Lagrange multiplier and its role is to ensure that the length of the polymer remains the same during the transformation If two discrete polymers are inextensible then the minimal distance transformation between them no longer involves purely straight line motion even on a Euclidean metric There is a potential application of such generalized distance to the problem of protein folding 1 2 This generalized distance is analogous to the Nambu Goto action in string theory however there is no exact correspondence because the Euclidean distance in 3 space is inequivalent to the space time distance minimized for the classical relativistic string ",
