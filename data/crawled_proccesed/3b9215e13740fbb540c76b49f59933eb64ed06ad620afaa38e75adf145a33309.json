			"previous": " The F 18 initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267 was drastically modified from the YF 17 For carrier operations the airframe undercarriage and tailhook were strengthened folding wings and catapult attachments were added and the landing gear widened 7 To meet Navy range and reserves requirements McDonnell increased fuel capacity by 4 460 pounds 2 020 kg by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96 gallon fuel tank to each wing A snag was added to the wing s leading edge and stabilators to prevent an Aeroelastic flutter discovered in the F 15 stabilator The wings and stabilators were enlarged the aft fuselage widened by 4 inches 102 mm and the engines canted outward at the front These changes added 10 000 lb 4 540 kg to the gross weight bringing it to 37 000 lb 16 800 kg The YF 17 s control system was replaced with a fully digital fly by wire system with quadruple redundancy the first to be installed in a production fighter 7 ",
			"after": " Originally it was planned to acquire a total of 780 aircraft of three variants the single seat F 18A fighter and A 18A attack aircraft differing only in avionics and the dual seat TF 18A which retained full mission capability of the F 18 with a reduced fuel load 8 Following improvements in avionics and multifunction displays and a redesign of external stores stations the A 18A and F 18A were able to be combined into one aircraft 4 Starting in 1980 the aircraft began to be referred to as the F A 18A and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984 The TF 18A was redesignated F A 18B 4 ",
