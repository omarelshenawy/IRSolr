			"previous": " A study in 2007 used computer models to estimate running speeds based on data taken directly from fossils and claimed that Tyrannosaurus rex had a top running speed of 8 metres per second 29 km h 18 mph An average professional football soccer player would be slightly slower while a human sprinter can reach 12 metres per second 43 km h 27 mph These computer models predict a top speed of 17 8 metres per second 64 km h 40 mph for a 3 kilogram 6 6 lb Compsognathus 105 106 probably a juvenile individual 107 ",
			"after": " However in 2010 Scott Persons a graduate student from the University of Alberta proposed that Tyrannosaurus s speed may have been enhanced by strong tail muscles 108 He found that theropods such as T rex had certain muscle arrangements that are different from modern day birds and mammals but with some similarities to modern reptiles 109 He concluded that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability agility and balance The caudofemoralis muscle would have been a key muscle in femoral retraction pulling back the leg at the femur 108 The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus s tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles the elongation of its tail s hemal arches According to Persons the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hind quarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight improving its overall balance and agility This would also have made the animal less front heavy thus reducing rotational inertia Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy and thereby improved locomotive efficiency Persons adds that this means that non avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base 108 109 ",
