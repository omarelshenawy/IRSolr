			"previous": " Dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity 134 In 2004 the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN reported stating that currently birds 135 mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at maximum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates possibly 1 024 times higher In 2006 there were believed to be 4 035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle Of these 1 356 33 6 were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1 427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status 136 A number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species climate change endocrine disrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like chytridiomycosis However many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are a topic of ongoing discussion 137 ",
			"after": " With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators 138 In many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass Any decline in amphibian numbers will have an impact on the patterns of predation The loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species In the Middle East a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes 139 Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline The western terrestrial garter snake Thamnophis elegans in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are diminishing in numbers the Yosemite toad Bufo canorus and the mountain yellow legged frog Rana muscosa putting the snake s future at risk If the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it 140 Meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences 141 ",
