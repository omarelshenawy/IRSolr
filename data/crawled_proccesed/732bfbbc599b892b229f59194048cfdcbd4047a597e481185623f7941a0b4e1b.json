			"previous": " For example an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane More generally an equation or system of equations in two or more variables defines a curve a surface or some other such object in n dimensional space In Diophantine geometry one asks whether there are any rational points points all of whose coordinates are rationals or integral points points all of whose coordinates are integers on the curve or surface If there are any such points the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed A basic question in this direction is are there finitely or infinitely many rational points on a given curve or surface What about integer points ",
