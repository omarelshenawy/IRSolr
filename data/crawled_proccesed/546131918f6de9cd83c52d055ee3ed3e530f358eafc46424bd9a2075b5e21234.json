			"previous": " Prospective colourists at A Farsari Co were interviewed by Farsari himself who ensured they were familiar with Japanese painting techniques Once hired they were given unpaid instruction for several months and then a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts On the other hand Farsari complained in a letter to his sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage swear and beat them which he did according to a fixed schedule By 1891 A Farsari Co had 32 employees 19 of whom were hand colouring artists 18 ",
			"after": " In 1885 Farsari had a daughter Kiku by a Japanese woman whom he may not have married He described himself as living like a misanthrope associating with very few people outside of business and his correspondence indicates that he increasingly hoped to return to Italy He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States and he even hoped to be made a cavaliere and thereby join the Italian aristocracy His success in these endeavours is not clear Nevertheless in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in Vicenza 19 ",
