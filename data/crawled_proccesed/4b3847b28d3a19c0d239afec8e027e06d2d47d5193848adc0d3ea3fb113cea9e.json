			"previous": " Gorgosaurus teeth were typical of all known tyrannosaurids The eight premaxillary teeth at the front of the snout were smaller than the rest closely packed and D shaped in cross section In Gorgosaurus the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section rather than blade like as in most other theropods 2 Along with the eight premaxillary teeth Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30 maxillary teeth and 30 to 34 teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw This number of teeth is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus 6 ",
			"after": " Gorgosaurus shared its general body plan with all other tyrannosaurids Its massive head was perched on the end of an S shaped neck In contrast to its large head its forelimbs were very small The forelimbs had only two digits although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens the vestigial remains of the third digit seen in other theropods Gorgosaurus had four digits on each hindlimb including a small first toe hallux which did not contact the ground Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods 2 The largest known Gorgosaurus femur measured 105 cm 41 in long In several smaller specimens of Gorgosaurus the tibia was longer than the femur a proportion typical of fast running animals 1 The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens 7 The long heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips 2 ",
