			"after": "  Keep It Together received mixed reviews from critics Mark C Taylor author of Nots Religion and Postmodernism felt that Keep It Together was a striking instance of her repeated invocation of family values He believed that Madonna s fascination for family was reflected in the song 10 Carol Benz one of the authors of The Madonna Connection believed that the song was successful in asserting the necessity of family ties 11 J Randy Taraborrelli author of Madonna An Intimate Biography described the track as an uptempo romp about the trials and tribulations and the joys of having a family 12 Martha Bayles author of Hole In Our Soul felt that Keep It Together failed to become an anthem for emotional commitment because of the funk nature of the song 13 Madonna Unauthorized s writer Christopher Anderson proclaimed the track as a worthy number one single and complimented the song s theme of allegiance to one s family despite the turmoil and dissensions that occur 14 Lucy O Brien author of Madonna Like an Icon described it as an upbeat meditation on sibling power and believed that the purpose behind the song was to present a homey image of brothers and sisters happy and together and Madonna s need to restore bonds and relationships that had become fraught or distant in her life then 15 Hadley Freeman from The Guardian described Keep It Together as amazing purely for being Madonna s take on Sister Sledge s We Are Family a concept no one foresaw and the fact that she later disowned various members of her family gives it shall we say an interesting tinge of irony 16 ",
