			"previous": " Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market designing many works specifically for the English market Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477 the export market became more important Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites including Edward IV of England James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu 112 ",
			"after": " There was considerable overlap between panel painting and illumination van Eyck van der Weyden Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures In addition miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings Campin s work was often used as a source in this way for example in the Hours of Raoul d Ailly 113 Commissions were often shared between several masters with junior painters or specialists assisting especially with details such as the border decorations these last often done by women 105 The masters rarely signed their work making attribution difficult the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost 110 114 ",
