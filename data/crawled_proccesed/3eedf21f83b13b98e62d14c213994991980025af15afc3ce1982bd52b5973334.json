			"previous": " Following the Little Ice Age s end around 1850 glaciers around the Earth have retreated substantially A slight cooling led to the advance of many alpine glaciers between 1950 1985 but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss has become larger and increasingly ubiquitous 14 15 16 ",
			"after": " Glaciers move or flow downhill due to gravity and the internal deformation of ice 17 Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50 m 160 ft The pressure on ice deeper than 50 m causes plastic flow At the molecular level ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter layer binding strength it moves faster than the layer below 18 ",
