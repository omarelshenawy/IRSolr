			"previous": " Superheater operation is similar to that of the coils on an air conditioning unit although for a different purpose The steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace The temperature in this area is typically between 1 300 and 1 600 C 2 372 and 2 912 F Some superheaters are radiant type that is they absorb heat by radiation Others are convection type absorbing heat from a fluid Some are a combination of the two types Through either method the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within While the temperature of the steam in the superheater rises the pressure of the steam does not and the pressure remains the same as that of the boiler 9 Almost all steam superheater system designs remove droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and associated piping ",
			"after": " Supercritical steam generators are frequently used for the production of electric power They operate at supercritical pressure In contrast to a subcritical boiler a supercritical steam generator operates at such a high pressure over 3 200 psi or 22 MPa that the physical turbulence that characterizes boiling ceases to occur the fluid is neither liquid nor gas but a super critical fluid There is no generation of steam bubbles within the water because the pressure is above the critical pressure point at which steam bubbles can form As the fluid expands through the turbine stages its thermodynamic state drops below the critical point as it does work turning the turbine which turns electrical generator from which power is ultimately extracted The fluid at that point may be a mix of steam and liquid droplets as it passes into the condenser This results in slightly less fuel use and therefore less greenhouse gas production The term boiler should not be used for a supercritical pressure steam generator as no boiling actually occurs in this device ",
