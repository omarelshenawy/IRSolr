			"previous": " In 1964 a rise in the price of silver led to silver coins being hoarded by the public With change short hoarding extended to the cent which also became scarce in circulation Mint Director Eva Adams felt that part of the reason for the shortage was coin collectors taking pieces from circulation and Adams ordered that mintmarks no longer appear on coins Coins continued to be dated 1964 until the end of 1965 using authority given by the Coinage Act of 1965 and almost all 1965 cents were actually struck in 1966 62 The Mint began striking clad dimes and quarters replacing the silver pieces which the public would not spend Although coinage had been stopped at San Francisco after 1955 the California facility began to issue cents again though without mintmarks 63 In 1968 mintmarks were restored to the cent San Francisco began minting a limited number of circulation strikes 64 which it would cease to do after 1974 65 and began striking proof coins 64 ",
			"after": " Copper prices began to rise in 1973 to such an extent that the intrinsic value of the coin approached a cent and citizens began to hoard cents hoping to realize a profit The Mint decided to switch to an aluminum cent Over a million and a half such pieces were struck in the second half of 1973 though they were dated 1974 At congressional hearings representatives of the vending machine industry testified that aluminum cents would jam their equipment and the Mint backed away from its proposal 66 Mint director Mary Brooks sought the return of samples which had been distributed to members of Congress but 14 remained missing with the recipients affecting not to know what had become of them One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Numismatic Collection 67 68 another was reportedly found by a US Capitol Police Officer 67 ",
