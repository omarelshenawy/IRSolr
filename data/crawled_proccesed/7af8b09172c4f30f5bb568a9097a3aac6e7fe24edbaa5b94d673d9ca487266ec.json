			"previous": " The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded agricultural and suburban landscapes and is no more than 6 miles 10 km from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven Meriden New Britain Hartford and Springfield Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield Northampton Amherst Holyoke West Hartford Farmington Wallingford and Hamden 3 ",
			"after": " The Metacomet Ridge is the result of continental rifting processes that took place 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods The basalt also called traprock crest of the Metacomet Ridge is the product of a series of massive lava flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of the North American continent from Eurasia and Africa Essentially the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric rift valley which was once a branch of or a parallel of the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean 9 ",
