			"previous": " Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings of fixed wing aircraft which when deployed allow the wing to operate at a higher angle of attack A higher coefficient of lift is produced as a result of angle of attack and speed so by deploying slats an aircraft can fly at slower speeds or take off and land in shorter distances They are usually used while landing or performing maneuvers which take the aircraft close to the stall but are usually retracted in normal flight to minimize drag ",
