			"previous": " That same year Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date The Papah naumoku kea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres 340 000 km2 and is home to 7 000 species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands 170 The move was hailed by conservationists for its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area 171 ",
			"after": " In his 2007 State of the Union Address Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production 172 Amid high gasoline prices in 2008 Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling 173 However the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling Bush said This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U S Congress 173 Bush had said in June 2008 In the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells In the short run the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil And that means we need to increase supply especially here at home So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production 174 ",
