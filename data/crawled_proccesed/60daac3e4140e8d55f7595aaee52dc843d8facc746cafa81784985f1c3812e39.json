			"after": " Corrugated waveguide filters also called ridged waveguide filters consist of a number of ridges or teeth that periodically reduce the internal height of the waveguide as shown in figures 10 and 11 They are used in applications which simultaneously require a wide passband good passband matching and a wide stopband They are essentially low pass designs above the usual limitation of the cutoff frequency unlike most other forms which are usually band pass The distance between teeth is much smaller than the typical 4 distance between elements of other filter designs Typically they are designed by the image parameter method with all ridges identical but other classes of filter such as Chebyshev can be achieved in exchange for complexity of manufacture In the image design method the equivalent circuit of the ridges is modelled as a cascade of LC half sections The filter operates in the dominant TE10 mode but spurious modes can be a problem when they are present In particular there is little stopband attenuation of TE20 and TE30 modes 66 ",
