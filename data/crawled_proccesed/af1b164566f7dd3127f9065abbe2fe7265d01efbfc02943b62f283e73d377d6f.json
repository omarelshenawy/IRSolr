			"previous": " The Pan American Highway route in North America is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48 000 km 30 000 mi in length which travels through the mainland nations of the Americas No definitive length of the Pan American Highway exists because the US and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan American Highway and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the US border However the total length of the North American portion of the highway is roughly 26 000 km 16 000 mi ",
