			"after": " Barn owls living in tropical regions can breed at any time of year but some seasonality in nesting is still evident Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons egg laying usually takes place during the dry season with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off In arid regions such as parts of Australia breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods triggered by temporary increases in the populations of small mammals In temperate climates nesting seasons become more distinct and there are some seasons of the year when no egg laying takes place In Europe and North America most nesting takes place between March and June when temperatures are increasing The actual dates of egg laying vary by year and by location being correlated with the amount of prey rich foraging habitat around the nest site and often with the phase of the rodent abundance cycle 38 An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting thus even in the cooler parts of its range two broods are often raised in a good year 5 ",
