			"previous": " Development of the olm and other troglobite amphibians is characterized by heterochrony the animal does not undergo metamorphosis and instead retains larval features The form of heterochrony in the olm is neoteny delayed somatic maturity with precocious reproductive maturity i e reproductive maturity is reached while retaining the larval external morphology In other amphibians the metamorphosis is regulated by the hormone thyroxine excreted by the thyroid gland The thyroid is normally developed and functioning in the olm so the lack of metamorphosis is due to the unresponsiveness of key tissues to thyroxine 12 ",
			"after": " The olm swims by eel like twisting of its body assisted only slightly by its poorly developed legs It is a predatory animal feeding on small crabs snails and occasionally insects 5 It does not chew its food instead swallowing it whole The olm is resistant to long term starvation an adaptation to its underground habitat It can consume large amounts of food at once and store nutrients as large deposits of lipids and glycogen in the liver When food is scarce it reduces its activity and metabolic rate and can also reabsorb its own tissues in severe cases Controlled experiments have shown that an olm can survive up to 10 years without food 28 ",
