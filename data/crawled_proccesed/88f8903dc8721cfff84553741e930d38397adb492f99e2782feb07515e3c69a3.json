			"previous": " Berry died in 1416 with no male heir and deeply in debt Those of his works in precious metal and jewels that had not already gone to his creditors were mostly seized by the English when they took Paris in July 1417 56 This was the first of a number of periods that saw the large scale destruction of goldsmiths work that the cup escaped but thousands of other pieces did not a survival that Brigitte Buettner finds almost miraculous 57 In particular the move to Spain in 1604 enabled it to avoid the dispersal and destruction of the English Crown Jewels and royal collection of plate under the English Commonwealth 31 ",
			"after": " As a secular piece the cup would be an almost unique survival at this level of quality the one representative left to us of medieval secular plate in its most sumptuous development 58 Although French plate in silver and gold was made in great quantities and at a high level of quality French silver made prior to the early 19th century is probably scarcer than that of any other European country 59 The cost of even very skilled labour was low compared to that of the materials and in the absence of any reliable way of either depositing or investing money it was turned into lavish objects in the knowledge that it might well need to be sold or melted down to finance some future project If it survived long enough to become old fashioned it was likely to be melted down and remodelled in a new style 60 ",
