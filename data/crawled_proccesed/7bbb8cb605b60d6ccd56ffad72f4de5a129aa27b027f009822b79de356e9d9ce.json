			"previous": " The fulmarine petrels are generalists which for the most part take many species of fish and crustacea The giant petrels uniquely for Procellariiformes will feed on land eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds The diet of the giant petrels varies according to sex with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion 22 All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea a habit that has been implicated in but not proved to have caused the expansion in range of the Northern Fulmar in the Atlantic 23 ",
			"after": " Three of the six prion species have bills filled with lamellae which act as filters to sift zooplankton from the water 24 Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected This technique is often used in conjunction with a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward with wings and feet as if walking on the water ",
