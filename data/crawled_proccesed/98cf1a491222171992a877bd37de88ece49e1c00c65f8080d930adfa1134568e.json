			"previous": " Fruit bodies typically grow in clusters and are found on dead or decaying wood or on woody fragments in cow or horse dung 10 Dung loving coprophilous species include C stercoreus C costatus C fimicola and C pygmaeus 16 Some species have been collected on woody material like dead herbaceous stems the empty shells or husks of nuts or on fibrous material like coconut jute or hemp fiber woven into matting sacks or cloth 17 In nature fruit bodies are usually found in moist partly shaded sites such as the edges of woods on trails or around lighted openings in forests They are less frequently found growing in dense vegetation and deep mosses as these environments would interfere with the dispersal of peridioles by falling drops of water 18 The appearance of fruit bodies is largely dependent upon features of the immediate growing environment specifically optimum conditions of temperature moisture and nutrient availability are more important factors for fruit rather than the broad geographical area in which the fungi are located or the season 18 Examples of the ability of Cyathus to thrive in somewhat inhospitable environments are provided by C striatus and C stercoreus which can survive the drought and cold of winter in temperate North America 19 and the species C helenae which has been found growing on dead alpine plants at an altitude of 7 000 feet 2 100 m 20 ",
			"after": " In general species of Cyathus have a worldwide distribution but are only rarely found in the arctic and subarctic 3 One of the best known species C striatus has a circumpolar distribution and is commonly found throughout temperate locations while the morphologically similar C poeppigii is widely spread in tropical areas rarely in the subtropics and never in temperate regions 21 The majority of species are native to warm climates For example although 20 different species have been reported from the United States and Canada only 8 are commonly encountered on the other hand 25 species may be regularly found in the West Indies and the Hawaiian Islands alone have 11 species 22 Some species seem to be endemic to certain regions such as C novae zeelandiae found in New Zealand or C crassimurus found only in Hawaii however this apparent endemism may just be a result of a lack of collections rather than a difference in the habitat that constitutes a barrier to spread 22 Although widespread in the tropics and most of the temperate world C stercoreus is only rarely found in Europe this has resulted in its appearance on a number of Red Lists For example it is considered endangered in Bulgaria 23 Denmark 24 and Montenegro 25 and near threatened in Great Britain 26 The discovery of a Cyathus species in Dominican amber C dominicanus suggests that the basic form of the bird s nest fungi had already evolved by the Cretaceous era and that the group had diversified by the mid Cenozoic 27 ",
