			"previous": " Around 105 however there appears to have been a serious setback at the hands of the tribes of the Picts of Alba several Roman forts were destroyed by fire with human remains and damaged armour at Trimontium at modern Newstead in SE Scotland indicating hostilities at least at that site There is also circumstantial evidence that auxiliary reinforcements were sent from Germany and an unnamed British war of the period is mentioned on the gravestone of a tribune of Cyrene However Trajan s Dacian Wars may have led to troop reductions in the area or even total withdrawal followed by slighting of the forts by the Picts rather than an unrecorded military defeat The Romans were also in the habit of destroying their own forts during an orderly withdrawal in order to deny resources to an enemy In either case the frontier probably moved south to the line of the Stanegate at the Solway Tyne isthmus around this time ",
			"after": " A new crisis occurred at the beginning of Hadrian s reign 117 a rising in the north which was suppressed by Quintus Pompeius Falco When Hadrian reached Britannia on his famous tour of the Roman provinces around 120 he directed an extensive defensive wall known to posterity as Hadrian s Wall to be built close to the line of the Stanegate frontier Hadrian appointed Aulus Platorius Nepos as governor to undertake this work who brought the Legio VI Victrix legion with him from Germania Inferior This replaced the famous Legio IX Hispana whose disappearance has been much discussed Archaeology indicates considerable political instability in Scotland during the first half of the 2nd century and the shifting frontier at this time should be seen in this context ",
