			"previous": " Plateosaurus had the typical body shape of a herbivorous bipedal dinosaur a small skull a long and flexible neck composed of 10 cervical neck vertebrae a stocky body and a long mobile tail composed of at least 40 caudal tail vertebrae 1 2 3 The arms of Plateosaurus were very short even compared to most other prosauropods However they were strongly built with hands adapted for powerful grasping 2 4 The shoulder girdle was narrow often misaligned in skeletal mounts and drawings 4 with the clavicles collar bones touching at the body s midline 2 as in other basal sauropodomorphs 5 The hind limbs were held under the body with slightly flexed knees and ankles and the foot was digitigrade meaning the animal walked on its toes 2 6 7 The proportionally long lower leg and metatarsus show that Plateosaurus could run quickly on its hind limbs 2 4 6 7 The tail of Plateosaurus was typically dinosaurian muscular and with high mobility 4 ",
			"after": " The skull of Plateosaurus is small and narrow rectangular in side view and nearly three times as long as it is high There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back The large round orbit eye socket the sub triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris nostril are of almost equal size 1 2 8 The jaws carried many small leaf shaped socketed teeth 5 to 6 per premaxilla 24 to 30 per maxilla and 21 to 28 per dentary lower jaw 1 2 8 The thick leaf shaped bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material 1 2 8 The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite 8 These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants 8 Its eyes were directed to the sides rather than the front providing all round vision to watch for predators 1 2 8 Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings rings of bone plates that protect the eye 1 2 8 ",
