			"previous": " Roman italic and oblique are also terms used to differentiate between upright and two possible slanted forms of a typeface Italic and oblique fonts are similar indeed oblique fonts are often simply called italics but there is strictly a difference italic applies to fonts where the letter forms are redesigned not just slanted Almost all serif faces have italic forms some sans serif faces have oblique designs Most faces do not offer both as this is an artistic choice by the font designer about how the slanted form should look 16 ",
			"after": " Sans serif lit without serif designs appeared relatively recently in the history of type design The evolution of the sans serif font very likely stemmed from the slab serif font The earliest slab serif font Antique later renamed Egyptian designed in 1815 by the English typefounder Vincent Figgins 17 was succeeded one year later by the first sans serif font created by William Caslon IV The evidence of this is clearly shown in the uniform strokes in the letter forms Sans serif fonts are commonly but not exclusively used for display typography such as signage headings and other situations demanding legibility above high readability The text on electronic media offers an exception to print most web pages and digitized media are laid out in sans serif typefaces because serifs often detract from readability at the low resolution of displays citation needed ",
