			"previous": " In most theories up to the eighteenth century light was pictured as being made up of particles Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction diffraction and birefringence of light wave theories of light were proposed by Ren Descartes 1637 30 Robert Hooke 1665 31 and Christiaan Huygens 1678 32 however particle models remained dominant chiefly due to the influence of Isaac Newton 33 In the early nineteenth century Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted 34 In 1865 James Clerk Maxwell s prediction 35 that light was an electromagnetic wave which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz s detection of radio waves 36 seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light ",
			"after": " The Maxwell wave theory however does not account for all properties of light The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only on its intensity not on its frequency nevertheless several independent types of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to atoms depends only on the light s frequency not on its intensity For example some chemical reactions are provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain threshold light of frequency lower than the threshold no matter how intense does not initiate the reaction Similarly electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by shining light of sufficiently high frequency on it the photoelectric effect the energy of the ejected electron is related only to the light s frequency not to its intensity 37 Note 4 ",
