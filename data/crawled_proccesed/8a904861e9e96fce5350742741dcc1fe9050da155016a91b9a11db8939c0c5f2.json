			"previous": " Humans arrived on the Florida Peninsula about 12 000 years ago when the ocean was about 350 feet 110 m lower than today and the peninsula was double its current size 80 These earliest people are called Paleo Indians They were primarily hunter gatherers who followed large game such as mastodons horses camels and bison Much of the land was far from water most fresh water was contained in glaciers and polar ice caps As a result Florida was an arid landscape with few trees dominated by grasslands and scrub vegetation 81 ",
			"after": " Around 9 000 years ago the climate warmed melting many of the polar ice caps and glaciers creating a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf As Paleo Indians did not have to travel as far to find water their camps became more permanent turning into villages With evidence of a wide variety of tools constructed around this time archeologists note the transition into Archaic people The Archaic people made tools from bone animal teeth and antlers They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos A few burial sites have been excavated including the Windover Archaeological Site in Brevard County near Titusville that provide evidence of burial rituals Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow peat marshes which preserved much of the human tissue 82 Further climate change between 5 000 and 3 000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period evidence suggests that human habitation near the St Johns River first occurred during this era Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time and numerous settlements near the St Johns have been recorded from this era the banks of the St Johns and its arteries are dotted with middens filled with thousands of shells primarily those of Viviparus georgianus a freshwater snail and oysters 83 84 ",
