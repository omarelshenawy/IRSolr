			"previous": " Britain had for a long time been sending its convicts across the Atlantic to the American colonies That trade was ended with the Declaration of Independence by the United States in 1776 Overrun with prisoners Britain decided in 1786 to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by Cook some 16 years earlier Captain Arthur Phillip was charged with establishing the new colony He led a fleet known as the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into Botany Bay on 18 January 1788 though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water He travelled a short way further north and arrived at Port Jackson on 26 January 1788 33 34 This was to be the location for the new colony The official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 February 1788 The name was at first to be Albion but Phillip decided on Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend Lord Sydney and his role in authorising the establishment of the settlement ",
			"after": " Between 1788 and 1792 about 4 300 convicts were landed at Sydney The colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity Maps from this time show no prison buildings the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging 35 36 Officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land 37 The region s indigenous population was also suffering It is estimated that half of the native people in Sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 1789 28 38 Some mounted violent resistance to the British settlers Lachlan Macquarie became Governor in 1810 and started an initiative to civilise Christianise and educate indigenous children by removing them from their clans and placing them with British households 39 ",
