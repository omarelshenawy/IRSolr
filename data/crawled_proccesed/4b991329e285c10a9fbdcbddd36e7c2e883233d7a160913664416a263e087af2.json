			"previous": " The corn crake winters mainly in Africa from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and central Tanzania south to eastern South Africa North of this area it is mainly seen on migration but occasionally winters in North Africa and to the west and north of its core area in southeast Africa Most of the South African population of about 2 000 birds occurs in KwaZulu Natal and the former Transvaal Province and numbers elsewhere in Africa are uncertain There are several nineteenth century records when populations were much higher than now of birds being seen in western Europe mainly Britain and Ireland between December and February 22 ",
			"after": " This crake migrates to Africa along two main routes a western route through Morocco and Algeria and a more important flyway through Egypt On passage it has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges including much of West Africa 12 Birds from Coll following the western route paused in West Africa on their way further south and again on the return flight when they also rested in Spain or North Africa 23 Eastern migrants have been recorded in those parts of southern Asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and Africa Further afield the corn crake has been recorded as a vagrant to Sri Lanka Vietnam and Australia 21 the Seychelles 24 Bermuda 25 Canada the US Greenland 12 Iceland the Faroes the Azores Madeira and the Canary Islands 22 ",
