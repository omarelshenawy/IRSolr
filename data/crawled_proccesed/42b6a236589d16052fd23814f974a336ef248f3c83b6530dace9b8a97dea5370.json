			"after": " Intermeshing rotors on a helicopter are a set of two rotors turning in opposite directions with each rotor mast mounted on the helicopter with a slight angle to the other so that the blades intermesh without colliding This configuration is sometimes referred to as a synchropter Intermeshing rotors have high stability and powerful lifting capability The arrangement was pioneered in Nazi Germany in 1939 with Anton Flettner s successful Flettner Fl 265 design and later placed in limited production as the successful Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri used by the German Kriegsmarine in small numbers 24 airframes produced as an experimental light anti submarine warfare helicopter During the Cold War an American company Kaman Aircraft produced the HH 43 Huskie for USAF firefighting and rescue missions The latest Kaman model the Kaman K MAX is a dedicated sky crane design ",
