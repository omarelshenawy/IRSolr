			"previous": " The early economy of Phoenix was focused primarily on agriculture and natural resources dependent mainly on the 5Cs which were copper cattle climate cotton and citrus 11 Once the Salt River Project was completed the city and the valley in general began to develop more rapidly due to a now fairly reliable source of water Led by agriculture the number one crop in the 1910s was alfalfa followed by citrus cotton and other crops with almost a quarter million acres under cultivation by the middle of the decade World War I would greatly change the agricultural landscape of the valley and teach the farmers of the region an invaluable if difficult lesson 105 106 ",
			"after": " As the war began imports of foreign cotton were no longer available to American manufacturing since cotton was a major material used in the production of tires and airplane fabric those manufacturers began to look for new sources The Salt River Valley looked to be an ideal location for expansion of the cotton crop Led by Goodyear tire and airplane manufacturers began to buy more and more cotton from valley growers In fact the town of Goodyear was founded during this period when the company purchased desert acreage southwest of Phoenix to grow cotton By 1918 cotton had replaced alfalfa as the number one industry in Phoenix As the price of cotton rose more and more of Phoenix acreage was devoted to the crop However in 1920 when cotton accounted for three quarters of the cultivated acreage in the valley the bottom fell out of the cotton market due to the dual reasons of lower demand due to the end of the war production machine and foreign growers now once again having access to the American market resulting in their shipping large amounts of cotton to the U S This led to a diversification of crops in the valley from that point forward 107 106 ",
