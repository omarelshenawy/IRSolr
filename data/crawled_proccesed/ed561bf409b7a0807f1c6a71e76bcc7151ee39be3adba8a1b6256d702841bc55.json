			"previous": " In any case the debate is purely modern it is clear that most Byzantine viewers did not consider their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic As Cyril Mango has observed our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this art is not naturalistic yet the Byzantines themselves judging by their extant statements regarded it as being highly naturalistic and as being directly in the tradition of Phidias Apelles and Zeuxis 9 ",
			"after": " The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial the two themes are often combined as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth century church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople These preoccupations are partly a result of the pious and autocratic nature of Byzantine society and partly a result of its economic structure the wealth of the empire was concentrated in the hands of the church and the imperial office which therefore had the greatest opportunity to undertake monumental artistic commissions ",
