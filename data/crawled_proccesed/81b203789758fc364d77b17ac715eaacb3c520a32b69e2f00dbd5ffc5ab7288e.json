			"after": " Initially the log line was not knotted and sailors measured the length directly on the line With the introduction of the nautical mile as a standard unit of measure at sea in the 15th century they began to mark the line at equal intervals proportional to the nautical mile and to the time interval used for measurement Initially the markings were simply knots in the line Later sailors worked knotted cords into the log line For convenience many ships used knots spaced 8 fathoms 48 feet or 14 6 meters apart while other ships endured the original 7 fathom prescription 7 The time interval needs to be adjusted according to the distance between knots Substituting 6 000 feet for 1 mile the above formula yields 28 8 seconds for a distance of 8 fathoms In fact 28 second and 14 second glasses used to be common among navigation equipment 8 ",
