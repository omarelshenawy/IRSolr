			"previous": " Litorea aurea is equally and most closely related to Li castanes and L ranaformis A microcomplement fixation technique using serum albumins has indicated the species closest to L aurea is L ranifomis Albumin immunological distance data suggest no differentiation between the two and the green and golden bell frog evolutionally separated from the other two species about 1 1 million years ago A 1995 study of protein variations showed four of 19 protein systems had variation and only two had differentiation 5 Scientists believe the different species can still hybridise as their distribution areas still overlap and both L raniformis and L aurea have been seen sharing ponds in the Gippsland area of Victoria 5 However little evidence of hybridisation actually occurring has been found Although there have been reports of frogs of mixed appearance in Gippsland analysis of proteins and sera of the frogs showed two distinct species 6 Samples in other area of distribution have shown no evidence of hybridisation in spite of cohabitation 6 ",
