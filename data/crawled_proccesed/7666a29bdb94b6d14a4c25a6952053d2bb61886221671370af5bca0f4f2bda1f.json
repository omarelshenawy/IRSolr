			"after": " Pipe organs use wind moving through pipes to produce sounds Since the 16th century pipe organs have used various materials for pipes which can vary widely in timbre and volume The pipes are divided into ranks and controlled by the use of hand stops and combination pistons Although the keyboard is not expressive as on a piano and does not affect dynamics pressing a key only turns the sound on or off some divisions may be enclosed in a swell box allowing the dynamics to be controlled by shutters Some organs are totally enclosed meaning all the manuals and the pedals can be controlled by one set of shutters Some special registers with free reed pipes are expressive These instruments vary greatly in size ranging from a cubic yard to a height reaching five floors 4 and are built in churches synagogues concert halls and homes Small organs are called positive easily placed in different locations or portative small enough to carry while playing Increasingly hybrid organs are appearing in which pipes are augmented with electronic additions Great economies of space and cost are possible especially when the lowest and largest of the pipes can be replaced ",
