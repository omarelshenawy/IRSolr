			"previous": " As in all mushroom producing fungi the fruit bodies sporocarps are the reproductive structures that are produced from fungal mycelium when the appropriate environmental conditions of temperature humidity and nutrient availability are met Hydnellum peckii is a stipitate hydnoid fungus meaning that it has a cap atop a stipe stem and a form resembling a Hydnum characterized by a teeth like hymenium rather than gills or pores on the underside of the cap Fruit bodies growing closely together often appear to fuse together this is called confluence They can reach a height of up to 10 5 cm 4 1 in 5 Fresh fruit bodies exude a striking thick red fluid when they are moist 2 ",
			"after": " The cap s surface is convex to flattened more or less uneven and sometimes slightly depressed in the center It is usually densely covered with hairs that give it a texture similar to felt or velvet these hairs are sloughed off in age leaving the caps of mature specimens smooth 5 Its shape varies from somewhat round to irregular 4 to 10 cm 1 6 to 3 9 in or even as much as 20 cm 7 9 in wide as a result of confluence The cap is initially whitish but later turns slightly brownish with irregular dark brown to nearly black blotches where it is bruised In maturity the surface is fibrous and tough scaly and jagged grayish brown in the upper part of the cap and somewhat woody The flesh is a pale pinkish brown 12 ",
