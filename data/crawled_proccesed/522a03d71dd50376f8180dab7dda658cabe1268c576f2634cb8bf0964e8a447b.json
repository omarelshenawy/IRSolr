			"previous": " With about 750 species Ficus Moraceae is one of the largest angiosperm genera David Frodin of Chelsea Physic Garden ranked it as the 31st largest genus 8 Ficus aurea is classified in the subgenus Urostigma the strangler figs and the section Americana 4 Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that subgenus Urostigma is polyphyletic but have strongly supported the validity of section Americana as a discrete group although its exact relationship to section Galoglychia is unclear 9 ",
			"after": " Thomas Nuttall described the species in the second volume of the his 1846 work The North American Sylva 10 with specific epithet aurea golden in Latin 11 In 1768 Scottish botanist Philip Miller described Ficus maxima citing Carl Linnaeus Hortus Cliffortianus 1738 and Hans Sloane s Catalogus plantarum qu in insula Jamaica 1696 Sloane s illustration of the species published in 1725 depicted it with figs borne singly a characteristic of the Ficus subgenus Pharmacosycea 12 As a member of the subgenus Urostigma F aurea has paired figs However a closer examination of Sloane s description led Cornelis Berg to conclude that the illustration depicted a member of the subgenus Urostigma since it had other diagnostic of that subgenus almost certainly F aurea and that the illustration of singly borne figs was probably artistic license Berg located the plant collection upon which Sloane s illustration was based and concluded that Miller s F maxima was in fact F aurea 10 In his description of F aurea which was based on plant material collected in Florida Thomas Nuttall considered the possibility that his plants belonged to the species that Sloane had described but came to the conclusion that it was a new species 10 Under the rules of botanical nomenclature the name F maxima has priority over F aurea since Miller s description was published in 1768 while Nuttall s description was published in 1846 ",
