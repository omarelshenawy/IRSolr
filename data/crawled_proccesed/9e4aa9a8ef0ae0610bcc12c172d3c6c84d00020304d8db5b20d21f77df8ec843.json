			"after": " The potential for ultrasonic imaging of objects with a 3 GHZ sound wave producing resolution comparable to an optical image was recognized by Sokolov in 1939 but techniques of the time produced relatively low contrast images with poor sensitivity 20 Ultrasonic imaging uses frequencies of 2 megahertz and higher the shorter wavelength allows resolution of small internal details in structures and tissues The power density is generally less than 1 watt per square centimetre to avoid heating and cavitation effects in the object under examination 21 High and ultra high ultrasound waves are used in acoustic microscopy with frequencies up to 4 gigahertz Ultrasonic imaging applications include industrial non destructive testing quality control and medical uses 20 ",
