			"previous": " The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by air conditioning units It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude and this causes sore eyes dry skin and mucosa on long flights Although humidification technology could raise its relative humidity to comfortable middle levels this is not done since humidity promotes corrosion to the inside of the hull and risks condensation which could short electrical systems so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value around 10 ",
