			"previous": " The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the 53 million U S gallons 204 000 m3 of high level radioactive waste stored in 177 underground tanks As of 1998 about a third of these tanks had leaked waste into the soil and groundwater 76 As of 2008 update most of the liquid waste has been transferred to more secure double shelled tanks however 2 8 million U S gallons 10 600 m3 of liquid waste together with 27 million U S gallons 100 000 m3 of salt cake and sludge remains in the single shelled tanks 4 DOE lacks information about the extent to which the 27 double shell tanks may be susceptible to corrosion Without determining the extent to which the factors that contributed to the leak in AY 102 were similar to the other 27 double shell tanks DOE cannot be sure how long its double shell tanks can safely store waste 6 That waste was originally scheduled to be removed by 2018 As of 2008 update the revised deadline was 2040 74 Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270 billion U S gallons 1 billion m3 of contaminated groundwater as a result of the leaks 77 As of 2008 update 1 million U S gallons 4 000 m3 of highly clarification needed radioactive waste is traveling through the groundwater toward the Columbia River This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule 4 The site includes 25 million cubic feet 710 000 m3 of solid radioactive waste 77 ",
