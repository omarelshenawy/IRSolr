			"previous": " The American white ibis is a tactile nonvisual forager which limits its ability to choose from a wide variety of prey 54 For the most part the American white ibis forages for food by tactile probing It wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long downcurved bill into the substrate of the water body with its bill held at around 1 to 2 cm 0 39 to 0 79 in agape at the tip and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items 2 Birds may also probe when standing still Groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone as is head swinging in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water Others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it On land the American white ibis locates prey by sight and pecks and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate 54 The American white ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around as it needs time to break up larger food items into smaller pieces to eat and other predators such as herons and egrets often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch 29 55 Along with the scarlet ibis the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the Llanos in Venezuela American white ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior 56 ",
			"after": " Juveniles have lower foraging efficiency compared to adults and in most feeding flocks the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults They usually tend to stay close to one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group 57 During the breeding season adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young and extract the ball of food 58 This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis which would reduce its own reproductive success Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males but instead try to avoid or move away from them 58 This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate 58 The explanation of the species sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and as males are larger they need more food than females 59 ",
