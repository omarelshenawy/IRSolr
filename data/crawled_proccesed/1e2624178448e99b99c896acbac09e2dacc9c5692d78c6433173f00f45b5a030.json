			"previous": " Western films often depict conflicts with Native Americans While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the Injuns as dishonorable villains the later and more culturally neutral Westerns notably those directed by John Ford gave native Americans a more sympathetic treatment Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks or perilous journeys e g Stagecoach or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in The Magnificent Seven ",
			"after": " Early Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio just like other early Hollywood films but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s producers of Westerns used desolate corners of Arizona California Colorado Kansas Montana Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Texas Utah or Wyoming Productions were also filmed on location at movie ranches ",
