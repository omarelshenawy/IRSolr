			"previous": " Carte finally assembled a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company to launch a series of original English comic operas beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan The Sorcerer in November 1877 This work was a modest success 26 and H M S Pinafore followed in May 1878 Despite a slow start mainly due to a scorching summer Pinafore became a red hot favourite by autumn After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes intending to mount a rival production The attempt was repelled by stagehands and others at the theatre loyal to Carte and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed D Oyly Carte Opera Company 55 Indeed Pinafore was so successful that over a hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone Gilbert Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas without success 56 ",
			"after": " For the next decade the Savoy Operas as the series came to be known after the theatre Carte later built to house them were Gilbert s principal activity The successful comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two several of them being among the longest running productions up to that point in the history of the musical stage 57 After Pinafore came The Pirates of Penzance 1879 Patience 1881 Iolanthe 1882 Princess Ida 1884 based on Gilbert s earlier farce The Princess The Mikado 1885 Ruddigore 1887 The Yeomen of the Guard 1888 and The Gondoliers 1889 Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works but he actually designed the costumes himself for Patience Iolanthe Princess Ida and Ruddigore 58 He insisted on precise and authentic sets and costumes which provided a foundation to ground and focus his absurd characters and situations 59 ",
