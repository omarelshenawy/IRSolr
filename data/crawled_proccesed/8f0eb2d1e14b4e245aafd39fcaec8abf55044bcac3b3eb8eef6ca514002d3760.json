			"previous": " Major air combat during the war in the Pacific began with the entry of the Western Allies following Japan s attack against Pearl Harbor The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service primarily operated the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service flew the Nakajima Ki 27 and the Nakajima Ki 43 initially enjoying great success as these fighters generally had better range maneuverability speed and climb rates than their Allied counterparts 10 11 Additionally Japanese pilots had received excellent training and many were combat veterans from Japan s campaigns in China They quickly gained air superiority over the Allies who at this stage of the war were often disorganized under trained and poorly equipped and Japanese air power contributed significantly to their successes in the Philippines Malaysia and Singapore the Dutch East Indies and Burma ",
			"after": " By mid 1942 the Allies began to regroup and while some Allied aircraft such as the Brewster Buffalo and the P 39 were hopelessly outclassed by fighters like Japan s Zero others such as the Army s P 40 and the Navy s Wildcat possessed attributes such as superior firepower ruggedness and dive speed and the Allies soon developed tactics such as the Thach weave to take advantage of these strengths These changes soon paid dividends as the Allied ability to deny Japan air superiority was critical to their victories at Coral Sea Midway Guadalcanal and New Guinea In China the Flying Tigers also used the same tactics with some success although they were unable to stem the tide of Japanese advances there ",
