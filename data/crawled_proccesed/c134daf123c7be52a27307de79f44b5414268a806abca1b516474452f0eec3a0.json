			"previous": " During the war in 1810 a revolutionary body the Cortes of C diz was assembled to co ordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution 45 It met as one body and its members represented the entire Spanish empire 46 In 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime Ferdinand VII dismissed the Cortes Generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries ",
			"after": " Spain s conquest by France benefited Latin American anti colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government s policies that favored Spanish born citizens Peninsulars over those born overseas Criollos and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people Starting in 1809 Spain s American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence leading to the Spanish American wars of independence that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas King Ferdinand VII s attempt to re assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and army revolts followed led by liberal officers By the end of 1826 the only American colonies Spain held were Cuba and Puerto Rico ",
