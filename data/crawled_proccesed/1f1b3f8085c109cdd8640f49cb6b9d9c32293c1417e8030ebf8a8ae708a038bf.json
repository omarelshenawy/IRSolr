			"previous": " During his re examination of Iguanodon David Norman was able to show that this posture was unlikely because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons 14 To get the tripodal pose the tail would literally have to be broken 5 Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable For example the hand is relatively immobile with the three central fingers grouped together bearing hoof like phalanges and able to hyperextend This would have allowed them to bear weight The wrist is also relatively immobile and the arms and shoulder bones robust These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours 14 ",
			"after": " Furthermore it appears that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier juvenile I bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults 60 of hindlimb length versus 70 for adults 2 When walking as a quadruped the animal s hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus s arms and hands 24 25 The three toed pes foot of Iguanodon was relatively long and when walking both the hand and the foot would have been used in a digitigrade fashion walking on the fingers and toes 2 The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at 24 km h 14 9 mph 26 which would have been as a biped it would not have been able to gallop as a quadruped 2 ",
