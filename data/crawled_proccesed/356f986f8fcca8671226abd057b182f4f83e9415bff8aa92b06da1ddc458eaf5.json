			"previous": " This expression is called a difference quotient A line through two points on a curve is called a secant line so m is the slope of the secant line between a f a and a h f a h The secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point a because it does not account for what happens between a and a h It is not possible to discover the behavior at a by setting h to zero because this would require dividing by zero which is undefined The derivative is defined by taking the limit as h tends to zero meaning that it considers the behavior of f for all small values of h and extracts a consistent value for the case when h equals zero ",
			"after": " Geometrically the derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at a The tangent line is a limit of secant lines just as the derivative is a limit of difference quotients For this reason the derivative is sometimes called the slope of the function f ",
