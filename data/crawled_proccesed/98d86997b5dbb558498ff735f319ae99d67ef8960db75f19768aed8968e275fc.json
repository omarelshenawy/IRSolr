			"previous": " Babbage s motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation has been a commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review under Babbage s guidance 31 32 The context of these developments is still debated Babbage s own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society s wish to improve The Nautical Almanac Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project to recalculate some part of those tables With the results to hand discrepancies were found This was in 1821 or 1822 and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation 33 The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks who had died in 1820 34 ",
