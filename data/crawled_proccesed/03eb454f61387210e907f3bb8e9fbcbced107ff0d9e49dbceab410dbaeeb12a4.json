			"after": " At the age of 18 Shakespeare married the 26 year old Anne Hathaway The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 The next day two of Hathaway s neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage 16 The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times 17 and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter Susanna baptised 26 May 1583 18 Twins son Hamnet and daughter Judith followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585 19 Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596 20 ",
