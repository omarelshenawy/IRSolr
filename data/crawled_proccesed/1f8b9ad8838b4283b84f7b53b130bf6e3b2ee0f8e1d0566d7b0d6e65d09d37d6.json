			"previous": " In 2005 researchers assembled a complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth which allowed them to trace the close evolutionary relationship between mammoths and Asian elephants Elephas maximus 18 African elephants Loxodonta africana branched away from this clade around 6 million years ago close to the time of the similar split between chimpanzees and humans Before the publication of the Neanderthal genome many researchers expected the first fully sequenced nuclear genome of an extinct species would be that of the mammoth 19 A 2010 study confirmed these relationships and suggested the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages diverged 5 8 7 8 million years ago while African elephants diverged from an earlier common ancestor 6 6 8 8 million years ago 20 In 2008 much of the woolly mammoth s chromosomal DNA was mapped The analysis showed that the woolly mammoth and the African elephant are 98 55 to 99 40 identical 21 The team mapped the woolly mammoth s nuclear genome sequence by extracting DNA from the hair follicles of both a 20 000 year old mammoth retrieved from permafrost and another that died 60 000 years ago 22 In 2012 proteins were confidently identified for the first time collected from a 43 000 year old woolly mammoth 23 ",
			"after": " Since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities it is possible to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges or lamellar plates on their molars primitive species had few ridges and the number increased gradually as new species evolved and replaced the preceding ones The crowns of the teeth lengthened and the skulls became taller to accommodate this At the same time the skulls became shorter from front to back to minimise the weight 24 The short and tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths Mammuthus columbi are the culmination of this process 25 These adaptations were acquired gradually as mammoths turned to more abrasive food items 26 ",
