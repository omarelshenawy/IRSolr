			"previous": " Prior to the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682 up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods more than 31 000 square miles 80 000 km2 of eastern white pine eastern hemlock and a mix of hardwoods 13 The forests near the three original counties Philadelphia Bucks and Chester were the first to be harvested as the early settlers used the readily available timber to build homes barns and ships and cleared the land for agriculture The demand for wood products slowly increased and by the time of the American Revolution the lumber industry had reached the interior and mountainous regions of Pennsylvania 13 14 Lumber thus became one of the leading industries in Pennsylvania 13 Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state and wood for construction furniture and barrel making Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber as were a wide variety of household utensils and the first Conestoga wagons 13 ",
			"after": " By the early 19th century the demand for lumber reached the Pine Creek Gorge where the surrounding mountainsides were covered with eastern white pine 3 to 6 feet 0 9 to 1 8 m in diameter and 150 feet 46 m or more tall eastern hemlock 9 feet 2 7 m in circumference and huge hardwoods 7 Each acre 0 4 ha of these virgin forests produced 100 000 board feet 236 m3 of white pine and 200 000 board feet 472 m3 of hemlock and hardwoods For comparison the same area of forest today produces a total of only 5 000 board feet 11 8 m3 on average According to Steven E Owlett environmental lawyer and author shipbuilders considered pine from Pine Creek the best timber in the world for making fine ship masts 15 so it was the first lumber to be harvested on a large scale Pine Creek was declared a public highway by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 16 1798 7 and rafts of spars were floated down the creek to the Susquehanna River then to the Chesapeake Bay and the shipbuilders at Baltimore 15 The lumbermen would then walk home following the old Pine Creek Path at the end of their journey 11 A spar sold for one dollar and three spars up to 90 feet 27 m long were lashed together to make a ship s mast The largest spar produced on Pine Creek was 43 inches 110 cm in diameter 12 feet 3 7 m above the base 93 feet 28 m long and 33 inches 84 cm in diameter at the top By 1840 Tioga County alone produced over 452 such spar rafts with more than 22 000 000 board feet 52 000 m3 of lumber 15 ",
