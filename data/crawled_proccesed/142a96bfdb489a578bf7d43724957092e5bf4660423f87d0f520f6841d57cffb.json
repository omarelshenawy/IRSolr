			"previous": " The DAP was a comparatively small group with fewer than 60 members 35 Nevertheless it attracted the attention of the German authorities who were suspicious of any organisation that appeared to have subversive tendencies In July 1919 while stationed in Munich army Gefreiter Adolf Hitler was appointed a Verbindungsmann intelligence agent of the Reichswehr army by the head of press and propaganda in the Bavarian section Captain Mayr 37 Hitler s assignment was to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the DAP 27 While attending a party meeting on 12 September 1919 Hitler became involved in a heated argument with a visitor Professor Baumann who questioned the soundness of Gottfried Feder s arguments against capitalism and proposed that Bavaria should break away from Prussia and found a new South German nation with Austria In vehemently attacking the man s arguments he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills and according to Hitler the professor left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat 38 According to August Kubizek Drexler was so impressed that he whispered to a neighbour My he s got a gift of the gab We could use him 35 Drexler invited him to join and Hitler accepted 39 In less than a week Hitler received a postcard from Drexler stating he had officially been accepted as a DAP member 40 Among the party s earlier members were Ernst R hm of the Army s District Command VII well to do journalist Dietrich Eckart then University of Munich student Rudolf Hess 41 Freikorps soldier Hans Frank and Alfred Rosenberg often credited as the philosopher of the movement All were later prominent in the Nazi regime 37 ",
			"after": " Hitler became the DAP s 55th member and received the number 555 as the DAP added 500 to every member s number to exaggerate the party s strength 42 He later claimed to be the seventh party member he was in fact the seventh executive member of the party s central committee 43 he would later wear the Golden Party Badge number one Hitler s first speech was held in the Hofbr ukeller where he spoke in front of 111 people as the second speaker of the evening Hitler later declared that this was when he realised he could really make a good speech 35 At first Hitler only spoke to relatively small groups but his considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership With the support of Anton Drexler Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920 44 Hitler began to make the party more public and he organised their biggest meeting yet of 2 000 people on 24 February 1920 in the Staatliches Hofbr uhaus in M nchen Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement 45 It was in this speech that Hitler for the first time enunciated the twenty five points of the German Worker s Party s manifesto that had been drawn up by Drexler Feder and Hitler 46 Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem 44 with a clear foreign policy abrogation of The Treaty of Versailles a Greater Germany Eastern expansion exclusion of Jews from citizenship and among his specific points were confiscation of war profits abolition of unearned incomes the State to share profits of land and land for national needs to be taken away without compensation 47 In general the manifesto was antisemitic anti capitalist anti democratic anti Marxist and anti liberal 48 To increase its appeal to larger segments of the population on 24 February 1920 the same day as Hitler s Hofbr uhaus speech the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei National Socialist German Workers Party 49 That year the Nazi Party officially announced that only persons of pure Aryan descent rein arischer abkunft could become party members if the person had a spouse they also had to be a racially pure Aryan Party members could not be related either directly or indirectly to a so called non Aryan 50 Even before it became legally forbidden at the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 the Nazis banned sexual relations and marriages between party members and Jews 51 Party members found guilty of Rassenschande racial defilement were persecuted heavily some members were even sentenced to death 52 ",
