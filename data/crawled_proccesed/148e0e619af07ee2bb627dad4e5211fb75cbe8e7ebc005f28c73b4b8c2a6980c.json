			"previous": " Epitome of Copernican Astronomy was read by astronomers throughout Europe and following Kepler s death it was the main vehicle for spreading Kepler s ideas Between 1630 and 1650 it was the most widely used astronomy textbook winning many converts to ellipse based astronomy 58 However few adopted his ideas on the physical basis for celestial motions In the late 17th century a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler s work notably those of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Robert Hooke began to incorporate attractive forces though not the quasi spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler and the Cartesian concept of inertia This culminated in Isaac Newton s Principia Mathematica 1687 in which Newton derived Kepler s laws of planetary motion from a force based theory of universal gravitation 81 ",
			"after": " Beyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy Kepler has loomed large in the philosophy and historiography of science Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as Jean Etienne Montucla s 1758 Histoire des math matiques and Jean Baptiste Delambre s 1821 Histoire de l astronomie moderne These and other histories written from an Enlightenment perspective treated Kepler s metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval but later Romantic era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success William Whewell in his influential History of the Inductive Sciences of 1837 found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences of 1840 Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of scientific method Similarly Ernst Friedrich Apelt the first to extensively study Kepler s manuscripts after their purchase by Catherine the Great identified Kepler as a key to the Revolution of the sciences Apelt who saw Kepler s mathematics aesthetic sensibility physical ideas and theology as part of a unified system of thought produced the first extended analysis of Kepler s life and work 82 ",
