			"previous": " In Munich Germany in 1957 Rudolf M ssbauer in what has been called one of the landmark experiments in twentieth century physics 36 discovered the resonant and recoil free emission and absorption of gamma rays by atoms in a solid metal sample containing only 191Ir 37 This phenomenon known as the M ssbauer effect which has since been observed for other nuclei such as 57Fe and developed as M ssbauer spectroscopy has made important contributions to research in physics chemistry biochemistry metallurgy and mineralogy 27 M ssbauer received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961 at the age 32 just three years after he published his discovery 38 In 1986 Rudolf M ssbauer was honored for his achievements with the Albert Einstein Medal and the Elliot Cresson Medal ",
			"after": " Iridium is one of the nine least abundant stable elements in Earth s crust having an average mass fraction of 0 001 ppm in crustal rock gold is 40 times more abundant platinum is 10 times more abundant and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant 4 Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium 4 In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock iridium is relatively common in meteorites with concentrations of 0 5 ppm or more 40 The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks but because of the density and siderophilic iron loving character of iridium it descended below the crust and into Earth s core when the planet was still molten 19 ",
