			"after": " The DC 8 71 to DC 8 73 were straightforward conversions of the 61 to 63 replacing the JT3D engines with more fuel efficient 22 000 lb 98 5 kN CFM56 2 high bypass turbofans in new housings built by Grumman along with new engine pylons and fairing of the air intakes below the nose The DC 8 71 achieved the same end but required more modification because the 61 did not have the improved wings and relocated engines of the 62 and 63 Maximum takeoff weights remained the same but there was a slight reduction in payload because of the heavier engines All three models were certified in 1982 and a total of 110 60 Series DC 8s were converted by the time the program ended in 1988 citation needed ",
