			"previous": " Modern aircraft generate power in the main engines or an additional fuel burning turbine engine called an auxiliary power unit which is often mounted in the rear of the fuselage or in the main wheel well The RAT generates power from the airstream due to the speed of the aircraft If aircraft speeds are low the RAT will produce less power In normal conditions the RAT is retracted into the fuselage or wing and is deployed manually or automatically following complete loss of power In the time between power loss and RAT deployment batteries are used ",
			"after": " RATs are common in military aircraft which must be capable of surviving sudden and complete loss of power Many modern types of commercial airliners are equipped with RATs In the 1960s the Vickers VC10 was one of the first types of airliner equipped with a RAT The Airbus A380 has the largest RAT propeller in the world at 1 63 metres 5 3 ft in diameter but around 80 centimetres 2 6 ft is more common A typical large RAT on a commercial aircraft can be capable of producing depending on the generator from 5 to 70 kW Smaller low airspeed models may generate as little as 400 watts ",
