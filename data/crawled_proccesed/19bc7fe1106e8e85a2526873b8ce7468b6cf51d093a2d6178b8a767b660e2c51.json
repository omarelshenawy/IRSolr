			"previous": " Many structural alloys corrode merely from exposure to moisture in air but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances Corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack or it can extend across a wide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface Because corrosion is a diffusion controlled process it occurs on exposed surfaces As a result methods to reduce the activity of the exposed surface such as passivation and chromate conversion can increase a material s corrosion resistance However some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable ",
