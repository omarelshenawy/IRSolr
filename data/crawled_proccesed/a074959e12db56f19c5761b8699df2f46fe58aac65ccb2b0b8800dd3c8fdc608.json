			"previous": " Paleontology also has some overlap with archaeology which primarily works with objects made by humans and with human remains while paleontologists are interested in the characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms When dealing with evidence about humans archaeologists and paleontologists may work together for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site to discover what the people who lived there ate or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans 8 ",
			"after": " In addition paleontology often uses techniques derived from other sciences including biology osteology ecology chemistry physics and mathematics 2 For example geochemical signatures from rocks may help to discover when life first arose on Earth 9 and analyses of carbon isotope ratios may help to identify climate changes and even to explain major transitions such as the Permian Triassic extinction event 10 A relatively recent discipline molecular phylogenetics often helps by using comparisons of different modern organisms DNA and RNA to re construct evolutionary family trees it has also been used to estimate the dates of important evolutionary developments although this approach is controversial because of doubts about the reliability of the molecular clock 11 Techniques developed in engineering have been used to analyse how ancient organisms might have worked for example how fast Tyrannosaurus could move and how powerful its bite was 12 13 ",
