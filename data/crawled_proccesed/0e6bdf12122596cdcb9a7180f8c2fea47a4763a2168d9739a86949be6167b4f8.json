			"after": " As a direct result of watching his fellow martial artists train with a fixed blade fighting knife in class yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat 19 Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost 17 in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials 20 He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously 14 He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives 14 The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance 21 ",
