			"previous": " In his Futures Past On the Semantics of Historical Time historian Reinhart Koselleck discusses Altdorfer s representation of time in a more philosophical light After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting s contemporary context he posits that the latter type is less a superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history With reference to Koselleck Kathleen Davis argues for Altdorfer 4th century Persians look like 16th century Turks not because he does not know the difference but because the difference does not matter The Alexanderschlacht in other words exemplifies a premodern untemporalized sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness Altdorfer s historical overlays evince an eschatological vision of history evidence that the 16th century and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries remained locked in a static constant temporality that proleptically saturates the future as always a repetition of the same In such a system there can be no event as such anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history which is not temporalized because its time is essentially undifferentiated 65 ",
