			"previous": " In 1948 the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies rail and road access to the sectors of West Berlin under Allied control Their aim was to force the western powers to allow the Soviet zone to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city In response the Western Allies organized the Berlin Airlift to carry supplies via air to the people in West Berlin The airports in Frankfurt Hamburg and Hannover were the primary bases for the allied airplanes The heavy use of these so called Raisin Bombers caused damage to the runway in Frankfurt and forced the US Army to build a second parallel runway The airlift ended in September 1949 after the Soviet Union ended their blockade ",
			"after": " In 1951 restrictions for German air travellers were lifted and civil air traffic started to grow again In 1952 Frankfurt Airport handled more than 400 000 passengers a year later it was more than half a million About 100 to 120 planes took off from and landed in Frankfurt daily In 1955 Lufthansa finally recommenced their flights to and from Frankfurt and in the same year the Federal Republic of Germany gained its air sovereignty back from the Allies In 1957 the northern runway was extended first to 3 000 m 9 843 ft and then to 3 900 m 12 795 ft to make it compatible with jet aircraft ",
