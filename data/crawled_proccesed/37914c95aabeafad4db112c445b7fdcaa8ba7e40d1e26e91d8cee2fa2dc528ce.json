			"previous": " Each carbon filament is produced from a polymer such as polyacrylonitrile PAN rayon or petroleum pitch known as a precursor For synthetic polymers such as PAN or rayon the precursor is first spun into filament yarns using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer atoms in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber Precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers After drawing or spinning the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non carbon atoms carbonization producing the final carbon fiber The carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities then wound on to bobbins 14 ",
			"after": " A common method of manufacture involves heating the spun PAN filaments to approximately 300 C in air which breaks many of the hydrogen bonds and oxidizes the material The oxidized PAN is then placed into a furnace having an inert atmosphere of a gas such as argon and heated to approximately 2000 C which induces graphitization of the material changing the molecular bond structure When heated in the correct conditions these chains bond side to side ladder polymers forming narrow graphene sheets which eventually merge to form a single columnar filament The result is usually 93 95 carbon Lower quality fiber can be manufactured using pitch or rayon as the precursor instead of PAN The carbon can become further enhanced as high modulus or high strength carbon by heat treatment processes Carbon heated in the range of 1500 2000 C carbonization exhibits the highest tensile strength 820 000 psi 5 650 MPa or N mm while carbon fiber heated from 2500 to 3000 C graphitizing exhibits a higher modulus of elasticity 77 000 000 psi or 531 GPa or 531 kN mm ",
