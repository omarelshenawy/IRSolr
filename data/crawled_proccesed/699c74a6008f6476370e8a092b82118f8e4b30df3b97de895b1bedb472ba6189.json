			"after": " The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission scheduled for 1993 While Kodak had ground a back up mirror for Hubble it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit and too expensive and time consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit Instead the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission effectively acting as spectacles to correct the spherical aberration 62 63 ",
