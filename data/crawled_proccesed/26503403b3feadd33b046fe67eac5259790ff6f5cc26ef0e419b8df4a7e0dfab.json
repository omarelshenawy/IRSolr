			"previous": " For a given strength of circulation The effect of the flow over and the circulation around the aerofoil is to reduce the velocity over the face and increase it over the back of the blade If the reduction in pressure is too much in relation to the ambient pressure of the fluid cavitation occurs bubbles form in the low pressure area and are moved towards the blade s trailing edge where they collapse as the pressure increases this reduces propeller efficiency and increases noise The forces generated by the bubble collapse can cause permanent damage to the surfaces of the blade ",
