			"previous": " From August 1968 BEA supplemented its Tempelhof based Viscount fleet with de Havilland Comet 4B series jetliners 136 143 Although these aircraft could operate from Tempelhof s short runways without payload restrictions they were not suited to the airline s ultra short haul operation from Berlin average stage length 230 mi 370 km given the high fuel consumption of the Comet especially when operating at the mandatory 10 000 ft 3 000 m altitude inside the Allied air corridors 132 133 153 156 This measure was therefore only a stopgap until most of BEA s Berlin fleet was equipped with 97 seat single class BAC One Eleven 500s nb 23 136 BEA s re equipment of its Berlin fleet with brand new One Eleven 500 jets was central to the airline s competitive strategy to regain ground lost to Pan Am s 727s The new One Eleven 500 which BEA called the Super One Eleven operated its first scheduled service from Berlin on 1 September 1968 11 136 143 156 157 It began replacing the airline s Berlin based Viscounts from 17 November 1968 91 ",
