			"previous": " It was in Bentley s time in 1698 that a body of senior scholars the Curators known from 1733 as the Syndics was appointed to be responsible to the University for the Press s affairs The Press Syndicate s publishing committee still meets regularly eighteen times a year and its role still includes the review and approval of the Press s planned output John Baskerville became University Printer in the mid eighteenth century Baskerville s concern was the production of the finest possible books using his own type design and printing techniques ",
			"after": " Baskerville wrote The importance of the work demands all my attention not only for my own eternal reputation but I hope also to convince the world that the University in the honour done me has not entirely misplaced their favours Caxton would have found nothing to surprise him if he had walked into the Press s printing house in the eighteenth century all the type was still being set by hand wooden presses capable of producing only 1 000 sheets a day at best were still in use and books were still being individually bound by hand A technological breakthrough was badly needed and it came when Lord Stanhope perfected the making of stereotype plates This involved making a mould of the whole surface of a page of type and then casting plates from that mould The Press was the first to use this technique and in 1805 produced the technically successful and much reprinted Cambridge Stereotype Bible ",
