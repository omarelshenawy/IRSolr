			"previous": " In 1818 the Black Ball Line with a fleet of sailing ships offered the first regular passenger service with emphasis on passenger comfort from England to the United States From the early 19th century steam engines began to appear in ships but initially they were inefficient and offered little advantage over sailing ships ",
			"after": " The clipper domination was challenged when SS Great Western designed by railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel 5 began its first Atlantic service in 1837 It took 15 days to cross the Atlantic 6 as compared with two months by sail powered ships Unlike the clippers steamers offered a consistent speed and the ability to keep to a schedule The early steamships still had sails as well though as engines at this time had very inefficient consumption of fuel Having sails enabled vessels like the Great Western to take advantage of favourable weather conditions and minimise fuel consumption ",
