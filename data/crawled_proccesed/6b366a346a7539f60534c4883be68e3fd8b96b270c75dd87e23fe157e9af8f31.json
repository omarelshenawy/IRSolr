			"previous": " Banksia menziesii grows either as a gnarled tree to 10 m 35 ft or a lower spreading 1 3 metre 4 10 ft shrub generally encountered at its northern limits in the vicinity of Eneabba Mount Adams thus it declines steadily in size as the climate becomes warmer and dryer further north 2 In the shrub form several stems arise from the woody base known as the lignotuber The trunk is greyish sometimes with shades of brown or pink and the 2 3 cm 1 in thick rough bark breaks away easily The new growth is covered in fine brownish hair which wears away after two or three years leaving smooth stems and leaves 3 Stems which will bear flower spikes the following year are generally thicker and longer 4 Oblong in shape and somewhat truncate at the tips the leaves are grey green in colour 8 25 cm 3 10 in long and up to 4 cm 1 6 in wide The new leaves are paler and finely downy The leaf margins are serrated with many small 1 2 mm long triangular teeth The lower surface of the leaf has a midrib covered in fine pale brown hair 3 ",
			"after": " Flowering occurs in autumn and winter peaking from May to July Overall the inflorescences or flower spikes take around eight months to development from the first microscopic changes in late spring 5 Ovoid to cylindrical in shape the flower spikes can be up to 7 8 cm 2 6 3 4 in wide and 4 12 cm 1 6 4 8 in high 3 They are composed of numerous individual flowers one field study south of Perth recorded an average of 1043 per flower spike 6 while another on plants in cultivation in South Australia recorded an average of 720 7 B menziesii has more flower colour variants than any other Banksia species with flower spikes occurring in a wide range of pinks as well as chocolate bronze yellow and white and greenish variants They are particularly striking closeup but can look indistinct from a distance They are most attractive in late bud the styles contrasting well to the body of the inflorescence the whole looking like a red or pink and white vertical candy striped bloom The inflorescences are generally a deeper red after colder weather and further into the winter 8 Anthocyanin pigments are responsible for the red and pink shades in the flowers 9 ",
