			"after": " Armillaria gallica is a weaker pathogen than the related A Mellea or A Solidipes and is considered a secondary parasite typically initiating infection only after the host s defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation drought or infection by another fungus 67 Fungal infection can lead to root rot or butt rot 68 As the diseased trees die the wood dries increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning The resulting forest fire may in turn kill the species that killed the trees 69 Plants that are under water stress caused by dry soils or waterlogging are more susceptible to infection by A gallica 70 It has been shown to be one of several Armillaria species responsible for widespread mortality of oak trees in the Arkansas Ozarks 71 The fungus has also been shown to infect Daylily in South Carolina 72 Northern highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum in Italy 73 74 and vineyards Vitis species of R as Baixas in northwestern Spain The latter infestation may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites 75 When A solidipes and A gallica co occur in the same forest infection of root systems by A gallica may reduce damage or prevent infection from A solidipes 76 ",
