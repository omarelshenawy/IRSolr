			"previous": " During its service with the USMC the Harrier has had an accident rate three times that of the Corps F A 18s The AV 8 was dubbed a widow maker by some in the military 99 113 The Los Angeles Times reported in 2003 that the Harrier family had the highest rate of major accidents among military aircraft in service then with 148 accidents and 45 people killed 114 Lon Nordeen notes that several other USMC single engine strike aircraft like the A 4 Skyhawk and A 7 Corsair II had worse accident rates 115 The Harrier s high accident rate is largely due to the higher percentage of time it spends taking off and landing which are the most critical times in flight 116 ",
			"after": " The AV 8B is to be replaced by the F 35B version of the Lockheed Martin F 35 Lightning II which had been slated to enter service in 2012 117 The USMC had sought a replacement since the 1980s 118 119 and has argued strongly in favor of the development of the F 35B The Harrier s performance in Iraq including its ability to use forward operating bases reinforced the need for a V STOL aircraft in the USMC arsenal 105 In November 2011 the USN purchased the UK s fleet of 72 retired BAe Harrier IIs 63 single seat GR 7 9 9As plus 9 twin seat T 12 12As 120 and replacement engines to provide spares for the existing USMC Harrier II fleet 121 122 Although the March 2012 issue of the magazine AirForces Monthly stated that the USMC intended to fly some of the ex British Harrier IIs instead of using them just for spare parts 120 the Naval Air Systems Command NAVAIR has since stated that the USMC has never had any plans to operate those Harriers 123 ",
