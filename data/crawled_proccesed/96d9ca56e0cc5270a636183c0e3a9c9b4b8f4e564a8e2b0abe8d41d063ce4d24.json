			"previous": " In 2008 the International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the koala under Least Concern for the following reasons Its wide distribution presumed large population and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category 1 Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal to include the koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 19 In 2012 the Australian Government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable because of a 40 population decline in the former and a 33 decline in the latter Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant however the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures is based on a misconception that the total koala population is 200 000 whereas they believe it is probably less than 100 000 143 ",
			"after": " Koalas were hunted for food by Aboriginals A common technique used to capture the animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark to the end of a long thin pole so as to form a noose This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree beyond the reach of a climbing hunter an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick waddy 144 According to the customs of some tribes it was considered taboo to skin the animal while other tribes thought the animal s head had a special status and saved them for burial 145 ",
