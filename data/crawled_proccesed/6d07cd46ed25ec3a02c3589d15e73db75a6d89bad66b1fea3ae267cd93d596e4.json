			"previous": " The Poitevin breed was created in the marshes of the Poitou region 13 especially around Lu on La Rochelle Melle and Niort 14 It was developed through a mixture of human and natural selection to the marshy area that it inhabited Although described as a draft horse it was not selected for draft purposes and was never popular for that use 6 ",
			"after": " Remains of prehistoric horses have been found in the Poitou region with Mesolithic remains 20 000 to 5 000 BC located near Surgeres and Echire Some enthusiasts claim that the Poitevin horse is descended directly from these horses based on physical similarities and claim a common origin with the Tarpan horse painted on the Lascaux cave walls However this has not been confirmed by scientific studies and numerous claims by other horse breeds of this same relationship have been invalidated by further research 4 Other horses were probably brought to the area by migrating Celts and there is a record from the 10th century of a bishop from Rome asking the Count of Poitou for a mare from the region These horses like mules were a favorite among the magistrates and ecclesiastical personnel in the medieval era and were sold around Niort Saint Maixent Auvergne Dauphine Languedoc and in Spain 15 The number of horses in the area however was not well known before the 17th century 16 ",
