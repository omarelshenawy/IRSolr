			"previous": " Discrete probability theory deals with events that occur in countable sample spaces For example count observations such as the numbers of birds in flocks comprise only natural number values 0 1 2 On the other hand continuous observations such as the weights of birds comprise real number values and would typically be modeled by a continuous probability distribution such as the normal Discrete probability distributions can be used to approximate continuous ones and vice versa For highly constrained situations such as throwing dice or experiments with decks of cards calculating the probability of events is basically enumerative combinatorics ",
			"after": " Number theory is concerned with the properties of numbers in general particularly integers It has applications to cryptography cryptanalysis and cryptology particularly with regard to modular arithmetic diophantine equations linear and quadratic congruences prime numbers and primality testing Other discrete aspects of number theory include geometry of numbers In analytic number theory techniques from continuous mathematics are also used Topics that go beyond discrete objects include transcendental numbers diophantine approximation p adic analysis and function fields ",
