			"previous": " Mercury Atlas 6 the flight of John Glenn proved to be a testing experience both for Mission Control and for Kraft One book on the history of the Apollo program calls it the single event that decisively shaped Flight Operations 18 The mission the first orbital flight by an American unfolded normally until Glenn began his second orbit At that point Kraft s systems controller Don Arabian reported that telemetry was showing a Segment 51 indicator This suggested that the capsule s landing bag which was meant to deploy upon splashdown in order to provide a cushion might have deployed early Kraft believed that the Segment 51 indicator was due to faulty instrumentation rather than to an actual early deployment However if he was wrong it would mean that the capsule s heat shield which fitted on top of the landing bag was now loose A loose heat shield could cause the capsule to burn up during re entry 19 ",
			"after": " On consulting with his flight controllers Kraft became convinced that the indication was false and that no action was needed However his superiors including Mercury capsule designer Max Faget felt differently They overruled Kraft telling him to instruct Glenn to leave the capsule s retrorocket package on during re entry The reasoning was that the package which was strapped over the heatshield would hold the heatshield in place if it was loose Kraft however felt that this was an unacceptable risk I was aghast he remembered If any of three retrorockets had solid fuel remaining an explosion could rip everything apart 20 Yet he agreed to follow the plan advocated by Faget and by Walt Williams his superior in the flight operations division The retrorockets would be kept on ",
