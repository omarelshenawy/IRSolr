			"previous": " Lemurs have been the focus of monographic series action plans field guides and classic works in ethology 62 However few species have been thoroughly studied to date and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality 2 Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species 62 Long term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations However learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island 2 ",
			"after": " Lemurs are mentioned in sailors voyage logs as far back as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven lemur species were described in detail by the French merchant tienne de Flacourt who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant now extinct lemur which he called the tretretretre Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe at which time James Petiver an apothecary in London described and illustrated the mongoose lemur Starting in 1751 the London illustrator George Edwards began describing and illustrating some lemur species of which a few were included in various editions of Systema Naturae by Carl Linnaeus In the 1760s and 1770s French naturalists Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon and Louis Jean Marie Daubenton began describing the anatomy of several lemur species The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was Philibert Commer on in 1771 although it was Pierre Sonnerat who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels 133 135 ",
