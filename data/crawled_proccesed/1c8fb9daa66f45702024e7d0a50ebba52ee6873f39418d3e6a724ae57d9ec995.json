			"previous": " Inside Cloud Gate s polished exterior shell are several steel structures that keep the sculpture standing The first structural pieces two type 304 stainless steel rings were put into place in February 2004 As construction continued crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings 27 The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases The finished sculpture has no inner bracing 28 The supporting structural components were designed and constructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate As a result the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other allowing the shell to move independently of the rings 23 ",
			"after": " When Cloud Gate s interior components were completed construction crews prepared to work on the outer shell this comprises 168 stainless steel panels each 3 8 inch 10 mm thick and weighing 1 000 to 2 000 pounds 450 to 910 kg 29 They were fabricated using three dimensional modeling software 23 Computers and robots were essential in the bending and shaping of the plates 24 which was performed by English wheel and a robotic scanning device 30 Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel s interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity About a third of the plates along with the entire interior structure were fabricated in Oakland 23 The plates were polished to 98 percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks 31 Once in Chicago the plates were welded together on site creating 2 442 linear feet 744 m of welded seams 29 Welders used keyhole welding machines rather than traditional welding guns 6 The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position 29 ",
