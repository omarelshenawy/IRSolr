			"previous": " Beginning in 1859 large quantities of silver were found in Nevada Territory and elsewhere in the American West 44 In 1869 Director of the Mint Henry Linderman began advocating the end of the acceptance of silver bullion deposits to be struck into dollars Although silver dollars were not coined in large numbers Linderman saw that mining in the West would increase after the completion of the transcontinental railroad c which it did as US silver production increased from 10 million troy ounces in 1867 to more than 22 million five years later Linderman foresaw that these activities would increase the supply of silver causing its price to drop below the 1 2929 per ounce at which the precious metal in the standard silver dollar is worth 1 00 He anticipated that silver suppliers would turn to the Mint to dispose of their product by striking it into dollars The monetization of that cheap silver Linderman feared would inflate the currency and drive gold from commerce because of Gresham s law Although silver advocates later called the resulting law the Crime of 73 and claimed that it had been passed in a deceitful manner the bill was discussed during five different sessions of Congress read in full by both the House of Representatives and the Senate and printed in full on multiple occasions Once it passed both houses of Congress it was signed into law by President Ulysses S Grant on February 12 1873 45 46 ",
			"after": " The Coinage Act of 1873 ended production of the standard silver dollar and authorized creation of the Trade dollar thus concluding the Seated Liberty dollar series 47 The Trade dollar was slightly heavier than the standard dollar and was intended for use in payments in silver to merchants in China Although not meant for use in the United States a last minute rider gave it legal tender status there up to 5 When silver prices plummeted in the mid 1870s millions appeared in circulation at first in the West and then throughout the United States causing problems in commerce when banks insisted on the 5 legal tender limit Other abuses followed such as purchase by companies for bullion value by then about 0 80 for use in pay packets Workers had little option but to accept them as dollars In response to complaints Congress ended any status as legal tender in 1876 halted production of the Trade dollar except for collectors in 1878 and agreed to redeem any which had not been chopmarked in 1887 48 ",
