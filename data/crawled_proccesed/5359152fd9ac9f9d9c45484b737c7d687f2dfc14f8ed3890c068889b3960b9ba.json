			"previous": " The first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321 also known as the Stretched A320 A320 500 and A325 40 49 Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured 40 50 The aircraft would be a minimum changed derivative apart from a number of minor modifications to the wing and the fuselage stretch itself The wing would incorporate double slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications 51 increasing the wing area from 124 m2 1 330 sq ft to 128 m2 1 380 sq ft 52 The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs two ahead and two behind the wings giving the A321 an overall length of 6 94 metres 22 ft 9 in longer than the A320 51 53 54 The length increase required the overwing exits of the A320 to be enlarged and repositioned in front of and behind the wings 55 The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate the increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9 600 kg 21 200 lb taking it to 83 000 kg 183 000 lb 51 ",
			"after": " Final assembly for the A321 would be as a first for any Airbus carried out in Germany then West Germany 56 This came after a dispute between the French who claimed the move would incur 150 million 135 million in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant 57 and the Germans arguing it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run The second production line was located at Hamburg which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318 For the first time Airbus entered the bond market through which it raised 480 million 475 million to finance development costs 43 An additional 180 million 175 million was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors 58 ",
