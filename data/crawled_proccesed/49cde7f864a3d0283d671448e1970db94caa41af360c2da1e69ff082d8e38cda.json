			"previous": " A lifeboat is a small rigid or inflatable boat carried for emergency evacuation in the event of a disaster aboard a ship Lifeboat drills are required by law on larger commercial ships Rafts liferafts are also used In the military a lifeboat may double as a whaleboat dinghy or gig The ship s tenders of cruise ships often double as lifeboats Recreational sailors usually carry inflatable life rafts though a few prefer small proactive lifeboats that are harder to sink and can be sailed to safety ",
			"after": " Inflatable lifeboats may be equipped with auto inflation carbon dioxide or nitrogen canisters or mechanical pumps A quick release and pressure release mechanism is fitted on ships so that the canister or pump automatically inflates the lifeboat and the lifeboat breaks free of the sinking vessel Commercial aircraft are also required to carry auto inflating life rafts in case of an emergency water landing offshore oil platforms also have liferafts ",
