			"previous": " The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society 147 The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus and centralized the right to declare war ratify treaties and negotiate with foreign leaders 148 While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate the emperor s powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical culminating in the Dominate 149 ",
			"after": " The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy and decision making but in the early Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life and to deal personally with official business and petitions A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually 150 The Julio Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians but trusted slaves and freedmen 151 After Nero the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion and the emperor s council consilium became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency 152 Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the Antonine dynasty equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium 153 The women of the emperor s family often intervened directly in his decisions Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people 154 ",
