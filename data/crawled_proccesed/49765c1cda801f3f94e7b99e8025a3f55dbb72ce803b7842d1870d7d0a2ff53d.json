			"previous": " During the Permian all the Earth s major land masses except portions of East Asia were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean Panthalassa the universal sea and the Paleo Tethys Ocean a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia causing the Paleo Tethys to shrink A new ocean was growing on its southern end the Tethys Ocean an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold continental climate and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea ",
			"after": " The Mesozoic extended roughly from 252 to 66 million years ago 2  After the vigorous convergent plate mountain building of the late Paleozoic Mesozoic tectonic deformation was comparatively mild Nevertheless the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent Laurasia and a southern continent Gondwana This created the passive continental margin that characterizes most of the Atlantic coastline such as along the U S East Coast today ",
