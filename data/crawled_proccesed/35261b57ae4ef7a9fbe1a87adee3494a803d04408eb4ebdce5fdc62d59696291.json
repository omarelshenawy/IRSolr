			"previous": " Because speed and range were severely limited underwater while running on battery power U boats were required to spend most of their time surfaced running on Diesel engines diving only when attacked or for rare daytime torpedo strikes The more ship like hull design reflects the fact that these were primarily surface vessels which had the ability to submerge when necessary This contrasts with the cylindrical profile of modern nuclear submarines which are more hydrodynamic underwater where they spend the majority of their time but less stable on the surface Indeed while U boats were faster on the surface than submerged the opposite is generally true of modern subs The most common U boat attack during the early years of the war was conducted on the surface and at night see submarine warfare This period before the Allied forces developed truly effective antisubmarine warfare ASW tactics which included convoys was referred to by German submariners as die gl ckliche Zeit or the happy time 12 ",
