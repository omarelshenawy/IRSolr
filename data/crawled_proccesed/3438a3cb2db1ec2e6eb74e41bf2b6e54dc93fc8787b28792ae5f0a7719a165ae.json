			"previous": " The ceremony is often held weeks months or years after the death so that the deceased s family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses 26 Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden abrupt event but a gradual process toward Puya the land of souls or afterlife During the waiting period the body of the deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral ceremony is completed after which it begins its journey to Puya 27 ",
			"after": " Another component of the ritual is the slaughter of water buffalo The more powerful the person who died the more buffalo are slaughtered at the death feast Buffalo carcasses including their heads are usually lined up on a field waiting for their owner who is in the sleeping stage Torajans believe that the deceased will need the buffalo to make the journey and that they will be quicker to arrive at Puya if they have many buffalo Slaughtering tens of water buffalo and hundreds of pigs using a machete is the climax of the elaborate death feast with dancing and music and young boys who catch spurting blood in long bamboo tubes Some of the slaughtered animals are given by guests as gifts which are carefully noted because they will be considered debts of the deceased s family 28 However a cockfight known as bulangan londong is an integral part of the ceremony As with the sacrifice of the buffalo and the pigs the cockfight is considered sacred because it involves the spilling of blood on the earth In particular the tradition requires the sacrifice of at least three chickens However it is common for at least 25 pairs of chickens to be set against each other in the context of the ceremony 29 ",
