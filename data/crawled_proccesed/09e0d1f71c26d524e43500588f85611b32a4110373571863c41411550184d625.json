			"after": " After winning the division in 2005 the Bucs suffered through an abysmal 2006 season The season was plagued by injuries with starters such as guard Dan Buenning wide receiver Michael Clayton running back Cadillac Williams defensive end Simeon Rice cornerback Brian Kelly and quarterback Chris Simms all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs such as quarterback Bruce Gradkowski tackle Jeremy Trueblood and guard Davin Joseph ",
