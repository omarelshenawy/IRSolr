			"previous": " The ubiquitin protein itself is 76 amino acids long and was named due to its ubiquitous nature as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms 41 The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest evolving protein identified to date 42 Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains 43 Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin have a role in proteasome targeting while other types of chains may be involved in other processes 44 45 ",
