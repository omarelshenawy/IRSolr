			"previous": " Emperor penguins are able to breed at around three years of age and usually commence breeding around one to three years later 18 The yearly reproductive cycle begins at the start of the Antarctic winter in March and April when all mature emperor penguins travel to colonial nesting areas often walking 50 to 120 km 31 to 75 mi inland from the edge of the pack ice 63 The start of travel appears to be triggered by decreasing day lengths emperor penguins in captivity have been induced successfully into breeding by using lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic day lengths 64 ",
			"after": " The penguins start courtship in March or April when the temperature can be as low as 40 C 40 F A lone male gives an ecstatic display where it stands still and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1 2 seconds it then moves around the colony and repeats the call A male and female then stand face to face with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it they both hold this posture for several minutes Once in pairs couples waddle around the colony together with the female usually following the male Before copulation one bird bows deeply to its mate its bill pointed close to the ground and its mate then does the same 65 ",
