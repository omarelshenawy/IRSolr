			"previous": " Engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science The advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life In the first revolution Lewis Paul was the original inventor of roller spinning the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill Matthew Boulton and James Watt s improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world ",
			"after": " In the latter part of the second revolution Thomas Alva Edison developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory In 1882 Edison switched on the world s first large scale electrical supply network that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty nine customers in lower Manhattan Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution Nikola Tesla made many contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries ",
