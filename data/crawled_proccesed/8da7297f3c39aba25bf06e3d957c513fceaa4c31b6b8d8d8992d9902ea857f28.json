			"previous": " The Commonwealth of Australia was inaugurated on 1 January 1901 and Sydney with a population of 481 000 became the capital of New South Wales 36 The Great Depression had a severe effect on Sydney s economy as it did with most cities throughout the industrial world For much of the 1930s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed 44 Construction of the Harbour Bridge served to alleviate some of the effects of the economic downturn by employing 1 400 men between 1924 and 1932 45 The population continued to boom despite the Depression and reached 1 million in 1925 43 ",
			"after": " Australia entered World War II in 1939 and Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development to meet the needs of a wartime economy Far from mass unemployment there were now labour shortages and women becoming active in male roles Sydney s harbour came under direct attack from Japanese submarines on 1 June 1942 46 After the war the cultural and economic pillars of Sydney flourished There were 1 7 million people living in the city by 1950 and almost 3 million by 1975 Sydney s iconic Opera House opened in 1973 and became a World Heritage Site in 2007 47 The 2000 Summer Olympics were held in Sydney and became known as the best Olympic Games ever by the President of the International Olympic Committee 48 A strong rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne that began in the 1850s still exists to this day Sydney exceeded Melbourne s population in the early twentieth century and remains Australia s largest city 7 49 ",
