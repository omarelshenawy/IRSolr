			"after": " Most Cucurbita species are climbing annual vines they are also mesophytes plants which require a more or less continuous water supply The less numerous perennial species grow in tropical zones and are xerophytes plants which tolerate dry conditions Growing 5 to 15 meters 16 to 49 ft in height or length the plant stem produces tendrils to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground Most species do not readily root from the nodes a notable exception is C ficifolia and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent The vine of the perennial Cucurbita can become semiwoody if left to grow There is wide variation in size shape and color among Cucurbita fruits and even within a single species C ficifolia is an exception being highly uniform in appearance 5 The morphological variation in the species C pepo 6 and C maxima 7 is so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species 6 ",
