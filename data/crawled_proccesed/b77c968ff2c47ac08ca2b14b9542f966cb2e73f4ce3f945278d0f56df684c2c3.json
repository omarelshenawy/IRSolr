			"after": " There are hereditary as well as non hereditary variations in plumage that are rare and termed as abnormal or aberrant plumages Melanism refers to an excess of black or dark colours Erythromelanism or erythrism is the result of excessive reddish brown erythromelanin deposition in feathers that normally lack melanin Melanin of different forms combine with xanthophylls to produce colour mixtures and when this combination is imbalanced it produces colour shifts that are termed as schizochroisms including xanthochromism overabundance of yellow and axanthism lack of yellow which are commonly bred in cagebirds such as budgerigars A reduction in eumelanin leads to non eumelanin schizochroism with an overall fawn plumage while a lack of phaeomelanin results in grey coloured non phaeomelanin schizochroism Carotenism refers to abnormal distribution of carotenoid pigments ",
