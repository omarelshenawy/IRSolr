			"previous": " Archimedes died c 212 BC during the Second Punic War when Roman forces under General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two year long siege According to the popular account given by Plutarch Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined saying that he had to finish working on the problem The soldier was enraged by this and killed Archimedes with his sword Plutarch also gives a lesser known account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier According to this story Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed 11 Marcellus called Archimedes a geometrical Briareus 12 ",
