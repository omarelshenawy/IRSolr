			"previous": " Bartlett celebrated as a hero by press and public was honoured for outstanding bravery by the Royal Geographical Society However he was later censured by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice and for allowing Mackay s party to leave the main group despite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed absolving the captain from responsibility 5 95 Stefansson too was privately critical of Bartlett s conduct 114 Bartlett resumed his career at sea and over the next 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic 95 During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies he died aged 70 in April 1946 115 His account of the Karluk disaster published in 1916 makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else Niven records however that to his friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader 95 ",
			"after": " In 1918 Stefansson returned after four years absence reporting the discovery of three new islands He was honoured by the National Geographical Society received tributes from polar veterans such as Peary and Adolphus Greely 116 and was given the presidency of the Explorers Club of New York 117 In Canada his reception was more muted there were questions relating to the overall costs of the expedition 95 its poor initial organisation and his handling of the Southern Party which under Rudolph Anderson completed its work independently of Stefansson 118 Anderson and other members of the Southern Party later petitioned the Canadian government to investigate statements made by Stefansson in his 1921 book The Friendly Arctic which they felt reflected poorly on their honour The request was declined on the ground that no good could come of the enquiry 95 In his book Stefansson takes responsibility for the bold decision to take Karluk into the ice rather than hugging the coast on the way to Herschel Island and accepts that he chose the wrong alternative 119 However McKinlay felt that the book gave an inaccurate account of the Karluk voyage and its consequences putting the blame on everyone but Vilhjalmur Stefansson 116 Historian Tom Henighan believes that McKinlay s biggest complaint against his leader was that Stefansson never at any time seemed able to express an appropriate sorrow over his lost men 120 Stefansson who never returned to the Arctic died in 1962 at the age of 82 121 ",
