			"previous": " The near absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the Albertosaurus bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits in California and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour 7 Other scientists are skeptical observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought flood or for other reasons 3 39 41 ",
			"after": " There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs 42 However only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site Small theropods like Deinonychus 43 Coelophysis and Megapnosaurus Syntarsus rhodesiensis 44 have been found in aggregations as have larger predators like Allosaurus and Mapusaurus 45 There is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other tyrannosaurids as well Fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside Sue the Tyrannosaurus mounted in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and a bonebed in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana contains at least three specimens of Daspletosaurus preserved alongside several hadrosaurs 46 These findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in Albertosaurus although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations 7 Others have speculated that instead of social groups at least some of these finds represent Komodo dragon like mobbing of carcasses where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and cannibalized 39 ",
