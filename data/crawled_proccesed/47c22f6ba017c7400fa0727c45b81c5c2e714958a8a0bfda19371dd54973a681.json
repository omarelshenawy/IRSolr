			"previous": " ACT was not payable on dividends from one UK company to another unless the payor company elected to pay it 15 Also the recipient company was not taxed on that dividend receipt except for dealers in shares and life assurance companies in respect of some of their profits 15 As the payor company would have suffered tax on the payments it made the company that received the dividend also received a credit that it could use to reduce the amount of ACT it itself paid or in certain cases apply to have the tax credit repaid to them 12 ",
			"after": " The level of ACT was linked to the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993 The March 1993 Budget of Norman Lamont cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22 5 from April 1993 and 20 from April 1994 5 These changes were accompanied with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20 while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25 Persons liable for tax were lightly affected by the change because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25 tax on the amount of the dividend actually received net as against 20 before the change ",
