			"previous": " The L 1011 featured a highly advanced autopilot system and was the first widebody to receive FAA certification for Cat IIIc autolanding which approved the TriStar for completely blind landings in zero visibility weather performed by the aircraft s autopilot 23 The L 1011 used an Inertial Navigation System INS to navigate 24 25 this included aligning the navigation system by entering current coordinates of longitude and latitude ",
			"after": " It also had a unique Direct Lift Control DLC system which allowed for smooth approaches when landing without having to use significant pitch changes while on the approach path 26 27 DLC helps maintain the descending glideslope on final approach by automatically deploying spoiler panels on the wings Thus rather than maintaining the descent by adjusting pitch DLC helps control the descent while maintaining a more consistent pitch angle using four redundant hydraulic systems Production also utilized a unique autoclave system for bonding fuselage panels together this made the L 1011 extremely resistant to corrosion ",
