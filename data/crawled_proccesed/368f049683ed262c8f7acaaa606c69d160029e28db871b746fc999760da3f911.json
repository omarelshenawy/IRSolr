			"after": " The UK had identified a requirement for a new fighter as early as 1971 The AST 403 specification issued by the Air staff in 1972 resulted in the P 96 conventional tailed design which was presented in the late 1970s While the design would have met the Air Staff s requirements the UK air industry had reservations as it appeared to be very similar to the McDonnell Douglas F A 18 Hornet which was then well advanced in its development The P 96 design had little potential for future growth and when it entered production it would secure few exports in a market in which the Hornet would be well established 8 However the simultaneous West German requirement for a new fighter had led by 1979 to the development of the TKF 90 concept 9 10 This was a cranked delta wing design with forward close coupled canard controls and artificial stability Although the British Aerospace designers rejected some of its advanced features such as engine vectoring nozzles and vented trailing edge controls 11 a form of boundary layer control they agreed with the overall configuration ",
