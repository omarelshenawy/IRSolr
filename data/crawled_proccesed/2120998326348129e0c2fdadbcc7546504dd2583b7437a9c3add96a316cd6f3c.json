			"previous": " One of Colfer s major influences is Whoopi Goldberg He said When I was little my favorite movie I used to watch was Sister Act and my mother stated that I would place towels on my head and sing with Whoopi and the nuns Colfer stated on his Twitter account that actor Robin Williams was his hero growing up before Williams committed suicide and said You know someone is special when the whole world considers them family Colfer stated that Kristin Chenoweth was another major influence on him claiming in one interview with Jay Leno that he was nervous sitting next to her and that Kristin was his very first celebrity crush Colfer stated that Glee s producer Ryan Murphy also became a huge influence on him with him stating he would often get himself into trouble with his mother when he was caught watching Nip Tuck and that Murphy was the first person in Hollywood to ever let him work despite him being horrible at auditions describing Murphy as his fairy godfather in his 2011 Golden Globes speech He also stated that Elton John influenced him to respond to hateful anti gay people with love kindness and respect rather than anger and resentment Colfer said two of his favorite artists are Betty Who and Melissa Etheridge on his Twitter ",
