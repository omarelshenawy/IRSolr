			"previous": " In Elizabethan England music printing was regulated by two royal patents issued by the queen one for metrical psalters psalms set to music and one for all other types of music and music paper The patent holders thus held a monopoly only they or their assignees could legally print music 20 After printer John Day s death in 1584 the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees who were members of the Stationers Company The more general one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575 Despite the monopoly Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavors their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur failed to sell and was a financial disaster 21 After Tallis died in 1585 Byrd continued holding the patent producing works with his assignee Thomas East 22 The monopoly expired in 1596 prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley to take advantage of the resulting power vacuum 20 ",
			"after": " In 1596 despite not having access to a proper music fount Barley using the services of Danter and his wood blocks published The Pathway to Music a music theory book and A New Booke of Tabliture a tutor for the lute and related instruments that included compositions by John Dowland Philip Rosseter and Anthony Holborne Both featured numerous errors and for the latter Barley seems not to have gained prior publishing approval from the composers Dowland disowned A New Booke of Tabliture calling his lute lessons falce and unperfect 23 while Holborne complained of corrupt coppies of his work being presented by a meere stranger 24 Modern musicologists have labelled the publication exasperating and seedy 23 Morley criticized The Pathway to Music stating that the author should be ashamed of his labour 23 and that v ix est in toto pagina sano libro there is scarcely a page that makes sense in the whole book 25 Despite their flaws both works seem to have been instrumental in introducing music tutor books to the London market 23 ",
