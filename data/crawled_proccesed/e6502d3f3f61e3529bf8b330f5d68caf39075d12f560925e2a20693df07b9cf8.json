			"previous": " The revisionist perspective has subsequently been supported by his children Maxim and Galina and many Russian musicians Volkov has further argued both in Testimony and in Shostakovich and Stalin that Shostakovich adopted the role of the yurodivy or holy fool in his relations with the government Other prominent revisionists are Ian MacDonald whose book The New Shostakovich put forward further revisionist interpretations of his music and Elizabeth Wilson whose Shostakovich A Life Remembered provides testimony from many of the composer s acquaintances ",
			"after": " Musicians and scholars including Laurel Fay 106 and Richard Taruskin contest the authenticity and debate the significance of Testimony alleging that Volkov compiled it from a combination of recycled articles gossip and possibly some information direct from the composer Fay documents these allegations in her 2002 article Volkov s Testimony reconsidered 107 showing that the only pages of the original Testimony manuscript that Shostakovich had signed and verified are word for word reproductions of earlier interviews given by the composer none of which are controversial Against this it has been pointed out by Allan B Ho and Dmitry Feofanov that at least two of the signed pages contain controversial material for instance on the first page of chapter 3 where Shostakovich notes that the plaque that reads In this house lived Vsevolod Meyerhold should also say And in this house his wife was brutally murdered 108 ",
