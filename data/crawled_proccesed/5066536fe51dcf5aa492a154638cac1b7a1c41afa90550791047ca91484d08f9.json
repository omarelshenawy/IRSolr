			"previous": " During the electoral campaign Johnson had confided to Brian Paddick that he was unsure how he would retain his current lifestyle while relying upon the Mayoral salary of 140 000 a year 215 Dealing with this problem he agreed to continue writing his Telegraph column alongside his Mayoral position thus earning him a further 250 000 a year 216 His team recognised that this would prove controversial with the electorate and made him promise to donate a fifth of his Telegraph fee to a charitable cause providing bursaries for students of journalism and Classics Johnson resented this and ultimately did not pay a full fifth 217 The situation generated controversy when he was questioned regarding his Telegraph fee on BBC s HARDtalk here he referred to the 250 000 as chicken feed something that was widely condemned given that 250 000 was roughly ten times the average yearly wage for a British worker 218 219 220 ",
			"after": " Johnson made no major changes to the mayoral system as developed by Livingstone 221 He did however reverse a number of measures implemented by Livingstone s administration by ending the city s oil deal with Venezuela abolishing The Londoner newsletter and scrapping the half yearly inspections of black cabs although the latter were reinstated three years later 221 Abolishing the western wing of the congestion charging zone 222 he cancelled plans to increase the congestion charge for four wheel drives 223 He also sought to claim credit for projects like Crossrail and the 2012 Olympic Games which had been introduced by the Livingstone administration 224 He introduced a public bicycle scheme which had been planned by Livingstone s administration colloquially known as Boris Bikes the system cost 140 million and was a significant financial loss although proved popular 225 Despite Johnson s support of cycling in London and his much publicised identity as a cyclist himself his administration was heavily criticised by cycling groups who argued that he had failed to make the city s roads safer for cyclists 226 As per his election pledge he also commissioned the development of the New Routemaster buses for central London 227 He also ordered the construction of a cable car system that crossed the River Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks 228 In financing these projects Johnson s administration had borrowed 100 million 229 while public transport fares had increased by 50 230 ",
