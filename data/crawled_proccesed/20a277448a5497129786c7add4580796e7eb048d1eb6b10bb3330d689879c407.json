			"previous": " The interior of the State Apartments was mostly designed by Wyatville in the early 19th century Wyatville intended each room to illustrate a particular architectural style and to display the matching furnishings and fine arts of the period 21 With some alterations over the years this concept continues to dominate the apartments Different rooms follow the Classical Gothic and Rococo styles together with an element of Jacobethan in places 22 Many of the rooms on the eastern end of the castle had to be restored following the 1992 fire using equivalent restoration methods the rooms were restored so as to appear similar to their original appearance but using modern materials and concealing modern structural improvements 23 nb 2 These rooms were also partially redesigned at the same time to more closely match modern tastes Art historian Hugh Roberts has praised the State Apartments as a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste 1 Others such as architect Robin Nicolson and critic Hugh Pearman have described them as bland and distinctly dull 24 ",
			"after": " Wyatville s most famous work are those rooms designed in a Rococo style These rooms take the fluid playful aspects of this mid 18th century artistic movement including many original pieces of Louis XV decoration but project them on a vastly inflated scale 25 Investigations after the 1992 fire have shown though that many Rococo features of the modern castle originally thought to have been 18th century fittings transferred from Carlton House or France are in fact 19th century imitations in plasterwork and wood designed to blend with original elements 26 The Grand Reception Room is the most prominent of these Rococo designs 100 ft 30 m long and 40 ft 12 m tall and occupying the site of Edward III s great hall 27 This room restored after the fire includes a huge French Rococo ceiling characterised by Ian Constantinides the lead restorer as possessing a coarseness of form and crudeness of hand completely overshadowed by the sheer spectacular effect when you are at a distance 28 The room is set off by a set of restored Gobelins French tapestries 28 Although decorated with less gold leaf than in the 1820s the result remains one of the greatest set pieces of Regency decoration 29 The White Green and Crimson Drawing Rooms include a total of 62 trophies carved gilded wooden panels illustrating weapons and the spoils of war many with Masonic meanings 30 Restored or replaced after the fire these trophies are famous for their vitality precision and three dimensional quality and were originally brought from Carlton House in 1826 some being originally imported from France and others carved by Edward Wyatt 30 The soft furnishings of these rooms although luxurious are more modest than the 1820s originals both on the grounds of modern taste and cost 31 ",
