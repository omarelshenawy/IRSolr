			"previous": " The obverse of Saint Gaudens s final design shows a female figure of Liberty who also represents victory Saint Gaudens based his design on the female figure he had designed in creating New York City s monument to General William Tecumseh Sherman 19 but the sculptor s ultimate inspiration was the Nike of Samothrace 20 The figure for the Sherman monument was modeled by Henrietta Anderson one of the artist s favorite subjects 19 On the coin Liberty holds a torch in one hand representing enlightenment an olive branch in the other a symbol of peace 21 She strides across a rocky outcrop behind her are the United States Capitol and the rays of the sun The figure is surrounded by 46 stars one for each of the states in 1907 The reverse is a side view of a flying eagle seen slightly from below with a rising sun and its rays behind it complementing the obverse design 19 The edge bears the lettering E Pluribus Unum c Saint Gaudens felt he could not place a third line of text on the reverse without unbalancing the composition and the obverse lacked room for the motto so it was placed on the edge 22 ",
