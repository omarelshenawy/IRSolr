			"previous": " The United States Marine Corps has avoided the Super Hornet program and their resistance is so high that they would rather fly former Navy F A 18Cs that have been replaced with Super Hornets This is said to be because they fear that any Super Hornet buys will be at the cost of the F 35B STOVL fighters that they intend to operate from amphibious ships 111 As a concession the Marine Corps has agreed to eventually equip five Marine fighter attack squadrons VMFA with the F 35C carrier variant to continue to augment Navy carrier air wings as they currently do with the F A 18C 112 ",
			"after": " Boeing offered Malaysia the Super Hornets as part of a buy back package for its existing F A 18 Hornets in 2002 However the Super Hornet procurement was halted in 2007 after the government decided to purchase the Sukhoi Su 30MKM instead But Chief Gen Datuk Nik Ismail Nik Mohamaed of the Royal Malaysian Air Force RMAF indicated that the air force had not planned to end procurement of the Super Hornets instead saying that it needed such fighters 113 In a separate deal the RMAF s MiG 29 will be replaced in 2015 The F A 18F Super Hornet is one of the leading contenders for the MiG 29 replacement MRCA program Under the program the RMAF is looking to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighter aircraft with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion US 1 84 billion to US 2 46 billion The other competitors are the Eurofighter Typhoon Dassault Rafale and Saab JAS 39 Gripen 114 ",
