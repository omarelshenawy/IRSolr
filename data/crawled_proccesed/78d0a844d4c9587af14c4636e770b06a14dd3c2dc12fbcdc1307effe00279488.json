			"previous": " In addition the Egyptians had built separate ramps at the crossing points reaching as high as 21 metres 69 ft to counter the Israeli sand wall provide covering fire for the assaulting infantry and to counter the first Israeli armored counterattacks 93 The scale and effectiveness of the Egyptian strategy of deploying these anti tank weapons coupled with the Israelis inability to disrupt their use with close air support due to the SAM shield greatly contributed to Israeli setbacks early in the war ",
			"after": " The Egyptian Army put great effort into finding a quick and effective way of breaching the Israeli defenses The Israelis had built large 18 metre 59 foot high sand walls with a 60 degree slope and reinforced with concrete at the water line Egyptian engineers initially experimented with explosive charges and bulldozers to clear the obstacles before a junior officer proposed using high pressure water cannons The idea was tested and found to be a sound one and several high pressure water cannons were imported from Britain and East Germany The water cannons effectively breached the sand walls using water from the canal 94 ",
