			"previous": " Europeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century with the first settlements founded by the Dutch who in 1623 built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River opposite the Schuylkill River in what is now Brooklawn New Jersey The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony In 1638 Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina present day Wilmington Delaware and quickly spread out in the valley In 1644 New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their military defeat of the English colony of Maryland In 1648 the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware south of the Schuylkill near the present day Eastwick section of Philadelphia to reassert their dominion over the area The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm named New Korsholm after a town that is now in Finland In 1655 a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony ending its claim to independence although the Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia religion and court and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664 but the situation did not really change until 1682 when the area was included in William Penn s charter for Pennsylvania ",
