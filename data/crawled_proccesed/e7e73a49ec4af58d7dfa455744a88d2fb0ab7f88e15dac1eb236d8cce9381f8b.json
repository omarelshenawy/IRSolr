			"previous": " After Scheidemann s resignation a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation Although he shared his countrymen s disgust with the treaty he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty the Allies would invade Germany from the west and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion With this in mind he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty Hindenburg after prodding from his chief of staff Wilhelm Groener concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale However rather than inform Ebert himself he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities Upon receiving this the new government recommended signing the treaty The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 with five abstentions there were 421 delegates in total This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline Foreign minister Hermann M ller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116 101 ",
