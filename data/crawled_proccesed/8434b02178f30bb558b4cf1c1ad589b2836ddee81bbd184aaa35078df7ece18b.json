			"previous": " While exploring the Marias River in 1806 the Lewis and Clark Expedition came within 50 miles 80 km of the area that is now the park 7 A series of explorations after 1850 helped to shape the understanding of the area that later became the park In 1885 George Bird Grinnell hired noted explorer and later well regarded author James Willard Schultz to guide him on a hunting expedition into what would later become the park 14 After several more trips to the region Grinnell became so inspired by the scenery that he spent the next two decades working to establish a national park In 1901 Grinnell wrote a description of the region in which he referred to it as the Crown of the Continent His efforts to protect the land make him the premier contributor to this cause 15 A few years after Grinnell first visited Henry L Stimson and two companions including a Blackfoot climbed the steep east face of Chief Mountain in 1892 ",
			"after": " In 1891 the Great Northern Railway crossed the Continental Divide at Marias Pass 5 213 feet 1 589 m which is along the southern boundary of the park In an effort to stimulate use of the railroad the Great Northern soon advertised the splendors of the region to the public The company lobbied the United States Congress In 1897 the park was designated as a forest preserve 16 Under the forest designation mining was still allowed but was not commercially successful Meanwhile proponents of protecting the region kept up their efforts In 1910 under the influence of the Boone and Crockett Club 17 spearheaded by Club members George Bird Grinnell Henry L Stimson and the railroad a bill was introduced into the U S Congress which redesignated the region from a forest reserve to a national park This bill was signed into law by President William Howard Taft on May 11 1910 18 19 In 1910 George Bird Grinnell wrote This Park the country owes to the Boone and Crockett Club whose members discovered the region suggested it being set aside caused the bill to be introduced into congress and awakened interest in it all over the country 20 ",
