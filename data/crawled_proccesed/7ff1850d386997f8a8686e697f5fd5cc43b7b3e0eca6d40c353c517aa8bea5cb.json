			"previous": " There has been a settlement at Bramall since Saxon times 3 According to Alfred Burton who wrote about Bramall in the late 19th century the house has not always been in the present location and was originally at Crow Holt Wood This theory was rejected by another historian Frederick Moorhouse who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory 65 Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides which two streams run through It is a grade I listed building and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries 1 It was originally accessed from the east side the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side reaching the courtyard on the other side The main entrance is now on the side of the courtyard in the west 66 because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888 42 The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building in the courtyard the service wing is on the left the Great Hall is in the centre and the Banqueting Hall is on the right 67 Before the 19th century the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down between 1774 and 1819 68 69 because of its being neither required nor in vogue 27 ",
			"after": " The house is built with stone foundations and the main structure is made of oak timbers joined together using mortice and tenon joints and held in place with oak pegs Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period though some parts have been repaired in later years 66 ",
