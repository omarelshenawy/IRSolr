			"after": " A parclo interchange also known as a partial cloverleaf is an interchange usually involving four to six ramps two of which are loop ramps which connect to the non highway  The parclo is a safer modification of the cloverleaf design Depending on the number of ramps used they take up a moderate to large amount of land and are typically inexpensive to build Parclos with more ramps have a greater capacity and efficiency than parclos with fewer ramps Parclos are sometimes called a folded diamond when only four ramps in two quadrants are used If the loop ramps are constructed opposite or mirrored along the highway weaving is avoided Cloverleaf interchanges that involve a non highway can be changed to parclos without too much reconstruction Although the interchange s capacity is reduced weaving is eliminated increasing the safety and efficiency of the interchange ",
