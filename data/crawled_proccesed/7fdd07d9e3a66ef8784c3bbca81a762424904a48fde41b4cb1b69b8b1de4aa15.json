			"after": " About 140 AD Ptolemy the Alexandrian astronomer sexagesimally subdivided both the mean solar day and the true solar day to at least six places after the sexagesimal point and he used simple fractions of both the equinoctial hour and the seasonal hour none of which resemble the modern second 4 Muslim scholars including al Biruni in 1000 subdivided the mean solar day into 24 equinoctial hours each of which was subdivided sexagesimally that is into the units of minute second third fourth and fifth creating the modern second as 1 60 of 1 60 of 1 24 1 86400 of the mean solar day in the process 5 With this definition the second was proposed in 1874 as the base unit of time in the CGS system of units 6 Soon afterwards Simon Newcomb and others discovered that Earth s rotation period varied irregularly 7 so in 1952 the International Astronomical Union IAU defined the second as a fraction of the sidereal year Because the tropical year was considered more fundamental than the sidereal year in 1955 the IAU redefined the second as the fraction 1 31 556 925 9747 of the 1900 0 mean tropical year which was adopted in 1956 by the International Committee for Weights and Measures and in 1960 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures becoming a part of the International System of Units SI 8 ",
