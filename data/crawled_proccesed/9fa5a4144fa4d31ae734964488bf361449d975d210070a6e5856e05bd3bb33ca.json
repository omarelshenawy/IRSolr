			"after": " The only supersonic airliner in direct competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu 144 nicknamed Concordski by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde 217 It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts had resulted in the theft of Concorde blueprints ostensibly to assist in the design of the Tu 144 218 As a result of a rushed development programme the first Tu 144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines but both were cruder than Concorde The Tu 144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde due to its low bypass turbofan engines 219 The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design in addition the Tu 144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti lock brakes 220 The Tu 144 had two crashes one at the 1973 Paris Air Show 221 222 and another during a pre delivery test flight in May 1978 223 224 ",
