			"previous": " A submarine torpedo tube is a more complex mechanism than a torpedo tube on a surface ship because the tube has to accomplish the function of moving the torpedo from the normal atmospheric pressure within the submarine into the sea at the ambient pressure of the water around the submarine Thus a submarine torpedo tube operates on the principle of an airlock ",
			"after": " The diagram on the right illustrates the operation of a submarine torpedo tube The diagram is somewhat simplified but does show the working of a submarine torpedo launch  A torpedo tube has a considerable number of interlocks for safety reasons For example an interlock prevents the breech door and muzzle door from opening at the same time Also the breech door cannot be opened when the muzzle door is also open or it will let water enter the submarine thus sinking it ",
