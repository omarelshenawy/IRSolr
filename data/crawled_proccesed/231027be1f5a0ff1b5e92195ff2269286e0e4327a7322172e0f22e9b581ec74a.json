			"after": " Tankers are considered force multipliers because they convey considerable tactical advantages Primarily aerial refueling adds to the combat radius of attack fighter and bombers aircraft and allows patrol aircraft to remain airborne longer thereby reducing the numbers of aircraft necessary to accomplish a given mission Aerial refueling can also mitigate basing issues which might otherwise place limitations on combat payload Combat aircraft operating from airfields with shorter runways must limit their takeoff weight which could mean a choice between range fuel and combat payload munitions Aerial refueling however eliminates many of these basing difficulties because a combat aircraft can take off with a full combat payload and refuel immediately ",
