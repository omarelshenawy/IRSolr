			"previous": " The first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch not just portable quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch tel Switzerland From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192 Hz quartz oscillator a thermo compensation module and an inhouse made dedicated integrated circuit unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch As a result the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch tel in 1967 24 In 1970 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch including the Omega Electroquartz as well as Patek Philippe Rolex Oysterquartz and Piaget",
			"after": " The first quartz watch to enter production was the Seiko 35 SQ Astron which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969 swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21 and then a year later the prototype of one of the world s most accurate wristwatches to date the Omega Marine Chronometer Thanks to the technology having been developed by the Swiss Seiko could not patent the whole movement of the quartz wristwatch thus allowing other manufacturers to participate in the rapid growth and development of the quartz watch market This ended in less than a decade almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day an inexpensive quartz movement in a child s wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day ten times better than a mechanical movement 25 ",
