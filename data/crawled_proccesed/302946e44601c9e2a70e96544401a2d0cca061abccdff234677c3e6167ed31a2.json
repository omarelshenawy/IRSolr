			"previous": " Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime but he received a large amount of praise 170 In 1598 the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as the most excellent in both comedy and tragedy 171 The authors of the Parnassus plays at St John s College Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer Gower and Spenser 172 In the First Folio Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the Soul of the age the applause delight the wonder of our stage though he had remarked elsewhere that Shakespeare wanted art ",
			"after": " Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century classical ideas were in vogue As a result critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson 173 Thomas Rymer for example condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic Nevertheless poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly saying of Jonson I admire him but I love Shakespeare 174 For several decades Rymer s view held sway but during the 18th century critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius A series of scholarly editions of his work notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790 added to his growing reputation 175 By 1800 he was firmly enshrined as the national poet 176 In the 18th and 19th centuries his reputation also spread abroad Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire Goethe Stendhal and Victor Hugo 177 ",
