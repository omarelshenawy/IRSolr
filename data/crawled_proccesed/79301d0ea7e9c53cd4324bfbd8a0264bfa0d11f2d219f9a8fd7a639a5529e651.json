			"previous": " As they grew older Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses This would later raise Madonna s interest in poetry with Sylvia Plath being her favourite 5 Later Madonna commented We were all wounded in one way or another by her death and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something If I hadn t had that emptiness I wouldn t have been so driven Her death had a lot to do with me saying after I got over my heartache I m going to be really strong if I can t have my mother I m going to take care of myself 5 Taraborrelli felt that in time no doubt because of the devastation she felt Madonna would never again allow herself or even her daughter to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died Her death had taught Madonna a valuable lesson that she would have to remain strong for herself because she feared weakness particularly her own and wanted to be the queen of her own castle 5 ",
