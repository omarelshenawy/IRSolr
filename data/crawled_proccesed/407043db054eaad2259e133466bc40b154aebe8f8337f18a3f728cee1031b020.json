			"after": " The potential dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic or human made releases of greenhouse gases most notably carbon dioxide can act interactively and have adverse effects upon the planet its natural environment and humans existence It is clear the planet is warming and warming rapidly The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the group of the leading climate scientists in the world concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2 7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit between 1990 and 2100 15 Efforts have been increasingly focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes on developing adaptative strategies to global warming to assist humans other animal and plant species ecosystems regions and nations in adjusting to the effects of global warming Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include ",
