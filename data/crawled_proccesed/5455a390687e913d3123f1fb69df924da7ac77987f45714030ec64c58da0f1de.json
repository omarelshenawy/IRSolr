			"previous": " The most egregious episode during the Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine Arkansas in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered 143 Reports coming out of the South blamed the blacks alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government Infuriated with the distortions Du Bois published a letter in the New York World claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities 144 Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy in the case known as Moore v Dempsey 145 Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense which six years later resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes 102 Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South it marked the first time the Federal government used the 14th amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence 146 ",
			"after": " In 1920 Du Bois published Darkwater Voices From Within the Veil the first of three autobiographies he would write 147 The veil was that which covered colored people around the world In the book he hoped to lift the veil and show white readers what life was like behind the veil and how it distorted the viewpoints of those looking through it in both directions 148 The book contained Du Bois s feminist essay The Damnation of Women which was a tribute to the dignity and worth of women particularly black women 149 ",
