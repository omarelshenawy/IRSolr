			"previous": " The Douglas XA 26 prototype AAC Ser No 41 19504 first flew on 10 July 1942 at Mines Field El Segundo with test pilot Benny Howard at the controls Flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling but problems with engine cooling led to cowling changes and elimination of the propeller spinners on production aircraft Repeated collapses during testing led to strengthening of the nose landing gear 9 ",
			"after": " The A 26 was originally built in two different configurations The A 26B had a solid nose which originally could be equipped with a combination of armament including 50 caliber machine guns 37mm auto cannon 20mm or even a 75mm pack howitzer but normally the solid nose version housed six or later eight 50 caliber machine guns officially termed the all purpose nose later commonly known as the six gun nose or eight gun nose The A 26C s glass nose officially termed the Bombardier nose contained a Norden bombsight for medium altitude precision bombing The A 26C nose section included two fixed M 2 guns later replaced by underwing gun packs or internal guns in the wings 10 ",
