			"previous": " The first flight of the X 32A designed for CTOL and carrier trials took place on 18 September 2000 from Boeing s Palmdale plant to Edwards Air Force Base The X 32B demonstrated STOVL flight first flying in March 2001 The X 32 achieved STOVL flight in much the same way as the AV 8B Harrier II with thrust vectoring of the jet and fan exhaust The Lockheed Martin team used a riskier alternative a shaft driven lift fan powered by the main engine which was designed to generate more thrust than possible with only direct exhaust gases A successful design would have greater payload and thus longer range than a simple thrust vectored turbofan Flight testing of both companies aircraft continued until July 2001 ",
			"after": " On 26 October 2001 the Department of Defense announced that the Lockheed Martin X 35 won the JSF competition The X 35 would be developed into the production Lockheed Martin F 35 Lightning II 4  The loss of the JSF contract to Lockheed Martin in 2001 was a major blow to Boeing as it represented the most important international fighter aircraft project since the Lightweight Fighter program competition of the 1960s and 1970s which had led to the F 16 Fighting Falcon and F A 18 Hornet At the time the production run of the JSF was estimated at anywhere between 3 000 and 5 000 7 Prior to the awarding of the contract many lawmakers pushed the idea of retaining the losing competitor as a sub contractor however the winner takes all principle was not changed Nonetheless Boeing views its work on the X 32 as a strategic investment yielding important technologies which it has been able to adopt in the Boeing F A 18E F Super Hornet and other studies 8 ",
