			"after": " The primary use of game theory is to describe and model how human populations behave Some who scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied This particular view of game theory has been criticized First it argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real world situations Game theorists usually assume players act rationally but in practice human behavior often deviates from this model Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in physics Thus while their assumptions do not always hold they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific ideal akin to the models used by physicists However empirical work has shown that in some classic games such as the centipede game guess 2 3 of the average game and the dictator game people regularly do not play Nash equilibria There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation 8 ",
