			"previous": " Plotted above are the results of several off design calculations showing the effect of throttling a jet engine from its design point condition This line is known as the compressor steady state as opposed to transient working line Over most of the throttle range the turbine system on a turbojet operates between choked planes All the turbine throats are choked as well as the final nozzle Consequently the turbine pressure ratio stays essentially constant This implies a fixed Since turbine rotor entry temperature usually falls with throttling the temperature drop across the turbine system must also decrease However the temperature rise across the compression system is proportional to Consequently the ratio must also fall implying a decrease in the compression system pressure ratio The non dimensional or corrected flow at compressor exit tends to stay constant because it sees beyond the combustor the constant corrected flow of the choked turbine Consequently there must be a decrease in compressor entry corrected flow as compressor pressure ratio falls Therefore the compressor steady state working line has a positive slope as shown above on the RHS ",
			"after": " Fairly obviously when an engine is throttled back it will lose net thrust This drop in thrust is mainly caused by the reduction in air mass flow but the reduction in turbine rotor inlet temperature and degradations in component performance will also contribute ",
