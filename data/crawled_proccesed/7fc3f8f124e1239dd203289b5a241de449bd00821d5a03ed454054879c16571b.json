			"previous": " ATP synthase also called complex V is the final enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions in the same way in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes 64 The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate Pi Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four 65 66 with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio to suit different conditions 67 ",
			"after": " This phosphorylation reaction is an equilibrium which can be shifted by altering the proton motive force In the absence of a proton motive force the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane However when the proton motive force is high the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction it proceeds from left to right allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP 64 Indeed in the closely related vacuolar type H ATPases the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP 68 ",
