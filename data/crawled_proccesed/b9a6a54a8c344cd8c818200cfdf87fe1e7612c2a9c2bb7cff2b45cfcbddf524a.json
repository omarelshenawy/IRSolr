			"previous": " The followers of John Wycliffe undertook the first complete English translations of the Christian scriptures in the 15th century These translations were banned in 1409 due to their association with the Lollards 27 The Wycliffe Bible pre dated the printing press but was circulated very widely in manuscript form often inscribed with a date earlier than 1409 to avoid the legal ban As the text translated in the various versions of the Wycliffe Bible was the Latin Vulgate and as it contained no heterodox readings there was in practice no way by which the ecclesiastical authorities could distinguish the banned version consequently many Catholic commentators of the 15th and 16th centuries such as Thomas More took these manuscript English Bibles to represent an anonymous earlier orthodox translation ",
			"after": " In 1525 William Tyndale an English contemporary of Martin Luther undertook a translation of the New Testament 28 Tyndale s translation was the first printed Bible in English Over the next ten years Tyndale revised his New Testament in the light of rapidly advancing biblical scholarship and embarked on a translation of the Old Testament 29 Despite some controversial translation choices the merits of Tyndale s work and prose style made his translation the ultimate basis for all subsequent renditions into Early Modern English 30 With these translations lightly edited and adapted by Myles Coverdale in 1539 Tyndale s New Testament and his incomplete work on the Old Testament became the basis for the Great Bible This was the first authorized version issued by the Church of England during the reign of King Henry VIII 3 When Mary I succeeded to the throne in 1553 she returned the Church of England to the communion of the Roman Catholic faith and many English religious reformers fled the country 31 some establishing an English speaking colony at Geneva Under the leadership of John Calvin Geneva became the chief international centre of Reformed Protestantism and Latin biblical scholarship 32 ",
