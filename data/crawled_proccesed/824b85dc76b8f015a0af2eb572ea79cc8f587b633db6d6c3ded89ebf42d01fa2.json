			"previous": " From the outset Boydell s project inspired imitators In April 1788 after the announcement of the Shakespeare Gallery but a year before its opening Thomas Macklin opened a Gallery of the Poets in the former Royal Academy building on the south side of Pall Mall The first exhibition featured one work from each of 19 artists including Fuseli Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough The gallery added new paintings of subjects from poetry each year and from 1790 supplemented these with scenes from the Bible The Gallery of the Poets closed in 1797 and its contents were offered by lottery 81 This did not deter Henry Fuseli from opening a Milton Gallery in the same building in 1799 Another such venture was the Historic Gallery opened by Robert Bowyer in Schomberg House at 87 Pall Mall in about 1793 The gallery accumulated 60 paintings many by the same artists who worked for Boydell commissioned to illustrate a new edition of David Hume s The History of Great Britain 82 Ultimately Bowyer had to seek parliamentary approval for a sale by lottery in 1805 and the other ventures like Boydell s also ended in financial failure 82 83 ",
			"after": " The building in Pall Mall was purchased in 1805 by the British Institution a private club of connoisseurs founded that year to hold exhibitions It remained an important part of the London art scene until disbanded in 1867 typically holding a Spring exhibition of new works for sale from the start of February to the first week of May and a loan exhibition of old masters generally not for sale from the first week of June to the end of August 84 ",
