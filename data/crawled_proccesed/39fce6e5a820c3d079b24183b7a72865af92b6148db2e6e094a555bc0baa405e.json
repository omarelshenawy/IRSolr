			"after": " The purpose of varying pitch angle with a variable pitch propeller is to maintain an optimal angle of attack maximum lift to drag ratio on the propeller blades as aircraft speed varies Early pitch control settings were pilot operated either two position or manually variable Following World War I automatic propellers were developed to maintain an optimum angle of attack This was done by balancing the centripetal twisting moment on the blades and a set of counterweights against a spring and the aerodynamic forces on the blade Automatic props had the advantage of being simple lightweight and requiring no external control but a particular propeller s performance was difficult to match with that of the aircraft s powerplant An improvement on the automatic type was the constant speed propeller Constant speed propellers allow the pilot to select a rotational speed for maximum engine power or maximum efficiency and a propeller governor acts as a closed loop controller to vary propeller pitch angle as required to maintain the selected engine speed In most aircraft this system is hydraulic with engine oil serving as the hydraulic fluid However electrically controlled propellers were developed during World War II and saw extensive use on military aircraft and have recently seen a revival in use on homebuilt aircraft ",
