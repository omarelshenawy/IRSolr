			"previous": " GNOME and KDE are popular desktop environments and provide a framework for developing applications These projects are based on the GTK and Qt widget toolkits respectively which can also be used independently of the larger framework Both support a wide variety of languages There are a number of Integrated development environments available including Anjuta Code Blocks CodeLite Eclipse Geany ActiveState Komodo KDevelop Lazarus MonoDevelop NetBeans and Qt Creator while the long established editors Vim nano and Emacs remain popular 64 ",
			"after": " Linux kernel is a widely ported operating system kernel it runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures including the hand held ARM based iPAQ and the IBM mainframes System z9 or System z10 covering devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers 65 Specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures for example the ELKS kernel fork can run on Intel 8086 or Intel 80286 16 bit microprocessors while the Clinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer created operating system such as Macintosh computers with both PowerPC and Intel processors PDAs video game consoles portable music players and mobile phones ",
