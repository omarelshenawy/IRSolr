			"previous": " However the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa mostly German citizens and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa Consequently when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people 33 History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop Furthermore when Sweden did develop freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class 34 ",
