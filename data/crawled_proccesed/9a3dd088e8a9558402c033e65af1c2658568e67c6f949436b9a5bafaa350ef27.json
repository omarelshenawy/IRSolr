			"previous": " Postwar commercial airframe design focused on larger capacities on turboprop engines and then on jet turbojet later turbofan engines The generally higher speeds and stresses of turboprops and jets were major challenges 4 Newly developed aluminum alloys with copper magnesium and zinc were critical to these designs 5 The Lockheed L 188 turboprop first flown in 1957 used some of these materials and became a costly lesson in controlling vibration and planning around metal fatigue ",
			"after": " The de Havilland Comet was the world s first commercial jet airliner to reach production It first flew in 1949 and was considered a landmark in British aeronautical design After introduction into commercial service early Comet models suffered from catastrophic airframe metal fatigue causing a string of well publicised accidents The Royal Aircraft Establishment investigation at Farnborough founded the science of aircraft crash reconstruction Over 3000 cycles of pressurisation later in a specially constructed pressure chamber airframe failure was found to be due to stress concentration a consequence of the square shaped windows The windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted but had been punch riveted only Unlike drill riveting the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting may cause the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet ",
