			"previous": " In June 2008 Cathay Pacific entered into a plea bargain with the United States Department of Justice in respect of antitrust investigations over air cargo price fixing agreements It was fined US 60 million The airline has subsequently set up an internal Competition Compliance Office reporting to chief operating officer John Slosar to ensure that the Group complies with all relevant competition and antitrust laws in the jurisdiction in which it operates The breaches for which Cathay Pacific Cargo were being investigated in the U S were not illegal under Hong Kong competition law 43 44 ",
			"after": " In March 2009 the airline reported a record full year loss of HK 8 56 billion for 2008 which was also the carrier s first since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis The record loss included fuel hedging losses of HK 7 6 billion and a HK 468 million charge for a price fixing fine in the U S It had to scrap its final dividend The hedging losses were a result of locking in fuel prices at higher than prevailing market price As of the end of 2008 Cathay Pacific has hedged about half of its fuel needs until the end of 2011 The airline at the time estimated that it would face no further cash costs from the hedges if the average market price stood at US 75 enabling it recoup provisions it made in 2008 45 ",
