			"after": " In quantum mechanics and in particular in atomic and molecular physics within the Hartree Fock theory the atomic and molecular orbitals can be defined by the eigenvectors of the Fock operator The corresponding eigenvalues are interpreted as ionization potentials via Koopmans theorem In this case the term eigenvector is used in a somewhat more general meaning since the Fock operator is explicitly dependent on the orbitals and their eigenvalues If one wants to underline this aspect one speaks of nonlinear eigenvalue problem Such equations are usually solved by an iteration procedure called in this case self consistent field method In quantum chemistry one often represents the Hartree Fock equation in a non orthogonal basis set This particular representation is a generalized eigenvalue problem called Roothaan equations ",
