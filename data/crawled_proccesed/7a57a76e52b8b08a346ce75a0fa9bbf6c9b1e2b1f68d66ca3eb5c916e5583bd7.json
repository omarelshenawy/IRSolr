			"after": " A glyph s outline is defined by the vertices of individual stroke paths and the corresponding stroke profiles The stroke paths are a kind of topological skeleton of the glyph The advantages of stroke based fonts over outline fonts include reducing number of vertices needed to define a glyph allowing the same vertices to be used to generate a font with a different weight glyph width or serifs using different stroke rules and the associated size savings For a font developer editing a glyph by stroke is easier and less prone to error than editing outlines A stroke based system also allows scaling glyphs in height or width without altering stroke thickness of the base glyphs Stroke based fonts are heavily marketed for East Asian markets for use on embedded devices but the technology is not limited to ideograms ",
