			"previous": " The development of the scientific method has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired 16 To be termed scientific a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning and experimentation 17 The scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation and the formulation and testing of hypotheses 18 Science and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of Philosophy As science itself has developed knowledge has developed a broader usage which has been developing within biology psychology discussed elsewhere as meta epistemology or genetic epistemology and to some extent related to theory of cognitive development ",
