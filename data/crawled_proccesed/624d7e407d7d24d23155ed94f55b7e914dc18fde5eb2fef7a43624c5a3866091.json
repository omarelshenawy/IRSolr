			"previous": " Despite the growing movement to protect native species the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926 28 led to the killing of another 600 000 koalas during a one month open season in August 1927 149 In 1934 Frederick Lewis the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria said that the once abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state suggesting that only 500 1000 remained 150 ",
			"after": " The first successful efforts at conserving the species were initiated by the establishment of Brisbane s Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Sydney s Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s The owner of the latter park Noel Burnet became the first to successfully breed koalas and earned a reputation as the foremost contemporary authority on the marsupial 151 In 1934 David Fleay curator of Australian mammals at the Melbourne Zoo established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo and featured the koala This arrangement allowed him to undertake a detailed study of its diet in captivity Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at Healesville Sanctuary and the David Fleay Wildlife Park 152 ",
