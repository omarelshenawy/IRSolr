			"after": " The noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display displays can involve driving where the male jumps or flies at the female from 1 2 metres 3 3 6 6 ft away and if she moves away he pursues her aggressively The female may perform a bowed wing display where the wings and tail are spread and quivered with the wings arched and the head pointing down The male may adopt a vertical or horizontal eagle display with wings and tail spread wide and held still for several seconds Copulation is frequent and conspicuous with both males and females copulating with several birds while other members of the colony display or otherwise interfere with the mating pair 43 Copulation usually occurs on larger exposed branches close to the nest site and can occur at any time of the day although slightly more often between 11 00 and 13 00 when communal activities are less frequent 52 The frenzied courtship activity had led to speculation that the female mates promiscuously to recruit males to help care for the young however recent genetic testing shows that 96 5 of noisy miner broods result from monogamous mating and that multiple paternity is rare An observation of banded birds noted that while females copulated repeatedly it was always with the same male Mate switching between broods is uncommon with pairs staying together over several years 53 ",
