			"previous": " In 1995 the Park Service began preliminary work on a redesign of Independence Mall Architects Venturi Scott Brown Associates developed a master plan with two design alternatives The first proposed a block long visitors center on the south side of Market Street that would also house the Liberty Bell This would have interrupted the mall s three block vista of Independence Hall and made the bell visible only from the south i e Chestnut Street The second alternative placed a similar visitors center on the north side of Market Street also interrupting the mall s vista with the bell in a small pavilion on the south side 77 City planner Edmund Bacon who had overseen the mall s design in the 1950s saw preservation of the vista of Independence Hall as essential He created his own plan which included a domed bell pavilion built north of Market Street 78 Public reaction to the possibility of moving the Liberty Bell so far from Independence Hall was strongly negative NPS announced that the bell would remain on the block between Chestnut and Market Streets 79 Other plans were proposed each had strengths and weaknesses but the goal of all was to encourage visitors to see more of the historical park than just the Liberty Bell 80 ",
			"after": " The Olin Partnership was hired to create a new master plan for Independence Mall its team included architect Bernard Cywinski who ultimately won a limited design competition to design what was called the Liberty Bell Center LBC 81 Cywinski s design was unveiled in early 1999 Significantly larger than the existing pavilion allowing for exhibit space and an interpretive center the proposed LBC building also would cover about 15 of the footprint of the long demolished President s House the White House of George Washington and John Adams 82 Archaeologists excavating the LBC s intended site uncovered remnants of the 1790 1800 executive mansion which were reburied 83 The project became highly controversial when it was revealed that Washington s slaves had been housed only feet from the planned LBC s main entrance 84 The Park Service refused to redesign the LBC building or delay its construction 85 Initially NPS resisted interpreting the slaves and the slave quarters 86 but after years of protest by Black activists agreed 87 The new facility which opened hours after the bell was installed on October 9 2003 is adjacent to an outline of Washington s slave quarters marked in the pavement with interpretive panels explaining the significance of what was found 88 ",
