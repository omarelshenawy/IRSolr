			"previous": " The human piloted Solair 1 was developed by G nther Rochelt and based on a Hans Farner canard design 2 24 It employed 2499 wing mounted solar cells giving an output of between 1 8 kilowatts kW This was equivalent to approximately 2 4 horsepower hp and 2 2 kW 3 0 hp The aircraft first flew at Unterw ssen Germany on 21 August 1983 2 It flew for 5 hours and 41 minutes mostly on solar energy and also thermals 2 The aircraft is now displayed at the German Museum in Munich 24 The newly developed piloted Solair II made its first flight in May 1998 and further test flights that summer but the propulsion system overheated too fast 24 Development stopped when G nther Rochelt suddenly died in September 1998 ",
