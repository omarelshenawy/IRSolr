			"previous": " The early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China based B 29s had been Hansell continued the practice of conducting so called high altitude precision bombing aimed at key industries and transportation networks even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results 31 These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft unfavorable weather conditions and enemy action 32 33 ",
			"after": " Hansell s successor Major General Curtis LeMay assumed command in January 1945 and initially continued to use the same precision bombing tactics with equally unsatisfactory results The attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes 37 Under pressure from USAAF headquarters in Washington LeMay changed tactics and decided that low level incendiary raids against Japanese cities were the only way to destroy their production capabilities shifting from precision bombing to area bombardment with incendiaries 38 ",
