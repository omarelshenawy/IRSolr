			"after": " Henry Moore was a British artist and sculptor Born into a poor mining family in the Yorkshire town of Castleford he became well known for his large scale abstract cast bronze and carved marble sculptures substantially supported by the British art establishment Moore helped to introduce a particular form of modernism into Britain His ability to satisfy large scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy towards the end of his life However he lived frugally and most of his wealth went to endow the Henry Moore Foundation which continues to support education and promotion of the arts His signature form is a pierced reclining figure first influenced by a Toltec Maya sculpture known as Chac Mool which he had seen as a plaster cast in Paris in 1925 Early versions are pierced conventionally as a bent arm reconnects with the body Later more abstract versions are pierced directly through the body in order to explore the concave and convex shapes These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with Barbara Hepworth s sculptures Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore s early shows ",
