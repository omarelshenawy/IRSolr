			"previous": " William De Morgan was unwilling to compromise on quality or embrace the trend towards mass production and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than similar works by other designers Consequently his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially 52 In 1906 his first novel Joseph Vance was published and became a great success prompting De Morgan to close the ceramics business in 1907 to concentrate on writing 52 Mary Watts attempted to replicate De Morgan s tile designs at Watts s pottery in Compton but was unable to do so and investigated other tile manufacturers 52 ",
			"after": " It transpired that the only manufacturer able to supply suitable tiles was Royal Doulton although they were unable or unwilling to replicate De Morgan s designs and they were duly commissioned to manufacture the 24 tiles delivered in May 1908 52 Mary Watts was unhappy with the design of the tiles which were significantly different in colour and appearance from De Morgan s original tiles and they were installed without ceremony on 21 August 1908 immediately below De Morgan s original row of tiles 53 ",
