			"previous": " All scramjet engines have an intake which compresses the incoming air fuel injectors a combustion chamber and a divergent thrust nozzle Sometimes engines also include a region which acts as a flame holder although the high stagnation temperatures mean that an area of focused waves may be used rather than a discrete engine part as seen in turbine engines Other engines use pyrophoric fuel additives such as silane to avoid such issues An isolator between the inlet and combustion chamber is often included to improve the homogeneity of the flow in the combustor and to extend the operating range of the engine ",
			"after": " A scramjet is reminiscent of a ramjet In a typical ramjet the supersonic inflow of the engine is decelerated at the inlet to subsonic speeds and then reaccelerated through a nozzle to supersonic speeds to produce thrust This deceleration which is produced by a normal shock creates a total pressure loss which limits the upper operating point of a ramjet engine ",
