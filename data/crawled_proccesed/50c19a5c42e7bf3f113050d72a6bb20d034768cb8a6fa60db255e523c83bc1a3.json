			"previous": " The Andean condor is a scavenger feeding mainly on carrion 35 Wild condors inhabit large territories often traveling more than 200 km 120 mi a day in search of carrion 24 In inland areas they prefer large carcasses Naturally they feed on the largest carcasses available which can include llamas Lama glama alpacas Vicugna pacos rheas Rhea ssp guanacos Lama guanicoe deer and armadillos However most inland condors now live largely off of domestic animals which are now more widespread in South America such as cattle Bos primigenius taurus horses Equus ferus caballus donkeys Equus africanus asinus mules sheep Ovis aries pigs Sus scrofa domesticus goats Capra aegagrus hircus and dogs Canis lupus familiaris They also feed on the carcasses of introduced game species such as wild boars Sus scrofa rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus foxes Vulpes vulpes and red deer Cervus elaphus For condors who live around the coast the diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals largely cetaceans 28 39 They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs 40 Andean condors have been observed to do some hunting of small live animals such as rodents birds and rabbits which given their lack of powerful grasping feet or developed hunting technique they usually kill by jabbing repeatedly with their bill 39 Coastal areas provide a constant food supply and in particularly plentiful areas some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach front land 33 They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers such as corvids or other vultures 41 It may follow New World vultures of the genus Cathartes the turkey vulture C aura the lesser yellow headed vulture C burrovianus and the greater yellow headed vulture C melambrotus to carcasses The Cathartes vultures forage by smell detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species 42 Black vultures Coragyps atratus king vultures Sarcoramphus papa and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range 43 44 Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild often going for a few days without eating then gorging themselves on several pounds at once sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping it must feed while on the ground 24 Like other carrion feeders it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease 45 ",
