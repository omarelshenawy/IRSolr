			"after": " This alcid typically fed in shoaling waters which were shallower than those frequented by other alcids 45 although after the breeding season they had been sighted up to 500 kilometres 310 mi from land 45 They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks 45 Their main food was fish usually 12 to 20 centimetres 4 7 to 7 9 in in length and weighing 40 to 50 grams 1 4 to 1 8 oz but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird s own length The bird could on average dive up to 75 metres 246 ft for its prey with the maximum dive depth being estimated at 130 metres 430 ft however to conserve energy most dives were shallower 45 Its ability to dive this deeply reduced competition with other alcid species Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favored prey 46 Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers shorthorn sculpins cod crustaceans and sand lance 44 45 The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and possibly fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adult auks 36 42 ",
