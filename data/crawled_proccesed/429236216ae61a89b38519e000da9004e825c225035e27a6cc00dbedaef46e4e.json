			"previous": " The castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of Richard the Lionheart 1189 1199 71 The castle was extended under William Longchamp Richard s Lord Chancellor and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade The Pipe Rolls record 2 881 1s 10d spent at the Tower of London between 3 December 1189 and 11 November 1190 72 from an estimated 7 000 spent by Richard on castle building in England 73 According to the contemporary chronicler Roger of Howden Longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the Thames 28 Longchamp was also Constable of the Tower and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with Richard s younger brother Prince John who in Richard s absence arrived in England to try to seize power As Longchamp s main fortress he made the Tower as strong as possible The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191 when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege 74 ",
			"after": " John succeeded Richard as king in 1199 but his rule proved unpopular with many of his barons who in response moved against him In 1214 while the king was at Windsor Castle Robert Fitzwalter led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower Although under garrisoned the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the Magna Carta 75 The king reneged on his promises of reform leading to the outbreak of the First Barons War Even after the Magna Carta was signed Fitzwalter maintained his control of London During the war the Tower s garrison joined forces with the barons John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince Louis the eldest son of the French king However after John s death in October 1216 many began to support the claim of his eldest son Prince Henry War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry with Fitzwalter supporting Louis Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower both of which held out until it was clear that Henry s supporters would prevail 75 ",
