			"previous": " In January 1898 Spain promised some concessions to the rebels but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property 131 On February 15 the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed 132 Public opinion and the newspapers demanded war but McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental 133 Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence but on March 20 the court ruled that the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine 134 As pressure for war mounted in Congress McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence 135 Spain refused McKinley s proposals and on April 11 McKinley turned the matter over to Congress He did not ask for war but Congress declared war anyway on April 20 with the addition of the Teller Amendment which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba 136 ",
			"after": " The expansion of the telegraph and the development of the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day to day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed and he used the new technologies to direct the army s and navy s movements as far as he was able 137 McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War and did not get along with the Army s commanding general Nelson A Miles 138 Bypassing them he looked for strategic advice first from Miles s predecessor General John Schofield and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin 138 The war led to a change in McKinley s cabinet as the President accepted Sherman s resignation as Secretary of State Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war s end 139 ",
