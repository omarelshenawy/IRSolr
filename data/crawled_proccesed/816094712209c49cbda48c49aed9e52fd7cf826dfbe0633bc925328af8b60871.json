			"previous": " Although studies showed that turbojet engines are highly desirable for supersonic airliners none were available The Tu 144 prototype was therefore originally fitted with the inefficient Kuznetsov NK 144 turbofan engines and consequently suffered from higher nacelle aerodynamic drag While this permitted early test flights it did not permit cruising at Mach 2 without afterburner A maximum cruising speed of 2 430 km h 1 510 mph 1 310 kn Mach 2 29 was obtained with the afterburner 7 This meant that while Concorde could supercruise maintain supersonic flight without using its afterburners the Tu 144 could not Later work on the Tu 144S resolved this shortcoming 8 The turbofan engines suffered from heavy fuel consumption and hence a limited range of about 2 500 km 1 600 mi 1 300 nmi far less range than the Rolls Royce Snecma Olympus 593 turbojet that powered Concorde ",
			"after": " The Tu 144S model of which nine were produced featured the Kuznetsov NK 144F turbofan engines that offered better fuel efficiency over the original engine The four engines each had a maximum afterburning thrust of 200 kilonewtons 45 000 lbf and each had separate inlet ducts in each nacelle and variable intake ramps in the inlets 9 giving a cruising speed of 2 000 km h 1 200 mph 1 100 kn Mach 1 88 This also gave it a longer range of 3 080 km 1 910 mi 1 660 nmi but still less than half the range of Concorde 10 ",
