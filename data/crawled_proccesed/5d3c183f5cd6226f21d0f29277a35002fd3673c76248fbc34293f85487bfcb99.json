			"previous": " From the last quarter of the 20th century the indispensable tool of the cartographer has been the computer Much of cartography especially at the data gathering survey level has been subsumed by Geographic Information Systems GIS The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps Having local information such as rainfall level distribution of wildlife or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making In the pre electronic age such superimposition of data led Dr John Snow to identify the location of an outbreak of cholera Today it is used by agencies of the human kind as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world ",
