			"after": " Due to its location at the South Pole Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice Precipitation is low most of Antarctica is a desert and almost always in the form of snow which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams which flow towards the edges of the continent Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass Offshore temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling ",
