			"after": " Time dilation is permitted by Albert Einstein s special and general theories of relativity These theories state that relative to a given observer time passes more slowly for bodies moving quickly relative to that observer or bodies that are deeper within a gravity well 60 For example a clock which is moving relative to the observer will be measured to run slow in that observer s rest frame as a clock approaches the speed of light it will almost slow to a stop although it can never quite reach light speed so it will never completely stop For two clocks moving inertially not accelerating relative to one another this effect is reciprocal with each clock measuring the other to be ticking slower However the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates as in the twin paradox where one twin stays on Earth while the other travels into space turns around which involves acceleration and returns in this case both agree the traveling twin has aged less General relativity states that time dilation effects also occur if one clock is deeper in a gravity well than the other with the clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly this effect must be taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the Global Positioning System and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a black hole ",
