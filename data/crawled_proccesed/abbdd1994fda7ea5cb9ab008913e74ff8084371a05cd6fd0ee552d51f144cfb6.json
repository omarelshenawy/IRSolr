			"previous": " The use of slaves declined in the border states and could barely survive in cities and industrial areas it was fading out in cities such as Baltimore Louisville and St Louis so a South based on slavery was rural and non industrial On the other hand as the demand for cotton grew the price of slaves who picked it soared Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war Most historians now disagree with the economic determinism of historian Charles A Beard in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary While socially different the sections economically benefited each other 53 54 ",
			"after": " Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to abolitionism 55 56 Southerners complained that it was the North that was changing and was prone to new isms while the South remained true to historic republican values of the Founding Fathers many of whom owned slaves including Washington Jefferson and Madison Lincoln said that Republicans were following the tradition of the framers of the Constitution including the Northwest Ordinance and the Missouri Compromise by preventing expansion of slavery 57 ",
