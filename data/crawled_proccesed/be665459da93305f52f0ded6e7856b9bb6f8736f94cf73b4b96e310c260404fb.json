			"previous": " Many peoples have no or few taboos on exposure of the breasts but the vulva and pubic triangle are always the first areas to be covered Saartjie Baartman the so called Hottentot Venus who was exhibited in London at the beginning of the nineteenth century was paid to display her large buttocks but she never revealed her vulva Khoisan women were said to have elongated labia leading to questions about and requests to exhibit their sinus pudoris curtain of shame or tablier the French word for apron To quote Stephen Jay Gould The labia minora or inner lips of the ordinary female genitalia are greatly enlarged in Khoi San women and may hang down three or four inches below the vagina when women stand thus giving the impression of a separate and enveloping curtain of skin 5 Baartman never allowed this trait to be exhibited while she was alive 6 ",
			"after": " In some cultures including modern Western culture women have shaved or otherwise depilated part or all of the vulva When high cut swimsuits became fashionable women who wished to wear them would shave the sides of their pubic triangles to avoid exhibiting pubic hair Other women relish the beauty of seeing their vulva with hair or completely hairless and find one or the other more comfortable Depilation of the vulva is a fairly recent phenomenon in the United States Canada and Western Europe but has been prevalent usually in the form of waxing in many Eastern European and Middle Eastern cultures for centuries usually due to the idea that it may be more hygienic or originating in prostitution and pornography Shaving may include all or nearly all of the hair Some styles retain a small amount of hair on either side of the labia or a strip directly above and in line with the pudendal cleft Many people object to pubic shaving which can result in cuts to the vulva and clitoris ingrown hairs pseudofolliculitis barbae razor bumps and folliculitis 7 ",
