			"previous": " An initial design of the logo was created by Paul Stansifer a 17 year old Wikipedia user whose entry won a design competition run by the site in 2003 Another Wikipedia user David Friedland subsequently improved the logo by changing the styling of the jigsaw pieces so that their boundaries seemed indented and simplified their contents to be a single glyph per piece rather than a jumble of nonsensical multilingual text 5 In the process some errors were introduced 5 In particular one piece of Devanagari script and one piece of Japanese katakana were incorrectly rendered 6 ",
			"after": " In 2007 a modified 3D model was developed by Wikimedia Taiwan for Wikimania when they distributed a 3 inch diameter spherical puzzle based on the logo that attendees could piece together It did not add other letters on the parts that cannot be seen on the 2D logo but used that space to include small logos of the sister projects and information about Wikimania A variant of that model was used to build a person sized Wikiball that spun on a stand featured during the event 7 This led to a renewed interest in getting a proper 3D model for the logo ",
