			"previous": " To produce the 767 Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy s Aeritalia and Japan s CTDC 7 The wings and cabin floor were produced in house while Aeritalia provided control surfaces Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage 6 The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies namely Fuji Heavy Industries wing fairings and gear doors Kawasaki Heavy Industries center fuselage and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rear fuselage doors and tail 7 Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory 6 For expedited production of wing spars the main structural member of aircraft wings the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners 6 This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747 6 Final assembly of the first aircraft began on July 6 1979 3 ",
