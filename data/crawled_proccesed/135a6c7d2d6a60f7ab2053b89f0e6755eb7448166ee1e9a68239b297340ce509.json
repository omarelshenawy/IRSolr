			"previous": " Many modern compasses incorporate a baseplate and protractor tool and are referred to variously as orienteering baseplate map compass or protractor designs This type of compass uses a separate magnetized needle inside a rotating capsule an orienting box or gate for aligning the needle with magnetic north a transparent base containing map orienting lines and a bezel outer dial marked in degrees or other units of angular measurement 93 The capsule is mounted in a transparent baseplate containing a direction of travel DOT indicator for use in taking bearings directly from a map 93 ",
			"after": " Other features found on modern orienteering compasses are map and romer scales for measuring distances and plotting positions on maps luminous markings on the face or bezels various sighting mechanisms mirror prism etc for taking bearings of distant objects with greater precision global needles for use in differing hemispheres adjustable declination for obtaining instant true bearings without resort to arithmetic and devices such as clinometers for measuring gradients 93 The sport of orienteering has also resulted in the development of models with extremely fast settling and stable needles for optimal use with a topographic map a land navigation technique known as terrain association 94 ",
