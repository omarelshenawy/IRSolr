			"after": " In Catholic teaching baptism is stated to be necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire 151 This teaching is based on Jesus words in the Gospel according to John Truly truly I say to you unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God Jn 3 5 It dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st century Christians and the connection between salvation and baptism was not on the whole an item of major dispute until Huldrych Zwingli denied the necessity of baptism which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community 18 The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament 17 The Council of Trent also states in the Decree Concerning Justification from session six that baptism is necessary for salvation 152 A person who knowingly willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation However if knowledge is absent those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience 153 ",
