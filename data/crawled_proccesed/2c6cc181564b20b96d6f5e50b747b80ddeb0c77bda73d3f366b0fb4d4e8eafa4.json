			"after": " Edward Wright was an English mathematician and cartographer noted for his book Certaine Errors in Navigation which for the first time explained the mathematical basis of the Mercator projection and set out a reference table giving the linear scale multiplication factor as a function of latitude calculated for each minute of arc up to a latitude of 75 This was the essential step needed to make practical both the making and the navigational use of Mercator charts In 1589 Elizabeth I requested that he carry out navigational studies with an expedition organised by the Earl of Cumberland The expedition s route was the subject of the first map to be prepared according to Wright s projection which was published in Certaine Errors in 1599 The same year Wright created and published the first world map produced in England and the first to use the Mercator projection since Gerardus Mercator s original 1569 map Apart from a number of other books and pamphlets Wright translated John Napier s pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English Wright s work influenced among other persons Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius Adriaan Metius the geometer and astronomer from Holland and the English mathematician Richard Norwood ",
