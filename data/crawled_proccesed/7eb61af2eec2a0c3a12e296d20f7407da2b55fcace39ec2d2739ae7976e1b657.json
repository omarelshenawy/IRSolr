			"previous": " The aircraft went through several alterations in each of its design stages and variants Of the 13 YB 17s ordered for service testing 12 were used by the 2nd Bomb Group of Langley Field Virginia to develop heavy bombing techniques and the 13th was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field Ohio 38 Experiments on this aircraft led to the use of a quartet of turbo superchargers which would become standard on the B 17 line A 14th aircraft the YB 17A originally destined for ground testing only and upgraded with the turbochargers 57 was re designated B 17A after testing had finished 40 41 ",
			"after": " As the production line developed Boeing engineers continued to improve upon the basic design To enhance performance at slower speeds the B 17B was altered to include larger rudder and flaps 50 The B 17C changed from three bulged oval shaped machine gun blisters to two flush oval shaped machine gun window openings and a single bathtub machine gun housing on the lower fuselage 51 that resembled the similarly configured and located ventral defensive emplacement on the German Heinkel He 111P series medium bomber Models A through D of the B 17 were designed defensively while the large tailed B 17E was the first model primarily focused on offensive warfare 57 ",
