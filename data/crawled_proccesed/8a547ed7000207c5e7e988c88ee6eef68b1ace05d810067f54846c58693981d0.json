			"after": " From 1934 through 1985 the finance industry averaged 13 8 of U S domestic corporate profit Between 1986 and 1999 it averaged 23 5 From 2000 through 2010 it averaged 32 6 Some of this increase is doubtless due to increased efficiency from banking consolidation and innovations in new financial products that benefit consumers However if most consumers had refused to accept financial products they did not understand e g negative amortization loans the finance industry would not have been as profitable as it has been and the Late 2000s recession might have been avoided or postponed Stiglitz 19 noted that the Late 2000s recession was created in part because Bankers acted greedily because they had incentives and opportunities to do so They did this in part by innovating to make consumer financial products like retail banking services and home mortgages as complicated as possible to make it easy for them to charge higher fees Consumers who shop carefully for financial services typically find better options than the primary offerings of the major banks However few consumers think to do that This explains part of this increase in financial industry profits ",
