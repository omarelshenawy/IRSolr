			"previous": " The Irish Football Association IFA was originally the governing body for soccer across the island The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s with Cliftonville F C in Belfast being Ireland s oldest club It was most popular especially in its first decades around Belfast and in Ulster However some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team In 1921 following an incident in which despite an earlier promise the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi final replay from Dublin to Belfast 170 Dublin based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State Today the southern association is known as the Football Association of Ireland FAI Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations associations the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 against Italy However both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams Both also referred to their respective teams as Ireland ",
			"after": " In 1950 FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and in 1953 directed that the FAI s team be known only as Republic of Ireland and that the IFA s team be known as Northern Ireland with certain exceptions Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup finals in 1958 reaching the quarter finals 1982 and 1986 The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in 1990 reaching the quarter finals 1994 2002 and the European Championships in 1988 and 2012 Across Ireland there is significant interest in the English and to a lesser extent Scottish soccer leagues ",
