			"previous": " For example the theorem from the plane geometry of triangles about the concurrence of the lines joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side at the centroid or barycenter depends on the notions of mid point and centroid as affine invariants Other examples include the theorems of Ceva and Menelaus ",
			"after": " Familiar formulas such as half the base times the height for the area of a triangle or a third the base times the height for the volume of a pyramid are likewise affine invariants While the latter is less obvious than the former for the general case it is easily seen for the one sixth of the unit cube formed by a face area 1 and the midpoint of the cube height 1 2 Hence it holds for all pyramids even slanting ones whose apex is not directly above the center of the base and those with base a parallelogram instead of a square The formula further generalizes to pyramids whose base can be dissected into parallelograms including cones by allowing infinitely many parallelograms with due attention to convergence The same approach shows that a four dimensional pyramid has 4D volume one quarter the 3D volume of its parallelepiped base times the height and so on for higher dimensions ",
