			"after": " The redback spider is responsible for far more envenomations requiring antivenom than any other creature in Australia 67 Estimates of the number of people thought to be bitten by redback spiders each year across Australia range from 2 000 to 10 000 68 69 The larger female spider is responsible for almost all cases of redback spider bites The smaller male was thought to be unable to envenomate a human although some cases have been reported their rarity is probably due to the male s smaller size and proportionally smaller fangs rather than the male being incapable of biting or lacking potent venom 70 The bite from both juvenile and mature females appear to have similar potency The male bite usually only produces short lived mild pain 70 Most bites occur in the warmer months between December and April in the afternoon or evening 70 71 As the female redback is slow moving and rarely leaves her web bites generally occur as a result of placing a hand or other body part too close to the web such as when reaching into dark holes or wall cavities Bites often also occur when a hidden spider is disturbed in objects such as clothes shoes gloves building materials or garden tools 72 73 ",
