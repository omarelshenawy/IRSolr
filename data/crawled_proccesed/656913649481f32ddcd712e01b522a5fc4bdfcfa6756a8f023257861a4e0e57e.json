			"previous": " While articles in the Uzbek Wikipedia are written using the Latin script historically the Uzbek language has used many different alphabets Before 1928 Uzbek was written in an Arabic based alphabet by the literate population Between 1928 and 1940 it was written in a Latin alphabet which was different from the Latin alphabet that is used today Starting from 1940 Uzbek began to be written in the Cyrillic alphabet which remained the predominant form of writing until 1993 ",
			"after": " A new Latin alphabet was introduced to Uzbek after Uzbekistan gained independence from the USSR Currently the Latin script is used in school and university textbooks some newspapers and in some official papers Since 2004 some official websites have switched over to using the Latin script when writing in Uzbek However the use of Cyrillic is still widespread especially among older Uzbeks and among Uzbeks who live in other countries ",
