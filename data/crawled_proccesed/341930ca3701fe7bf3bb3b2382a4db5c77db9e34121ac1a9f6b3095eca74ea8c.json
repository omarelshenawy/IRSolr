			"previous": " This process continues today Due to their position jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean the Cape and islands are subject to massive coastal erosion Geologists say that due to erosion the Cape will be completely submerged by the sea in thousands of years 18 This erosion causes the washout of beaches and the destruction of the barrier islands for example the ocean broke through the barrier island at Chatham during Hurricane Bob in 1991 allowing waves and storm surges to hit the coast with no obstruction Consequently the sediment and sand from the beaches is being washed away and deposited elsewhere While this destroys land in some places it creates land elsewhere most noticeably in marshes where sediment is deposited by waters running through them ",
