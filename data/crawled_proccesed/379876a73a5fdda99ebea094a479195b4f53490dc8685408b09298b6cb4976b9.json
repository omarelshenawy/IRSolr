			"previous": " The surface area relative to the mass of a sphere is called the specific surface area and can be expressed from the above stated equations as The sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area The sphere therefore appears in nature for example bubbles and small water drops are roughly spherical because the surface tension locally minimizes surface area ",
			"after": " where is the ratio of mass to volume  A sphere can also be defined as the surface formed by rotating a circle about any diameter Replacing the circle with an ellipse rotated about its major axis the shape becomes a prolate spheroid rotated about the minor axis an oblate spheroid ",
