			"after": " In 1983 Columbia under the command of John Young on what was his sixth spaceflight undertook its second operational mission STS 9 in which the Spacelab science laboratory and a six person crew was carried including the first non American astronaut on a space shuttle Ulf Merbold After the flight Columbia spent 18 months at the Rockwell Palmdale facility beginning in January 1984 undergoing modifications that removed the Orbiter Flight Test hardware and bringing it up to similar specifications as that of its sister orbiters At that time the shuttle fleet was expanded to include Discovery and Atlantis ",
