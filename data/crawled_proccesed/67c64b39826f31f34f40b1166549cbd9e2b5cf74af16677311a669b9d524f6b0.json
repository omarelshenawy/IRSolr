			"previous": " A side effect of too much dihedral effect caused by excessive dihedral angle among other things can be yaw roll coupling a tendency for an aircraft to Dutch roll This can be unpleasant to experience or in extreme conditions it can lead to loss of control or can overstress an aircraft ",
			"after": " Military fighter aircraft often have near zero or even negative dihedral angle reducing dihedral effect and hence reducing the stability of the spiral mode This increases maneuverability which is desirable in fighter type aircraft ",
