			"previous": " In November 1879 Gilbert Sullivan and Carte sailed to America with a company of strong singers to play both Pinafore and the new opera including J H Ryley as Sir Joseph Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup Furneaux Cook as Dick Deadeye Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe some of whom had been in the Pinafore cast in London 19 To these he added some American singers including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran 20 Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan while his brother Fran ois remained in London to conduct Pinafore there 21 Gilbert and Sullivan chose talented actors who were not well known stars did not command high fees They then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers 22 The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience as critic Herman Klein wrote we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which the Gilbertian quips and absurdities were said and done For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird eccentric yet intensely human beings They conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight 23 Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas He sought naturalism in acting which was unusual at the time just as he strove for realistic visual elements He deprecated self conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes 24 Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals 25 ",
			"after": " The composition of the music for Pirates was unusual in that Sullivan wrote the music for the acts in reverse intending to bring the completed Act II with him to New York with Act I existing only in sketches When he arrived in New York however he found that he had left the sketches behind and he had to reconstruct the first act from memory 26 Gilbert told a correspondent many years later that Sullivan was unable to recall his setting of the entrance of the women s chorus so they substituted the chorus Climbing over rocky mountain from their earlier opera Thespis 27 Sullivan s manuscript for Pirates contains pages removed from a Thespis score with the vocal parts of this chorus altered from their original arrangement as a four part chorus Some scholars e g Tillett and Spencer 2000 have suggested that Gilbert and Sullivan had planned all along to re use Climbing over rocky mountain and perhaps other parts of Thespis arguing that the presence of the unpublished Thespis score in New York when there were no plans to revive it might not have been accidental In any case on 10 December 1879 Sullivan wrote a letter to his mother about the new opera upon which he was hard at work in New York I think it will be a great success for it is exquisitely funny and the music is strikingly tuneful and catching 19 As was to be his usual practice in his later operas Sullivan left the overture for the last moment sketching it out and entrusting it to the company s music director in this case Alfred Cellier to complete 25 ",
