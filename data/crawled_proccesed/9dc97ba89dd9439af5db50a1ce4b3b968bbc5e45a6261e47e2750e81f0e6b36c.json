			"previous": " Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings the effectiveness of educational interventions the psychology of teaching and the social psychology of schools as organizations Although the terms educational psychology and school psychology are often used interchangeably researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as educational psychologists whereas practitioners in schools or school related settings are identified as school psychologists Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities ",
			"after": " Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines It is informed primarily by psychology bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies including instructional design educational technology curriculum development organizational learning special education and classroom management Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences In universities departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks Lucas Blazek Raley 2006 ",
