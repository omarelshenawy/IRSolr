			"previous": " Cubic equations were known to the ancient Babylonians Greeks Chinese Indians and Egyptians 2 3 4 Babylonian 20th to 16th centuries BC cuneiform tablets have been found with tables for calculating cubes and cube roots 5 6 The Babylonians could have used the tables to solve cubic equations but no evidence exists to confirm that they did 7 The problem of doubling the cube involves the simplest and oldest studied cubic equation and one for which the ancient Egyptians did not believe a solution existed 8 In the 5th century BC Hippocrates reduced this problem to that of finding two mean proportionals between one line and another of twice its length but could not solve this with a compass and straightedge construction 9 a task which is now known to be impossible Methods for solving cubic equations appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art a Chinese mathematical text compiled around the 2nd century BC and commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century 3 In the 3rd century the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus found integer or rational solutions for some bivariate cubic equations Diophantine equations 4 10 Hippocrates Menaechmus and Archimedes are believed to have come close to solving the problem of doubling the cube using intersecting conic sections 9 though historians such as Reviel Netz dispute whether the Greeks were thinking about cubic equations or just problems that can lead to cubic equations Some others like T L Heath who translated all Archimedes works disagree putting forward evidence that Archimedes really solved cubic equations using intersections of two cones but also discussed the conditions where the roots are 0 1 or 2 11 ",
