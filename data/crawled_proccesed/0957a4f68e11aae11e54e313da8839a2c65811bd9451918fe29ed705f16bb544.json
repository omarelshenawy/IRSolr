			"previous": " After Dickinson s death Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet s correspondence Significantly though Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest 124 Lavinia recognized the poems worth and became obsessed with seeing them published 125 She turned first to her brother s wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd her brother s mistress for assistance 116 A feud ensued with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses preventing complete publication of Dickinson s poetry for more than half a century 126 ",
			"after": " The first volume of Dickinson s Poems edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T W Higginson appeared in November 1890 127 Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th century standards with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson s obliquity 128 The first 115 poem volume was a critical and financial success going through eleven printings in two years 127 Poems Second Series followed in 1891 running to five editions by 1893 a third series appeared in 1896 One reviewer in 1892 wrote The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings letters as well as literature has been published 129 ",
