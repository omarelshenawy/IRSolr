			"previous": " Only July 1 the system s circulation became broad with most of the convection located west of the center 3 The next day Chataan briefly weakened to an intensity of 85 km h 50 mph although it began strengthening steadily on July 3 6 when its center passed very near Weno in Chuck State in the FSM At 1800 UTC that night the JTWC upgraded Chataan to a typhoon 3 and about 24 hours later the JMA followed suit while the storm was approaching Guam from the southeast 6 At about 2130 UTC on July 4 the eye of Chataan moved across northern Guam in about two hours although the center of the eye passed north of the island 3 ",
			"after": " After affecting Guam Chataan continued toward the northwest and gradually intensified At 0000 UTC on July 8 the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 175 km h 110 mph 10 minute sustained while located near the Japanese island of Okinotorishima 6 The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240 km h 150 mph 1 minute sustained about six hours earlier on that basis the agency classified the system as a super typhoon On July 8 Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18 hours 5 On July 9 the typhoon turned to the northeast and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm At around 1530 UTC on July 10 Chataan made landfall on the B s Peninsula in Honshu with winds of about 100 km h 65 mph 10 minute sustained The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern Hokkaido at 1200 UTC on July 11 6 this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28 years 7 A few hours later Chataan became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Okhotsk where the remnants stalled before dissipating on July 13 near Sakhalin 6 ",
