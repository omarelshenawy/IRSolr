			"previous": " In January 1703 shortly after graduating from St Michael s and being turned down for the post of organist at Sangerhausen 21 Bach was appointed court musician in the chapel of Duke Johann Ernst III in Weimar 22 His role there is unclear but likely included menial non musical duties During his seven month tenure at Weimar his reputation as a keyboardist spread so much that he was invited to inspect the new organ and give the inaugural recital at St Boniface s Church in Arnstadt located about 30 kilometres 19 mi southwest of Weimar 23 In August 1703 he became the organist at St Boniface s with light duties a relatively generous salary and a fine new organ tuned in the modern tempered system that allowed a wide range of keys to be used ",
			"after": " Despite strong family connections and a musically enthusiastic employer tension built up between Bach and the authorities after several years in the post Bach was dissatisfied with the standard of singers in the choir while his employer was upset by his unauthorised absence from Arnstadt Bach was gone for several months in 1705 06 to visit the great organist and composer Dieterich Buxtehude and his Abendmusiken at St Mary s Church in the northern city of L beck The visit to Buxtehude involved a 450 kilometre 280 mi journey each way reportedly on foot 24 ",
