			"previous": " Boulton spent much time in London lobbying for a contract to strike British coins but in June 1790 the Pitt Government postponed a decision on recoinage indefinitely 77 Meanwhile the Soho Mint struck coins for the East India Company Sierra Leone and Russia while producing high quality planchets or blank coins to be struck by national mints elsewhere 70 The firm sent over 20 million blanks to Philadelphia to be struck into cents and half cents by the United States Mint 78 Mint Director Elias Boudinot found them to be perfect and beautifully polished 70 The high technology Soho Mint gained increasing and somewhat unwelcome attention rivals attempted industrial espionage while lobbying for Boulton s mint to be shut down 70 ",
			"after": " The national financial crisis reached its nadir in February 1797 when the Bank of England stopped redeeming its bills for gold In an effort to get more money into circulation the Government adopted a plan to issue large quantities of copper coins and Lord Hawkesbury summoned Boulton to London on 3 March 1797 informing him of the Government s plan Four days later Boulton attended a meeting of the Privy Council and was awarded a contract at the end of the month 78 According to a proclamation dated 26 July 1797 King George III was graciously pleased to give directions that measures might be taken for an immediate supply of such copper coinage as might be best adapted to the payment of the laborious poor in the present exigency which should go and pass for one penny and two pennies 79 The proclamation required that the coins weigh one and two ounces respectively bringing the intrinsic value of the coins close to their face value 79 Boulton made efforts to frustrate counterfeiters Designed by Heinrich K chler the coins featured a raised rim with incuse or sunken letters and numbers features difficult for counterfeiters to match 70 The twopenny coins measured exactly an inch and a half across 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet 70 The exact measurements and weights made it easy to detect lightweight counterfeits K chler also designed proportionate halfpennies and farthings these were not authorised by the proclamation and though pattern pieces were struck they never officially entered circulation The halfpenny measured ten to a foot the farthing 12 to a foot 70 The coins were nicknamed cartwheels both because of the size of the twopenny coin and in reference to the broad rims of both denominations 80 The penny was the first of its denomination to be struck in copper 81 ",
