			"after": " When all the time derivatives of a flow field vanish the flow is considered to be a steady flow Steady state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time Otherwise flow is called unsteady also called transient 5 Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady can depend on the chosen frame of reference For instance laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow the flow is unsteady ",
