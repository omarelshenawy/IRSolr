			"previous": " Arriving at New York Harbor Bartholdi focused on Bedloe s Island as a site for the statue struck by the fact that vessels arriving in New York had to sail past it He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States government it had been ceded by the New York State Legislature in 1800 for harbor defense It was thus as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye land common to all the states 13 As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers Bartholdi visited President Ulysses S Grant who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue 14 Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail and met many Americans he felt would be sympathetic to the project 12 But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign 15 ",
			"after": " Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870 16 The son of a friend of Bartholdi s American artist John LaFarge later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his U S visit at La Farge s Rhode Island studio Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France 16 He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians One of these was the Lion of Belfort a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of Belfort which during the war had resisted a Prussian siege for over three months The defiant lion 73 feet 22 m long and half that in height displays an emotional quality characteristic of Romanticism which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty 17 ",
