			"after": " After the 1953 disaster the Delta Works were constructed a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering New projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the Delta Works A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10 000 years compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country This was achieved by raising 3 000 kilometres 1 864 mi of outer sea dykes and 10 000 kilometres 6 214 mi of inner canal and river dikes and by closing off the sea estuaries of the Zeeland province New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dyke reinforcements The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world 72 ",
