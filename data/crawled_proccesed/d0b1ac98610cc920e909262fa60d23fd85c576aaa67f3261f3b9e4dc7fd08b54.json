			"previous": " On 22 June the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus known as Operation Bagration that resulted in the almost complete destruction of the German Army Group Centre 239 Soon after that another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland The successful advance of Soviet troops prompted resistance forces in Poland to initiate several uprisings Though the largest of these in Warsaw where German soldiers massacred 200 000 civilians as well as a national Slovak Uprising in the south did not receive Soviet support and were put down by German forces 240 The Red Army s strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d tat in Romania and in Bulgaria followed by those countries shift to the Allied side 241 ",
			"after": " In September 1944 Soviet Red Army troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of the German Army Groups E and F in Greece Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off 242 By this point the Communist led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941 controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and were engaged in delaying efforts against the German forces further south In northern Serbia the Red Army with limited support from Bulgarian forces assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October A few days later the Soviets launched a massive assault against German occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945 243 In contrast with impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans the bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to the signing of Soviet Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions 244 245 with a subsequent shift to the Allied side by Finland ",
