			"previous": " In response to this situation the government which controlled all official foreign trade continued to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels resulting in a growing black market and the development of a shortage economy 18 The only way for an individual to buy most Western goods was to use Western currencies notably the U S dollar which in effect became a parallel currency However it could not simply be exchanged at the official banks for Polish z otys since the government exchange rate undervalued the dollar and placed heavy restrictions on the amount that could be exchanged and so the only practical way to obtain it was from remittances or work outside the country An entire illegal industry of street corner money changers emerged as a result The so called Cinkciarze gave clients far better than official exchange rate and became wealthy from their opportunism albeit at the risk of punishment usually diminished by the wide scale bribery of Milicja communist police 16 ",
			"after": " As Western currency came into the country from emigrant families and foreign workers the government in turn attempted to gather it up by various means most visibly by establishing a chain of state run Pewex and Baltona stores in all Polish cities where goods could only be bought with hard currency It even introduced its own ersatz U S currency bony PeKaO in Polish 16 This paralleled the financial practices in East Germany running its own ration stamps at the same time 16 The trend led to an unhealthy state of affairs where the chief determinant of economic status was access to hard currency This situation was incompatible with any remaining ideals of socialism which were soon completely abandoned at the community level ",
