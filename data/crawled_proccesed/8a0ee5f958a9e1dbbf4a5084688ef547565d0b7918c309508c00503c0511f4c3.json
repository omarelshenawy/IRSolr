			"after": " While the 1976 renovations prolonged the life of the 1930s market by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit The walkways themselves already narrow were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing Removable shutters used to secure the stalls overnight were stacked against the sides of the stalls during trading hours causing further obstruction while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units In addition the floors of stalls followed the slope of the hill a gradient of about 1 12 causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day 61 Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market 62 ",
