			"previous": " Though the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union this was never likely and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators 210 211 The Union under Lincoln and Secretary of State William H Seward worked to block this and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America In 1861 Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton but this did not work 212 Worse Europe developed other cotton suppliers which they found superior hindering the South s recovery after the war ",
			"after": " Cotton diplomacy proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton while the 1860 62 crop failures in Europe made the North s grain exports of critical importance It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy It was said that King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton as U S grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half 212 When Britain did face a cotton shortage it was temporary being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India Meanwhile the war created employment for arms makers ironworkers and British ships to transport weapons 213 ",
