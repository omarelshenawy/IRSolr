			"previous": " Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural models and spurring or enabling generative action These social shifts may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change For example the U S feminist movement involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations altering both gender and economic structures Environmental conditions may also enter as factors For example after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice age plants suitable for domestication were available leading to the invention of agriculture which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics 6 ",
			"after": " Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies which may also produce or inhibit social shifts and changes in cultural practices War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics Additionally cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another through diffusion or acculturation In diffusion the form of something though not necessarily its meaning moves from one culture to another For example hamburgers fast food in the United States seemed exotic when introduced into China Stimulus diffusion the sharing of ideas refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another Direct Borrowing on the other hand tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another Diffusion of innovations theory presents a research based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas practices and products ",
