			"previous": " In a hang glider the shape of the wing is determined by a structure and it is this that distinguishes them from the other main type of foot launched aircraft paragliders technically Class 3 Some hang gliders have engines and are known as powered hang gliders Due to their commonality of parts construction and design they are usually considered by aviation authorities to be hang gliders even though they may use the engine for the entire flight Some flexible wing powered aircraft Ultralight trikes have a wheeled undercarriage and so are not hang gliders ",
