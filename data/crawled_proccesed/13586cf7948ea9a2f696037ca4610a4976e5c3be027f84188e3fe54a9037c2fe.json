			"previous": " In 1922 six U S states in the Colorado River basin signed the Colorado River Compact which divided half of the river s flow to both the Upper Basin the drainage area above Lee s Ferry comprising parts of Colorado New Mexico Utah and Wyoming and a small portion of Arizona and the Lower Basin Arizona California Nevada and parts of New Mexico and Utah Each was given rights to 7 5 million acre feet 9 3 km3 of water per year a figure believed to represent half of the river s minimum flow at Lee s Ferry 193 This was followed by a U S Mexico treaty in 1944 allocating 1 5 million acre feet 1 9 km3 of Colorado River water to the latter country per annum 194 Arizona refused to ratify the Colorado River Compact in 1922 because it feared that California would take too much of the lower basin allotment in 1944 a compromise was reached in which Arizona would get a firm allocation of 2 8 million acre feet 3 5 km3 but only if California s 4 4 million acre foot 5 4 km3 allocation was prioritized during drought years 195 These and nine other decisions compacts federal acts and agreements made between 1922 and 1973 form what is now known as the Law of the River 195 196 ",
