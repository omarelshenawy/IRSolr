			"previous": " In 2004 a stalemate in federal support of Amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as resumption of deferred maintenance In fiscal 2004 and 2005 Congress appropriated about 1 2 billion for Amtrak 300 million more than President George W Bush had requested However the company s board requested 1 8 billion through fiscal 2006 the majority of which about 1 3 billion would be used to bring infrastructure rolling stock and motive power back to a state of good repair In Congressional testimony the DOT Inspector General confirmed that Amtrak would need at least 1 4 billion to 1 5 billion in fiscal 2006 and 2 billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo In 2006 Amtrak received just under 1 4 billion with the condition that Amtrak would reduce but not eliminate food and sleeper service losses Thus dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on board service workers Only Auto Train and Empire Builder services continue regular made on board meal service In 2010 the Senate approved a bill to provide 1 96 billion to Amtrak but cut the approval for high speed rail to a 1 billion appropriation 122 ",
