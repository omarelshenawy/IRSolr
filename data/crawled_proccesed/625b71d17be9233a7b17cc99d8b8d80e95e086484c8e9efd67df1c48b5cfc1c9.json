			"previous": " Astronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part About 90 of all matter appears to be so called dark matter which has mass or equivalently gravitational influence but does not interact electromagnetically and hence cannot be observed directly 123 There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter within the framework of known particle physics 124 or otherwise 125 Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or equivalently by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state known as dark energy the nature of which remains unclear 126 ",
