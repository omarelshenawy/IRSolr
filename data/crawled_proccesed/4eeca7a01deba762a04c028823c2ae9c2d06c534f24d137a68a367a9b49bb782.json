			"previous": " This alcid typically fed in shoaling waters which were shallower than those frequented by other alcids 45 although after the breeding season they had been sighted up to 500 kilometres 310 mi from land 45 They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks 45 Their main food was fish usually 12 to 20 centimetres 4 7 to 7 9 in in length and weighing 40 to 50 grams 1 4 to 1 8 oz but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird s own length The bird could on average dive up to 75 metres 246 ft for its prey with the maximum dive depth being estimated at 130 metres 430 ft however to conserve energy most dives were shallower 45 Its ability to dive this deeply reduced competition with other alcid species Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favored prey 46 Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers shorthorn sculpins cod crustaceans and sand lance 44 45 The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and possibly fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adult auks 36 42 ",
			"after": " Historical descriptions of the great auk s breeding behaviour are somewhat unreliable 47 Great auks began pairing in early and mid May 48 They are believed to have mated for life although some theorize that auks could have mated outside of their pair a trait seen in the Razorbill 31 42 Once paired they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies where they likely copulated 21 31 Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads showing off their white eye patch bill markings and yellow mouth 31 These colonies were extremely crowded and dense with some estimates stating that there was a nesting auk for every 1 square metre 11 sq ft of land 31 These colonies were very social 31 When the colonies included other species of alcid the great auks were dominant due to their size 31 ",
