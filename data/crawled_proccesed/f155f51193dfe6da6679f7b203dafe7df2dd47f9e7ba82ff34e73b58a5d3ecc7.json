			"previous": " The Vanuatu group of islands first had contact with Europeans in 1606 when the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queir s working for the Spanish Crown arrived on the largest island and called the group of islands La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo or The Southern Land of the Holy Spirit He thought he had arrived in Terra Australis or Australia Europeans did not return until 1768 when Louis Antoine de Bougainville rediscovered the islands In 1774 Captain Cook named the islands the New Hebrides a name that would last until independence in 1980 11 ",
			"after": " In 1825 the trader Peter Dillon discovered sandalwood on the island of Erromango which began a rush of immigrants that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrants and Polynesian workers During the 1860s planters in Australia Fiji New Spain and the Samoan Islands in need of labourers encouraged a long term indentured labour trade called blackbirding At the height of the labour trade more than one half of the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad Fragmentary evidence indicates that the current population of Vanuatu is greatly reduced compared to pre contact times 11 ",
