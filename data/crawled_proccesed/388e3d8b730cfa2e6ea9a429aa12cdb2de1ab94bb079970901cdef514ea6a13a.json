			"after": " Modern compasses usually use a magnetized needle or dial inside a capsule completely filled with a liquid lamp oil mineral oil white spirits purified kerosene or ethyl alcohol is common While older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude some modern liquid compasses utilize smaller housings and or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result 91 The liquid inside the capsule serves to damp the movement of the needle reducing oscillation time and increasing stability Key points on the compass including the north end of the needle are often marked with phosphorescent photoluminescent or self luminous materials 92 to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light As the compass fill liquid is noncompressible under pressure many ordinary liquid filled compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths ",
