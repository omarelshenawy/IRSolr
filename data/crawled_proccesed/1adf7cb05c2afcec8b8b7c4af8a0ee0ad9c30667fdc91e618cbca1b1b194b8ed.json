			"previous": " Conchology is the scientific study of mollusc shells but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes There are many private and public collections of mollusc shells but the largest one in the world is at the Smithsonian Institution which houses in excess of 20 million specimens 98 ",
			"after": " Shells are used decoratively in many ways They can be pressed into concrete or plaster to make decorative paths steps or walls and can be used to embellish picture frames mirrors or other craft items They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations utensils scrapers and cutting implements Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32 000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia In this region shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials 99 ",
