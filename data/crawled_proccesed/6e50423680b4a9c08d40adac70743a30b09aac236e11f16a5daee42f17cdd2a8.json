			"previous": " Other human factors have led to declines and even extinctions in seabird populations colonies and species Of these perhaps the most serious are introduced species Seabirds breeding predominantly on small isolated islands have lost many predator defence behaviours 38 Feral cats are capable of taking seabirds as large as albatrosses and many introduced rodents such as the Pacific rat can take eggs hidden in burrows Introduced goats cattle rabbits and other herbivores can lead to problems particularly when species need vegetation to protect or shade their young 56 Disturbance of breeding colonies by humans is often a problem as well visitors even well meaning tourists can flush brooding adults off a colony leaving chicks and eggs vulnerable to predators ",
			"after": " The build up of toxins and pollutants in seabirds is also a concern Seabirds being apex predators suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned among other effects DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California 57 Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil causing them to lose their waterproofing 58 Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations ",
