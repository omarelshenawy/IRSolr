			"after": " Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are primarily legislation especially codifications in constitutions or statutes passed by government and custom 71 Codifications date back millennia with one early example being the Babylonian Codex Hammurabi Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th century Eastern Roman Empire whose texts were rediscovered by late medieval Western Europe Roman law in the days of the Roman Republic and Empire was heavily procedural and lacked a professional legal class 72 Instead a lay magistrate iudex was chosen to adjudicate Decisions were not published in any systematic way so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised 73 Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State which mirrors the theoretical unimportance of judges decisions for future cases in civil law systems today From 529 534 AD the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point so that what remained was one twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before 74 This became known as the Corpus Juris Civilis As one legal historian wrote Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before 75 The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the Byzantine Empire Western Europe meanwhile relied on a mix of the Theodosian Code and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century and scholars at the University of Bologna used it to interpret their own laws 76 Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law alongside some influences from religious laws such as canon law continued to spread throughout Europe until the Enlightenment then in the 19th century both France with the Code Civil and Germany with the B rgerliches Gesetzbuch modernised their legal codes Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe e g Greece but also the Japanese and Korean legal traditions 77 78 Today countries that have civil law systems range from Russia and China to most of Central and Latin America 79 With the exception of Louisiana s Civil Code the United States follows the common law system described below ",
