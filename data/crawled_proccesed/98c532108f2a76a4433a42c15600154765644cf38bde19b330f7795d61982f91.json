			"previous": " House mice use both audible and ultrasonic calls in a variety of contexts Audible vocalisations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest 46 ",
			"after": " Laboratory rats which are brown rats Rattus norvegicus emit short high frequency ultrasonic vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough and tumble play when anticipating routine doses of morphine during mating and when tickled The vocalization described as a distinct chirping has been likened to laughter and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding In clinical studies the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings and social bonding occurs with the tickler resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling However as the rats age the tendency to chirp declines Like most rat vocalizations the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment so bat detectors have been used for this purpose 55 ",
