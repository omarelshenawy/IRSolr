			"after": " The Spanish described the Tequesta as greatly feared by their sailors who suspected the natives of torturing and killing survivors of shipwrecks Spanish priests wrote that the Tequesta performed child sacrifices to mark the occasion of making peace with a tribe with whom they had been fighting Like the Calusa the Tequesta hunted small game but depended more upon roots and less on shellfish in their diets They did not practice cultivated agriculture They were skilled canoeists and hunted in the open ocean for what Fontaneda described as whales but were probably manatees They lassoed the manatees and drove a stake through their snouts 23 34 ",
