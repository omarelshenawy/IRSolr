			"after": " The facility did not experience significant flooding during Hurricane Katrina due to a natural ridge that runs along its northwestern boundary the levee that makes up the southern and eastern boundaries and the work of the pump operators who stayed to protect the facility during the storm There was wind damage and rain water damage to several buildings All shifts were initially canceled up to September 26 2005 potentially setting back future Shuttle flights All the buildings and the shuttle hardware within survived the hurricane without grave damage but the roof of the main building was breached and debris damaged ET 122 stored inside that tank was refurbished and later flew on the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour STS 134 On September 16 2005 NASA announced that the repairs were progressing faster than anticipated 5 and so they would continue to use Michoud for external tank work ",
