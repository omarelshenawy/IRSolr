			"previous": " The close similarities between Gorgosaurus libratus and Albertosaurus sarcophagus have led many experts to combine them into one genus over the years Albertosaurus was named first so by convention it is given priority over the name Gorgosaurus which is sometimes considered its junior synonym William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown doubted the distinction of the two genera as early as 1922 15 Gorgosaurus libratus was formally reassigned to Albertosaurus as Albertosaurus libratus by Dale Russell in 1970 1 and many subsequent authors followed his lead 12 16 Combining the two greatly expands the geographical and chronological range of the genus Albertosaurus Other experts maintain the two genera as separate 2 Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie claims there are as many anatomical differences between Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus as there are between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus which are almost always kept separate He also notes that undescribed tyrannosaurids discovered in Alaska New Mexico and elsewhere in North America may help clarify the situation 5 Gregory S Paul has suggested that Gorgosaurus libratus is ancestral to Albertosaurus sarcophagus 17 ",
