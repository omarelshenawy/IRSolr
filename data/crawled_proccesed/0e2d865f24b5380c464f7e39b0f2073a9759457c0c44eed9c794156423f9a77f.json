			"previous": " As T1 increases along the SOT plateau the engines will throttle back causing both a decrease in corrected airflow and overall pressure ratio As shown the chart implies a common T3 limit for both the low and high design T1 cycles Roughly speaking the T3 limit will correspond to a common overall pressure ratio at the T3 breakpoint Although both cycles will increase throttle setting as T1 decreases the low design T1 cycle has a greater spool up before hitting the corrected speed limit Consequently the low design T1 cycle has a higher design overall pressure ratio 13 ",
