			"previous": " During the Interregnum however squatters had occupied Windsor Castle As a result the King s house was a wreck the fanatic the pilferer and the squatter having been at work Paupers had squatted in many of the towers and cabinets 149 Shortly after returning to England Charles appointed Prince Rupert one of his few surviving close relatives to be the Constable of Windsor Castle in 1668 150 Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle s defences repairing the Round Tower and reconstructing the real tennis court 151 Charles attempted to restock Windsor Great Park with deer brought over from Germany but the herds never recovered their pre war size 144 Rupert created apartments for himself in the Round Tower decorated with an extraordinary number of weapons and armour with his inner chambers hung with tapisserie curious and effeminate pictures 152 ",
			"after": " Charles was heavily influenced by the works of Louis XIV of France imitating French design at his palace at Winchester and the Royal Hospital at Chelsea 153 At Windsor Charles created the most extravagantly Baroque interiors ever executed in England 153 Much of the building work was paid for out of increased royal revenues from Ireland during the 1670s 154 French court etiquette at the time required a substantial number of enfiladed rooms to satisfy court protocol the demand for space forced May to expand out into the North Terrace rebuilding and widening it in the process 155 This new building was called the Star Building because Charles II placed a huge gilt Garter star on the side of it 155 May took down and rebuilt the walls of Edward III s hall and chapel incorporating larger windows but retaining the height and dimensions of the medieval building 155 Although Windsor Castle was now big enough to hold the entire court it was not built with chambers for the King s Council as would be found in Whitehall 156 Instead Charles took advantage of the good road links emerging around Windsor to hold his council meetings at Hampton Court when he was staying at the castle 156 The result became an exemplar for royal buildings for the next twenty five years 157 The result of May s work showed a medievalist leaning although sometimes criticised for its dullness May s reconstruction was both sympathetic to the existing castle and a deliberate attempt to create a slightly austere 17th century version of a neo Norman castle 158 ",
