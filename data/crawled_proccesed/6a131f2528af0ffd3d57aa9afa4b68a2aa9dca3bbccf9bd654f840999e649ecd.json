			"previous": " Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time the largest complete specimen located at the Field Museum of National History and known colloquially as FMNH PR2081 and nicknamed Sue measured 12 3 metres 40 ft long 3 and was 4 metres 13 ft tall at the hips 4 Mass estimates have varied widely over the years from more than 7 2 metric tons 7 9 short tons 10 to less than 4 5 metric tons 5 0 short tons 11 12 with most modern estimates ranging between 5 4 metric tons 6 0 short tons and 6 8 metric tons 7 5 short tons 5 13 14 15 One study in 2011 found that the maximum weight of Sue the largest Tyrannosaurus was between 9 5 and 18 5 metric tons 9 3 18 2 long tons 10 5 20 4 short tons though the authors stated that their upper and lower estimates were based on models with wide error bars and that they consider them to be too skinny too fat or too disproportionate 3 Packard et al 2009 tested dinosaur mass estimation procedures on elephants and concluded that those of dinosaurs are flawed and produce over estimations thus the weight of Tyrannosaurus could have been much less than previously thought 16 Other estimations have concluded that the largest known Tyrannosaurus specimens had masses approaching 17 or exceeding 9 tonnes 3 18 19 ",
			"after": " The neck of Tyrannosaurus rex formed a natural S shaped curve like that of other theropods but was short and muscular to support the massive head The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers 20 along with an additional small metacarpal representing the remnant of a third digit 21 In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod The tail was heavy and long sometimes containing over forty vertebrae in order to balance the massive head and torso To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow reducing its weight without significant loss of strength 20 ",
