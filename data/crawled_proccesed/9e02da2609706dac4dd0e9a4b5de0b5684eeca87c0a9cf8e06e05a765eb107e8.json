			"previous": " A number of ancient cultures used lodestones suspended so they could turn as magnetic compasses for navigation Early mechanical compasses are referenced in written records of the Chinese who began using it for navigation sometime between the 9th and 11th century some time before 1050 possibly as early as 850 19 A common theory by historians 19 20 suggests that the Arabs introduced the compass from China to Europe although current textual evidence only supports the fact that Chinese use of the navigational compass preceded that of Europe and the Middle East 3 Some scholars suggested the compass was transmitted from China to Europe and Arabs via Indian Ocean 21 ",
			"after": " There is disagreement as to exactly when the compass was invented These are noteworthy Chinese literary references in evidence for its antiquity  Thus the use of a magnetic compass by the military for land navigation occurred sometime before 1044 but incontestable evidence for the use of the compass as a maritime navigational device did not appear until 1117 ",
