			"previous": " The use of sequences of photographs in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s Eadweard Muybridge created the first animated image sequences photographed in real time A row of cameras was used each in turn capturing one image on a glass photographic plate so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras about two dozen at most Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects Hand painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his zoopraxiscope 5 ",
			"after": " By the end of the 1880s the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a peep show device such as the Kinetoscope Others were intended for a projector mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these moving pictures could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience The first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at Koster and Bial s Music Hall in New York City on the 23rd of April 1896 ",
