			"previous": " In the late 1980s increasing airline hub congestion and the onset of U S airport noise regulations fueled a turnaround in 757 sales 39 From 1988 to 1989 airlines placed 322 orders including a combined 160 orders from American Airlines and United Airlines 39 51 By this time the 757 had become commonplace on short haul domestic flights and transcontinental services in the U S 50 and had replaced aging 707s 727s Douglas DC 8s and McDonnell Douglas DC 9s 52 The 757 200 s maximum range of 3 900 nautical miles 7 220 km 28 which was over one and a half times the 727 s 18 allowed airlines to use the aircraft on longer nonstop routes 53 The 757 was also flown out of airports with stringent noise regulations such as John Wayne Airport in Orange County California 54 and airports with aircraft size restrictions such as Washington National Airport near downtown Washington D C 11 The largest U S operators Delta Air Lines and American Airlines would ultimately operate fleets of over 100 aircraft each 50 ",
			"after": " In Europe British Airways Iberia and Icelandair were the 757 s largest mainline customers 55 while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as too large for their narrow body aircraft needs 43 Many European charter airlines including Air 2000 Air Holland and LTU International 45 also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s 50 52 In Asia where even bigger aircraft were commonly preferred because of large passenger volumes the 757 found fewer orders 56 A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines 45 57 and the first Asian customer Singapore Airlines sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240 seat wide body Airbus A310 just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes 58 The 757 fared better in China where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China CAAC in 1987 50 orders grew to 59 aircraft making it the largest Asian market 45 Operators such as China Southern China Southwest Shanghai Airlines Xiamen Airlines and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes 59 ",
