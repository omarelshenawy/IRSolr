			"previous": " Plates 65 to 82 were named caprichos enf ticos emphatic caprices in the original series title a 4 Completed between 1813 and 1820 and spanning Ferdinand VII s fall and return to power they consist of allegorical scenes that critique post war Spanish politics including the Inquisition and the then common judicial practice of torture Although peace was welcomed it produced a political environment that was in ways more repressive than before The new regime stifled the hopes of liberals such as Goya who used the term fatal consequences to describe the situation in his title for the series 35 36 Hughes refers to the group as the disasters of peace 17 ",
			"after": " After the six years of absolutism that followed Ferdinand s return to the throne on 1 January 1820 Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt with the intent of restoring the 1812 Constitution By March the king was forced to agree but by September 1823 after an unstable period a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824 Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events 37 ",
