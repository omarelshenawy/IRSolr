			"previous": " Gilbert brought suit and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891 he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy 71 Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith 29 and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit and felt vindicated but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners Nevertheless the partnership had been so profitable that after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer 71 ",
			"after": " In 1891 after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair Tom Chappell the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists and within two weeks had succeeded 72 Two more operas resulted Utopia Limited 1893 and The Grand Duke 1896 Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan His Excellency 1894 but Gilbert s insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh his proteg e from Utopia led to Sullivan s refusal 73 Utopia concerning an attempt to anglicise a south Pacific island kingdom was only a modest success and The Grand Duke in which a theatrical troupe by means of a statutory duel and a conspiracy takes political control of a grand duchy was an outright failure After that the partnership ended for good 74 Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later In 1904 Gilbert would write Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator Sir Arthur Sullivan When that event occurred I saw no one with whom I felt that I could work with satisfaction and success and so I discontinued to write libretti 75 ",
