			"previous": " Perhaps the most thorough redesign was of the wing the objective being to match the performance of the cancelled AV 16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV 8A 78 Engineers designed a new one piece supercritical wing which improves cruise performance by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift to drag ratio 78 Made of composites the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV 8A Compared to the AV 8A s wing it has a higher aspect ratio reduced sweep from 40 to 37 and an area increased from 200 sq ft 18 6 m2 to 230 sq ft 21 4 m2 The wing has a high lift configuration employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering and drooped ailerons Using the leading edge root extensions the new wing allows for a 6 700 lb 3 035 kg increase in payload compared with the first generation Harriers after a 1 000 ft 300 m takeoff roll 79 Because the wing is almost exclusively composite it is 330 lb 150 kg lighter than the AV 8A s smaller wing 78 ",
			"after": " The Harrier II was the first combat aircraft to extensively employ carbon fiber composite materials exploiting their light weight and high strength 80 81 they are used in the wings rudder flaps nose forward fuselage and tail Twenty six percent of the aircraft s structure is made of composites reducing its weight by 480 lb 217 kg compared to a conventional metal structure 76 ",
