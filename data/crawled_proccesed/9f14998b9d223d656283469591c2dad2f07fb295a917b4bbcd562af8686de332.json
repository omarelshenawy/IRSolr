			"previous": " Born into the families of a goldsmith and a watch maker Mir grew up in the Barri G tic neighborhood of Barcelona 2 His father was Miquel Mir Adzerias and his mother was Dolors Ferr 3 He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13 a medieval mansion In 1907 he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja to the dismay of his father He studied at the Cercle Art stic de Sant Lluc 4 and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the Dalmau Gallery where his work was ridiculed and defaced 5 Inspired by Cubist and surrealist exhibitions from abroad Mir was drawn towards the arts community that was gathering in Montparnasse and in 1920 moved to Paris but continued to spend his summers in Catalonia 2 ",
			"after": " Mir initially went to business school as well as art school He began his working career when he was a teenager as a clerk although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown 6 His early art like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists exhibited in Barcelona was inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul C zanne The resemblance of Mir s work to that of the intermediate generation of the avant garde has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period 7 ",
