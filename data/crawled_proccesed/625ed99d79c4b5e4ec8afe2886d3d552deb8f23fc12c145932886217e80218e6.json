			"previous": " Prior to the Impressionists other painters notably such 17th century Dutch painters as Jan Steen had emphasized common subjects but their methods of composition were traditional They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer s attention The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance 24 Photography was gaining popularity and as cameras became more portable photographs became more candid Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape but in the day to day lives of people ",
			"after": " The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography which seemed to devalue the artist s skill in reproducing reality Both portrait and landscape paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably 25 ",
