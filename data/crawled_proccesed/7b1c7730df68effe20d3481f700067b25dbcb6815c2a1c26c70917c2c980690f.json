			"previous": " Three Studies was first shown at a joint exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery London in April 1945 alongside work by Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland Bacon was then unknown and it is likely that his painting was included at the request of Sutherland 7 his close friend at the time 45 The show opened just two months after the end of the Second World War and John Russell has observed that the immediate post war period in British history was marked by an atmosphere of nostalgia and optimism a sense that everything was going to be alright and visitors went into the Lefevre in a spirit of thanksgiving for perils honourably surmounted 46 ",
			"after": " Both the public and critics were unnerved by the sight of the work Russell describes being shocked by images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them Their anatomy was half human half animal and they were confined in a low ceilinged windowless and oddly proportioned space They could bite probe and suck and they had very long eel like necks but their functioning in other respects was mysterious Ears and mouths they had but two at least of them were sightless 46 Writing for Apollo magazine Herbert Furst recalled I I must confess was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition Perhaps it was the red sic background that made me think of entrails of an anatomy or a vivisection and feel squeamish 48 The triptych caused a sensation and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country 49 ",
