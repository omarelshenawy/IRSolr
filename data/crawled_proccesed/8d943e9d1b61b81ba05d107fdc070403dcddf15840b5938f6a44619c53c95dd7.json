			"previous": " Because PTFE is poorly soluble in almost all solvents the polymerization is conducted as an emulsion in water This process gives a suspension of polymer particles Alternatively the polymerization is conducted using a surfactant such as PFOS ",
			"after": " PTFE is a thermoplastic polymer which is a white solid at room temperature with a density of about 2200 kg m3 According to DuPont its melting point is 600 K 327 C 620 F 17 It maintains high strength toughness and self lubrication at low temperatures down to 5 K 268 15 C 450 67 F and good flexibility at temperatures above 194 K 79 C 110 F 18 PTFE gains its properties from the aggregate effect of carbon fluorine bonds as do all fluorocarbons The only chemicals known to affect these carbon fluorine bonds are reactive metals like alkali metals and at higher temperature also e g aluminium and magnesium and fluorinating agents such as xenon difluoride and cobalt III fluoride 19 ",
