			"previous": " Donnell s goal was that the Monadnock would not only look as it originally did it would also live as it used to 77 and he sought tenants for the street level shops that were similar to their 19th century occupants 78 Shop windows were cleared of all signs and obstructions to preserve intended view from the corridor through to the street Fluorescent lighting was prohibited and only gold leaf lettering on the glass was permitted for signage Shops all individually owned were selected to fit the architectural character of the building 78 A florist for example was chosen that evoked a turn of the century atmosphere as well as a barbershop with vintage fixtures and decor A tobacconist with oak furnishings a pen shop with glass cases a shoe shine stand and other service establishments represented in Donnell s words the kind of small scale entrepreneurs who occupied those spaces at the turn of the century the kind of people who bring vitality and life to a building because they have a stake in it 78 ",
			"after": " The restoration was a success both critically and commercially The building was 80 percent occupied when bought in 1979 and rented for 5 50 per square foot 59 20 per square meter By 1982 it was 91 percent occupied and commanded rent of 9 per square foot 96 89 per square meter 64 The Monadnock was selected as one of top restoration projects in the country by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1987 noting the outstanding quality of the overall restoration effort and the precision detail and faithfulness of the interior restoration in particular the lobby which serves as a model for preservation nationwide 70 ",
