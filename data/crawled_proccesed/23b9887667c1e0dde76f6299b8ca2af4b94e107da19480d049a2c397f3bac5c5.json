			"after": " While grains were the primary constituent of most meals vegetables such as cabbage beets onions garlic and carrots were common foodstuffs Many of these were eaten daily by peasants and workers but were less prestigious than meat The cookbooks intended mostly for those who could afford such luxuries which appeared in the late Middle Ages contained only a small number of recipes using vegetables as the main ingredient The lack of recipes for many basic vegetable dishes such as potages has been interpreted not to mean that they were absent from the meals of the nobility but rather that they were considered so basic that they did not require recording 51 Carrots were available in many variants during the Middle Ages among them a tastier reddish purple variety and a less prestigious green yellow type Various legumes like chickpeas fava beans and peas were also common and important sources of protein especially among the lower classes With the exception of peas legumes were often viewed with some suspicion by the dietitians advising the upper class partly because of their tendency to cause flatulence but also because they were associated with the coarse food of peasants The importance of vegetables to the common people is illustrated by accounts from 16th century Germany stating that many peasants ate sauerkraut from three to four times a day 52 ",
