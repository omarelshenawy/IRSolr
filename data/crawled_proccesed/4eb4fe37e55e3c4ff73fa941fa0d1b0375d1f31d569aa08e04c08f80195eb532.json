			"previous": " Several courtship displays by splendid fairywren males have been recorded the sea horse flight so named for the similarity of movements to those by a seahorse is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male with his neck extended and his head feathers erect flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground 42 The face fan display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers 43 ",
			"after": " Another interesting habit of males of this and other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to pluck petals in this species predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage and show them to female fairywrens 3 Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren s own or another territory Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories presumably to promote themselves 44 It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous pairs will bond for life 45 but regularly mate with other individuals a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group Young are often raised not by the pair alone but with other males who also mated with the pair s female assisting Thus petal carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair bond Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female In either case the data does not strongly link petal carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter ",
