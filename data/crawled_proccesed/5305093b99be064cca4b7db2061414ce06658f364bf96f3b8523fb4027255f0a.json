			"previous": " Many seabirds feed on the ocean s surface as the action of marine currents often concentrates food such as krill forage fish squid or other prey items within reach of a dipped head ",
			"after": " Surface feeding itself can be broken up into two different approaches surface feeding while flying for example as practiced by gadfly petrels frigatebirds and storm petrels and surface feeding while swimming examples of which are practiced by fulmars gulls many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels Surface feeders in flight include some of the most acrobatic of seabirds which either snatch morsels from the water as do frigate birds and some terns or walk pattering and hovering on the water s surface as some of the storm petrels do 12 Many of these do not ever land in the water and some such as the frigatebirds have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so 13 Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the skimmer which has a unique fishing method flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the water this shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water The skimmer s bill reflects its unusual lifestyle with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one ",
