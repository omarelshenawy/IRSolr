			"after": " Arboreal locomotion is the locomotion of animals in trees In habitats in which trees are present animals have evolved to move in them Some animals may only scale trees occasionally while others are exclusively arboreal These habitats pose numerous mechanical challenges to animals moving through them leading to a variety of anatomical behavioral and ecological consequences as well as variations throughout different species 1 Furthermore many of these same principles may be applied to climbing without trees such as on rock piles or mountains ",
