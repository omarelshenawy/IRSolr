			"previous": " The composition is notable for both its adherence to academic tradition the mastery of the figure as an end in itself and its uniqueness in transposing the male nude to an outdoor setting The depiction of someone diving into water was very rare in the history of Western art 4 The other figures are artfully arranged to imply a continuous narrative of movement the poses progressing from reclining to sitting to standing to diving at the same time each figure is carefully positioned so that no genitalia are visible 4 As in his previous works Eakins chose to include a self portrait here as the swimmer at bottom right Unlike his appearances in The Gross Clinic or Max Schmitt in a Single Scull here the artist s presence is more ambiguous he may be seen as companion teacher or voyeur 18 The ripple in the water next to Eakins and the bubbles around the diver are the only indications of movement in a painting where motion is otherwise arrested 18 the water next to the red headed figure in the lake is still enough to offer a clear reflection 19 This contrast underscores the tension in the picture between classical prototypes and scientific naturalism 20 ",
			"after": " The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art 22 The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self depiction by the artist 10 It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation the subject was contemporary but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture 23 One possible influence by a contemporary source was Sc ne d t painted in 1869 by Fr d ric Bazille 1841 70 It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting 15 ",
