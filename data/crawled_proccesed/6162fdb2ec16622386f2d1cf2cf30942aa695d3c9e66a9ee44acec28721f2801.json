			"previous": " In 1874 Gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer conductor Carl Rosa whose wife would have played the leading role but her death in childbirth cancelled the project Not long afterwards Richard D Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach s La P richole Gilbert already had available the libretto he had written for Rosa and Carte suggested that Sullivan write the score The composer was delighted with it and Trial by Jury was composed in a matter of weeks 25 ",
			"after": " The piece is one of Gilbert s humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession based on his short experience as a barrister It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit The defendant argues that damages should be slight since he is such a very bad lot while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks substantial damages After much argument the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself With Sullivan s brother Fred as the Learned Judge the opera was a runaway hit outlasting the run of La P richole Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed 26 ",
