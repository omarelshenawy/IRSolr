			"after": " Spades are flat metal plates usually attached to the aileron lower surface ahead of the aileron hinge by a lever arm They reduce the force needed by the pilot to deflect the aileron and are often seen on aerobatic aircraft As the aileron is deflected upward the spade produces a downward aerodynamic force which tends to rotate the whole assembly so as to further deflect the aileron upward The size of the spade and its lever arm determines how much force the pilot needs to apply to deflect the aileron A spade works in the same manner as a horn but is more efficient due to the longer moment arm ",
