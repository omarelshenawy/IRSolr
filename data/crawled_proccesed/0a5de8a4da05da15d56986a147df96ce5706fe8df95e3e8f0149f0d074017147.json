			"after": " The history of thermodynamics as a scientific discipline generally begins with Otto von Guericke who in 1650 built and designed the world s first vacuum pump and demonstrated a vacuum using his Magdeburg hemispheres Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove Aristotle s long held supposition that nature abhors a vacuum Shortly after Guericke the physicist and chemist Robert Boyle had learned of Guericke s designs and in 1656 in coordination with the scientist Robert Hooke built an air pump 35 Using this pump Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between pressure temperature and volume In time they formulated Boyle s Law which states that for a gas at constant temperature its pressure and volume are inversely proportional In 1679 based on these concepts an associate of Boyle s named Denis Papin built a steam digester which was a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confined steam until a high pressure was generated Later designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from exploding By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and a cylinder engine He did not however follow through with his design Nevertheless in 1697 based on Papin s designs the engineer Thomas Savery built the first engine followed by Thomas Newcomen in 1712 Although these early engines were crude and inefficient they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time ",
