			"after": " Trap jaw ants of the genus Odontomachus are equipped with mandibles called trap jaws which snap shut faster than any other predatory appendages within the animal kingdom 78 One study of Odontomachus bauri recorded peak speeds of between 126 and 230 km h 78 143 mph with the jaws closing within 130 microseconds on average The ants were also observed to use their jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat 78 Before striking the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism Energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks Trap jaws also are seen in the following genera Anochetus Orectognathus and Strumigenys 78 plus some members of the Dacetini tribe 79 which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution ",
