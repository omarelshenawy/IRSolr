			"after": " The habitat of the woolly mammoth is known as mammoth steppe or tundra steppe This environment stretched across northern Asia many parts of Europe and the northern part of North America during the last ice age It was similar to the grassy steppes of modern Russia but the flora was more diverse abundant and grew faster Grasses sedges shrubs and herbaceous plants were present and scattered trees were mainly found in southern regions This habitat was not dominated by ice and snow as is popularly believed since these regions are thought to have been high pressure areas at the time The habitat of the woolly mammoth also supported other grazing herbivores such as the woolly rhinoceros wild horses and bison 64 A 2014 study concluded that forbs a group of herbaceous plants were more important in the steppe tundra than previously acknowledged and that it was a primary food source for the ice age megafauna 65 ",
