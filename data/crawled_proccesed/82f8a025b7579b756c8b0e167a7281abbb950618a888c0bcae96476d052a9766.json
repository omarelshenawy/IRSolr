			"previous": " Slow lorises range in weight from the Bornean slow loris at 265 grams 9 3 oz to as much as 2 100 grams 74 oz for the Bengal slow loris 67 Slow lorises have stout bodies 58 and their tails are only stubs and hidden beneath the dense fur 7 58 Their combined head and body lengths vary by species but range from 18 to 38 cm 7 1 to 15 0 in between all species 58 The trunk is longer than in other living strepsirrhines 68 because they have 15 16 thoracic vertebrae compared to 12 14 in other living strepsirrhines 69 This gives them greater mobility when twisting and extending towards nearby branches 60 Their other vertebrae include seven cervical vertebrae six or seven lumbar vertebrae six or seven sacral vertebrae and seven to eleven caudal vertebrae 69 ",
			"after": " Unlike galagos which have longer legs than arms slow lorises have arms and legs of nearly equal length 7 Their intermembral index ratio of arm to leg length averages 89 indicating that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs 58 As with the slender lorises their arms are slightly longer than their body 69 but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout 58 ",
