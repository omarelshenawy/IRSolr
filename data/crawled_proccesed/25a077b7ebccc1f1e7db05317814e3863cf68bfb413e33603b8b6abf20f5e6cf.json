			"previous": " The collision of Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers coming just a few months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble s optical performance Hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979 and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter an event believed to occur once every few centuries ",
			"after": " Other discoveries made with Hubble data include proto planetary disks proplyds in the Orion Nebula 120 evidence for the presence of extrasolar planets around Sun like stars 121 and the optical counterparts of the still mysterious gamma ray bursts 122 HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System including the dwarf planets Pluto 123 and Eris 124 ",
