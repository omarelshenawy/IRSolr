			"previous": " After the fall of Lae the 9th Division was given the task of capturing the Huon Peninsula The 20th Brigade landed near the strategic harbour of Finschhafen on 22 September 1943 and secured the area The Japanese responded by dispatching the 20th Division overland to the area and the remainder of the 9th Division was gradually brought in to reinforce the 20th Brigade against the expected counter attack The Japanese mounted a strong attack in mid October which was defeated by the 9th Division after heavy fighting During the second half of November the 9th Division captured the hills inland of Finschhafen from well dug in Japanese forces Following its defeat the 20th Division retreated along the coast with the 9th Division and 4th Brigade in pursuit 131 The Allies scored a major intelligence victory towards the end of this campaign when Australian engineers found the 20th Division s entire cipher library which had been buried by the retreating Japanese These documents led to a code breaking breakthrough which enabled MacArthur to accelerate the Allied advance by bypassing Japanese defences 132 ",
			"after": " While the 9th Division secured the coastal region of the Huon Peninsula the 7th Division drove the Japanese from the inland Finisterre Range The Finisterre Range campaign began on 17 September when the 2 6th Independent Company was air landed in the Markham Valley The company defeated a larger Japanese force at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to fly the Division s 21st and 25th Brigades in Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January 1944 the division began its attack on the key Shaggy Ridge position The ridge was taken by the end of January with the RAAF playing a key supporting role Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from Saidor on 21 April and secured Madang on 24 April 133 ",
