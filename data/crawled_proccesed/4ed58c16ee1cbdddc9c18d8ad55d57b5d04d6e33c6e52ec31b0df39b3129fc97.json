			"previous": " Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences 52 A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them 53 Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as Visual Auditory and Kinesthetic VAK are helpful particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning 54 55 Recent research has argued there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice 56 ",
			"after": " As an academic field philosophy of education is the philosophical study of education and its problems its central subject matter is education and its methods are those of philosophy 57 The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education That is it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims forms methods or results of the process of educating or being educated or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts aims and methods of the discipline 58 As such it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy drawing from fields of metaphysics epistemology axiology and the philosophical approaches speculative prescriptive and or analytic to address questions in and about pedagogy education policy and curriculum as well as the process of learning to name a few 59 For example it might study what constitutes upbringing and education the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline and the relation between education theory and practice ",
