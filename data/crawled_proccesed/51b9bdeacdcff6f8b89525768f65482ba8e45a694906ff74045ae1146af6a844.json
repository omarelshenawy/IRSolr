			"after": " Urdu has been one of the premier languages of poetry in South Asia for two centuries and has developed a rich tradition in a variety of poetic genres The Ghazal in Urdu represents the most popular form of subjective music and poetry whereas the Nazm exemplifies the objective kind often reserved for narrative descriptive didactic or satirical purposes Under the broad head of the Nazm we may also include the classical forms of poems known by specific names such as Masnavi a long narrative poem in rhyming couplets on any theme romantic religious or didactic Marsia an elegy traditionally meant to commemorate the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali grandson of Muhammad and his comrades of the Karbala fame or Qasida a panegyric written in praise of a king or a nobleman for all these poems have a single presiding subject logically developed and concluded However these poetic species have an old world aura about their subject and style and are different from the modern Nazm supposed to have come into vogue in the later part of the nineteenth century Probably the most widely recited and memorised genre of contemporary Urdu poetry is n t panegyric poetry written in praise of Muhammad N t can be of any formal category but is most commonly in the ghazal form The language used in Urdu n t ranges from the intensely colloquial to a highly Persified formal language The great early 20th century scholar Ala Hazrat Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi who wrote many of the most well known n ts in Urdu the collection of his poetic work is Hadaiq e Baqhshish epitomised this range in a ghazal of nine stanzas bayt in which every stanza contains half a line each of Arabic Persian formal Urdu and colloquial Hindi ",
