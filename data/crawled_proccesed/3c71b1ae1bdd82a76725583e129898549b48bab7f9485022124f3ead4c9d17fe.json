			"after": " During the early 1900s the Boulonnais were imported in large numbers to the United States and were quite popular in France however the European population suffered severe decreases during 20th century wars The breed nearly became extinct following World War II but rebounded in France in the 1970s as a popular breed for horse meat Breed numbers remain low with an estimation of less than 1 000 horses remaining in Europe mostly in France with a few in other nations Studies as early as 1983 indicated a danger of inbreeding within the Boulonnais population and a 2009 report suggested that the breed should be a priority for conservation within France The smallest type of Boulonnais was originally used to pull carts full of fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris while the larger varieties performed heavy draft work both on farms and in the cities The Boulonnais was also crossbred to create and refine several other draft breeds ",
