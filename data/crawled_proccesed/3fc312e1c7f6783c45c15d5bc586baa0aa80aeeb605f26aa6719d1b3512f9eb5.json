			"previous": " Different subgenres of rock were adopted by and became central to the identity of a large number of sub cultures In the 1950s and 1960s respectively British youths adopted the Teddy Boy and Rockers subcultures which revolved around US rock and roll 374 The counterculture of the 1960s was closely associated with psychedelic rock 374 The mid 1970s punk subculture began in the US but it was given a distinctive look by British designer Vivienne Westwood a look which spread worldwide 375 Out of the punk scene the Goth and Emo subcultures grew both of which presented distinctive visual styles 376 ",
			"after": " When an international rock culture developed it supplanted cinema as the major sources of fashion influence 377 Paradoxically followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion which has been seen as elevating image above substance 377 Rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom 377 378 Rock has also been associated with various forms of drug use including the stimulants taken by some mods in the early to mid 1960s through the LSD linked with psychedelic rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s and sometimes to cannabis cocaine and heroin all of which have been eulogised in song 379 380 ",
