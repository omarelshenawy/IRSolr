			"after": " CFRP is now widely used in sports equipment For the same strength a CFRP bicycle frame weighs less than one of steel aluminum or titanium The type and orientation of the carbon fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness and minimize the chance of failure The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections CFRP frames forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers handlebars seatposts and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher priced bicycles CFRP wheels while expensive are also becoming popular The higher yield strength of the CFRP rims compared to aluminium reduces the need to re true a wheel and the reduced mass of the rim also reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel since it is a rotating component Rarely the spokes of the wheel can be made from CFRP but most carbon wheelsets still use traditional stainless steel spokes Some other less common uses of CFRP on bicycles include derailleur parts brake and shifter levers and lever bodies cassette sprocket carriers suspension linkages disc brake rotors pedals shoe soles and saddle rails ",
