			"previous": " A member of the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider 5 with the katipo as its closest relative 13 A 2004 molecular study supports the redback s status as a distinct species as does the unique abdomen presenting behaviour of the male during mating 5 The close relationship between the two species is shown when mating the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring However the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web causing the female to eat it 14 There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild 13 ",
			"after": " The adult female redback has a body around 1 centimetre 0 4 in long with slender legs the first pair of which are longer than the rest 15 The round abdomen is a deep black occasionally brownish with a red sometimes orange longitudinal stripe on the upper surface and an hourglass shaped red orange streak on the underside 16 Females with incomplete markings or all black abdomens occasionally occur 17 The cephalothorax is much smaller than the abdomen and is black 15 Redback spiderlings are grey with dark spots 2 and become darker with each moult 18 Juvenile females have additional white markings on the abdomen 16 The bright red colours may serve as a warning to potential predators 19 Each spider has a pair of venom glands each attached to each of its chelicerae 20 with very small fangs 21 Small compared to the female 22 the male redback is 3 4 mm 0 12 0 16 in long and is light brown with white markings on the upper side of the abdomen and a pale hourglass marking on the underside 16 ",
