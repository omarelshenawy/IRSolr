			"previous": " In the pre dreadnought generation of warships casemates were placed initially on the main deck and later on the upper deck as well Casemates on the main deck were very close to the waterline In the Edgar class cruisers the guns in the casemates were only 10 feet 3 0 m above the waterline 15 Casemates that were too close to the waterline or too close to the bow such as in the 1912 Iron Duke class dreadnoughts were prone to flooding making the guns ineffective 16 ",
			"after": " In regards to armoured fighting vehicles casemate design refers to vehicles that have their main gun mounted directly within the hull and lack the rotating turret commonly associated with tanks Such a design generally makes the vehicle mechanically simpler in design less costly in construction lighter in weight and lower in profile The saved weight can be used to mount a heavier more powerful gun or alternatively increase the vehicle s armour protection in comparison to regular turreted tanks However in combat the crew has to rotate the entire vehicle if an enemy target presents itself outside of the vehicle s limited gun traverse arc This can prove very disadvantageous in combat situations with no clearly drawn front line ",
