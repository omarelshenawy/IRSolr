			"previous": " Previous to Jedediah Smith in 1828 no other explorer of European descent is known to have thoroughly investigated the inland region away from the immediate coast The discovery of gold along the Trinity River in 1850 led to a minor secondary rush in California This brought miners into the area and many stayed on at the coast after failing to strike it rich This quickly led to conflicts wherein native peoples were placed under great strain if not forcibly removed or massacred 11 By 1895 only one third of the Yurok in one group of villages remained by 1919 virtually all members of the Chilula tribe had either died or been assimilated into other tribes 12 The miners logged redwoods for building when this minor gold rush ended some of them turned again to logging cutting down the giant redwood trees Initially over 2 000 000 acres 8 100 km2 of the California and southwestern coast of Oregon were old growth redwood forest but by 1910 extensive logging led conservationists and concerned citizens to begin seeking ways to preserve the remaining trees which they saw being logged at an alarming rate 13 In 1911 U S Representative John E Raker of California became the first politician to introduce legislation for the creation of a redwood national park However no further action was taken by Congress at this time ",
			"after": " Preservation of the redwood stands in California is considered one of the most substantial conservation contributions of the Boone and Crockett Club The Save the Redwoods League was founded in 1918 by Boone and Crockett Club members Madison Grant John C Merriam Henry Fairfield Osborn and future member Frederick Russell Burnham The initial purchases of land were made by Club member Stephen Mather and Mr William Kent In 1921 Boone and Crockett Club member Dr John C Phillips donated 32 000 to purchase land and create the Raynal Bolling Memorial Grove in the Humboldt Redwoods State Park 14 This was timely as U S Route 101 which would soon provide nearly unfettered access to the trees was under construction Using matching funds provided initially by the County of Humboldt and later by the State of California the Save the Redwoods League managed to protect areas of concentrated or multiple redwood groves and a few entire forests in the 1920s As California created a state park system beginning in 1927 three of the preserved redwood areas became Prairie Creek Redwoods Del Norte Coast Redwoods and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks A fourth became Humboldt Redwoods State Park by far the largest of the individual Redwood State Parks but not in the Redwood National and State Park system Because of the high demand for lumber during World War II and the construction boom that followed in the 1950s the creation of a national park was delayed Efforts by the Save the Redwoods League the Sierra Club and the National Geographic Society to create a national park began in the early 1960s 15 After intense lobbying of Congress the bill creating Redwood National Park was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on October 2 1968 The Save the Redwoods League and other entities purchased over 100 000 acres 400 km2 which were added to existing state parks In 1978 48 000 acres 190 km2 were added to Redwood National Park in a major expansion 15 However only a fifth of that land was old growth forest the rest having been logged This expansion protected the watershed along Redwood Creek from being adversely affected by logging operations outside the park The federal and state parks were administratively combined in 1994 16 ",
