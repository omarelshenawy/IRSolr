			"previous": " In his original treatment Einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment but the same conclusion can be reached in other ways  The second part of Einstein s theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval This result enables the experimental determination of Avogadro s number and therefore the size of molecules Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium ",
