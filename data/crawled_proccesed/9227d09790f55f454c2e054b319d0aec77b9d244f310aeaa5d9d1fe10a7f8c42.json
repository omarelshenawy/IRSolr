			"previous": " The French Revolutionary Wars 1793 1801 and Napoleonic Wars 1803 1814 and 1815 saw the Royal Navy reach a peak of efficiency dominating the navies of all Britain s adversaries which spent most of the war blockaded in port The Navy achieved an emphatic early victory at the Glorious First of June 1794 and gained a number of smaller victories while supporting abortive French Royalist efforts to regain control of France In the course of one such operation the majority of the French Mediterranean fleet was captured or destroyed during a short lived occupation of Toulon in 1793 43 The military successes of the French Revolutionary r gime brought the Spanish and Dutch navies into the war on the French side but the losses inflicted on the Dutch at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797 and the surrender of their surviving fleet to a landing force at Den Helder in 1799 effectively eliminated the Dutch navy from the war 44 The Spithead and Nore mutinies in 1797 incapacitated the Channel and North Sea fleets leaving Britain potentially exposed to invasion but were rapidly resolved 45 The British Mediterranean fleet under Nelson failed to intercept Napoleon Bonaparte s 1798 expedition to invade Egypt but annihilated the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile leaving Bonaparte s army isolated 46 The emergence of a Baltic coalition opposed to Britain led to an attack on Denmark which lost much of its fleet in the Battle of Copenhagen 1801 and came to terms with Britain 47 ",
			"after": " During these years the Navy also conducted amphibious operations that captured most of the French Caribbean islands and the Dutch colonies at the Cape of Good Hope Ceylon and in the Dutch East Indies but except for Ceylon and Trinidad these gains were returned following the Peace of Amiens in 1802 which briefly halted the fighting 48 War resumed in 1803 and Napoleon attempted to assemble a large enough fleet from the French and Spanish squadrons blockaded in various ports to cover an invasion of England The Navy frustrated these efforts and following the abandonment of the invasion plan Nelson defeated the combined Franco Spanish fleet in the Battle of Trafalgar 1805 49 This victory marked the culmination of decades of developing British naval dominance and left the Navy in a position of uncontested hegemony at sea which endured until the early years of the 20th century ",
