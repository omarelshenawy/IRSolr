			"previous": " Fourth generation fighters continued the trend towards multirole configurations and were equipped with increasingly sophisticated avionics and weapon systems Fighter designs were significantly influenced by the Energy Maneuverability E M theory developed by Colonel John Boyd and mathematician Thomas Christie based upon Boyd s combat experience in the Korean War and as a fighter tactics instructor during the 1960s E M theory emphasized the value of aircraft specific energy maintenance as an advantage in fighter combat Boyd perceived maneuverability as the primary means of getting inside an adversary s decision making cycle a process Boyd called the OODA loop for Observation Orientation Decision Action This approach emphasized aircraft designs that were capable of performing fast transients quick changes in speed altitude and direction as opposed to relying chiefly on high speed alone ",
			"after": " E M characteristics were first applied to the McDonnell Douglas F 15 Eagle but Boyd and his supporters believed these performance parameters called for a small lightweight aircraft with a larger higher lift wing The small size would minimize drag and increase the thrust to weight ratio while the larger wing would minimize wing loading while the reduced wing loading tends to lower top speed and can cut range it increases payload capacity and the range reduction can be compensated for by increased fuel in the larger wing The efforts of Boyd s Fighter Mafia would result in the General Dynamics F 16 Fighting Falcon now Lockheed Martin s ",
