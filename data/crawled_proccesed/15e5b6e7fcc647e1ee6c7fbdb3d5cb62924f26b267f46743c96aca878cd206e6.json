			"previous": " Gould met Darwin and told him that the Gal pagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species not just varieties and what Darwin had thought was a wren was also in the finch group Darwin had not labelled the finches by island but from the notes of others on the Beagle including FitzRoy he allocated species to islands 67 The two rheas were also distinct species and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards 68 ",
			"after": " By mid March Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that one species does change into another to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas and extinct ones such as the strange Macrauchenia which resembled a giant guanaco His thoughts on lifespan asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction developed in his B notebook around mid July on to variation in offspring to adapt alter the race to changing world explaining the Gal pagos tortoises mockingbirds and rheas He sketched branching descent then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree in which It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another discarding Lamarck s independent lineages progressing to higher forms 69 ",
