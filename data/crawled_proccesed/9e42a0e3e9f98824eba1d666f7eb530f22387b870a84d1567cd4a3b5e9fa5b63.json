			"after": " Erosion is also an important control in tide dominated deltas such as the Ganges Delta which may be mainly submarine with prominent sand bars and ridges This tends to produce a dendritic structure 5 Tidal deltas behave differently from river and wave dominated deltas which tend to have a few main distributaries Once a wave or river distributary silts up it is abandoned and a new channel forms elsewhere In a tidal delta new distributaries are formed during times when there s a lot of water around such as floods or storm surges These distributaries slowly silt up at a pretty constant rate until they fizzle out 5 ",
