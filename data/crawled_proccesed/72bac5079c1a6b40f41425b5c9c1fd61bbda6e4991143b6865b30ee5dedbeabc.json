			"after": " Jean Baptiste Lamarck proposed in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809 a theory of the transmutation of species transformisme Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal or a plant to change based on the use or disuse of those organs just as exercise affects muscles He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century 54 55 ",
