			"previous": " Many important biochemical reactions such as energy generation use concentration gradients across membranes The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space 51 However in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light gathering membrane 52 These light gathering complexes may even form lipid enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria 53 Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm ",
			"after": " Bacteria do not have a membrane bound nucleus and their genetic material is typically a single circular DNA chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid 55 The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA The phylum Planctomycetes 56 and candidate phylum Poribacteria 57 may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane bound cellular structures Like all living organisms bacteria contain ribosomes often grouped in chains called polyribosomes for the production of proteins but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea 58 Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S measured in Svedberg units their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host ",
