			"previous": " Tupolev OKB was founded by Andrei Nikolayevich Tupolev in 1922 Its facilities are tailored for aeronautics research and aircraft design only manufacturing is handled by other firms It researched all metal airplanes during the 1920s based directly on the pioneering work already done by Hugo Junkers during World War I ",
			"after": " The first successful all metal airplane was built with sheet electrical steel by the German engineer Hugo Junkers in 1915 With the never completed Junkers J 3 of 1916 used strictly as a design study Junkers shifted to lighter construction using corrugated duralumin In the aftermath of WWI and to evade the terms of the Versailles Treaty that prevented German companies from building warplanes Junkers founded a clandestine aircraft factory in the Moscow suburb of Fili in 1922 This factory was turned over to Tupolev in 1925 3 Russian sources usually refrain from making the link between Junkers and Tupolev Tupolev was an able designer but his first generation aircraft were heavily influenced by his early connection to Junkers Among the notable results during Tupolev s early period were two significant all metal heavy bombers with corrugated duralumin skins the ANT 4 twin engined bomber which first flew in 1925 and the four engined ANT 6 of 1932 from which such airplanes as the ANT 20 were derived see Yefim Gordon Vladimir Rigmant OKB Tupolev Hinckley UK Midland 2005 pp 22 28 30 34 Tupolev s design approach in these two airplanes defined for many years the trends of heavy aircraft development civil and military ",
