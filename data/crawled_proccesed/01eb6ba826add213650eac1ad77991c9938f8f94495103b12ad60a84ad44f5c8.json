			"previous": " The earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques Around the turn of the 20th century films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film Until sound film became commercially practical in the late 1920s motion pictures were a purely visual art but these innovative silent films had gained a hold on the public imagination Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment theater owners hired a pianist or organist or in large urban theaters a full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment By the early 1920s most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose and complete film scores were composed for major productions ",
			"after": " The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of Hollywood typified most prominently by the innovative work of D W Griffith in The Birth of a Nation 1915 and Intolerance 1916 However in the 1920s European filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein F W Murnau and Fritz Lang in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith along with the contributions of Charles Chaplin Buster Keaton and others quickly caught up with American film making and continued to further advance the medium ",
