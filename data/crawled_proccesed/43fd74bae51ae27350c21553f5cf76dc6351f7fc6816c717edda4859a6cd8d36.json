			"previous": "  In mathematics an algebraic number is a number that is a root of a finite 1 non zero polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients or equivalently by clearing denominators with integer coefficients Numbers such as that are not algebraic are said to be transcendental Almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental Here almost all has the sense all but a countable set see Properties ",
			"after": " The sum difference product and quotient of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic this fact can be demonstrated using the resultant and the algebraic numbers therefore form a field sometimes denoted by A which may also denote the adele ring or Q Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are algebraic numbers is again algebraic This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is algebraically closed In fact it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals and is therefore called the algebraic closure of the rationals ",
