			"previous": " Despite all the changes the Mavs remained in contention However their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured patella tendon on March 10 1989 and missed the rest of the season as a result The Mavericks were left undermanned demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38 44 record It was their first losing season since 1982 83 which was also the last time they missed the playoffs ",
			"after": " The Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989 90 with a 47 35 record but it was another season of off court chaos On November 15 only six games into the Mavs season Tarpley was arrested for driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest The team started 5 6 and MacLeod was fired replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games It would be the team s last winning season and last playoff appearance until 2001 ",
