			"previous": " Belton House remained relatively untouched during this period largely owing to the failing fortunes of the Brownlow family The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived for only a few months of the year at Belton where they came for the fox hunting and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and Ashridge another country house in Hertfordshire Ashridge a huge Gothic revival pile had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the Egerton family It was sold with its art collection and furnishings to pay the death duties arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921 Hence Belton became the Brownlow s sole country home Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl s successor his second cousin Adelbert Cust 5th Baron Brownlow 50 ",
			"after": " In the ensuing period many thousands of country houses of great architectural value were demolished or had whole wings razed to the ground In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days 52 In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all as in addition to the family s problems the house deteriorated to such an extent that in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired and new cornices installed Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot 53 By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978 the resultant death duties coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep made Belton too much for the Brownlow family ",
