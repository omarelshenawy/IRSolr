			"previous": " The semi nomadic eco centred Inuit were fishers and hunters harvesting lakes seas ice platforms and tundra While there are some allegations that Inuit were hostile to early French and English explorers fishers and whalers more recent research suggests that the early relations with whaling stations along the Labrador coast and later James Bay were based on a mutual interest in trade 35 In the final years of the 18th century the Moravian Church began missionary activities in Labrador supported by the British who were tired of the raids on their whaling stations The Moravian missionaries could easily provide the Inuit with the iron and basic materials they had been stealing from whaling outposts materials whose real cost to Europeans was almost nothing but whose value to the Inuit was enormous and from then on contacts in Labrador were far more peaceful ",
			"after": " The European arrival tremendously damaged the Inuit way of life causing mass death through new diseases introduced by whalers and explorers and enormous social disruptions caused by the distorting effect of Europeans material wealth Nonetheless Inuit society in the higher latitudes had largely remained in isolation during the 19th century The Hudson s Bay Company opened trading posts such as Great Whale River 1820 today the site of the twin villages of Whapmagoostui and Kuujjuarapik where whale products of the commercial whale hunt were processed and furs traded The British Naval Expedition of 1821 3 led by Admiral William Edward Parry which twice over wintered in Foxe Basin provided the first informed sympathetic and well documented account of the economic social and religious life of the Inuit Parry stayed in what is now Igloolik over the second winter Parry s writings with pen and ink illustrations of Inuit everyday life and those of George Francis Lyon both published in 1824 were widely read 36 Captain George Comer s Inuit wife Shoofly known for her sewing skills and elegant attire 37 was influential in convincing him to acquire more sewing accessories and beads for trade with Inuit ",
