			"after": " When U S President Andrew Jackson allowed the charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836 the U S was without any sort of central bank and the money supply in New York City fluctuated with the country s annual agricultural cycle Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and in an effort to attract money back interest rates were raised Foreign investors then sent their money to New York to take advantage of the higher rates 6 From the January 1906 Dow Jones Industrial Average high of 103 the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year The April 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction 7 8 A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906 when the Bank of England raised its interest rates partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders and more funds remained in London than expected 9 From their peak in January stock prices declined 18 by July 1906 By late September stocks had recovered about half of their losses ",
