			"previous": " By 1875 France was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy Growing interest in the upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support 34 In September 1875 he announced the project and the formation of the Franco American Union as its fundraising arm With the announcement the statue was given a name Liberty Enlightening the World 35 The French would finance the statue Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal 36 The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia 35 French monarchists opposed the statue if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye who had recently been elected a senator for life 36 Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25 1876 that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod The piece was titled La Libert clairant le monde the French version of the statue s announced name 35 ",
