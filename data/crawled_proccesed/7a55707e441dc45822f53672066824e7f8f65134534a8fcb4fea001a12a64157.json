			"previous": " The ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of statistical mechanics and a series of other ergodic like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems Koopman approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of functional analysis An observable a is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number say instantaneous pressure or average height The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function t This introduces an operator U t the transfer operator ",
			"after": " By studying the spectral properties of the linear operator U it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of t In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function the finite dimensional nonlinear problem involving t gets mapped into an infinite dimensional linear problem involving U ",
