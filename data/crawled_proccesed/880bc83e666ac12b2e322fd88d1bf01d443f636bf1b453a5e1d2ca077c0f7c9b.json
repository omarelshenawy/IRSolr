			"previous": " Lock Haven was laid out as a town in 1833 15 and it became the county seat in 1839 when the county was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre counties 16 Incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870 15 Lock Haven prospered in the 19th century largely because of timber and transportation The forests of Clinton County and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak ash maple poplar cherry beech and magnolia The wood was used locally for such things as frame houses shingles canal boats and wooden bridges and whole logs were floated to Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore to make spars for ships Log driving and log rafting competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills began along the West Branch around 1800 By 1830 slightly before the founding of the town the lumber industry was well established 17 ",
			"after": " The West Branch Canal which opened in 1834 ran 73 miles 117 km from Northumberland to Farrandsville about 5 miles 8 km upstream from Lock Haven A state funded extension called the Bald Eagle Cut ran from the West Branch through Lock Haven and Flemington to Bald Eagle Creek A privately funded extension the Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation eventually reached Bellefonte 24 miles 39 km upstream Lock Haven s founder Jeremiah Church and his brother Willard chose the town site in 1833 partly because of the river the creek and the canal Church named the town Lock Haven because it had a canal lock and because it was a haven for loggers boatmen and other travelers Over the next quarter century canal boats 12 feet 4 m wide and 80 feet 24 m long carried passengers and mail as well as cargo such as coal ashes for lye and soap firewood food furniture dry goods and clothing A rapid increase in Lock Haven s population to 830 by 1850 18 followed the opening of the canal 19 ",
