			"previous": " The period of the British Raj hastened the Marwari s downfall as did the eventual independence of India The British occupiers preferred other breeds 11 and tried to eliminate the Marwari along with the Kathiawari 12 The British instead preferred Thoroughbreds and polo ponies and reduced the reputation of the Marwari to the point where even the inward turning ears of the breed were mocked as the mark of a native horse 13 During the 1930s the Marwari deteriorated with breeding stock diminishing and becoming of poorer quality due to poor breeding practices 6 Indian independence along with the obsolescence of warriors on horseback led to a decreased need for the Marwari and many animals were subsequently killed 11 In the 1950s many Indian noblemen lost their land and hence much of their ability to take care of animals resulting in many Marwari horses being sold as pack horses castrated or killed The breed was on the verge of extinction 4 until the intervention of Maharaja Umaid Singhji in the first half of the 20th century saved the Marwari His work was carried on by his grandson Maharaja Gaj Singh II 6 ",
			"after": " A British horsewoman named Francesca Kelly founded a group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995 with the goal of promoting and preserving the Marwari horse around the world 14 In 1999 Kelly and Raghuvendra Singh Dundlod a descendant of Indian nobility led a group that founded the Indigenous Horse Society of India of which the Marwari Horse Society is part a group that works with the government breeders and the public to promote and conserve the breed Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses the first in the country The pair worked with other experts from the Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards 15 ",
