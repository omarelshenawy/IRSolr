			"previous": " Plant virus particles or virus like particles VLPs have applications in both biotechnology and nanotechnology The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures and can be produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression in a variety of heterologous systems Plant virus particles can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology 203 ",
			"after": " Bacteriophages are a common and diverse group of viruses and are the most abundant form of biological entity in aquatic environments there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria 204 reaching levels of 250 000 000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater 205 These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell Within a short amount of time in some cases just minutes bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell helper proteins which help assembly of new virions or proteins involved in cell lysis Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane and in the case of the T4 phage in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released 206 ",
