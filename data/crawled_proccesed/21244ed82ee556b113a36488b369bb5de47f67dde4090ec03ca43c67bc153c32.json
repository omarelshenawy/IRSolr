			"previous": " Hobbs was particularly successful in 1925 Early in the season a string of centuries including a run of four in consecutive innings made him the first batman to reach 1 000 runs that season and brought him close to Grace s record of 126 first class hundreds 208 He scored the 125th century of his career against Kent on 20 July 209 but amid intense press and public interest Hobbs lost form through a combination of anxiety and fatigue He continued to score well but could not reach three figures in an innings after one innings of 54 a newspaper headline proclaimed that Hobbs Fails Again 210 It was not until 15 August against Somerset that Hobbs scored 101 to reached the landmark an achievement praised and feted throughout the country over the following weeks On the final day of the match Hobbs scored another century to become the outright record holder 211 He ended his season with an innings of 266 in a Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival his highest to date and the best score made in the Gentlemen v Players series and 104 for the Rest of England against Yorkshire the County Champions 212 In total he scored 16 centuries setting a record for most centuries in a season 213 and totalled 3 024 runs at an average of 70 32 to top the national averages for the first time 37 212 Following his successful season Hobbs was in great demand He attended several functions in his honour but rejected offers to appear on stage in film and to stand as a Liberal parliamentary candidate 214 ",
			"after": " Hobbs was given a third benefit by Surrey in 1926 which raised 2 670 215 Further recognition came when he and Rhodes joined the England selection committee for the Ashes series to be played that summer for professional cricketers to serve as England selectors was unprecedented 215 Hobbs began the season well 216 and after the first Test which was badly affected by rain he remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham this remained a Surrey first wicket record as of 2014 217 218 In the drawn second Test he and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182 Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings leading to accusations that he was more concerned with reaching three figures than batting for the team 219 The third Test was also drawn England followed on in the face of a large Australian total but Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the second innings with a partnership of 156 and Hobbs scored 88 as the game was saved 220 During the fourth Test he temporarily assumed the captaincy when Arthur Carr withdrew from the match owing to illness Hobbs became the first professional to captain England at home The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically He scored 74 in England s innings but heavy rain ensured a fourth successive draw 221 ",
