			"previous": " After Rio de Janeiro was purchased by the Ottoman Empire the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid 1914 but all were defeated Still the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation while the Russian Austrian Ottoman Italian and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro 144 ",
			"after": " The New York Tribune reported in late April that the Argentine government rejected a 17 5 million offer for Moreno alone which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships 12 million 145 The United States worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships which it eventually did 146 Similarly news outlets reported in late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile s first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of Rio de Janeiro 147 but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts no deal was made 148 ",
