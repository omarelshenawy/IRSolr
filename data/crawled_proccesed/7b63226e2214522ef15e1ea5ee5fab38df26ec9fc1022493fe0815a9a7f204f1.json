			"previous": " The cylinder head is attached to the engine block by numerous bolts or studs It has several functions The cylinder head seals the cylinders on the side opposite to the pistons it contains short ducts the ports for intake and exhaust and the associated intake valves that open to let the cylinder be filled with fresh air and exhaust valves that open to allow the combustion gases to escape However 2 stroke crankcase scavenged engines connect the gas ports directly to the cylinder wall without poppet valves the piston controls their opening and occlusion instead The cylinder head also holds the spark plug in the case of spark ignition engines and the injector for engines that use direct injection All CI engines use fuel injection usually direct injection but some engines instead use indirect injection SI engines can use a carburetor or fuel injection as port injection or direct injection Most SI engines have a single spark plug per cylinder but some have 2 A head gasket prevents the gas from leaking between the cylinder head and the engine block The opening and closing of the valves is controlled by one or several camshafts and springs or in some engines a desmodromic mechanism that uses no springs The camshaft may press directly the stem of the valve or may act upon a rocker arm again either directly or through a pushrod ",
			"after": " The crankcase is sealed at the bottom with a sump that collects the falling oil during normal operation to be cycled again The cavity created between the cylinder block and the sump houses a crankshaft that converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons to rotational motion The crankshaft is held in place relative to the engine block by main bearings which allow it to rotate Bulkheads in the crankcase form a half of every main bearing the other half is a detachable cap In some cases a single main bearing deck is used rather than several smaller caps A connecting rod is connected to offset sections of the crankshaft the crankpins in one end and to the piston in the other end through the gudgeon pin and thus transfers the force and translates the reciprocating motion of the pistons to the circular motion of the crankshaft The end of the connecting rod attached to the gudgeon pin is called its small end and the other end where it is connected to the crankshaft the big end The big end has a detachable half to allow assembly around the crankshaft It is kept together to the connecting rod by removable bolts ",
