			"previous": " Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech only a relatively small subset of these will be used to transcribe any one language It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision A precise phonetic transcription in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail is known as a narrow transcription A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription Both are relative terms and both are generally enclosed in square brackets 1 Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language ",
			"after": " For example the English word little may be transcribed broadly using the IPA as l t l and this broad imprecise transcription is a more or less accurate description of many pronunciations A narrower transcription may focus on individual or dialectical details in General American l o in Cockney or in Southern US English ",
