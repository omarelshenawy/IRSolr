			"after": " The detailed design for the project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007 25 The first task was to build a stable access road but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load bearing capacity The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries so there was a potential for subsidence To address these problems the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking 12 This was achieved by laying a crushed gravel base reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material 26 The wind turbines arrived at Scout Moor in parts transported by large goods vehicles along the M66 motorway to Edenfield as part of a 76 day long convoy of delivery 27 ",
