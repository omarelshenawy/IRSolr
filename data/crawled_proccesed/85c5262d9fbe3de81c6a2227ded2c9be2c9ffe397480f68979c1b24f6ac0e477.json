			"previous": " As the castle was developed work continued with alterations to Holland s Georgian range including his Bute Tower and to the medieval Herbert and Beauchamp Towers and the construction of the Guest Tower and the Octagonal Tower 75 In plan the castle broadly follows the arrangement of a standard Victorian stately home The Bute Tower includes Lord Bute s bedroom and ends in another highlight the Roof Garden with a sculpture of the Madonna by Fucigna Bute s bedroom has much religious iconography and a mirrored ceiling The Marquess s name John is repeated in Greek along the ceiling beams 80 The Octagon Tower followed including the oratory built on the spot where Bute s father died and the Chaucer Room the roof of which Mark Girouard cites as a superb example of Burges s genius in the construction of roofs 81 The Guest Tower contains the site of the original kitchen at its base and above the Nursery decorated with painted tiles depicting Aesop s Fables and characters from nursery rhymes 75 ",
			"after": " The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall with the library below Both are enormous the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties the latter to hold part of his vast library Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert Duke of Normandy who was imprisoned there in 1126 1134 82 The fireplace in the library contains five figures four representing the Greek Egyptian Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk 83 The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess a noted linguist The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers much was completed after Burges s death and Girouard considers that the muralist Lonsdale was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved 81 The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase Illustrated in a watercolour perspective prepared by Axel Haig 84 the staircase was long thought never to have been built but recent research has shown that it was constructed only to be torn out in the 1930s 75 reputedly after the third Marchioness had once slipped on its polished surface 85 The Arab Room in the Herbert Tower was the last room on which Burges was working when he fell ill in 1881 Bute placed Burges s initials together with his own and the date in the fireplace of that room as a memorial 86 The room was completed by Burges s brother in law Richard Popplewell Pullan 58 ",
