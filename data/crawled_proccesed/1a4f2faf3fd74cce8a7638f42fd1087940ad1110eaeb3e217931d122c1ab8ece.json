			"previous": " The current abbot of the Abbey of New Clairvaux Thomas X Davis first saw the stones and pictured them reassembled as a monastery on September 15 1955 his first day in California He arrived that day in San Francisco to serve as a new monk in Vina California at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow wine grapes 46 Davis s superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds From time to time in subsequent years Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition 29 ",
			"after": " In 1981 architectural historian Margaret Burke began working under a grant from the Hearst Foundation to inventory the remaining stones 29 She said it was an excavation project because of the weeds blackberry brambles and tree roots growing over them 29 Burke identified about 60 of the stones belonging to the chapter house a rectangular building originally spanning 31 by 46 feet 9 4 by 14 0 m She separated the chapter house stones surrounded them with a fence and began creating templates for rebuilding the arched entrances 39 During 1980 1982 the museum board sought 45 million for an expansion project that included 3 million for rebuilding the chapter house 2 Meanwhile Davis asked a museum staff member for permission to take several truckloads of stones to Vina to be used for architectural decoration Park workers helped him load the most ornate pieces he could find and they were hauled away Not told of the arrangement Burke discovered that Davis had taken some of the chapter house stones and the museum board insisted these be returned Davis was left with 58 stones from other monastery buildings 39 ",
