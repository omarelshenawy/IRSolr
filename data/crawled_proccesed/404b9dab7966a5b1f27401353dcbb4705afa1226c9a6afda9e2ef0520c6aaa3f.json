			"previous": " Many countries had both timber and stone castles 133 however Denmark had few quarries and as a result most of its castles are earth and timber affairs or later on built from brick 134 Brick built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone built counterparts Brick castles are less common in England than stone or earth and timber constructions and often it was chosen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries For example when Tattershall Castle was built between 1430 and 1450 there was plenty of stone available nearby but the owner Lord Cromwell chose to use brick About 700 000 bricks were used to build the castle which has been described as the finest piece of medieval brick work in England 135 Most Spanish castles were built from stone whereas castles in Eastern Europe were usually of timber construction 136 ",
