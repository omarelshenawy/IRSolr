			"after": " A temple needed many people to perform its rituals and support duties Priests performed the temple s essential ritual functions but in Egyptian religious ideology they were far less important than the king As temple decoration illustrates all ceremonies were in theory acts by the king and priests merely stood in his place The priests were therefore subject to the king s authority and he had the right to appoint anyone he wished to the priesthood In fact in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of the year to serve the temple in shifts 130 Once the priesthood became more professional the king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for the highest ranking positions usually to reward a favorite official with a job or to intervene for political reasons in the affairs of an important cult Lesser appointments he delegated to his vizier or to the priests themselves In such cases the holder of an office named his own son as his successor or the temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post 131 Priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by the wealthiest and most influential members of Egyptian society 132 until Roman economic reforms reduced the temples economic power 133 ",
