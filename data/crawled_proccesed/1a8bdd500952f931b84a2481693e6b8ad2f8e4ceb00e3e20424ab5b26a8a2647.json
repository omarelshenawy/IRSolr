			"previous": " Unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only in a handful of galaxies 23 these include the Milky Way the Local Group galaxies M31 and M32 and a few galaxies beyond the Local Group e g NGC 4395 In these galaxies the mean square or rms velocities of the stars or gas rises as 1 r near the center indicating a central point mass In all other galaxies observed to date the rms velocities are flat or even falling toward the center making it impossible to state with certainty that a supermassive black hole is present 23 Nevertheless it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole 24 The reason for this assumption is the M sigma relation a tight low scatter relation between the mass of the hole in the 10 galaxies with secure detections and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulges of those galaxies 25 This correlation although based on just a handful of galaxies suggests to many astronomers a strong connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself 24 ",
