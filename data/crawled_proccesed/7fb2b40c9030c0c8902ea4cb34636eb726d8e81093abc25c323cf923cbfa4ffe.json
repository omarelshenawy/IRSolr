			"previous": " Cloverleaves also use a considerable area of land and are more often found along older highways in rural areas and within cities with low population densities A variant design separates all turning traffic into a parallel carriageway to minimize the problem of weaving Collector and distributor roads are similar but are usually separated from the main carriageway by a divider such as a guard rail or Jersey barrier ",
			"after": " A stack interchange is a four way interchange whereby left turns are handled by semi directional flyover under ramps To go left right in countries with left hand drive vehicles first turn slightly right on a right turn off ramp to exit then complete the turn via a ramp which crosses both highways eventually merging with the right turn on ramp traffic from the opposite quadrant of the interchange A stack interchange then has two pairs of left turning ramps which can be stacked in various configurations above below or between the two interchanging highways ",
