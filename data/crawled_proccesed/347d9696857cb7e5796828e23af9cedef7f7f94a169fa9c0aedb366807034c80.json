			"previous": " Maslow used Einstein s writings and accomplishments to exemplify the characteristics of the self actualized person But Ruth Benedict and Max Wertheimer were also Maslow s models of self actualization In this case from a scientific perspective there are numerous problems with this particular approach First it could be argued that biographical analysis as a method is extremely subjective as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher Personal opinion is always prone to bias which reduces the validity of any data obtained Therefore Maslow s operational definition of Self actualization must not be blindly accepted as scientific fact 36 ",
			"after": " Maslow described human needs as ordered in a prepotent hierarchy a pressing need would need to be mostly satisfied before someone would give their attention to the next highest need None of his published works included a visual representation of the hierarchy The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher as an illustrative device This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs both physical and psychological as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow s needs theory and may give the impression that the Hierarchy of Needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression Yet starting with the first publication of his theory in 1943 Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid with many needs being present in a person simultaneously 38 ",
