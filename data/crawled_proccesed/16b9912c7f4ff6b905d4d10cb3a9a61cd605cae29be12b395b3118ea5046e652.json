			"previous": " All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils particularly lacking in phosphorus 54 The root system of the suckering forms of Banksia marginata in Victoria and South Australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root and an extensive system of thick lateral roots 7 5 15 cm 3 6 in below the surface During the winter months segments around 30 cm 1 ft in length develop vegetative buds capable of forming suckers 55 Clusters of fine proteoid roots up to 15 cm 6 in long arise from these lateral roots 56 ",
			"after": " The response of Banksia marginata to fire is variable In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed 36 38 They are serotinous storing their seed in old cones forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances generally 8 m 25 ft or less with those closest to the parent plant faring the best 57 In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and also eastern south Australia it grows as a low shrub which suckers shoots growing from lateral roots after fire Plants do not appear to live longer than 25 years 58 59 after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent 58 A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of Banksia marginata plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire There is anecodotal evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region 60 Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self select to be more flammable Banksia marginata tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily and fire would spread easily through it 61 ",
