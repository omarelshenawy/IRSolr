			"previous": " One of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance On 1 August the day of Uprising the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin 118 Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped receiving any oil from their depots 118 Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and more importantly directly from the Polish Prime Minister Stanis aw Miko ajczyk who informed them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans 118 119 The Red Army s halt and lack of support for the Polish resistance is seen as a calculated decision by Stalin to achieve certain post war political objectives 16 In other words had the Polish Home Army triumphed the Polish government in exile would have had legitimacy to continue the pre war government in Poland rendering the post war Polish communists regime invalid and likely rejected in all of the pre war Polish areas thus far liberated by the Red Army the news of planned Warsaw Uprising is likely one of the reason of speeding up the installation of communist regime on 22 July 1944 in Lublin Also the destruction of the main Polish resistance forces by the Germans was of direct benefit to Soviet Union since it significantly weakened any potential Polish opposition to planned and already started Soviet occupation Halting the advance and taking Warsaw in January 1945 enabled the Soviets to say they liberated Warsaw 16 ",
			"after": " One way or the other the presence of Soviet tanks in nearby Wo omin 15 kilometers to the east of Warsaw had sealed the decision of the Home Army leaders to launch the Uprising However as a result of the initial battle of Radzymin in the final days of July these advance units of the Soviet 2nd Tank Army were pushed out of Wo omin and back about 10 km 120 121 122 On 9 August Stalin informed Premier Miko ajczyk that the Soviets had originally planned to be in Warsaw by 6 August but a counter attack by four Panzer divisions had thwarted their attempts to reach the city 123 By 10 August the Germans had enveloped and inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet 2nd Tank Army at Wo omin 30 ",
