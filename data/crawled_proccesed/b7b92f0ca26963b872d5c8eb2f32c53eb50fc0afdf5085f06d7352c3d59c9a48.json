			"previous": " The right whales were first classified in the genus Balaena in 1758 by Carolus Linnaeus who at the time considered all of the right whales including the bowhead as a single species Through the 1800s and 1900s in fact the family Balaenidae has been the subject of great taxonometric debate Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale as one two three or four species either in a single genus or in two separate genera In the early whaling days they were all thought to be a single species Balaena mysticetus Eventually it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were in fact different and John Edward Gray proposed the genus Eubalaena for the right whale in 1864 Later morphological factors such as differences in the skull shape of northern and southern right whales indicated at least two species of right whale one in the Northern Hemisphere the other in the Southern Ocean 16 As recently as 1998 Rice in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification Marine mammals of the world systematics and distribution listed just two species Balaena glacialis the right whales and Balaena mysticetus the bowheads 17 ",
			"after": " In 2000 two studies of DNA samples from each of the whale populations concluded the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale 18 19 The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3 million and 12 million years 19 ",
