			"previous": " The F 16 s maneuverability was further enhanced by its slight aerodynamic instability This technique called relaxed static stability RSS was made possible by introduction of the fly by wire FBW flight control system FLCS which in turn was enabled by advances in computers and system integration techniques Analog avionics required to enable FBW operations became a fundamental requirement and began to be replaced by digital flight control systems in the latter half of the 1980s Likewise Full Authority Digital Engine Controls FADEC to electronically manage powerplant performance was introduced with the Pratt Whitney F100 turbofan The F 16 s sole reliance on electronics and wires to relay flight commands instead of the usual cables and mechanical linkage controls earned it the sobriquet of the electric jet Electronic FLCS and FADEC quickly became essential components of all subsequent fighter designs ",
