			"previous": " In October 2005 after a hundred years of neglect a part of the Mare aux Songes swamp was excavated by an international team of researchers To prevent malaria the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius which had to be removed Many remains were found including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity though no juveniles and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird which have been preserved in their natural position 107 These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden 63 of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus and 7 1 belonged to dodos which had been deposited within several centuries 4 000 years ago 108 Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4 200 years ago 107 Furthermore cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp which died of intoxication dehydration trampling and miring 109 Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp few were found during the 19th century probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting 73 In June 2007 adventurers exploring a cave in Mauritius discovered the most complete and best preserved dodo skeleton ever found The specimen was nicknamed Fred after the finder 110 ",
			"after": " Louis Etienne Thirioux an amateur naturalist at Port Louis also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations They included the first articulated specimen which is also the only subfossil dodo found outside the Mare aux Songes and the only remains of a juvenile specimen a now lost tarsometatarsus 2 42 The former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near Le Pouce mountain and is the only complete skeleton of an individual dodo and includes the only preserved kneecaps of the bird Thirioux donated it to the Museum Desjardins now Natural History Museum at Mauritius Institute where it is still on display 111 112 In 2014 this specimen was the basis for the first 3 D reconstruction of a complete dodo skeleton by using 3 D laser scanning technology The reconstruction was displayed in Berlin at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology 113 114 115 ",
