			"previous": " In 1928 four Supermarine Southampton flying boats of the RAF Far East flight arrived in Melbourne Australia The flight was considered proof that flying boats had evolved to become reliable means of long distance transport ",
			"after": " In the 1930s flying boats made it possible to have regular air transport between the U S and Europe opening up new air travel routes to South America Africa and Asia Foynes Ireland and Botwood Newfoundland and Labrador were the termini for many early transatlantic flights In areas where there were no airfields for land based aircraft flying boats could stop at small island river lake or coastal stations to refuel and resupply The Pan Am Boeing 314 Clipper planes brought exotic destinations like the Far East within reach of air travelers and came to represent the romance of flight ",
