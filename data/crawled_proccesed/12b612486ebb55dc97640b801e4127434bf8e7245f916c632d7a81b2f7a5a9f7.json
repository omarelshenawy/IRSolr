			"previous": " As had happened with the turboprops of only a few years earlier the success of the CRJ led to the introduction of a host of competitors The only successful example citation needed is the Embraer ERJ 145 which has seen excellent sales and has competed strongly with the CRJ in most markets Bombardier and Embraer have been locked in a series of counter lawsuits over export taxes and subsidies ever since The ERJ s success led to a totally new version the Embraer E Jets series Bombardier plans to build competing aircraft in response the CSeries It is currently in its developing stages ",
			"after": " Other competitors have not been successful Fairchild Dornier introduced the Fairchild Dornier 328JET to compete but went bankrupt soon afterwards and the type did not enter large scale production Their bankruptcy also ended development of the more competitive Fairchild Dornier 728 which had attracted strong airline interest The CRJ ERJ also resulted in the end of the BAe 146 line ",
