			"previous": " Others practice casual public nudity Topfree sunbathing is considered acceptable by many on the beaches of Finland France Spain Italy and most of the rest of Europe and even in some outdoor swimming pools however exposure of the genitals is restricted to nudist areas in most regions In the United States topfree sunbathing and wearing thongs are not common in many areas but are limited to nude beaches in various locations It is normally acceptable for men in the U S to be barechested or shirtless when engaged in outdoor recreational activities ",
			"after": " Where the social acceptability of nudity in certain places may be well understood the legal position is often less clear cut In England for example the law does not actually prohibit simple public nudity but does forbid indecent exposure citation needed In practice this means that successful prosecution hangs on whether there is a demonstrable intention to shock others rather than simply a desire to be nude in a public place Specifically using nudity to harass alarm or distress others is an offence against the Public Order Act of 1986 Occasional attempts to prove this point by walking naked around the country therefore often result in periods of arrest followed by release without charge and inconsistencies in the approach between different police jurisdictions Differences in the law between England and Scotland appear to make the position harder for naked ramblers once they reach Scotland ",
