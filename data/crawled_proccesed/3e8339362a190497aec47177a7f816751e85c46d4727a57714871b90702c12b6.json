			"previous": " Xenon is used in light emitting devices called xenon flash lamps which are used in photographic flashes and stroboscopic lamps 16 to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light 120 and occasionally in bactericidal lamps 121 The first solid state laser invented in 1960 was pumped by a xenon flash lamp 20 and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps 122 ",
			"after": " Continuous short arc high pressure xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators That is the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator that has a temperature close to that observed from the Sun After they were first introduced during the 1940s these lamps began replacing the shorter lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors 17 They are employed in typical 35mm IMAX and the new digital projectors film projection systems automotive HID headlights high end tactical flashlights and other specialized uses These arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and they have intense emissions in the near infrared which is used in some night vision systems ",
