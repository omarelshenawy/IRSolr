			"previous": " In 2004 Lancashire were relegated to the second division of the County Championship for the first time since the competition was restructured into two divisions 22 This was despite starting the season as the bookmarkers favourite to win the competition At one point in the season the team was without eight bowlers with James Anderson Andrew Flintoff and Sajid Mahmood on international duty while Glen Chapple Dominic Cork Kyle Hogg Peter Martin and all rounder Carl Hooper were all injured Their problems were not blamed solely on the injuries Watkinson said quite simply the opposition have done the basics better than us In addition we ve one or two who are out of form on top of the injury list which ripped us to pieces 23 Despite being relegated in the County Championship the team managed finish as runners up in the National League and were expected to be promoted back to the first division of first class cricket in the 2005 season 24 While Watkinson expected backlash from the fans he said that they were tremendously understanding about the injury situation 22 The squad underwent changes with six players leaving including Martin and Chris Schofield and six joining as well as a change of captain from wicket keeper Warren Hegg to batsman Mark Chilton 24 Chilton was the club s first Yorkshire born captain 25 Between 1864 and 2004 Lancashire played 2 790 matches winning 1 034 losing 583 drawing 1 170 with three tied matches In this period no other team had drawn more matches The team s percentage of wins was 37 06 third behind Yorkshire 44 05 and Surrey 39 74 26 ",
			"after": " Lancashire were promoted back to the first division of the county championship in 2005 winning the second division title in the process They stayed up in the National League progressed to the finals day of the Twenty20 Cup and were knocked out in the semi final of the C G Trophy 27 Despite winning the second division title there were concerns that the squad may have been getting too old and that there were limited opportunities for the younger players Of Lancashire s performance over the season Watkinson said I was not happy about our batting and although we have achieved what we set out to do get promoted our performance left a lot to be desired 28 Lancashire are one of three teams along with Middlesex and Surrey never to have finished bottom in the County Championship 10 On their return to the first division in the 2006 season Lancashire finished second in the Championship They also finished as runners up in the NatWest Trohpy 29 ",
