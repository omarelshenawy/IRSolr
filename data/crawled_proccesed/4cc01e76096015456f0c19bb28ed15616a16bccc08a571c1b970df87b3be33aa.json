			"after": " SOFIA uses a 2 5 meter reflector telescope which has an oversized 2 7 meter diameter primary mirror as is common with most large infrared telescopes 5 The optical system uses a Cassegrain reflector design with a parabolic primary mirror and a remotely configurable hyperbolic secondary In order to fit the telescope into the fuselage the primary is shaped to an f number as low as 1 3 while the resulting optical layout has an f number of 19 7 A flat tertiary dichroic mirror is used to deflect the infrared part of the beam to the Nasmyth focus where it can be analyzed An optical mirror located behind the tertiary mirror is used for a camera guidance system 6 ",
