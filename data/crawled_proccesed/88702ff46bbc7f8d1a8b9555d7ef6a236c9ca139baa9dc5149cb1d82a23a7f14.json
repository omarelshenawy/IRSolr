			"after": " Part of the reason for this is the extensive freeway system in the city due to the majority of that system being funded by local rather than federal funds through a cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985 Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways and no 3 digit interstates 282 ",
