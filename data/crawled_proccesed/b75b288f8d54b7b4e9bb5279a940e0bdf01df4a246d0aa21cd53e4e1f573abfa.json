			"previous": " Johnson remained with his close friend Harry Porter during a terminal illness 51 which ended in Porter s death on 3 September 1734 Porter s wife Elizabeth Jervis Porter otherwise known as Tetty was now a widow at the age of 45 with three children 52 Some months later Johnson began to court her The Reverend William Shaw claims that the first advances probably proceeded from her as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations 53 Johnson was inexperienced in such relationships but the well to do widow encouraged him and promised to provide for him with her substantial savings 54 They married on 9 July 1735 at St Werburgh s Church in Derby 55 The Porter family did not approve of the match partly because of the difference in their ages Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 46 Elizabeth s marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he severed all relations with her 56 However her daughter Lucy accepted Johnson from the start and her other son Joseph later came to accept the marriage 57 ",
			"after": " In June 1735 while working as a tutor for the children of Thomas Whitby a local Staffordshire gentleman Johnson had applied for the position of headmaster at Solihull School 58 Although Johnson s friend Gilbert Walmisley gave his support Johnson was passed over because the school s directors thought he was a very haughty ill natured gent and that he has such a way of distorting his face which though he can t help the gents think it may affect some lads 59 With Walmisley s encouragement Johnson decided that he could be a successful teacher if he ran his own school 60 In the autumn of 1735 Johnson opened Edial Hall School as a private academy at Edial near Lichfield He had only three pupils Lawrence Offley George Garrick and the 18 year old David Garrick who later became one of the most famous actors of his day 59 The venture was unsuccessful and cost Tetty a substantial portion of her fortune Instead of trying to keep the failing school going Johnson began to write his first major work the historical tragedy Irene 61 Biographer Robert DeMaria believed that Tourette syndrome likely made public occupations like schoolmaster or tutor almost impossible for Johnson This may have led Johnson to the invisible occupation of authorship 22 ",
