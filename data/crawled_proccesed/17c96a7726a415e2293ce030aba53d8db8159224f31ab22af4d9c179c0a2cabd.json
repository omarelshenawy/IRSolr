			"previous": " The hall like the chapel was largely built by Griffith Powell between 1613 and 1620 and was finally completed soon after his death in 1620 31 The panelling three tables and two benches date from Powell s time 102 It measures 54 by 25 feet 16 5 by 7 6 m and is a Grade I listed building 57 66 The fireplace was set in an enclosed hearth with a large projecting chimney breast in contrast to the traditional method of heating the hall which was by a brazier on an open hearth 103 A screen was installed in 1634 at a cost of 3 1s n 14 29 Pevsner noted the screen s elaborately decorated columns and the dragons along the frieze and said that it was one of the earliest examples in Oxford of panelling using four L shapes around a centre 74 91 Norwich said that the dragons on the screen were rather lovable 5 and Tyack said that they underlined the Welsh connections of the college 94 the red dragon is one of the national symbols of Wales The stone steps from the first quadrangle to the hall were added in 1637 29 During the 17th century changes were made to the interior of the hall Windows painted with various coats of arms were removed and a bay window was added on the west side 38 Pevsner commented that the hall windows themselves are different from all other 17th century Gothic windows in Oxford except for the exactly contemporary hall bay window of Exeter 3 ",
			"after": " In 1741 and 1742 a total of 423 17s 4d n 15 was spent on the hall which included the cost of covering the oak beamed roof with plaster and making rooms in the original roof space 37 38 Writing in 1891 Llewellyn Thomas noted that the plaster roof was added to create attic rooms to increase the accommodation of the lodgings He expressed the hope that the hall might soon regain its original proportions following the enlargement of the lodgings a few years previously 70 This has not happened and the plaster ceiling remains However in 2003 partitions between the rooms were knocked through to convert them into teaching rooms and the renovations enabled the upper part of the hall s hammerbeam roof to be seen from inside the rooms 104 Pevsner described the 1741 cartouche on the north wall which contains the college crest as large and rich 91 Tyack noted the lively Rococo plasterwork of the flat ceiling 105 In the early 19th century the east and west sides of the hall were crenellated and the roof was re slated 37 A clock was installed on the external wall of the hall in 1831 by the principal Henry Foulkes 68 There is a college tradition that students aim a champagne cork at the clock after finishing their final university examinations hitting it is supposed to mean that the student will obtain a first class honours degree 106 An extensive fire on 4 December 1913 threatened to destroy the hall before it was brought under control In the rebuilding work that followed a gallery was added to the hall with the balustrade joining the 1634 screen 96 The hall contains a portrait of Elizabeth I as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors 107 There are also portraits by court artists of two other monarchs who were college benefactors Charles I by Anthony van Dyck and Charles II by Sir Peter Lely 108 It has been said to be among the most impressive of all the Oxford college halls with its fine panelling austere ceiling and its notable paintings 109 ",
