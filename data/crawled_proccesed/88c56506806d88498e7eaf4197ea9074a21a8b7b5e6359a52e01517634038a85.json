			"after": " where W stands for fuel weight F for fuel flow and t for time  Endurance can factor into aviation design in a number of ways Some aircraft such as the P 3 Orion or U 2 spy plane require high endurance characteristics as part of their mission profile often referred to as loiter time on target The Endurance plays a prime factor in finding out the fuel fraction for an aircraft The Endurance like range is also related to fuel efficiency fuel efficient aircraft will tend to exhibit good endurance characteristics ",
