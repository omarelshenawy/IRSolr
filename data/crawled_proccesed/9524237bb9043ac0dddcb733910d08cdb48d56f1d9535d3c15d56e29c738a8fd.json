			"previous": " In aircraft overall propulsive efficiency is the efficiency in percent with which the energy contained in a vehicle s propellant is converted into useful energy to replace losses due to air drag gravity and acceleration It can also be stated as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft It is always less than 100 because of kinetic energy loss to the exhaust and less than ideal efficiency of the propulsive mechanism whether a propeller a jet exhaust or a fan In addition propulsive efficiency is greatly dependent on air density and airspeed ",
