			"previous": " The above lift equation neglects the skin friction forces which typically have a negligible contribution to the lift compared to the pressure forces By using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral we obtain an expression for the pressure drag Dp which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and if the wing is three dimensional the induced drag If we use the spanwise vector j we obtain the side force Y ",
