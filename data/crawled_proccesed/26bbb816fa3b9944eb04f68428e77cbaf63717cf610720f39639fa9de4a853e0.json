			"previous": " It was far from certain that the passenger 707 would be profitable At the time Boeing was making nearly all of its money from military contracts Its last passenger transport the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser had netted the company a 15 million loss before it was purchased by the Air Force as the KC 97 Stratofreighter 8 In a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside Seattle on August 7 1955 test pilot Tex Johnston performed a barrel roll in the 367 80 prototype 9 ",
			"after": " The 132 inch 3 350 mm wide fuselage of the Dash 80 was large enough for four abreast two plus two seating in the manner of the Stratocruiser Answering customers demands and under Douglas competition Boeing soon realized that this would not provide a viable payload so it widened the fuselage to 144 in 3 660 mm to allow five abreast seating and use of the KC 135 s tooling 10 Douglas Aircraft had launched its DC 8 with a fuselage width of 147 in 3 730 mm The airlines liked the extra space and six abreast seating and so Boeing increased the 707 s width again to compete this time to 148 in 3 760 mm 11 ",
