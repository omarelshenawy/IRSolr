			"previous": " The theoretical maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between This efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the Carnot heat engine although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency Mathematically this is because in reversible processes the change in entropy of the cold reservoir is the negative of that of the hot reservoir i e keeping the overall change of entropy zero Thus ",
			"after": " where is the absolute temperature of the hot source and that of the cold sink usually measured in kelvin Note that is positive while is negative in any reversible work extracting process entropy is overall not increased but rather is moved from a hot high entropy system to a cold low entropy one decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink ",
