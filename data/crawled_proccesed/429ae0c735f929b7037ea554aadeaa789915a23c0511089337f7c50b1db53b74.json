			"after": " The Andapa Basin surrounded by the high rugged mountains of Marojejy and Anjanaharibe Sud was extremely remote and difficult to access until relatively recently As a consequence the area was not permanently settled until the mid 1800s when refugees fled the Merina Kingdom Nearly half a century later another wave of refugees settled in the area this time fleeing from French colonists 47 The population in the region however remained relatively small despite a last small wave of immigration following World War I when people from R union came to the region to grow vanilla The population did not increase noticeably until the early 1970s when construction of the Andapa Sambava road was completed connecting the region to the coast This improved transportation route encouraged agricultural development and spawned another wave of immigration Over the next 30 years it was estimated that the population tripled with more than 100 000 people living in the region by 2003 4 With 37 villages surrounding Marojejy the population density is one of the highest in Madagascar and it continues to grow The dominant ethnic groups in the region are the Tsimihety the first settlers and the Betsimisaraka although other groups from the southern part of the island have also established themselves 4 47 ",
