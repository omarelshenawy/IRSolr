			"previous": " Sweden s doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814 During World War II Sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods 52 54 especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden which was vital to the German war machine 54 117 However Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943 ",
			"after": " During the early Cold War era Sweden combined its policy of non alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security policy based on strong national defence 118 The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack 119 At the same time the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc especially in the realm of intelligence exchange In 1952 a Swedish DC 3 was shot down over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet MiG 15 jet fighter Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO 120 Another plane a Catalina search and rescue plane was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well Prime Minister Olof Palme made an official visit to Cuba during the 1970s during which he denounced Fulgencio Batista s government and praised contemporary Cuban and Cambodian revolutionaries in a speech ",
