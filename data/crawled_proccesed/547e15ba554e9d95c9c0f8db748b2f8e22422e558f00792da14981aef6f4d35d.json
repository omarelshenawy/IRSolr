			"previous": " Allosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme distinct from the active site that bind to molecules in the cellular environment These molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme 46 In this way allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme s metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux through the rest of the pathway 47 ",
			"after": " Some enzymes do not need additional components to show full activity Others require non protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity 48 Cofactors can be either inorganic e g metal ions and iron sulfur clusters or organic compounds e g flavin and heme Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes which are released from the enzyme s active site during the reaction or prosthetic groups which are tightly bound to an enzyme Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound e g biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase 49 ",
