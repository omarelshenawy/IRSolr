			"previous": " Virgin and Child with Saints 23 a drawing in Stockholm s Nationalmuseum is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden 24 who possibly may have been the Master of the Koberger R ndblatter The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows from left to right an unidentified bishop saint with mitre and crosier making a blessing gesture a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint John the Baptist a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right looking at a book and holding the book a kneeling beardless male identified as John the Evangelist The drawing stops at the end of John s robe at about the point on the London panel where Joseph s walking stick meets John and the Magdalene s robes 24 This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work ",
			"after": " At an unknown point before 1811 the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces 25 possibly due to damage although The Magdalen fragment is in good condition The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well known collection of Dutch seventeenth century paintings 7 From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing it is estimated that the original was at least 1 m high by 1 5 m wide the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period 24 The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955 it was only after the layer s removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907 when they appear in the collection of L o Lardus in Suresnes France 23 ",
