			"previous": " Perhaps the first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices created by the Scottish monk Andrew Gordon in the 1740s 2 The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field Amp re s force law was discovered later by Andr Marie Amp re in 1820 The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821 A free hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury on which a permanent magnet PM was placed When a current was passed through the wire the wire rotated around the magnet showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire 3 This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments brine substituting for toxic mercury Though Barlow s wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century ",
			"after": " In 1827 Hungarian physicist nyos Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils After Jedlik solved the technical problems of the continuous rotation with the invention of commutator he called his early devices electromagnetic self rotors Although they were used only for instructional purposes in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors the stator rotor and commutator The device employed no permanent magnets as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ",
