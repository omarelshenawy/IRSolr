			"previous": " In the early 1950s a need to replace older designs and increase the size of the Soviet civil transport fleet a Soviet Council of Ministers directive was issued on 30 December 1955 to the chief designers Kuznetsov and Ivchenko to develop new turboprop engines and to Ilyushin and Antonov to design an aircraft to use these engines 1 The two aircraft designs were developed as the Ilyushin Il 18 and the Antonov An 10 and the engine chosen was the Kuznetsov NK 4 rather than the Ivchenko AI 20 1 ",
			"after": " The Il 18 design had started in 1954 before the directive was issued and experience with the piston engined Il 18 was used although the aircraft was a new design 1 The design was for a four engined low wing monoplane with a circular pressurised fuselage and a conventional tail 1 The forward retracting tricycle landing gear had four wheels fitted on the main leg bogies the main legs bogies rotated 90 degrees and retracted into the rear of the inboard engines 1 A new feature at the time was the fitting of a weather radar in the nose and it was the first soviet airliner to have an automatic approach system 1 The aircraft has two entry doors on the port side before and after the wing and two overwing emergency exits on each side 1 ",
