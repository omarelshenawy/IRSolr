			"previous": " In the 1940s the earliest electronic digital systems had no operating systems Electronic systems of this time were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plug boards These were special purpose systems that for example generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper cards After programmable general purpose computers were invented machine languages consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape were introduced that sped up the programming process Stern 1981 full citation needed ",
			"after": " In the early 1950s a computer could execute only one program at a time Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited period of time and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and or punched tape The program would be loaded into the machine and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine 5 ",
