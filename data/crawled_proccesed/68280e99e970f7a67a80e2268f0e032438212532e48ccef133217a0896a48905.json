			"after": " In 2011 the riverfront park landscaping surrounding the building which is referred to as Trump Plaza and Riverwalk or sometimes just Trump Plaza became the subject of controversy In 2010 the Plaza had earned special recognition at the Mayor Daley s Landscape Awards The press release noted the landscaping for their magnificent new civic landscape that is a poetic interpretation of native Illinois that seems at once sophisticated and familiar 16 However in 2011 the award winning plantings of small sumac trees ferns and native grasses with yellow orange and red hues were removed and replaced with evergreens like junipers and boxwoods pieces of gray stone and purple perennials catmint and salvia which may require significantly less watering To add to the controversy the planting was accompanied by a plan to light the trees to attract nighttime park visitors in conflict with the dark skies movement to reduce light pollution to facilitate better stargazing 17 ",
