			"previous": " A superphylum TACK has been proposed that includes the Thaumarchaeota Aigarchaeota Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota 21 This superphylum may be related to the origin of eukaryotes  The classification of archaea and of prokaryotes in general is a rapidly moving and contentious field Current classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors 14 These classifications rely heavily on the use of the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes to reveal relationships between organisms molecular phylogenetics 15 Most of the culturable and well investigated species of archaea are members of two main phyla the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota Other groups have been tentatively created For example the peculiar species Nanoarchaeum equitans which was discovered in 2003 has been given its own phylum the Nanoarchaeota 16 A new phylum Korarchaeota has also been proposed It contains a small group of unusual thermophilic species that shares features of both of the main phyla but is most closely related to the Crenarchaeota 17 18 Other recently detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms ARMAN which were discovered in 2006 19 and are some of the smallest organisms known 20 ",
			"after": " The classification of archaea into species is also controversial Biology defines a species as a group of related organisms The familiar exclusive breeding criterion organisms that can breed with each other but not with others is of no help because archaea reproduce asexually 22 ",
