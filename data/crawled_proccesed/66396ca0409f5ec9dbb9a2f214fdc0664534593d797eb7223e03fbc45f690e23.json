			"previous": " Also with respect to copyright the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization the Motion Picture Association of America In amicus briefs in important cases in lobbying before Congress and in its statements to the public the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual property rights In framing its presentations the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor Additionally Congress s awareness of the position of the United States as the world s largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property 90 These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry lending the MPAA even more power and authority 91 ",
			"after": " The growth of the Internet and particularly distributed search engines like Kazaa and Gnutella have represented a challenge for copyright policy The Recording Industry Association of America in particular has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement which the industry calls piracy The industry has had victories against some services including a highly publicized case against the file sharing company Napster and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems Equivalent provisions to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time and are being expanded in for example Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 91 250 EEC and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 98 84 EEC This can hinder legal uses affecting public domain works limitations and exceptions to copyright or uses allowed by the copyright holder Some copyleft licenses like GNU GPL 3 are designed to counter that 92 Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor s program or for accessibility reasons however distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal ",
