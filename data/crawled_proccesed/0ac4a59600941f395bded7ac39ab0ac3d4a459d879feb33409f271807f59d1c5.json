			"previous": " The Book of Kells contains the text of the four Gospels based on the Vulgate It does not however contain a pure copy of the Vulgate There are numerous differences from the Vulgate where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome s text Although such variants are common in all of the insular Gospels there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar ",
			"after": " The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters usually e or s The text is usually written in one long line across the page Fran oise Henry identified at least three scribes in this manuscript whom she named Hand A Hand B and Hand C 30 Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v folios 276 through 289 and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript Hand A for the most part writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall ink common throughout the West 30 Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128 Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A Hand C uses the same brownish gall ink used by hand A and wrote almost always seventeen lines per page 31 ",
