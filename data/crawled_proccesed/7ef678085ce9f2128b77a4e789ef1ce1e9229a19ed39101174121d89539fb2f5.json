			"previous": " Republicanism either support for a presidential or parliamentary republic as an enduring political movement appeared in Brazil during December 1870 in Rio de Janeiro with the publishing of a manifesto signed by 57 people and with the creation of the Republican Club 59 60 61 It represented an insignificant minority of scholars 62 There was no repudiation of or desire for eliminating slavery in the manifesto 59 In 1873 the Republican Party of S o Paulo was created and it affirmed that slavery would have to be resolved by the monarchist Conservative and Liberal parties The reason for this was because many of the republicans from S o Paulo were themselves slave owning farmers 63 The objective of most republicans was to wait until the death of Pedro II and by a plebiscite or other peaceful means prevent Princess Isabel from ascending the throne 60 64 65 Republicanism did not envisage any social readjustment such as improving the quality of life for former slaves and they were not revolutionaries in the deep meaning of the word 66 The republican movement had a slow and irregular evolution concentrated in the provinces south of Bahia more precisely in the provinces of S o Paulo Rio de Janeiro Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul 63 ",
			"after": " It was an extremely small group 67 with a precarious organization in the provinces 68 and no cohesion or connection among themselves 67 The only republican faction to achieve political clout was the Republican Party of S o Paulo which managed to elect two deputies to the Chamber of Deputies in 1884 60 though none were elected to the Empire s last legislature in 1889 68 In the 1880s it attracted sympathy in lesser numbers than slavery abolitionism and at a slower pace 69 Its numbers only increased after 1888 adding new adherents consisting of farmers who had been slave owners and who perceived themselves victims of an unjust abolition of slavery that had not included any type of indemnity to them 69 70 71 Even so in 1889 the avowed republicans were probably a small minority 72 as the republican ideals in reality had never managed to seduce the people Its dissemination was restricted to the intellectual and military fields 73 ",
