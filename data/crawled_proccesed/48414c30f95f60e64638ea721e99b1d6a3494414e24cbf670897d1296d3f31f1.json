			"previous": " The A318 was born out of mid 1990 studies between Aviation Industries of China AVIC Singapore Technologies Aerospace Alenia and Airbus on a 95 to 125 seat aircraft project The programme was called the AE31X and covered the 95 seat AE316 and 115 to 125 seat AE317 68 The former would have had an overall length of 31 3 m 102 ft 8 in while the AE317 was longer by 3 2 m 10 ft 6 in at 34 5 m 113 ft 2 in 69 The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls Royce BR715s CFM56 9s or the Pratt Whitney PW6000s 68 69 with the MTOW of 53 3 t 118 000 lb for the smaller version and 58 t 128 000 lb for the AE317 the thrust requirement were 77 9 84 6 kN 17 500 19 000 lbf and 84 6 91 2 kN 19 000 20 500 lbf respectively 69 Range was settled at 5 200 km 2 800 nmi and 5 800 km 3 100 nmi for the high gross weights of both variants 69 Both share a wingspan of 31 0 m 101 ft 8 in 69 and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family Costing 2 billion 1 85 billion to develop aircraft production to take place in China 68 ",
			"after": " Simultaneously Airbus was developing Airbus A318 In early 1998 Airbus revealed its considerations of designing a 100 seat aircraft based on the A320 The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998 after which Airbus officially announced an aircraft of its own the A318 70 at that year s Farnborough Airshow 71 The aircraft is the smallest product of Airbus s product range and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history the Airbus A380 First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995 it was shorter by 0 79 metre 2 ft 7 in ahead of the wing and 1 6 metres 5 ft 3 in behind 71 These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two class layout 72 Range was 5 700 kilometres 3 100 nmi or 5 950 kilometres 3 210 nmi with upcoming Sharklets 72 ",
