			"previous": " The woman s left ear is set according to art historian Norbert Schneider unnaturally high and far back parallel to her eyes rather than to her nose this position is probably an artistic device used to continue the flow of the diagonal line of the veil s inner right wing In the 15th century veils were normally worn for modesty to hide the sensuality of the flesh In this work the veil has the opposite effect the woman s face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty 10 ",
			"after": " The woman s hands are crossed tightly as if in prayer and positioned so low in the painting as to appear to be resting on the frame 11 They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head 12 Her slender fingers are minutely detailed van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists Her fingers are folded in layers their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting 10 and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting 12 ",
