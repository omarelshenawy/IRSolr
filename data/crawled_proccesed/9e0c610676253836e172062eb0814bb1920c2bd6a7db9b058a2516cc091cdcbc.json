			"after": " The white stork is a gregarious bird flocks of thousands of individuals have been recorded on migration routes and at wintering areas in Africa Non breeding birds gather in groups of 40 or 50 during the breeding season 22 The smaller dark plumaged Abdim s stork is often encountered with white stork flocks in southern Africa 64 Breeding pairs of white stork may gather in small groups to hunt and colony nesting has been recorded in some areas 65 However groups among white stork colonies vary widely in size and the social structure is loosely defined young breeding storks are often restricted to peripheral nests while older storks attain higher breeding success while occupying the better quality nests toward the centres of breeding colonies 66 Social structure and group cohesion is maintained by altruistic behaviours such as allopreening White storks exhibit this behaviour exclusively at the nest site Standing birds preen the heads of sitting birds sometimes these are parents grooming juveniles and sometimes juveniles preen each other 67 Unlike most storks it never adopts a spread winged posture though it is known to droop its wings holding them away from its body with the primary feathers pointing downwards when its plumage is wet 68 ",
