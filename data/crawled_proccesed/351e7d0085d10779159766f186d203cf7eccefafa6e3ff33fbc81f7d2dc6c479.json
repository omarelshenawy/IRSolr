			"after": " Several studies have shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged 28 29 30 Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years 27 In one case reported in Ovens Victoria the disease was spread to blueberry plants Vaccinium species via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting 31 In individual forest stands 32 fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees a discontinuous distribution 27 Large scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species 33 The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands shrubland and heath communities 34 It can be found on a wide range of hosts but is most commonly associated with in order of decreasing frequency jarrah Eucalyptus marginata bull banksia Banksia grandis marri E calophylla Lasiopetalum floribundum and Acacia saligna 35 It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo E wandoo 36 The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina and Pinus radiata in Chile 7 Armillaria luteobubalina uses an elaborate sophisticated aeration system that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs helping it thrive in low oxygen environments 37 38 When grown in culture the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so called air pores near the perforations These gas spaces connect the atmosphere with the central canal of the rhizomorph to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism s high oxygen requirement during growth This aeration system is thought to be an important factor in the organism s pathogenicity allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps where conditions may be hypoxic 38 The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially where lateral branches grow from a main stem 39 Although the structure of A luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient rich soil 40 ",
