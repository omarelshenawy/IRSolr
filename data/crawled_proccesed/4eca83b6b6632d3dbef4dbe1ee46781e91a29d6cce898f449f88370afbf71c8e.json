			"previous": " The number of vertebrae differs between specimens E regalis had thirteen neck vertebrae eighteen back vertebrae nine hip vertebrae and an unknown number of tail vertebrae 14 A specimen once identified as belonging to Anatosaurus edmontoni now considered to be the same as E regalis is reported as having an additional back vertebra and 85 tail vertebrae with an undisclosed amount of restoration 14 Other hadrosaurids are only reported as having 50 to 70 tail vertebrae 8 so this appears to have been an overestimate The anterior back was curved toward the ground with the neck flexed upward and the rest of the back and tail held horizontally 8 Most of the back and tail were lined by ossified tendons arranged in a latticework along the neural spines of the vertebrae This condition has been described as making the back and at least part of the tail ramrod straight 20 21 The ossified tendons are interpreted as having strengthened the vertebral column against gravitational stress incurred through being a large animal with a horizontal vertebral column otherwise supported mostly by the hind legs and hips 20 ",
			"after": " The shoulder blades were long flat blade like bones held roughly parallel to the vertebral column The hips were composed of three elements each an elongate ilium above the articulation with the leg an ischium below and behind with a long thin rod and a pubis in front that flared into a plate like structure The structure of the hip hindered the animal from standing with its back erect because in such a position the thigh bone would have pushed against the joint of the ilium and pubis instead of pushing only against the solid ilium The nine fused hip vertebrae provided support for the hip 5 ",
