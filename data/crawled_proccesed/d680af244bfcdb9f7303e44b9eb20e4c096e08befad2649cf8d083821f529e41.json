			"previous": " Another most ancient epithet is Lucetius although the Ancient followed by some modern scholars as e g Wissowa 119 interpreted it as referring to sunlight the carmen Saliare shows that it refers to lightning 120 A further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the sacred meaning of lightning which is reflected in the sensitivity of the flaminica Dialis to the phenomenon 121 To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet Elicius while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain as is testified by the ceremony of the Nudipedalia meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter 122 and the ritual of the lapis manalis the stone which was brought into the city through the Porta Capena and carried around in times of drought which was named Aquaelicium 123 Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are Pluvius Imbricius Tempestas Tonitrualis tempestatium divinarum potens Serenator Serenus 124 125 and referred to lightning Fulgur 126 Fulgur Fulmen 127 later as nomen agentis Fulgurator Fulminator 128 the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form Fulgur and the use of the term for the bidental the lightning well dug on the spot hit by a lightning bolt 129 ",
			"after": " A group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa and his followers as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine 130 131 The agricultural ones include Opitulus Almus Ruminus Frugifer Farreus Pecunia Dapalis 132 Epulo 133 Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro s Opitulus because he brings opem means relief to the needy Almus because he nourishes everything Ruminus because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them Pecunia because everything belongs to him 134 Dum zil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet Ruminus as Wissowa and Latte remarked may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including Rumina Ruminalis ficus Iuppiter Ruminus which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism preserved in inscriptions series that would be preserved in the sacred language cf Rumach Etruscan for Roman However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome Ruma meant in fact woman s breast 135 Diva Rumina as Augustine testifies in the cited passage was the goddess of suckling babies she was venerated near the ficus ruminalis and was offered only libations of milk 136 Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by Quintus Valerius Soranus while hypothesising Iuno more adept in his view as a breastfeeder i e Rumina instead of Ruminus might be nothing else than Iuppiter Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum ",
