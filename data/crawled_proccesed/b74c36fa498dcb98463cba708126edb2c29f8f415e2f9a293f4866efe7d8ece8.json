			"previous": " Plumage is regularly moulted the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the non breeding plumage or in the Humphrey Parkes terminology basic plumage breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey Parkes system as alternate plumages 92 Moulting is annual in most species although some may have two moults a year and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years Moulting patterns vary across species In passerines flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced the outermost tertiaries begin to drop After the innermost tertiaries are moulted the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers centrifugal moult The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap 93 A small number of species such as ducks and geese lose all of their flight feathers at once temporarily becoming flightless 94 As a general rule the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair 93 Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae 95 The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail 93 96 The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward secondaries inward and the tail from center outward 97 Before nesting the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation 98 ",
			"after": " Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily spending an average of around 9 of their daily time on this 99 The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland these secretions protect the feathers flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent inhibiting the growth of feather degrading bacteria 100 This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting to remove feather parasites 101 ",
