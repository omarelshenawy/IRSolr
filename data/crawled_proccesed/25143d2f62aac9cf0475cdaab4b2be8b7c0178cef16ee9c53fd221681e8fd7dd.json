			"previous": " Other approaches have been suggested over time including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans 89 Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation 90 dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop 89 or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons 91 Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone 92 These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others tropical cyclones are simply too large and short lived for any of the weakening techniques to be practical 93 ",
			"after": " Tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves heavy rain flood and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing shipwrecks 94 Tropical cyclones stir up water leaving a cool wake behind them which causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones 37 On land strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles The storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths 95 The broad rotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone and vertical wind shear at its periphery spawns tornadoes Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices which persist until landfall 96 ",
