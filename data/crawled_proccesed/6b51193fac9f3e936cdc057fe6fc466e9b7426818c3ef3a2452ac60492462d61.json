			"previous": " Many writers have speculated on the ways in which a friendly civilization might interact with humankind Albert Harrison a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California Davis 36 thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything how to use zero point energy or how to travel faster than light 37 They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences and even that artists may spearhead collaboration 38 Seth D Baum of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity 39 In contrast to these views however Paolo Musso a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics IAA and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess like humans a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile 40 ",
			"after": " Futurist Allen Tough suggests that an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization recalling its own past of war and plunder and knowing that it possesses superweapons that could destroy it would be likely to try to help humans rather than to destroy them 41 He identifies three approaches that a friendly civilization might take to help humanity 41 ",
