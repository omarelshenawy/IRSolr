			"previous": " Studies have sought to find the precise function of Mups in pheromone communication Mup proteins have been shown to promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects 38 45 However in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males even in the absence of urine 19 In addition Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ VNO a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors of mice and rats 19 46 Together this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves independent of their ligands 47 ",
			"after": " Consistent with a role in male male aggression adult male mice secrete significantly more Mups into their urine than females juveniles or castrated male mice The precise mechanism driving this difference between the sexes is complex but at least three hormones testosterone growth hormone and thyroxine are known to positively influence the production of Mups in mice 48 Wild house mouse urine contains variable combinations of four to seven distinct Mup proteins per mouse 49 Some inbred laboratory mouse strains such as BALB c and C57BL 6 also have different proteins expressed in their urine 20 However unlike wild mice different individuals from the same strain express the same protein pattern an artifact of many generations of inbreeding 50 51 One unusual Mup is less variable than the others it is consistently produced by a high proportion of wild male mice and is almost never found in female urine When this Mup was made in bacteria and used in behavioural testing it was found to attract female mice Other Mups were tested but they did not have the same attractive qualities suggesting the male specific Mup acts as a sex pheromone 52 Scientists named this Mup darcin as a humorous reference to Fitzwilliam Darcy the romantic hero from Pride and Prejudice 53 54 Taken together the complex patterns of Mups produced has the potential to provide a range information about the donor animal such as gender fertility social dominance age genetic diversity or kinship 19 55 56 Wild mice unlike laboratory mice that are genetically identical and which therefore also have identical patterns of Mups in the urine have individual patterns of Mup expression in their urine that act as a barcode to uniquely identify the owner of a scent mark 55 ",
