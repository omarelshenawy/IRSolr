			"previous": " Again as ambient temperature falls through increasing altitude or a cooler climate mechanical shaft speed must also decrease to remain at the same non dimensional point   2 mechanical shaft speed So as ambient temperature falls through increasing altitude or a cooler climate turbine entry temperature must also fall to stay at the same non dimensional point on the Husk Plot All the other non dimensional groups e g corrected flow axial and peripheral Mach numbers pressure ratios efficiencies etc will also stay constant ",
			"after": " Nowadays civil engines are usually flat rated on net thrust up to a kink point climate So at a given flight condition net thrust is held approximately constant over a very wide range of ambient temperature by increasing HP turbine rotor inlet temperature RIT or SOT However beyond the kink point SOT is held constant and net thrust starts to fall for further increases in ambient temperature 12 Consequently aircraft fuel load and or payload must be decreased ",
