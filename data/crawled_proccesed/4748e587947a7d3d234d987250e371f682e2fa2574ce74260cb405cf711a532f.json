			"previous": " A white stork pair raises a single brood a year The female typically lays four eggs though clutches of one to seven have been recorded 72 The eggs are white but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering They measure 72 58 mm 51 86 mm 2 857 in 2 042 in 88 and weigh 96 129 g 3 4 4 6 oz 72 of which 10 76 g 0 380 oz is shell 88 Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid so the brood hatches asynchronously beginning 33 to 34 days later The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings as is the case in some species weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents 89 90 This behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings White stork nestlings do not attack each other and their parents method of feeding them disgorging large amounts of food at once means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size Despite this this behaviour has not commonly been observed 89 ",
			"after": " The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates 45 Somewhat unexpectedly studies have found that later hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier hatching nestmates 91 The body weight of the chicks increases rapidly in the first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about 3 4 kg 7 5 lb in 45 days The length of the beak increases linearly for about 50 days 92 Young birds are fed with earthworms and insects which are regurgitated by the parents onto the floor of the nest Older chicks reach into the mouths of parents to obtain food 93 Chicks fledge 58 to 64 days after hatching 94 ",
