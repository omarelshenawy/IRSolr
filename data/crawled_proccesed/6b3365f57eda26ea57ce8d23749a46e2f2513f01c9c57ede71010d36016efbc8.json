			"after": " In the close coupled canard the foreplane is located just above and forward of the wing At high angles of attack and therefore typically at low speeds the canard surface directs airflow downward over the wing reducing turbulence which results in reduced drag and increased lift 29 Typically the foreplane creates a vortex which attaches to the upper surface of the wing stabilising and re energising the airflow over the wing and delaying or preventing the stall ",
