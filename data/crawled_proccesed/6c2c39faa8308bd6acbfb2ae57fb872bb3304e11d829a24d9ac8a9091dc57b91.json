			"previous": " Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure Using models of transport forecasting planners are able to predict future transport patterns On the operative level logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain Transport as a field is studied through transport economics the backbone for the creation of regulation policy by authorities Transport engineering a sub discipline of civil engineering must take into account trip generation trip distribution mode choice and route assignment while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering ",
			"after": " Because of the negative impacts incurred transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode as well as increased capacity Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy of the commons where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all Density of development depends on mode of transport with public transport allowing for better spacial utilization Good land use keeps common activities close to people s homes and places higher density development closer to transport lines and hubs to minimize the need for transport There are economies of agglomeration Beyond transportation some land uses are more efficient when clustered Transportation facilities consume land and in cities pavement devoted to streets and parking can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use An efficient transport system can reduce land waste ",
