			"after": " Seventeen species have been referred to the genus Psittacosaurus although only nine to eleven are considered valid today 3 37 38 36 This is the highest number of valid species currently assigned to any single dinosaur genus not including birds In contrast most other dinosaur genera are monospecific containing only a single known species The difference is most likely due to quirks of the fossil record While Psittacosaurus is known from hundreds of fossil specimens most other dinosaur species are known from far fewer and many are represented by only a single specimen With a very high sample size the diversity of Psittacosaurus can be analyzed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera resulting in the recognition of more species Most extant animal genera are represented by multiple species suggesting that this may have been the case for extinct dinosaur genera as well although most of these species may not have been preserved In addition most dinosaurs are known solely from bones and can only be evaluated from a morphological standpoint whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not normally be preserved in the fossil record such as behavior or coloration Therefore actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognized in this and other dinosaur genera 39 ",
