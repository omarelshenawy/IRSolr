			"after": " Instead of using a vernier mechanism which requires some practice to use the dial caliper reads the final fraction of a millimeter or inch on a simple dial  In this instrument a small precise rack and pinion drives a pointer on a circular dial allowing direct reading without the need to read a vernier scale Typically the pointer rotates once every inch tenth of an inch or 1 millimeter This measurement must be added to the coarse whole inches or centimeters read from the slide The dial is usually arranged to be rotatable beneath the pointer allowing for differential measurements the measuring of the difference in size between two objects or the setting of the dial using a master object and subsequently being able to read directly the plus or minus variance in size of subsequent objects relative to the master object ",
