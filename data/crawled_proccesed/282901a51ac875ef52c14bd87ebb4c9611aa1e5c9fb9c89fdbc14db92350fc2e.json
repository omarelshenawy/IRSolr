			"previous": " The end of the Cold War in 1991 led many governments to significantly decrease military spending as a peace dividend Air force inventories were cut Research and development programs working on fifth generation fighters took serious hits Many programs were canceled during the first half of the 1990s and those that survived were stretched out While the practice of slowing the pace of development reduces annual investment expenses it comes at the penalty of increased overall program and unit costs over the long term In this instance however it also permitted designers to make use of the tremendous achievements being made in the fields of computers avionics and other flight electronics which had become possible largely due to the advances made in microchip and semiconductor technologies in the 1980s and 1990s This opportunity enabled designers to develop fourth generation designs or redesigns with significantly enhanced capabilities These improved designs have become known as Generation 4 5 fighters recognizing their intermediate nature between the 4th and 5th generations and their contribution in furthering development of individual fifth generation technologies ",
			"after": " The primary characteristics of this sub generation are the application of advanced digital avionics and aerospace materials modest signature reduction primarily RF stealth and highly integrated systems and weapons These fighters have been designed to operate in a network centric battlefield environment and are principally multirole aircraft Key weapons technologies introduced include beyond visual range BVR AAMs Global Positioning System GPS guided weapons solid state phased array radars helmet mounted sights and improved secure jamming resistant datalinks Thrust vectoring to further improve transient maneuvering capabilities has also been adopted by many 4 5th generation fighters and uprated powerplants have enabled some designs to achieve a degree of supercruise ability Stealth characteristics are focused primarily on frontal aspect radar cross section RCS signature reduction techniques including radar absorbent materials RAM L O coatings and limited shaping techniques ",
