			"previous": " Airtankers or water bombers are fixed wing aircraft fitted with tanks that can be filled on the ground at an air tanker base or in the case of flying boats and amphibious aircraft by skimming water from lakes reservoirs or large rivers ",
			"after": " Various aircraft have been used over the years for firefighting In 1947 the United States Air Force and United States Forest Service experimented with World War II aircraft dropping water filled bombs The bombs were unsuccessful and internal water tanks were used instead 6 Though World War II and Korean War era bombers were for a long time the mainstay of the aerial firefighting fleet and are still in use 7 newer purpose built tankers are coming online The smallest are the Single Engine Air Tankers SEATs These are agricultural sprayers that generally drop about 800 US gallons 3 000 l of water or retardant An example is the Airtractor AT 802F which can deliver around 800 US gallons 3 000 l of water or fire retardant solution each drop Another is the Ukrainian Antonov An 2 biplane which can be fitted with floats that can scoop water from the surface of a body of water An advantage of the biplane is that it has a lower stall speed than a monoplane meaning it a can fly more slowly over a fire which enhances the accuracy of water or retardant drops Medium aircraft include the S 2 Tracker retrofitted with turboprop engines as the S 2T as used by the California Department of Forestry Fire Protection CDF as well as Conair Group Inc of Abbotsford British Columbia while the Douglas DC 4 the DC 7 the Lockheed C 130 Hercules P 2V Neptune Lockheed P 3 Orion and its commercial equivalent the Lockheed L 188 Electra as used by Air Spray Ltd of Red Deer Alberta and others have been used as heavy tankers ",
