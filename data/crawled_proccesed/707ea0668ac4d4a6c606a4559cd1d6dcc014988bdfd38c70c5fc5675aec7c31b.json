			"previous": " The foundations of a textile industry in Neilston were laid by the monks of Paisley Abbey who mastered the local woollen trade in the Middle Ages 14 Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century This developed into a spinning and dying industry and continued into the early 20th century Bleachfields and textile processing brought rapid socioeconomic growth to the village Neilston was one of the earliest centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution the process of bleaching linens was introduced into Neilston in 1765 and a mill in the parish was the second erected in Scotland 8 By 1780 cotton manufacturing and bleaching had become the main industry in Neilston the clear busy waters of the River Levern being well suited for power and processing 15 In the Old Statistical Account of Scotland 1792 compiled under the direction of Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster Neilston was noted to have two cotton mills employing together more than 300 people over half of them children 16 The local Minister was concerned for the children s welfare remarking on how they missed school to work in the mills where their lungs would be filled with cotton fluff and their skin spoiled by machine oil 16 ",
			"after": " Crofthead Mill known locally as Neilston Mill was established in 1792 17 It was one of seven large cotton mills on the banks of the River Levern between Neilston and Dovecothall and although it closed for business in the early 1990s 17 it is the only industrial structure from this period still standing 18 Because of the large size of the complex coupled with its short distance from the main residential core of Neilston it was described in 1830 at the peak of the industry s prosperity as a little town of its self 8 Other mills and factories have existed but have been demolished including Broadley Spinning and Weaving Factory and Gateside village and Spinning Mill 8 ",
