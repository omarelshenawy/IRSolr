			"previous": " Another limitation of current U S Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works thus copyright protection can only be obtained in original works of authorship 82 This definition excludes any works that are the result of community creativity for example Native American songs and stories current legislation does not recognize the uniqueness of indigenous cultural property and its ever changing nature Simply asking native cultures to write down their cultural artifacts on tangible mediums ignores their necessary orality and enforces a Western bias of the written form as more authoritative ",
			"after": " Other criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property both in duration and in scope  In addition as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies Patents have been granted for living organisms 83 and in the United States certain living organisms have been patentable for over a century 84 ",
