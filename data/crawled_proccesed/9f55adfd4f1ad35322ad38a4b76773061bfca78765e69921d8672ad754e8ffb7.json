			"previous": " Upon gaining independence from Portugal in 1822 the Brazilian nation as a whole was almost entirely in favor of a monarchical form of government 1 There were a variety of reasons for this political choice There was fear among various social groups of the possibility that Brazil would fall into the same political social and economic chaos experienced by most of the former Spanish American colonies territorial dismemberment coups dictatorships and the rise of caudillos The perceived necessity was for a political structure that would permit the Brazilian people not merely to enjoy the advantages of liberty but also that would guarantee the country s stability in conformance with the liberalism of the time Only a neutral entity completely independent of parties groups or opposing ideologies could achieve this end And there was always a powerful ideological element remaining from independence as the result of a great national union over particular interests 2 The Brazilian monarchy was a form of government that assured a Brazil that would include the whole of the old Portuguese dominion in a climate of order peace and freedom 3 ",
			"after": " There was also another reason for adoption of the monarchy or more precisely its maintenance The Europeans as much as the Africans and the native Americans came from monarchical societies To remain under this form of government was a way of maintaining the traditions and identity of the Brazilian people a people descended from those three distinct ethnic groups The choice of a member of the House of Braganza came not just from the historical moment but also from the fact that Prince Pedro descended from the pure male line of the Portuguese kings The House of Braganza originated with Afonso 1st Duke of Braganza an illegitimate son of John I of the House of Aviz who in turn was the son of Peter I of the House of Burgundy which was founded 300 years earlier in 1143 by Afonso Henriques first king of Portugal Thus the strong popular appeal of the monarchy and a tradition of more than three hundred years or seven hundred if Portuguese history is considered enabled Prince Pedro to take on the role of a symbol of national unity 4 The monarchical regime maintained on Brazilian soil was a force of continuity and tradition 5 ",
