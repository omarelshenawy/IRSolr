			"previous": " Lindow Man and Lindow III were found to have elevated levels of copper on their skin The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes although a study by Pyatt et al proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper based pigment 28 To test this skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al may have been correct However the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors 29 Similarly green deposits were found in the hair originally thought to be a copper based pigment used for decoration but it was later found to be the result of a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog 24 ",
			"after": " Dating Lindow Man is problematic as samples from the body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900 year period Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300 BC Lindow Man himself has a different date 32 Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body later tests suggested a date between 2 BC and 119 AD 33 34 There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man s death may have been a ritual sacrifice or execution 34 Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought Archaeologist P C Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300 years old 35 Geographer K E Barber has argued against this hypothesis saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed 36 ",
