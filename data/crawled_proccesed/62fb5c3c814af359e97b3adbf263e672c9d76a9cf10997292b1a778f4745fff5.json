			"after": " The ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food increasing the variety and availability of nutrients The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather enabling them to live in cooler climates Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay Evidence of cooked food is found from 1 9 million years ago citation needed although there is a theory that fire could have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 000 000 years ago 16 18 Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago suggesting regular use from this time interestingly resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time 16 The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated with its being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from tens of thousands of years ago 16 ",
