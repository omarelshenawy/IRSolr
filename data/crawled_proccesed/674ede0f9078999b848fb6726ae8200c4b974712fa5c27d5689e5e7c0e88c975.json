			"previous": " After the death of Henry II Catherine abandoned the palace of the Tournelles where Henry had lain after a lance fatally pierced his eye and brain in a joust 46 To replace the Tournelles she decided in 1563 to build herself a new Paris residence on the site of some old tile kilns or tuileries The site was close to the congested Louvre where she kept her household The grounds extended along the banks of the Seine and afforded a view of the countryside to the south and west 47 The Tuileries was the first palace that Catherine had planned from the ground up It was to grow into the largest royal building project of the last quarter of the sixteenth century in western Europe Her massive building schemes would have transformed western Paris as seen from the river into a monumental complex 48 ",
			"after": " To design the new palace Catherine brought back Philibert de l Orme from disgrace This arrogant genius had been sacked as superintendent of royal buildings at the end of Henry II s reign after making too many enemies 49 De l Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture but his ideas are not fully known It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles De l Orme is said to have taught France the classical style lucid rational and regular 50 He notes however that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen 51 The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to Bullant s later work and to a less classical style of architecture 52 ",
