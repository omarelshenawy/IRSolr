			"previous": " The rotary engine popular during World War I quickly disappeared having reached its peak as rotational forces prevented more fuel and air from being delivered to the cylinders which limited horsepower They were replaced chiefly by the stationary radial engine though major advances led to inline engines which gained ground with several exceptional engines including the 1 145 cu in 18 76 l V 12 Curtiss D 12 Aircraft engines increased in power several fold over the period going from a typical 180 hp 130 kW in the 1918 Fokker D VII to 900 hp 670 kW in the 1938 Curtiss P 36 The debate between the sleek in line engines versus the more reliable radial models continued with naval air forces preferring the radial engines and land based forces often choosing in line units Radial designs did not require a separate and vulnerable cooling system but had increased drag In line engines often had a better power to weight ratio but there were radial engines that kept working even after having suffered significant battle damage ",
			"after": " Some air forces experimented with heavy fighters called destroyers by the Germans These were larger usually twin engined aircraft sometimes adaptations of light or medium bomber types Such designs typically had greater internal fuel capacity thus longer range and heavier armament than their single engine counterparts In combat they proved vulnerable to more agile single engine fighters ",
