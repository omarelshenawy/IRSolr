			"previous": " Zinc I compounds are rare and requires bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state Most zinc I compounds contains formally the Zn2 2 core which is analogous to the Hg2 2 dimeric cation present in mercury I compounds The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure The first zinc I compound containing the Zn Zn bond 5 C5Me5 2Zn2 is also the first dimetallocene The Zn2 2 ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc II and has only been obtained as a yellow glass formed by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2 40 ",
