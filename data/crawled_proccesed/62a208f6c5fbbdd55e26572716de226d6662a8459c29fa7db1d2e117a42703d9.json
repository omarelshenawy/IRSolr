			"previous": " After metamorphosis young adults may disperse into terrestrial habitats or continue to live in water Almost all species of frogs are carnivorous as adults preying on invertebrates including arthropods worms snails and slugs A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs small mammals and fish Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast moving prey while others push food into their mouths with their hands A few species also eat plant matter the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous its diet including a large proportion of fruit 127 Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants 128 129 and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus with plants constituting 79 5 of its diet by volume 130 Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators The northern leopard frog Rana pipiens is eaten by herons hawks fish large salamanders snakes raccoons skunks mink bullfrogs and other animals 131 ",
			"after": " Frogs are primary predators and an important part of the food web Being cold blooded they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes while the rest is transformed into biomass They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates most of which feed on plants By reducing herbivory they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem 132 ",
