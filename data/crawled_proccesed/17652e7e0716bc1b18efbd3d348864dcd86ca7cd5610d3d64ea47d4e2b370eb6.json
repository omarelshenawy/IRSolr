			"previous": " The Twin Otter incorporated flaperons that drooped the ailerons as part of the flaps but these were not included in the Dash 7 due to weight and complexity Instead the ailerons were reduced in size to allow more flap area and were augmented with two sets of roll spoilers or spoilerons The inboard roll spoilers operate at all speeds while the outboard roll spoilers only operate at speeds less than 130KIAS to allow for more roll control at slower speeds Upon touchdown both the inboard and outboard roll spoilers extend in unison to aid in destroying lift created by the wing Each wing also includes two ground spoilers which only extend on touchdown Most of the trailing edge is spanned by a complex double Fowler flap arrangement for high lift at low speed During a typical STOL landing flaps are selected to the 45 position allowing for steeper descents and slower approach speeds Depending on weight the VREF speed with flaps at 45 is between 70 85 knots On touchdown through squat switches in the main gear the flaps automatically retract to the 25 position and thus reduce lift once on the runway producing better braking performance The flaps also retract to 25 when engine power is increased during a go around procedure The four engine layout aids lift at low speeds due to the wide span of the propellers blowing air over the wing propwash When reverse thrust is selected on landing the props reverse pitch push air forward and slow the aircraft very effectively along with the anti skid wheel brakes More importantly if an engine fails the asymmetric thrust is much less than on a twin engine layout thereby increasing safety and allowing for a lower VMC minimum control speed with an engine inoperative ",
			"after": " Development started in 1972 and the prototype first flew on March 27 1975 Testing went smoothly and the first delivery took place to Rocky Mountain Airways on February 3 1978 The Dash 7 enabled Rocky Mountain Airways to operate scheduled passenger air service from Denver into the Avon STOLport in Colorado which was controlled by the airline The Avon STOLport was located in a mountain valley in close proximity to the Vail ski resort Another close in ski resort airfield served by Rocky Mountain Airways with Dash 7 flights from Denver was Steamboat Springs Airport in Colorado With a relatively short runway length of 4 452 feet and an airfield elevation of 6 882 feet the Dash 7 was well suited for operations from this airport located in the Rocky Mountains ",
