			"previous": " The passenger version named 747 8 Intercontinental or 747 8I is designed to carry up to 467 passengers in a 3 class configuration and fly more than 8 000 nmi 15 000 km at Mach 0 855 As a derivative of the already common 747 400 the 747 8 has the economic benefit of similar training and interchangeable parts 173 The type s first test flight occurred on March 20 2011 174 At its introduction the 747 8 surpassed the Airbus A340 600 as the world s longest airliner The first 8I was delivered in May 2012 to Lufthansa 175 The 747 8 has received 120 total orders including 69 for the 8F and 51 for the 8I As of May 2014 update 3 ",
			"after": " Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage  During the late 1960s and early 1970s Boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with three engines to compete with the smaller L 1011 TriStar and DC 10 The 747 trijet would have had more payload range and passenger capacity than the L 1011 and DC 10 The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S duct intake similar to the L 1011 s However engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four engine 747 resulting in the 747SP 183 ",
