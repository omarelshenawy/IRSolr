			"previous": " Almost the entire Space Shuttle re entry procedure except for lowering the landing gear and deploying the air data probes was normally performed under computer control However the re entry could be flown entirely manually if an emergency arose The approach and landing phase could be controlled by the autopilot but was usually hand flown ",
			"after": " The vehicle began re entry by firing the Orbital maneuvering system engines while flying upside down backside first in the opposite direction to orbital motion for approximately three minutes which reduced the Shuttle s velocity by about 200 mph 322 km h The resultant slowing of the Shuttle lowered its orbital perigee down into the upper atmosphere The Shuttle then flipped over by pushing its nose down which was actually up relative to the Earth because it was flying upside down This OMS firing was done roughly halfway around the globe from the landing site ",
