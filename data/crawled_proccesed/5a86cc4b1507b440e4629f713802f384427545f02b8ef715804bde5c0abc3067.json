			"previous": " At the age of 16 Johnson was given the opportunity to stay with his cousins the Fords at Pedmore Worcestershire 24 There he became a close friend of Cornelius Ford who employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school 25 Ford was a successful well connected academic but he was also a notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years later 26 After spending six months with his cousins Johnson returned to Lichfield but Mr Hunter the headmaster angered by the impertinence of this long absence refused to allow Samuel to continue at the grammar school 27 Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School Johnson was enrolled into the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge 25 Because the school was located near Pedmore Johnson was able to spend more time with the Fords and he began to write poems and verse translations 27 However he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents home in Lichfield 28 ",
