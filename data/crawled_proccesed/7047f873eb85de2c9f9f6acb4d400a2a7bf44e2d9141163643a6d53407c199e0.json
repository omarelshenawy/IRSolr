			"after": " When in flight the movements of the condor are remarkably graceful The lack of a large sternum to anchor their correspondingly large flight muscles restricts them to being primarily soarers The birds flap their wings when taking off from the ground but after attaining a moderate elevation they largely glide sometimes going for miles without a single flap of their wings They have been known to fly up to speeds of 90 km h 55 mph and as high as 4 600 m 15 000 ft 37 They prefer to roost on high perches from which they can launch without any major wing flapping effort Often these birds are seen soaring near rock cliffs using thermals to aid them in keeping aloft 38 ",
