			"previous": " During the 1760s and early 1770s relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained primarily due to resentment of the British Parliament s attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent 56 This was summarised at the time by the slogan No taxation without representation a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self government In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule leading to the outbreak of war in 1775 The following year in 1776 the United States declared independence The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781 Britain began negotiating peace terms American independence was acknowledged at the Peace of Paris in 1783 57 ",
			"after": " The loss of such a large portion of British America at the time Britain s most populous overseas possession is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the first and second empires 58 in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia the Pacific and later Africa Adam Smith s Wealth of Nations published in 1776 had argued that colonies were redundant and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal 55 59 The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith s view that political control was not necessary for economic success 60 61 ",
