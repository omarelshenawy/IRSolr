			"previous": " Germany s first pre dreadnoughts the Brandenburg class were laid down in 1890 By 1905 a further 19 battleships were built or under construction thanks to the sharp increase in naval expenditure justified by the 1898 and 1900 Navy Laws 38 This increase was due to the determination of the navy chief Alfred von Tirpitz and the growing sense of national rivalry with the UK Besides the Brandenburg class German pre dreadnoughts include the ships of the Kaiser Friedrich III Wittelsbach and Braunschweig classes culminating in the Deutschland class which served in both World Wars On the whole the German ships were less powerful than their British equivalents but equally robust 39 ",
			"after": " Russia equally entered into a programme of naval expansion in the 1890s one of Russia s main objectives was to maintain its interests against Japanese expansion in the Far East The Petropavlovsk class begun in 1892 took after the British Royal Sovereigns later ships showed more French influence on their design such as the Borodino class The weakness of Russian shipbuilding meant that many ships were built overseas for Russia the best ship the Retvizan being largely constructed in America 40 The Russo Japanese War of 1904 05 was a disaster for the Russian pre dreadnoughts of the 15 battleships completed since Petropavlovsk eleven were sunk or captured during the war One of these the famous Potemkin mutinied and was scuttled however she was later raised and recommissioned After the war Russia completed four more pre dreadnoughts after 1905 ",
