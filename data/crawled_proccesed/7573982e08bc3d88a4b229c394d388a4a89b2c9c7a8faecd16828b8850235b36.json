			"previous": " In the spring of 1912 in search of a change from his unrewarding clerical job Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket 34 He reasoned that by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers he would be able to finance his winter studies of music and literature 35 His application was successful and in May 1912 he began his duties He worked initially under Attewell a former Nottinghamshire professional n 3 and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright 37 38 Cardus established good working relations with both of these but identified most closely with Cyril Alington the school s headmaster Because of Alington I call myself an old Salopian 39 Alington first detected Cardus s intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray s translation of Euripides s drama Medea 40 In August 1914 in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington s secretary after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight 41 ",
			"after": " Cardus did not find his duties at Shrewsbury onerous 42 He made frequent trips to Manchester for Hall concerts or to watch Thomas Beecham conduct at the Manchester Opera House 43 He found time for other work thus in 1913 he was the music critic for the northern edition of The Daily Citizen 4 This short lived newspaper was an official organ of the early Labour Party 44 mainly out of admiration for Bernard Shaw Cardus had joined the Independent Labour Party a separate organisation from the main body but quickly lost interest in socialism Their creed or system was obviously not to be a means to an end but an end in itself 45 According to Brookes the influence of Shrewsbury School affected Cardus to the extent that t he playing fields of an English public school were for him a more natural setting than the iconoclastic frenzy of the Lyons caf where socialism vied with Richard Strauss for pride of place in the race to modernity 46 The Daily Citizen paid poorly and Cardus s association with it soon ended 47 n 4 ",
