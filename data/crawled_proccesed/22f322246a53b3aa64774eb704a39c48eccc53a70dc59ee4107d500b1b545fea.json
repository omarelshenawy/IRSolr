			"previous": " In a status conscious society like that of the Romans clothing and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer 389 Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order 390 The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen but it was heavy and impractical worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites and for going to court 391 Contrary to popular perception the clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics cloaks and in some regions trousers 392 The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value and surviving textiles from the period are rare 393 ",
			"after": " The basic garment for all Romans regardless of gender or wealth was the simple sleeved tunic The length differed by wearer a man s reached mid calf but a soldier s was somewhat shorter a woman s fell to her feet and a child s to its knees 394 The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural dull shades with the length determined by the type of work they did Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes clavi woven vertically into the fabric the wider the stripe the higher the wearer s status 394 Other garments could be layered over the tunic ",
