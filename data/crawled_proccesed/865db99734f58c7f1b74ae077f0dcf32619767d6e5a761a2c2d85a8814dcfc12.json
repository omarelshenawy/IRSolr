			"after": " A tax haven is a state country or territory where certain taxes are levied at a low rate or not at all which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion 38 Individuals and or corporate entities can find it attractive to move themselves to areas with reduced taxation This creates a situation of tax competition among governments Taxes vary substantially across jurisdictions 39 Sovereign states have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories unless limited by previous international treaties The central feature of a tax haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions 40 In its December 2008 report on the use of tax havens by American corporations 41 the U S Government Accountability Office was unable to provide a satisfactory definition of a tax haven but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it nil or nominal taxes lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities lack of transparency in the operation of legislative legal or administrative provisions no requirement for a substantive local presence and self promotion as an offshore financial center ",
