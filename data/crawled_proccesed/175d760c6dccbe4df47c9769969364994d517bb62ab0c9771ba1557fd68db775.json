			"previous": " Wave functions change as time progresses The Schr dinger equation describes how wavefunctions change in time playing a role similar to Newton s second law in classical mechanics The Schr dinger equation applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity like a classical particle with no forces acting on it However the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a definite certain position eigenstate 30 ",
			"after": " Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant or independent of time such as when in a stationary state of constant energy time vanishes in the absolute square of the wave function Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such static wave functions For example a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus Fig 1 note however that only the lowest angular momentum states labeled s are spherically symmetric 31 ",
