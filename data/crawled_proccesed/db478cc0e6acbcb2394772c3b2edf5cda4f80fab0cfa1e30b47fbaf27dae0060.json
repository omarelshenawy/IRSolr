			"previous": " It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to English literature was in popularising the literary use of the vernacular English rather than French or Latin English had however been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer s life and several of Chaucer s contemporaries John Gower William Langland and the Pearl Poet also wrote major literary works in English It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it citation needed It is interesting to note that although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions such as The Flower and the Leaf which was translated by John Dryden modern English spelling and orthography owes much more to the innovations made by the Court of Chancery in the decades during and after his lifetime citation needed ",
			"after": " While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems the Book of the Duchess is believed to have been written for John of Gaunt on the occasion of his wife s death in 1368 the intended audience of The Canterbury Tales is more difficult to determine Chaucer was a courtier leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for the nobility He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by Eustache Deschamps and by his contemporary John Gower It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud which is probable as this was a common activity at the time However it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer rather than the speaker of the work Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult since the audience is part of the story This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader 53 ",
