			"previous": " When quantum mechanics was originally formulated it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non relativistic classical mechanics For instance the well known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator ",
			"after": " Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified in their quantized forms into a single quantum field theory known as electroweak theory by the physicists Abdus Salam Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work 35 ",
