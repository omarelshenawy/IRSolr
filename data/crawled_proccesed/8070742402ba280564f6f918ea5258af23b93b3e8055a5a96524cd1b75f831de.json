			"previous": " Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria the other three are Neovenatoridae 32 Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae 15 Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae which would make it paraphyletic one recent example being Gregory S Paul s Predatory Dinosaurs of the World 33 but this has been rejected with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods the Coelurosauria 34 Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review 15 Another genus Epanterias is a potential valid member but it and Saurophaganax may turn out to be large examples of Allosaurus 10 Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus 5 15 ",
			"after": " The discovery and early study of Allosaurus is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the Bone Wars of the late 19th century The first described fossil in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden in 1869 It came from Middle Park near Granby Colorado probably from Morrison Formation rocks The locals had identified such bones as petrified horse hoofs Hayden sent his specimen to Joseph Leidy who identified it as half of a tail vertebra and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus Poekilopleuron as Poicilopleuron sic valens 35 He later decided it deserved its own genus Antrodemus 36 ",
