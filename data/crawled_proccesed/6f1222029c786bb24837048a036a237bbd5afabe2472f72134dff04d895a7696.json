			"after": " The giant otter is clearly distinguished from other otters by morphological and behavioral characteristics It has the greatest body length of any species in the mustelid family although the sea otter may be heavier Males are between 1 5 and 1 7 m 4 9 and 5 6 ft in length from head to tail and females between 1 and 1 5 m 3 3 and 4 9 ft The animal s well muscled tail can add a further 70 cm 28 in to the total body length 20 21 Early reports of skins and living animals suggested exceptionally large males of up to 2 4 m 7 9 ft intensive hunting likely reduced the occurrence of such massive specimens Weights are between 26 and 32 kg 57 and 71 lb for males and 22 and 26 kg 49 and 57 lb for females 22 The giant otter has the shortest fur of all otter species it is typically chocolate brown but may be reddish or fawn and appears nearly black when wet 23 The fur is extremely dense so much so that water cannot penetrate to the skin 24 Guard hairs trap water and keep the inner fur dry the guard hairs are approximately 8 millimeters one third of an inch in length about twice as long as the fur of the inner coat 25 Its velvety feel makes the animal highly sought after by fur traders and has contributed to its decline 26 Unique markings of white or cream fur color the throat and under the chin allow individuals to be identified from birth 23 Giant otters use these marks to recognize one another and upon meeting other otters they engage in a behavior known as periscoping displaying their throats and upper chests to each other ",
