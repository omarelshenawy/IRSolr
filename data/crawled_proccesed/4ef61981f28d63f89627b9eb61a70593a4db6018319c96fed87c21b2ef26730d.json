			"previous": "  In missile literature originating from Russian sources 1 thrust vectoring is often referred as gas dynamic steering or gas dynamic control ",
			"after": " Thrust vector control is effective only while the propulsion system is creating thrust At other stages of flight separate mechanisms are required for attitude and flight path control  Nominally the line of action of the thrust vector of a rocket nozzle passes through the vehicle s center of mass generating zero net moment about the mass center It is possible to generate pitch and yaw moments by deflecting the main rocket thrust vector so that it does not pass through the mass center Because the line of action is generally oriented nearly parallel to the roll axis roll control usually requires the use of two or more separately hinged nozzles or a separate system altogether such as fins 2 or vanes in the exhaust plume of the rocket engine deflecting the main thrust ",
