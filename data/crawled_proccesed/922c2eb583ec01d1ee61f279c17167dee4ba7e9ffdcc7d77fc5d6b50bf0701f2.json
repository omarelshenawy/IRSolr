			"previous": " It is the only member of its genus and it is most closely related to honeyeaters of the genus Melithreptus Three subspecies are recognised At around 29 5 cm 11 6 in in length the blue faced species is large for a honeyeater Its plumage is distinctive with olive upperparts white underparts and a black head and throat with white nape and cheeks Males and females are similar in external appearance Adults have a blue area of bare skin on each side of the face readily distinguishing them from juveniles which have yellow or green patches of bare skin ",
			"after": " Found in open woodland parks and gardens the blue faced honeyeater is common in northern and eastern Australia and southern New Guinea It appears to be sedentary in parts of its range and locally nomadic in other parts however the species has been little studied Its diet is mostly composed of invertebrates supplemented with nectar and fruit They often take over and renovate old babbler nests in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs ",
