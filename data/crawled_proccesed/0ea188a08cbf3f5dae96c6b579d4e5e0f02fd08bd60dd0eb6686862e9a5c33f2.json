			"previous": " Once the domain typically an interval and degree of the polynomial are chosen the polynomial itself is chosen in such a way as to minimize the worst case error That is the goal is to minimize the maximum value of where P x is the approximating polynomial f x is the actual function and x varies over the chosen interval For well behaved functions there exists an Nth degree polynomial that will lead to an error curve that oscillates back and forth between and a total of N 2 times giving a worst case error of It is seen that an Nth degree polynomial can interpolate N 1 points in a curve Such a polynomial is always optimal It is possible to make contrived functions f x for which no such polynomial exists but these occur rarely in practice ",
