			"previous": " During the 1930s Friedrich s work was used in the promotion of Nazi ideology 90 which attempted to fit the Romantic artist within the nationalistic Blut und Boden 7 It took decades for Friedrich s reputation to recover from this association with Nazism His reliance on symbolism and the fact that his work fell outside the narrow definitions of modernism contributed to his fall from favour In 1949 art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that Friedrich worked in the frigid technique of his time which could hardly inspire a school of modern painting and suggested that the artist was trying to express in painting what is best left to poetry 88 91 Clark s dismissal of Friedrich reflected the damage the artist s reputation sustained during the late 1930s 88 ",
			"after": " Friedrich s reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of Hollywood directors such as Walt Disney built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F W Murnau within the horror and fantasy genres 92 His rehabilitation was slow but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann Helmut B rsch Supan and Sigrid Hinz who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work and placed it within a purely art historical context 92 By the 1970s he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians ",
