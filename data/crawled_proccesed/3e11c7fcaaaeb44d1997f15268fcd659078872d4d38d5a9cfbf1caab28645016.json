			"previous": " In the early days of Dunedin it was impossible for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb 16 The road curved around the edge of the hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground 7 ",
			"after": " Settlement in the area was slow though Caversham Valley was a preferred route south out of the city The Central Otago Gold Rush of 1861 led to rapid changes when thousands of people began using the road on their way to and from the gold fields The suburb began to expand rapidly at about this time and the first public house the Edinburgh Castle Hotel was erected in 1861 4 By the end of the decade Caversham had its own school post office drill hall from the Southern District Rifles and Anglican and Presbyterian churches A third church for the Baptist denomination followed in 1872 17 ",
