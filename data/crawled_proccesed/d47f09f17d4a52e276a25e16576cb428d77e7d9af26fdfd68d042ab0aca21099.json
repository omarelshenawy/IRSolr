			"previous": " Before the Democratic primaries began the dichotomy of change versus experience had already become a common theme in the presidential campaign with Senator Hillary Clinton positioning herself as the candidate with experience and Obama embracing the characterization as the candidate most able to bring change to Washington Before the official launch of her campaign aides for Clinton were already planning to position her as the change candidate as strategist Mark Penn made clear in an October 2006 memo titled The Plan 109 In his presidential run announcement Obama framed his candidacy by emphasizing that Washington must change 110 In response to this Clinton adopted her experience as a major campaign theme 111 By early and mid 2007 polls regularly found voters identifying Clinton as the more experienced candidate and Obama as the fresh or new candidate 112 113 Exit polls on Super Tuesday found that Obama won voters who thought that the ability to bring change was the most important quality in a candidate who made up a majority of the Democratic electorate By a margin of about 2 1 Clinton was able to make up for this deficiency by an almost total domination among voters who thought experience was the most important quality 114 These margins generally remained the same until Obama clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3 ",
