			"previous": " Daspletosaurus lived in a vast floodplain along the western shore of the interior seaway Large rivers watered the land occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment When water was plentiful the region could support a great deal of plant and animal life but periodic droughts also struck the region resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments including the Daspletosaurus bonebed 37 Similar conditions exist today in East Africa 38 Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash also resulting in large scale mortality while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group including offshore and nearshore marine habitats coastal wetlands deltas and lagoons in addition to the inland floodplains 35 The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations 36 ",
			"after": " The excellent vertebrate fossil record of Two Medicine and Judith River rocks resulted from a combination of abundant animal life periodic natural disasters and the deposition of large amounts of sediment Many types of freshwater and estuarine fish are represented including sharks rays sturgeons gars and others The Judith River Group preserves the remains of many aquatic amphibians and reptiles including frogs salamanders turtles Champsosaurus and crocodilians Terrestrial lizards including whiptails skinks monitors and alligator lizards have also been discovered Azhdarchid pterosaurs and birds like Apatornis and Avisaurus flew overhead while several varieties of mammals coexisted with Daspletosaurus and other types of dinosaurs in the various formations that make up the Judith River wedge 35 ",
