			"previous": " Approximately 2 5 3 0 carbon content 1 Steels that can be tempered to great hardness Used for special purposes like non industrial purpose knives axles or punches Most steels with more than 2 5 carbon content are made using powder metallurgy Note that steel with a carbon content above 2 14 is considered cast iron ",
			"after": " The purpose of heat treating carbon steel is to change the mechanical properties of steel usually ductility hardness yield strength or impact resistance Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered As with most strengthening techniques for steel Young s modulus elasticity is unaffected All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase therefore all heat treatments except spheroidizing and process annealing start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist The steel is then quenched heat drawn out at a high rate causing cementite to precipitate and finally the remaining pure iron to solidify The rate at which the steel is cooled through the eutectoid temperature affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite Generally speaking cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained pearlite until the martensite critical temperature is reached and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel less than 0 77 wt C results in a lamellar pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with ferrite pure iron between If it is hypereutectoid steel more than 0 77 wt C then the structure is full pearlite with small grains larger than the pearlite lamella of cementite scattered throughout The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible ",
