			"previous": " Bouts did not inscribe any of his paintings which makes attribution and dating difficult His developing skill with perspective and unified vanishing points is used by art historians to date his works from the period Although its colourisation is among the best of his work the perspective is clumsy in areas thus the painting can be assumed to date no later than 1460 Bouts often quoted visual passages from artists and paintings that influenced his work so the influences are well established and datable Along with the companion Resurrection British art historian Martin Davies believes the work shows influences from Rogier van der Weyden s Descent c 1435 and Miraflores Altarpiece 1440s which places it after 1440 4 29 Robert Koch dates it to between 1450 and 1455 3 ",
