			"previous": " In the 1920s Pyotr Kozlov s excavations of the royal tombs at Noin Ula in northern Mongolia that date to around the 1st century CE provided a glimpse into the lost world of the Xiongnu Other archaeological sites have been unearthed in Inner Mongolia and elsewhere they represent the Neolithic and historical periods of the Xiongnu s history 82 Those included the Ordos culture many of them had been identified as the Xiongnu cultures The region was occupied predominantly by peoples showing Mongoloid features known from their skeletal remains and artifacts Portraits found in the Noin Ula excavations demonstrate other cultural evidences and influences showing that Chinese and Xiongnu art have influenced each other mutually Some of these embroidered portraits in the Noin Ula kurgans also depict the Xiongnu with long braided hair with wide ribbons which are seen to be identical with the Turkic Ashina clan hair style 83 Well preserved bodies in Xiongnu and pre Xiongnu tombs in the Mongolian Republic and southern Siberia show both Mongoloid and Caucasian features 84 Analysis of skeletal remains from sites attributed to the Xiongnu provides an identification of dolichocephalic Mongoloid ethnically distinct from neighboring populations in present day Mongolia 85 Russian and Chinese anthropological and craniofacial studies show that the Xiongnu were physically very heterogenous with six different population clusters showing different degrees of Mongoloid and Caucasoid physical traits These clusters point to significant cross regional migrations both east to west and west to east that likely started in the Neolithic period and continued to the medieval Mongolian period 64 ",
