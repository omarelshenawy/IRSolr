			"previous": " The science of conserving fossil remains was in its infancy and new techniques had to be improvised to deal with what soon became known as pyrite disease Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble When in the ground the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening but when removed into the drier open air the natural chemical conversion began to occur To limit this effect De Pauw immediately in the mine gallery re covered the dug out fossils with wet clay sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue finishing with a final layer of tin foil Damage was repaired with papier m ch 60 This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol arsenic and 390 kilograms of shellac This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils with alcohol prevent the development of mold of with arsenic and harden them with shellac The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007 when the shellac hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues 61 Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage or for fresh specimens preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil 5 ",
			"after": " Dollo s specimens allowed him to show that Owen s prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby and put the spike that had been on the nose firmly on the thumb 62 63 He was not completely correct but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail This organ was more or less straight as shown by the skeletons he was excavating and the presence of ossified tendons In fact to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo like posture the tail would have had to be broken With its correct straight tail and back the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground arms in place to support the body if needed 5 ",
