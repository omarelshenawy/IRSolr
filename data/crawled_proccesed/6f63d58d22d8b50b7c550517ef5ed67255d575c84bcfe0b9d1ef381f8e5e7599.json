			"previous": " In mathematics an eigenvector of a transformation is a vector different from the zero vector which that transformation simply multiplies by a constant factor called the eigenvalue of that vector Often a transformation is completely described by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors The eigenspace for a factor is the set of eigenvectors with that factor as eigenvalue together with the zero vector ",
			"after": " The scalar multiple is denoted by the Greek letter and is called an eigenvalue of the matrix A while x is called the eigenvector of A corresponding to These concepts play a major role in several branches of both pure and applied mathematics appearing prominently in linear algebra functional analysis and to a lesser extent in nonlinear situations ",
