			"previous": " This hypothesis was viewed as radical when first proposed but additional evidence soon emerged The boundary clay was found to be full of minute spherules of rock crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact 105 Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K Pg boundary 106 107 Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact 108 and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby as did the discovery that the K Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States with meter thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico 14 ",
			"after": " Further research identified the giant Chicxulub crater buried under Chicxulub on the coast of Yucat n Mexico as the source of the K Pg boundary clay Identified in 1990 7 based on work by geophysicist Glen Penfield in 1978 the crater is oval with an average diameter of roughly 180 kilometres 110 mi about the size calculated by the Alvarez team 109 The discovery of the crater a necessary prediction of the impact hypothesis provided conclusive evidence for a K Pg impact and strengthened the hypothesis that the extinction was caused by an impact ",
