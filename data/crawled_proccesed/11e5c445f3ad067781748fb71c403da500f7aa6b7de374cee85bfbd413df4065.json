			"previous": " In appearance all forms of this coenzyme are white amorphous powders that are hygroscopic and highly water soluble 4 The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark Solutions of NAD are colorless and stable for about a week at 4 C and neutral pH but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis Upon decomposition they form products that are enzyme inhibitors 5 ",
			"after": " Both NAD and NADH strongly absorb ultraviolet light because of the adenine For example peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259 nanometers nm with an extinction coefficient of 16 900 M 1cm 1 NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths with a second peak in UV absorption at 339 nm with an extinction coefficient of 6 220 M 1cm 1 6 This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer 6 ",
