			"after": " The dam is protected against over topping by two spillways The spillway entrances are located behind each dam abutment running roughly parallel to the canyon walls The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side flow weir with each spillway containing four 100 ft 30 m long and 16 ft 4 9 m high steel drum gates Each gate weighs 5 000 000 pounds 2 300 000 kg and can be operated manually or automatically Gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions The gates are unable to entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but are able to maintain an extra 16 ft 4 9 m of lake level 92 Water flowing over the spillways drops dramatically into 600 ft 180 m long 50 ft 15 m wide spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels and reentering the main river channel below the dam This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate 700 ft 210 m elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges Each spillway s capacity of 200 000 cu ft s 5 700 m3 s was empirically verified in post construction tests in 1941 92 ",
