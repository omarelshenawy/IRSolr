			"previous": " The fruit bodies produced by the fungus are 7 to 15 cm 2 8 to 5 9 in wide and 6 to 20 cm 2 4 to 7 9 in tall 9 They are fleshy cauliflower like masses with a stout central stem that splits into a few lower primary branches before branching densely above The stem is short and thick between 1 5 and 6 cm 0 6 and 2 4 in in diameter and tapers downward Initially white in age both the stem and branches turn pale yellow to buff to tan 13 Old fruit bodies can fade to become almost white 19 or may be ochre due to fallen spores 14 The branching pattern is irregular with the primary branches few and thick typically 2 3 cm 0 8 1 2 in and the final branches slender 2 3 mm 13 and usually terminated with five to seven branchlets 7 The branchlet tips are pink to purplish red The flesh is solid and white 13 and has an odor described variously as indistinct 20 or pleasant 21 A drop of Melzer s reagent applied to the stem tissue reveals a weak amyloid staining reaction that often requires more than 30 minutes to develop This reaction can be used to help distinguish R botrytis from other similar fungi 7 ",
			"after": " Spores are produced by basidia on the outer surface of the branches Viewed in deposit the spores are pale yellow Microscopically they have fine longitudinal or oblique striations that often fuse together in a vein like network They range in shape from roughly cylindrical to sigmoid curved like the letter S and their dimensions are 12 16 by 4 5 m 22 23 Basidia are four spored occasionally two spored and measure 59 82 by 8 11 m The sterigmata slender projections of the basidia that attach to the spores are 4 8 m long The hymenium and subhymenium the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium combined are about 80 m thick Hyphae comprising the subhymenium are interwoven 2 5 4 5 m in diameter thin walled and clamped 7 ",
