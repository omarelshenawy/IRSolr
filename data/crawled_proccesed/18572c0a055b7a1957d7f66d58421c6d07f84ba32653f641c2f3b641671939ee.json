			"after": " Stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid As each coil is energized in turn the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding Unlike a synchronous motor in its application the stepper motor may not rotate continuously instead it steps starts and then quickly stops again from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de energized in sequence Depending on the sequence the rotor may turn forwards or backwards and it may change direction stop speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time ",
