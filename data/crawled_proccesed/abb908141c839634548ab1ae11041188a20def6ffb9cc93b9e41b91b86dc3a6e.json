			"previous": " The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama Shakespeare s plays are difficult to date however 84 and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus The Comedy of Errors The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare s earliest period 85 His first histories which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed s Chronicles of England Scotland and Ireland 86 dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty 87 The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe by the traditions of medieval drama and by the plays of Seneca 88 The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story 89 Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona in which two friends appear to approve of rape 90 the Shrew s story of the taming of a woman s independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors 91 ",
			"after": " Shakespeare s early classical and Italianate comedies containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences give way in the mid 1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies 92 A Midsummer Night s Dream is a witty mixture of romance fairy magic and comic lowlife scenes 93 Shakespeare s next comedy the equally romantic Merchant of Venice contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences 94 The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing 95 the charming rural setting of As You Like It and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare s sequence of great comedies 96 After the lyrical Richard II written almost entirely in verse Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s Henry IV parts 1 and 2 and Henry V His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes prose and poetry and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work 97 This period begins and ends with two tragedies Romeo and Juliet the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence love and death 98 and Julius Caesar based on Sir Thomas North s 1579 translation of Plutarch s Parallel Lives which introduced a new kind of drama 99 According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro in Julius Caesar the various strands of politics character inwardness contemporary events even Shakespeare s own reflections on the act of writing began to infuse each other 100 ",
