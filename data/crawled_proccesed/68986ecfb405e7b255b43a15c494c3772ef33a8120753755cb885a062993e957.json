			"after": " The Great Hall is the central part of Bramall Hall As with typical great halls in the Middle Ages this would have been the room where the business of the house estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household It was originally an open roofed single storey building 67 with a fireplace situated in the middle of the floor 3 It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor 69 Towards the end of the 16th century the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt and the Withdrawing Room was created above it A long gallery was also added as a third storey 16 The history of the gallery is uncertain it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819 70 because it was believed to be unsafe 27 A similar gallery was built at Little Moreton Hall and it is still intact causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight 15 The Great Hall has a bay window with leaded windows common throughout the building 71 William Harrison Ainsworth wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall in his 1834 novel Rookwood He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall and be entertained and sometimes refreshed He described Bramall as the best specimen of its class its class in our opinion is the best to be met with in Cheshire 72 No evidence exists for any such right of way According to another tale food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside 71 ",
