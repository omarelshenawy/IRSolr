			"previous": " From antiquity the Chinese used an equatorial system for describing the skies and a star map from 940 was drawn using a cylindrical Mercator projection The use of an armillary sphere is recorded from the 4th century BC and a sphere permanently mounted in equatorial axis from 52 BC In 125 AD Zhang Heng used water power to rotate the sphere in real time This included rings for the meridian and ecliptic By 1270 they had incorporated the principles of the Arab torquetum ",
