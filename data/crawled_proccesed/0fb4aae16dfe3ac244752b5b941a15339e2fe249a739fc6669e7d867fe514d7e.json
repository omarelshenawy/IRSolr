			"previous": " For much of the 20th century prokaryotes were regarded as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry morphology and metabolism For example microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls their shapes and the substances they consume 4 In 1965 Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerland 5 proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other This approach known as phylogenetics is the main method used today ",
			"after": " Archaea were first classified as a separate group of prokaryotes in 1977 by Carl Woese and George E Fox in phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of ribosomal RNA rRNA genes 6 These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and Eubacteria and treated as kingdoms or subkingdoms which Woese and Fox termed Urkingdoms Woese argued that this group of prokaryotes is a fundamentally different sort of life To emphasize this difference Woese later proposed a new natural system of organisms with three separate Domains the Eukarya the Bacteria and the Archaea 7 in what is now known as The Woesian Revolution ",
