			"previous": " The Franciscan Order had a strong following by the 15th century its Third Order of Saint Francis attracted women and men to local lay confraternities such as the Confraternity of the Dry Tree in Bruges to which Anselme Adornes belonged 36 St Francis was closely associated with pilgrimages then popular and most often taken to holy sites in Spain and Jerusalem He was revered for his own pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1219 by the 15th century the Franciscans were responsible for maintaining the holy sites in Jerusalem particularly the Church of the Holy Sepulchre 37 ",
			"after": " St Francis lived austerely in imitation of Christ He embraced the natural world and took vows of poverty charity and chastity In 1224 at La Verna he experienced the mystical vision which van Eyck portrays 36 Thomas of Celano author of Francis s hagiography describes the vision and stigmatization Francis had a vision in which he saw a man like a seraph he had six wings and was standing above him with his hands outstretched and his feet bound together and was fixed to a cross Two wings were lifted above his head and two were spread ready for flight and two covered his whole body When Francis saw this he was utterly amazed He could not fathom what this vision might mean 38 As he meditated marks of nails began to appear on his hands and feet His hands and feet seemed to be pierced by nails appearing on the inside of his hands and the upper side of his feet His right side was scarred as if it had been pierced by a spear and it often seeped blood 39 To the medieval observer the appearance of the stigmata signifies Francis s complete absorption in the vision of the seraph 40 ",
