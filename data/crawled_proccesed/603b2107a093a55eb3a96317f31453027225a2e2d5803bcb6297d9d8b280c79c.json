			"previous": " In military aircraft designs the large frontal area of the engine acted as an extra layer of armor for the pilot Also air cooled engines without vulnerable radiators are slightly less prone to battle damage and on occasion would continue running even with one or more cylinders shot away However the large frontal area also resulted in an aircraft with an aerodynamically inefficient increased frontal area ",
			"after": " Rotary engines have the cylinders in a circle around the crankcase as in a radial engine see above but the crankshaft is fixed to the airframe and the propeller is fixed to the engine case so that the crankcase and cylinders rotate The advantage of this arrangement is that a satisfactory flow of cooling air is maintained even at low airspeeds retaining the weight advantage and simplicity of a conventional air cooled engine without one of their major drawbacks The first practical rotary engine was the Gnome Omega designed by the Seguin brothers and first flown in 1909 Its relative reliability and good power to weight ratio changed aviation dramatically 10 Before the first World War most speed records were gained using Gnome engined aircraft and in the early years of the war rotary engines were dominant in aircraft types for which speed and agility were paramount To increase power engines with two rows of cylinders were built ",
