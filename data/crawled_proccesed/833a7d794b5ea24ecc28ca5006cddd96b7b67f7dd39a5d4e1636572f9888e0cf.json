			"previous": " By the 1930s Percherons accounted for over 70 percent of the purebred draft horses in the United States and all of the major land grant universities maintained stables of Percherons 11 A 1930 census of horses found over 33 000 Percherons in the United States with the next most popular breed the Belgian having a population of less than 10 000 One Percheron historian attributes this popularity to the breed s strength energy activity robustness and endurance 24 After World War II increasing mechanization prompted a decline in the Percheron population 10 In 1954 only 85 Percherons were registered in the US a record low 11 The 1950s 1960s and early 1970s were bad years for the US Percheron population and breeding was reduced to only a few farms These breeders kept the American population alive through these years however and the 1980s saw renewed interest in the breed 25 ",
			"after": " In 1966 the French stud book was changed to include draft types from other areas of France that were closely related to the Percheron including horses from Berrichon Nivernais Marne Augeron Bourbonnais Loire and Sa ne et Loire 7 French Percherons were also hit hard by the advent of mechanization and between 1970 and 1990 focus was placed on breeding horses of greater mass for the meat market The largest and heaviest stallions were selected for breeding 26 27 Beginning at the 1989 World Percheron Congress French breeders realized that they needed a lighter breed for tourism export to Japan for draft work and other markets 26 28 In 1993 a trend of importing American stallions to France was started with the gray stallion Silver Shadows Sheik This stallion and others were used to create a more elegant smaller and sleeker look in the French Percheron while still retaining the traditional bone and foot structure All other imported stallions were black reviving the popularity of black Percherons in France 26 French breeders continue to import American bred Percheron stallions in order to produce lighter foals moving away from the heavier meat type horses of the late 20th century 29 Also in 1993 the Soci t Hippique Percheronne anticipated the increasing tourist and exportation markets by prohibiting docking which was not prohibited for other draft breeds until 1996 30 This was partly at the request of the Germans 31 and partly due to the influence of magazines such as Cheval 32 ",
