			"previous": " Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence philosophy of law social theory and more specialised subjects such as criminology 63 The institutions of social construction social norms dispute processing and legal culture are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub discipline of sociology but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena In the United States the field is usually called law and society studies in Europe it is more often referred to as socio legal studies At first jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law Kelsen attacked one of its founders Eugen Ehrlich who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law which lawyers learn and apply and other forms of law or social norms that regulate everyday life generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts 64 Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas and acquiring a diversity of sources of often competing or conflicting authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally 65 ",
			"after": " Around 1900 Max Weber defined his scientific approach to law identifying the legal rational form as a type of domination not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms 66 Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism 63 Another leading sociologist mile Durkheim wrote in his classic work The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions 67 Other notable early legal sociologists included Hugo Sinzheimer Theodor Geiger Georges Gurvitch and Leon Petra ycki in Europe and William Graham Sumner in the U S 68 69 ",
