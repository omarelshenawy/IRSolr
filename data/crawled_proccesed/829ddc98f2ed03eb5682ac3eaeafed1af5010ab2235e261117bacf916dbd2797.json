			"after": " Nanotechnology is often defined as the study of materials and devices with features on a scale below 100 nanometers DNA nanotechnology specifically is an example of bottom up molecular self assembly in which molecular components spontaneously organize into stable structures the particular form of these structures is induced by the physical and chemical properties of the components selected by the designers 4 In DNA nanotechnology the component materials are strands of nucleic acids such as DNA these strands are often synthetic and are almost always used outside the context of a living cell DNA is well suited to nanoscale construction because the binding between two nucleic acid strands depends on simple base pairing rules which are well understood and form the specific nanoscale structure of the nucleic acid double helix These qualities make the assembly of nucleic acid structures easy to control through nucleic acid design This property is absent in other materials used in nanotechnology including proteins for which protein design is very difficult and nanoparticles which lack the capability for specific assembly on their own 5 ",
