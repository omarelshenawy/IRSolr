			"after": " One theory states that the origins of the Boulonnais breed emerged from the crossbreeding of native French mares and stallions brought by the Numidian army in 55 54 BC 11 However many equine scholars are skeptical of this theory and state that whatever the early origins the later selective breeding and local climate and soil types had a greater influence on the breed than any early Oriental blood 12 During the Crusades two breeders Eustache Comte de Boulogne and later Robert Comte d Artois wanted to create a fast agile and strong warhorse for knights to ride in battle They crossed the existing heavy French stallions with German Mecklenberg mares similar to modern day Hanoverians During the 17th century Spanish occupation of Flanders a mixture of Spanish Barb Arabian and Andalusian blood was added to the breed to create the modern Boulonnais 11 By the 17th century horse dealers were coming into the Boulonnais district from Picardy and Upper Normandy to buy local horses which enjoyed a good reputation among breeders 13 From the late 18th through the mid 19th century the Boulonnais spread across France and Europe during this time the breed increased in size as the Industrial Revolution called for larger horses that retained the active movement of the original type 14 15 Beginning in the 1830s it was proposed to cross the Arabian with the Boulonnais to create a new type of cavalry horse and in the 1860s calls were put forth to add Thoroughbred blood for the same reason 16 However breeders rejected these calls stating that using the breed to create cavalry horses would make them poorer draft horses 17 Breed societies also discouraged crosses between the Boulonnais and the Brabant 18 In June 1886 a studbook was created for the breed in France and placed under the jurisdiction of the Syndicat Hippique Boulonnais SHB in 1902 6 ",
