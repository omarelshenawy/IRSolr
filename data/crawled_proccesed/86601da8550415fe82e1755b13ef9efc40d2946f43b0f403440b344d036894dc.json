			"after": " Parasaurolophus is known from many adult specimens and a juvenile described in 2013 The juvenile was discovered in the Kaiparowits Formation in 2009 Excavated by the joint expedition by The Webb Schools and Raymond M Alf Museum of Paleontology RAM the juvenile has been identified as around only one year old when it died Referred to Parasaurolophus sp the juvenile under specimen number RAM 14000 is the most complete as well as youngest Parasaurolophus ever found and measures 2 5 m 8 2 ft This individual fits neatly into the currently known Parasaurolophus growth stages and lived approximately 75 million years ago Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult Parasaurolophus has been found yet a partial braincase of about the right size is known At 25 of the total adult size the juvenile show that crest growth of Parasaurolophus began sooner than in related genera such as Corythosaurus It has been suggested that Parasaurolophus adults bore such large crests especially when compared to the related Corythosaurus because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing Its age also means that Parasaurolophus had an very fast growth which took place in about a year The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults but low and hemispherical 27 ",
