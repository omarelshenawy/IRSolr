			"previous": " Following the accidents during the 2011 season the Red Arrows retained Red 8 and moved the original Red 10 to the Red 5 position to enable them to continue displaying with nine aircraft In March 2012 the MOD announced that the Red Arrows would fly aerobatic displays with seven aircraft during the 2012 display season as Flt Lt Kirsty Stewart had moved into a ground based role with the team It is believed this was due to the emotional stress she had been suffering over the loss of her two Red Arrows colleagues the previous year As a consequence of this Red 8 also dropped out of the display team to enable an odd number of aircraft to perform and thus maintain formation symmetry However the team carried out official flypasts with nine aircraft by utilising Red 8 as well as ex Red Arrow display pilot and current Red 10 Mike Ling The Red Arrows returned to a full aerobatic formation of nine aircraft in 2013 22 ",
