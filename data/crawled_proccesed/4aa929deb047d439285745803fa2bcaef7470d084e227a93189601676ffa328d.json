			"previous": " The family continued collecting and selling fossils together and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father s death 17 ",
			"after": " Their first well known find was in 1811 when Mary was 12 Joseph dug up a 4 foot ichthyosaur skull and a few months later Mary found the rest of the skeleton Henry Hoste Henley of Sandringham Norfolk who was lord of the manor of Colway near Lyme Regis paid the family about 23 for it 19 and in turn he sold it to William Bullock a well known collector who displayed it in London There it generated considerable interest because at a time when most people in England still believed in the Biblical account of creation which implied that the Earth was only a few thousand years old 20 it raised questions about the history of living things and of the Earth itself It was later sold for 45 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a Crocodile in a Fossil State to Charles Konig of the British Museum who had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus for it 21 ",
