			"previous": " Following the publication of Madsen s influential monograph Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment but it too was not strongly defined Semi technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods usually those that were larger and better known than megalosaurids Typical theropods that were thought to be related to Allosaurus included Indosaurus Piatnitzkysaurus Piveteausaurus Yangchuanosaurus 30 Acrocanthosaurus Chilantaisaurus Compsosuchus Stokesosaurus and Szechuanosaurus 31 Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid although several like Acrocanthosaurus and Yangchuanosaurus are members of closely related families 15 ",
