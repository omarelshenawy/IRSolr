			"after": " Waxwings are not highly territorial and although normally solitary breeders several pairs may nest close together where there are a number of good nest sites 2 Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates and females may squabble over nest sites Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest showing the black throat and opening the bill The breeding display is almost the opposite of this the male erects his body and crest feathers and turns his head away from the female The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item often food to his partner placing it in her open bill In about 90 of cases this display does not lead to copulation 30 Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females 23 ",
