			"after": " Weber s essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is his most famous work 38 It is argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism but rather as an introduction into Weber s later works especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system 76 In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism 76 He noted the post Reformation shift of Europe s economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France Spain and Italy and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands England Scotland and Germany Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy 77 Similarly in societies with different religions most successful business leaders were Protestant 76 Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world 76 ",
