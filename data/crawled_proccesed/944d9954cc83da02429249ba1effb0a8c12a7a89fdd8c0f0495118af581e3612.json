			"previous": " Although there is evidence that Richard Cantillon wrote a wide variety of manuscripts only his Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En G n ral abbreviated Essai survives 6 32 Written in 1730 33 it was published in French in 1755 34 and was translated into English by Henry Higgs in 1932 35 Although there is evidence which suggests that Essai had tremendous influence on the early development of economic science Cantillon s treatise was largely neglected during the 19th century 5 In the late 19th century it was rediscovered by William Stanley Jevons who considered it the cradle of political economy 4 Since then Cantillon s Essai has received growing attention Essai is considered the first complete treatise on economic theory 36 and Cantillon has been called the father of enterprise economics 6 37 ",
			"after": " One of the greatest influences on Cantillon s writing was English economist William Petty and his 1662 tract Treatise on Taxes 39 Although Petty provided much of the groundwork for Cantillon s Essai 38 Anthony Brewer argues that Petty s influence has been overstated 40 Apart from Petty other possible influences on Cantillon include John Locke 41 Cicero Livy Pliny the Elder Pliny the Younger Charles Davenant Edmond Halley Isaac Newton S bastien Le Prestre de Vauban and Jean Boisard 3 Cantillon s involvement in John Law s speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight on the relationship between increases in the supply of money price and production 42 ",
