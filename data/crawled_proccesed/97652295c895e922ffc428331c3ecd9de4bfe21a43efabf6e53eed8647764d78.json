			"after": " Sir Hiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England He built his own whirling arm rig and wind tunnel and constructed a large machine with a wingspan of 105 feet 32 m a length of 145 feet 44 m fore and aft horizontal surfaces and a crew of three Twin propellers were powered by two lightweight compound steam engines each delivering 180 hp 130 kW Overall weight was 8 000 pounds 3 600 kg It was intended as a test rig to investigate aerodynamic lift lacking flight controls it ran on rails with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it Completed in 1894 on its third run it broke from the rail became airborne for several hundred feet at two to three feet altitude 47 and was badly damaged upon falling back to the ground It was subsequently repaired but Maxim abandoned his experiments shortly afterwards 48 ",
