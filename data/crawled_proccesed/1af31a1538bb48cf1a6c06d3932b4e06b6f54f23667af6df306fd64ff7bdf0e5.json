			"previous": " Film badges used to measure exposure to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N 10 000 had been exposed to more than 0 1 roentgens but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite and the crews of the two lead lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure Anderson s dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens and one of the tank drivers who made three trips recorded 13 to 15 roentgens 122 ",
			"after": " The heaviest fallout contamination outside the restricted test area was 30 miles 48 km from the detonation point on Chupadera Mesa The fallout there was reported to have settled in a white mist onto some of the livestock in the area resulting in local beta burns and a temporary loss of dorsal or back hair Patches of hair grew back discolored white The Army bought 75 cattle in all from ranchers the 17 most significantly marked were kept at Los Alamos while the rest were shipped to Oak Ridge for long term observation 123 124 125 126 ",
