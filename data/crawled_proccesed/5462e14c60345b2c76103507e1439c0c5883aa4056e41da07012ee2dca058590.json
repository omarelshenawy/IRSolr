			"previous": " Allosaurus had nine vertebrae in the neck 14 in the back and five in the sacrum supporting the hips 14 The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size James Madsen estimated about 50 4 while Gregory S Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less 10 There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae 4 Such spaces which are also found in modern theropods that is the birds are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration 15 The rib cage was broad giving it a barrel chest especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus 16 Allosaurus had gastralia belly ribs but these are not common findings 4 and they may have ossified poorly 10 In one published case the gastralia show evidence of injury during life 17 A furcula wishbone was also present but has only been recognized since 1996 in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia 17 18 The ilium the main hip bone was massive and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry independent of size the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic with females lacking fused bones to make egg laying easier 4 This proposal has not attracted further attention however ",
			"after": " The forelimbs of Allosaurus were short in comparison to the hindlimbs only about 35 the length of the hindlimbs in adults 19 and had three fingers per hand tipped with large strongly curved and pointed claws 4 The arms were powerful 10 and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm 1 1 2 ulna humerus ratio 20 The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal 21 also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans Of the three fingers the innermost or thumb was the largest 10 and diverged from the others 20 The phalangeal formula is 2 3 4 0 0 meaning that the innermost finger phalange has two bones the next has three and the third finger has four 22 The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof like than those of earlier theropods 10 Each foot had three weight bearing toes and an inner dewclaw which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles 4 There was also what is interpreted as the splint like remnant of a fifth outermost metatarsal perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot 23 ",
