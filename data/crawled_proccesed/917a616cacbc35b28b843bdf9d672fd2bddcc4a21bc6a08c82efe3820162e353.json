			"previous": " The tower was terraced into the side of a mound so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level 16 As was typical of most keeps 17 the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage One of the rooms contained a well Although the layout has remained the same since the tower s construction the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts 16 The basement is lit through small slits 13 ",
			"after": " The entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the Constable of the Tower Lieutenant of the Tower of London and other important officials The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century and not reopened until 1973 Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east also connected to the entrance floor The crypt of St John s Chapel occupied the south east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt according to Geoffrey Parnell Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries the windowless form and restricted access suggest that it was designed as a strong room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents 16 ",
