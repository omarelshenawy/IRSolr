			"previous": " 5 September marked a turn in the rebels fortunes despite the arrival of the southern fleet a day earlier All of their land gains were taken by government forces leaving only the fleet in the mutineers hands By the next day an air strike was mounted by government forces The only damage done was to the submarine H4 which was unable to dive but at least one bomb landed about 50 yards 46 m from Almirante Latorre Despite the scant damage the attack broke the mutineers spirits they quickly offered to send a delegation to Santiago to discuss terms but the government bolstered by its land victories refused While the mutiny devolved into arguing and anarchy individual ships began leaving the bay and setting sail for Valpara so and the rest soon followed Almirante Latorre ended up in the Bay of Tongoy with Blanco Encalada Seven crewmen on the dreadnought received death sentences later commuted to life in prison 42 43 44 ",
			"after": " Still in the midst of the depression Almirante Latorre was deactivated at Talcahuano in 1933 to lessen government expenditures 45 and only a caretaker crew was assigned to tend to the mothballed ship into the mid 1930s 46 G In a 1937 refit in the Talcahuano dockyard the aircraft catapult was taken off and anti aircraft weaponry was added 47 Almirante Latorre was never fully modernized however and by the Second World War her main battery was comparatively short ranged and her armor protection designed before the all or nothing principle was put into practice was wholly inadequate 48 Nevertheless soon after Japan s attack on Pearl Harbor the United States approached the Chilean naval attach and the vice admiral heading Chile s naval commission to the United States with the aim of purchasing Almirante Latorre and a few destroyers to bolster the United States navy The offer was declined 32 49 and Almirante Latorre was used for neutrality patrols during the Second World War 18 ",
