			"previous": " Nicolas of Cusa rekindled Platonic thought in the early 15th century He promoted democracy in Medieval Europe both in his writings and in his organization of the Council of Florence Unlike Aristotle and the Hobbesian tradition to follow Cusa saw human beings as equal and divine that is made in God s image so democracy would be the only just form of government Cusa s views are credited by some as sparking the Italian Renaissance which gave rise to the notion of Nation States ",
			"after": " Later Niccol Machiavelli rejected the views of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as unrealistic The ideal sovereign is not the embodiment of the moral virtues rather the sovereign does whatever is successful and necessary rather than what is morally praiseworthy Thomas Hobbes also contested many elements of Aristotle s views For Hobbes human nature is essentially anti social people are essentially egoistic and this egoism makes life difficult in the natural state of things Moreover Hobbes argued though people may have natural inequalities these are trivial since no particular talents or virtues that people may have will make them safe from harm inflicted by others For these reasons Hobbes concluded that the state arises from a common agreement to raise the community out of the state of nature This can only be done by the establishment of a sovereign in which or whom is vested complete control over the community and is able to inspire awe and terror in its subjects 20 ",
