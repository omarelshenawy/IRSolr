			"after": " In 1948 Truman ordered a controversial addition to the exterior of the White House a second floor balcony in the south portico that came to be known as the Truman Balcony The addition was unpopular some stated it spoiled the appearance of the south facade but it gave the First Family more living space 148 149 150 The work uncovered structural faults which led engineering experts to conclude that the building much of it over 130 years old was in a dangerously dilapidated condition That August a section of floor collapsed and Truman s own bedroom and bathroom were closed as unsafe No public announcement about the serious structural problems of the White House was made until after the 1948 election had been won by which time Truman had been informed that his new balcony was the only part of the building that was sound As a result the Truman family moved into nearby Blair House during the renovations As the newer West Wing including the Oval Office remained open Truman walked to work across the street each morning and afternoon In due course the decision was made to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations The famous exterior of the structure however was buttressed and retained while the renovations proceeded inside The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952 151 ",
