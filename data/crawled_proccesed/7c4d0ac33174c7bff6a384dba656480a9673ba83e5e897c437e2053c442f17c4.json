			"previous": " Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart called the organ the King of instruments 5 Some of the biggest instruments have 64 foot pipes a foot here means sonic foot a measure quite close to the English measurement unit and it sounds to an 8 Hz frequency fundamental tone Perhaps the most distinctive feature is the ability to range from the slightest sound to the most powerful plein jeu impressive sonic discharge which can be sustained in time indefinitely by the organist For instance the Wanamaker organ located in Philadelphia USA has sonic resources comparable with three simultaneous symphony orchestras Another interesting feature lies in its intrinsic polyphony approach each set of pipes can be played simultaneously with others and the sounds mixed and interspersed in the environment not in the instrument itself Contrast this with digital organs where the electronically produced sound comes from loudspeakers ",
