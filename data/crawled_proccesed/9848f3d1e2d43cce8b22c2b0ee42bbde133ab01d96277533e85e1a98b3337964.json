			"previous": " It is important to recognize that even the most accurate maps sacrifice a certain amount of accuracy in scale to deliver a greater visual usefulness to its user For example the width of roads and small streams are exaggerated when they are too narrow to be shown on the map at true scale that is on a printed map they would be narrower than could be perceived by the naked eye The same applies to computer maps where the smallest unit is the pixel A narrow stream say must be shown to have the width of a pixel even if at the map scale it would be a small fraction of the pixel width ",
			"after": " Some maps called cartograms have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance For example this map at the right of Europe has been distorted to show population distribution while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible ",
