			"previous": " An ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons becoming a positively charged cation and the electrons are then gained by the non metal atom becoming a negatively charged anion The two oppositely charged ions attract one another and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them For example sodium Na a metal loses one electron to become an Na cation while chlorine Cl a non metal gains this electron to become Cl The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction and that compound sodium chloride NaCl or common table salt is formed ",
			"after": " In a covalent bond one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration eight electrons in their outermost shell for each atom Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule However some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration these atoms are said to follow the duet rule and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium which has two electrons in its outer shell ",
