			"after": " The woodwork removed by Street was sold for a nominal sum with a condition that it could only be used for a hall chapel or library 83 Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow east London an institution that previously had no link to the college 84 Panels under the communion rail were also removed from the chapel even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante chapel screen and the adjoining seats Some of the woodwork was transferred to St Edern s Church Bodedern in Anglesey which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 84 Some of the panels may also have been re used in the Fellows Library in the second quadrangle other panelling at Bodedern came from the college but not apparently from the chapel and so may have been from a disused library gallery 85 86 ",
