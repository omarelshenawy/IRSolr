			"after": " The Tetrarch was a British light tank with a 2 pounder gun deployed in the Second World War Vickers Armstrong produced between 100 and 177 of them but the tanks had design flaws and most remained in Britain Twenty of them were sent to the USSR as part of the Lend Lease program In early 1941 one Royal Armoured Corps squadron used in overseas amphibious operations was equipped with Tetrarchs In May 1942 a few of them joined the British force invading Madagascar and in June they supported the 1st Airborne Division as air portable light tanks transported in gliders During the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 the 6th Airborne Division used around 20 Tetrarchs but those not lost in accidents proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the German armoured fighting vehicles The tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and all were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks and M22 Locusts by December Tetrarchs did not see any further combat and the last was retired in 1950 There were several variations on the design including the Alecto self propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII but none of these were used in active service with the British Army Full article ",
