			"after": " Neanderthal anatomy differed from modern humans in that they had a more robust build and distinctive morphological features especially on the cranium which gradually accumulated more derived aspects as it was described by Marcellin Boule 72 particularly in certain isolated geographic regions These include shorter limb proportions a wider barrel shaped rib cage a reduced chin and perhaps most notably a large nose which was much larger in both length and width and started somewhat higher on the face than in modern humans 41 Evidence suggests they were much stronger than modern humans with particularly strong arms and hands 73 74 while they were comparable in height based on 45 long bones from at most 14 males and 7 females Neanderthal males averaged 164 168 cm 65 66 in and females 152 156 cm 60 61 in tall 15 Samples of 26 specimens in 2010 found an average weight of 77 6 kg 171 lb for males and 66 4 kg 146 lb for females 75 A 2007 genetic study suggested some Neanderthals may have had red hair and blond hair along with a light skin tone 76 ",
