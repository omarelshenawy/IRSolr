			"previous": " This species preferred habitat of shallow water is naturally susceptible to problems such as drought or the encroachment of vegetation but this duck s habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change 16 Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities 27 and a Canadian study showed that more than half of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing 28 ",
			"after": " Hunting with lead shot along with the use of lead sinkers in angling has been identified as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects 29 A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway where lead shot has been banned 30 In the United States Canada and many western European countries all shot used for waterfowl must now be non toxic and therefore may not contain any lead 31 32 33 ",
