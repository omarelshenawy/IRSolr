			"after": " The Macintosh Classic was the final adaptation of Jerry Manock s and Terry Oyama s Macintosh 128K industrial design bringing back some elements of the original while retaining little of the Snow White design language used in the Macintosh SE s design 20 The only remnant of the SE was the stripe across the front panel bezel for the floppy drive the distinctive front bezel lines of the SE were not used on the Classic and the vertical lines around its base were replaced by four horizontal vent lines more reminiscent of the original design 20 Also the curve of the front bezel was increased to the same 50 inch 1 3 m radial curve as on the front of both the Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi 20 The screen brightness dial on this bezel was also removed in favor of a software control This broad curved front bezel became a signature of Apple product design for much of the 1990s 20 ",
