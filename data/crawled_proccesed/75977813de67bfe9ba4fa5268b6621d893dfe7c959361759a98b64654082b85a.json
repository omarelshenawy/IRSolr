			"previous": " The contribution of civil aircraft in flight to global CO2 emissions has been estimated at around 2 11 However in the case of high altitude airliners which frequently fly near or in the stratosphere non CO2 altitude sensitive effects may increase the total impact on anthropogenic human made climate change significantly 11 A 2007 report from Environmental Change Institute Oxford University posits a range closer to 4 percent cumulative effect 13 Subsonic aircraft in flight contribute to climate change 11 in four ways ",
			"after": " Emissions of passenger aircraft per passenger kilometre vary extensively because of differing factors such as the size and type aircraft the altitude and the percentage of passenger or freight capacity of a particular flight and the distance of the journey and number of stops en route Also the effect of a given amount of emissions on climate radiative forcing is greater at higher altitudes see below Some representative figures for CO2 emissions are provided by LIPASTO s survey of average direct emissions not accounting for high altitude radiative effects of airliners expressed as CO2 and CO2 equivalent per passenger kilometre 18 ",
