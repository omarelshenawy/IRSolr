			"after": " The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories 18 Economic issues including inflation and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers 19 Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia which revived in the middle of the 3rd century 20 The army doubled in size and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit 21 The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial or landowning class and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns 20 More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax collectors in the empire than tax payers 21 ",
