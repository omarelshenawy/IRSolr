			"previous": " If the amount of current used exceeds the capability of the electrode tungsten inclusions in the weld may result Known as tungsten spitting it can be identified with radiography and prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter In addition if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal it can become dirty or contaminated This often causes the welding arc to become unstable requiring that electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity 19 ",
