			"after": " A large part of Archimedes work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse The Greek writer Athenaeus of Naucratis described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship the Syracusia which could be used for luxury travel carrying supplies and as a naval warship The Syracusia is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity 24 According to Athenaeus it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations a gymnasium and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite among its facilities Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull the Archimedes screw was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water Archimedes machine was a device with a revolving screw shaped blade inside a cylinder It was turned by hand and could also be used to transfer water from a low lying body of water into irrigation canals The Archimedes screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain The Archimedes screw described in Roman times by Vitruvius may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon 25 26 27 The world s first seagoing steamship with a screw propeller was the SS Archimedes which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw 28 ",
