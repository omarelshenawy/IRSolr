			"previous": " Gates consistently testified that he first heard on October 1 1986 from Charles E Allen the national intelligence officer who was closest to the Iran initiative that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the Contras Other evidence proves however that Gates received a report on the diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr 24 The issue was whether the Independent Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with Allen in October ",
			"after": " Grand jury secrecy rules hampered Independent Counsel s response Nevertheless in order to answer questions about Gates prior testimony Independent Counsel accelerated his investigation of Gates in the summer of 1991 This investigation was substantially completed by September 3 1991 at which time Independent Counsel determined that Gates Iran Contra activities and testimony did not warrant prosecution ",
