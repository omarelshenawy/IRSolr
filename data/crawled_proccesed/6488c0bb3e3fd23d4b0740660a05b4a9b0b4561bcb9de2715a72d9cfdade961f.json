			"after": " A directional filter is a device that combines the functions of a directional coupler and a diplexer As it is based on a directional coupler it is essentially a four port device but like directional couplers port 4 is commonly permanently terminated internally Power entering port 1 exits port 3 after being subject to some filtering function usually band pass The remaining power exits port 2 and since no power is absorbed or reflected this will be the exact complement of the filtering function at port 2 in this case band stop In reverse power entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1 but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4 Figure 15 shows one possible waveguide implementation of a directional filter Two rectangular waveguides operating in the dominant TE10 mode provide the four ports These are joined together by a circular waveguide operating in the circular TE11 mode The circular waveguide contains an iris coupled filter with as many irises as needed to produce the required filter response 83 ",
