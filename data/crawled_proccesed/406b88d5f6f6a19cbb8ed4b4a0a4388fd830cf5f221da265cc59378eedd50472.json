			"after": " Ninety five percent of bird species are socially monogamous These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or in some cases for several years or until the death of one mate 164 Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care which is especially important for species in which females require males assistance for successful brood rearing 165 Among many socially monogamous species extra pair copulation infidelity is common 166 Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids 167 Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from to remain viable long after copulation a hundred days in some species 168 Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism For females possible benefits of extra pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate 169 Males of species that engage in extra pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise 170 ",
