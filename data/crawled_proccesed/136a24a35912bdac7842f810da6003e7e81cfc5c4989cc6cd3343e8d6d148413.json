			"previous": " In 1979 Messerschmitt B lkow Blohm MBB and British Aerospace BAe presented a formal proposal to their respective governments for the ECF the European Collaborative Fighter 12 or European Combat Fighter 10 In October 1979 Dassault joined the ECF team for a tri national study which became known as the European Combat Aircraft 12 It was at this stage of development that the Eurofighter name was first attached to the aircraft 13 The development of different national prototypes continued France produced the ACX The UK produced two designs the P 106 N 1 was a single engined lightweight fighter superficially resembling the JAS 39 Gripen the P 110 was a twin engined fighter The P 106 concept was rejected by the RAF on the grounds that it had half the effectiveness of the two engined aircraft at two thirds of the cost 8 West Germany continued to refine the TKF 90 concept 10 The ECA project collapsed in 1981 for several reasons including differing requirements Dassault s insistence on design leadership and the British preference for a new version of the RB199 to power the aircraft versus the French preference for the new Snecma M88 13 ",
			"after": " Consequently the Panavia partners MBB BAe and Aeritalia launched the Agile Combat Aircraft ACA programme in April 1982 15 The ACA was very similar to the BAe P 110 having a cranked delta wing canards and a twin tail One major external difference was the replacement of the side mounted engine intakes with a chin intake The ACA was to be powered by a modified version of the RB199 The German and Italian governments withdrew funding and the UK Ministry of Defence agreed to fund 50 of the cost with the remaining 50 to be provided by industry MBB and Aeritalia signed up with the aim of producing two aircraft one at Warton and one by MBB In May 1983 BAe announced a contract with the MoD for the development and production of an ACA demonstrator the Experimental Aircraft Programme 15 16 ",
