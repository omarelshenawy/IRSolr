			"previous": " The Vanport flood induced changes to the slough s system of levees which were rebuilt and in some cases fortified to withstand a 100 year flood Instead of repairing the levee along the Peninsula Canal the city plugged it at both ends The disaster also affected Oregon s system of higher education After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center set up in 1946 the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland where it eventually became Portland State University 45 ",
			"after": " Debate about how to use the slough and its watershed continued through the rest of the century In 1964 the Port of Portland interested in industrial development began to fill Smith Bybee and Ramsey lakes with dredge sands from the Columbia 45 In the 1970s the Oregon Legislature passed a law against filling Smith or Bybee lakes below a contour line 11 feet 3 4 m above mean sea level except to enhance fish and wildlife habitat 45 Plans for a Willamette River Greenway project proposed by Oregon Governor Tom McCall in the late 1960s called for park and recreation areas along the Willamette and many of its tributaries but ignored the slough 55 Some planners argued that the slough was so filthy that more industry was all it was good for They portrayed cleanup as a lofty but impractical goal 55 ",
