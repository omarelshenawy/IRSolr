			"previous": " For missions beyond low Earth orbit BLEO NASA has been directed to develop the Space Launch System SLS a Saturn V class rocket and the two to six person beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft Orion In February 2010 President Barack Obama s administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies 88 During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15 2010 Obama proposed a new heavy lift vehicle HLV to replace the formerly planned Ares V 89 In his speech Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025 and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid 2030s 89 The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11 2010 90 The act officially canceled the Constellation program 90 ",
			"after": " The Authorization Act required a newly designed HLV be chosen within 90 days of its passing the launch vehicle was given the name Space Launch System The new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft 91 The Orion spacecraft which was being developed as part of the Constellation program was chosen to fulfill this role 92 The Space Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low Earth orbit 93 The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions The initial capability of SLS is required to be able to lift 70 mt into LEO It is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt 92 94 ",
