			"previous": " In 1964 The Beatles starred in their first feature film A Hard Day s Night directed by Richard Lester Shot in black and white and presented as a mock documentary it interspersed comedic and dialogue sequences with musical tones The musical sequences furnished basic templates on which countless subsequent music videos were modeled It was the direct model for the successful US TV series The Monkees 1966 1968 which similarly consisted of film segments that were created to accompany various Monkees songs 14 The Beatles second feature Help 1965 was a much more lavish affair filmed in colour in London and on international locations The title track sequence filmed in black and white is arguably one of the prime archetypes of the modern performance style music video employing rhythmic cross cutting contrasting long shots and close ups and unusual shots and camera angles such as the shot 50 seconds into the song in which George Harrison s left hand and the neck of his guitar are seen in sharp focus in the foreground while the completely out of focus figure of John Lennon sings in the background In 1965 The Beatles began making promotional clips then known as filmed inserts for distribution and broadcast in other countries primarily the USA so they could promote their record releases without having to make in person appearances By the time The Beatles stopped touring in late 1966 their promotional films like their recordings had become highly sophisticated In May 1966 they filmed two sets of colour promotional clips for their current single Rain Paperback Writer all directed by Michael Lindsay Hogg 15 who went on to direct The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus and The Beatles final film Let It Be The colour promotional clips for Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane made in early 1967 and directed by Peter Goldman 16 took the promotional film format to a new level They used techniques borrowed from underground and avant garde film including reversed film and slow motion dramatic lighting unusual camera angles and color filtering added in post production At the end of 1967 the group released their third film the one hour made for television project Magical Mystery Tour it was written and directed by the group and first broadcast on the BBC on Boxing Day 1967 Although poorly received at the time for lacking a narrative structure it showed the group to be accomplished music video makers in their own right ",
