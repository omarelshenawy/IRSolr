			"after": " The extensive use of dashes and unconventional capitalization in Dickinson s manuscripts and the idiosyncratic vocabulary and imagery combine to create a body of work that is far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed 3 139 Dickinson avoids pentameter opting more generally for trimeter tetrameter and less often dimeter Sometimes her use of these meters is regular but oftentimes it is irregular The regular form that she most often employs is the ballad stanza a traditional form that is divided into quatrains using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth while rhyming the second and fourth lines ABCB Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four she also makes frequent use of slant rhyme 140 In some of her poems she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one two and four while only using tetrameter for line three ",
