			"previous": " Cypress trees are conifers that are adapted to live in standing fresh water They grow in compact structures called cypress domes and in long strands over limestone Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes and strands so cypresses develop knees that protrude from the water at high levels to provide oxygen for the root systems Dwarf cypress trees grow in drier areas with poorer soil Epiphytes such as bromeliads Spanish moss Tillandsia usneoides orchids and ferns grow on the branches and trunks of cypress trees Everglades National Park features twenty five species of orchids 35 Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas for birds including wild turkeys Meleagris gallopavo ibis herons egrets anhingas Anhinga anhinga and belted kingfishers Megaceryle alcyon Mammals in cypress regions include white tailed deer squirrels raccoons opossums skunks swamp rabbits river otters Lontra canadensis and bobcats as well as small rodents 36 37 ",
			"after": " Mangrove trees cover the coastlines of South Florida sometimes growing inland depending on the amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems During dryer years when less fresh water flows to the coast mangroves will appear among fresh water plants When rain is abundant sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast Three species of mangrove trees red Rhizophora mangle black Avicennia germinans and white Laguncularia racemosa can be found in the Everglades Due to their high tolerance of salt water winds extreme tides high temperatures and muddy soils mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species They are also Florida s first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion 38 The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world 39 ",
