			"after": " Feathers on the alula or bastard wing are not generally considered to be flight feathers in the strict sense though they are asymmetrical they lack the length and stiffness of most true flight feathers However alula feathers are definitely an aid to slow flight These feathers which are attached to the bird s thumb and normally lie flush against the anterior edge of the wing function in the same way as the slats on an airplane wing allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attack and thus lift without resulting in a stall By manipulating its thumb to create a gap between the alula and the rest of the wing a bird can avoid stalling when flying at low speeds or landing 11 ",
