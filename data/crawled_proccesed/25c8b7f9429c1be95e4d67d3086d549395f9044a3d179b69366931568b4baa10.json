			"after": " The Anthony Roll was originally a set of three separate vellum rolls It exists today in the form of a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane The membranes were of a width of 70 cm 27 inches and a height varying from 79 to 96 cm 31 to 37 inches 11 After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book now known as Pepys 2991 The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony s but pre dated Pepys binding of the rolls This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace Dieu Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two page spreads The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail Despite this there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls The second roll British Library Additional MS 22047 is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing 12 ",
