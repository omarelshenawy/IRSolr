			"previous": " To determine the degree of fractionation that takes place in a given plant the amounts of both 12 C and 13 C isotopes are measured and the resulting 13 C 12 C ratio is then compared to a standard ratio known as PDB note 5 The 13 C 12 C ratio is used instead of 14 C 12 C because the former is much easier to measure and the latter can be easily derived the depletion of 13 C relative to 12 C is proportional to the difference in the atomic masses of the two isotopes so the depletion for 14 C is twice the depletion of 13 C 14 The fractionation of 13 C known as 13C is calculated as follows 33 ",
