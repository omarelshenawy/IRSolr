			"after": " The white bellied sea eagle is listed as being of Least Concern by the IUCN 1 There are an estimated 10 thousand to 100 thousand individuals although there seems to be a decline in numbers They have become rare in Thailand and some other parts of southeast Asia 11 They are relatively abundant in Hong Kong where the population increased from 39 to 57 birds between 2002 and 2009 52 A field study on Kangaroo Island in South Australia showed that nesting pairs in areas of high human disturbance as defined by clearing of landscape and high human activity had lower breeding success rates 53 In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia nests have been vacated as human activities have encroached on the eagles territories 54 Elsewhere the clearing of trees suitable for nesting has seen it largely disappear locally such as the removal of stands of Casuarina equisetifolia in Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh in India 55 In India nest densities of about one per 4 32 km of coastline have been noted in Sindhudurg and one per 3 57 km 45 nests along 161 km in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra 56 57 They also nest on Netrani Island where about a 100 birds were noted in 1875 then known as Pigeon Island by Allan Octavian Hume who noted that this was perhaps the largest breeding colony of the species 58 In 2000 the disturbance to the island from torpedo firing exercises conducted by the Indian navy was noted as a threat 59 Nearly 100 nests have been noted in 2004 on this island 60 ",
