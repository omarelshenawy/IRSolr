			"after": " Because of the high pressures used in the steam circuits and the materials used steam turbines and their casings have high thermal inertia When warming up a steam turbine for use the main steam stop valves after the boiler have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine Also a turning gear is engaged when there is no steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent uneven expansion After first rotating the turbine by the turning gear allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane no bowing then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10 15 RPM 0 17 0 25 Hz to slowly warm the turbine The warm up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours 18 ",
