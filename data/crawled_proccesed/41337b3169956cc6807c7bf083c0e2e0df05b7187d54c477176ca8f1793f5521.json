			"after": " Some SI engines are crankcase scavenged and do not use poppet valves Instead the crankcase and the part of the cylinder below the piston is used as a pump The intake port is connected to the crankcase through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve driven by the engine For each cylinder a transfer port connects in one end to the crankcase and in the other end to the cylinder wall The exhaust port is connected directly to the cylinder wall The transfer and exhaust port are opened and closed by the piston The reed valve opens when the crankcase pressure is slightly below intake pressure to let it be filled with a new charge this happens when the piston is moving upwards When the piston is moving downwards the pressure in the crankcase increases and the reed valve closes promptly then the charge in the crankcase is compressed When the piston is moving upwards it uncovers the exhaust port and the transfer port and the higher pressure of the charge in the crankcase makes it enter the cylinder through the transfer port blowing the exhaust gases Lubrication is accomplished by adding 2 stroke oil to the fuel in small ratios Petroil refers to the mix of gasoline with the aforesaid oil This kind of 2 stroke engines has a lower efficiency than comparable 4 strokes engines and release a more polluting exhaust gases for the following conditions ",
