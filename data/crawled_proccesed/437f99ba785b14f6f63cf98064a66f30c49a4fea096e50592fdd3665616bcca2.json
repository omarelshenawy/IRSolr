			"previous": " The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the Korean People s Air Force KPAF of North Korea with the MiG 15 one of the world s most advanced jet fighters 270 The fast heavily armed MiG outflew first generation UN jets such as the F 80 United States Air Force and Gloster Meteors Royal Australian Air Force posing a real threat to B 29 Superfortress bombers even under fighter escort Fearful of confronting the United States directly the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian This known direct Soviet participation was a casus belli that the UN Command deliberately overlooked lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union and potentially escalate into atomic warfare 270 ",
			"after": " The USAF countered the MiG 15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter the F 86 Sabre These arrived in December 1950 272 273 The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor It had a very high service ceiling 50 000 feet 15 000 m and carried very heavy weaponry one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons They were fast enough to dive past the fighter escort of P 80 Shooting Stars and F9F Panthers and could reach and destroy the U S heavy bombers B 29 losses could not be avoided and the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the necessarily less accurate nighttime bombing of targets The MiGs were countered by the F 86 Sabres They had a ceiling of 42 000 feet 13 000 m and were armed with six 50 caliber 12 7 mm machine guns which were range adjusted by radar gunsights If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG Once in a level flight dogfight both swept wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 660 mph 1 100 km h The MiG climbed faster but the Sabre turned and dived better 274 ",
