			"previous": " Inspired by Fan the later Chancellor Wang Anshi 1021 1086 implemented a series of reforms in 1069 upon his ascendance to office Wang promulgated a community based law enforcement and civil order known as the Baojia system Wang Anshi attempted to diminish the importance of landholding and private wealth in favor of mutual responsibility social groups that shared similar values and could be easily controlled by the government 129 Just as scholar officials owed their social prestige to their government degrees Wang wanted to structure all of society as a mass of dependents loyal to the central government 129 He used various means including the prohibition of landlords offering loans to tenants this role was assumed by the government 129 Wang established local militias that could aid the official standing army and lessen the constrained state budget expenses for the military 130 He set up low cost loans for the benefit of rural farmers whom he viewed as the backbone of the Song economy 130 Since the land tax exacted from rural farmers filled the state treasury s coffers Wang implemented a reform to update the land survey system so that more accurate assessments could be gathered 130 Wang removed the mandatory poetry requirement in the civil service exams on the grounds that many otherwise skilled and knowledgeable Confucian students were being denied entry into the administration 130 Wang also established government monopolies for tea salt and wine production 130 All of these programs received heavy criticism from conservative ministerial peers who believed his reforms damaged local family wealth which provided the basis for the production of examination candidates managers merchants landlords and other essential members of society 129 Historian Paul J Smith writes that Wang s reforms the New Policies represented the professional bureaucratic elite s final attempt to bring the thriving economy under state control to remedy the lack of state resources in combating powerful enemies to the north the Liao and Western Xia 131 ",
			"after": " Winston W Lo argues that Wang s obstinate behavior and inability to consider revision or annulment of his reforms stemmed from his conviction that he was a latter day sage 132 Confucian scholars of the Song believed that the way dao embodied in the Five Classics was known by the ancient sages and was transmitted from one sage to another in an almost telepathic manner but after it reached Mencius c 372 c 289 BC there was no one worthy of accepting the transference of the dao 133 Some believed that the long dormant dao could be revived if one were truly a sage Lo writes of Song Neo Confucianists it is this self image which explained their militant stand in relation to conventional ethics and scholarship 133 Wang defined his life mission as restoring the unity of dao as he believed it had not departed from the world but had become fragmented by schools of Confucian thought each one propagating only half truths 134 Lo asserts that Wang believing that he was in possession of the dao followed Yi Zhi and the Duke of Zhou s classic examples in resisting the wishes of selfish or foolish men by ignoring criticism and public opinion 134 If unflinching certitude in his sagehood and faultless reforms was not enough Wang sought potential allies and formed a coalition that became known as the New Policies Group which in turn emboldened his known political rivals to band together in opposition to him 135 Yet factional power struggles were not steeped in ideological discourse alone cliques had formed naturally with shifting alliances of professional elite lineages and efforts to obtain a greater share of available offices for one s immediate and extended kinship over vying competitors 136 People such as Su Shi also opposed Wang s faction on practical grounds for example Su s critical poem hinting that Wang s salt monopoly hindered effective salt distribution 130 ",
