			"previous": " By 2018 AC 130 gunships will have been providing close air support for special operators for 50 years Although the aircraft have been kept relevant through constant upgrades to their weaponry sensor packages and countermeasures they are not expected to be survivable in future non permissive environments due to their high signatures and low airspeeds Military analysts such as the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments have suggested that AFSOC invest in more advanced technologies to fill the role to operate in future contested combat zones including a mix of low cost disposable unmanned and stealthy strike aircraft 27 ",
			"after": " The AC 130 is a heavily armed long endurance aircraft carrying an array of anti ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors navigation and fire control systems It is capable of delivering precision firepower or area saturation fire over a target area over a long period of time at night or in adverse weather The sensor suite consists of a television sensor infrared sensor and radar These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most weather conditions ",
