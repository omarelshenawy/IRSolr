			"previous": " The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich s life he joined the Communist Party The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers Union but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1958 to 1964 was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union s artists 49 This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment a mark of cowardice the result of political pressure or as his free decision On the one hand the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin s death On the other his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears 50 and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed 51 Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal 52 Once he joined the Party several articles denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name though he did not actually write them In addition in joining the party Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before His Twelfth Symphony which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961 was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called The Year 1917 53 Around this time his health also began to deteriorate ",
			"after": " Shostakovich s musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet composed in only three days He subtitled the piece To the victims of fascism and war 54 ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945 Yet like the Tenth Symphony this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman I started thinking that if some day I die nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me so I had better write one myself 55 Several of Shostakovich s colleagues including Natalya Vovsi Mikhoels 56 and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky 57 were also aware of the Eighth Quartet s biographical intent ",
