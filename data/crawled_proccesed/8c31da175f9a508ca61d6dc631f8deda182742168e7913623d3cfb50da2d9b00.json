			"after": " The pitot static system obtains pressures for interpretation by the pitot static instruments While the explanations below explain traditional mechanical instruments many modern aircraft use an air data computer ADC to calculate airspeed rate of climb altitude and Mach number In some aircraft two ADCs receive total and static pressure from independent pitot tubes and static ports and the aircraft s flight data computer compares the information from both computers and checks one against the other There are also standby instruments which are back up pneumatic instruments employed in the case of problems with the primary instruments ",
