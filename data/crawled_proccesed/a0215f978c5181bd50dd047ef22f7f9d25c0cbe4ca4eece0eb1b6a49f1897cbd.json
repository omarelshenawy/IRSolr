			"previous": " At T minus 10 seconds hydrogen igniters were activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition Failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase The main engine turbopumps also began charging the combustion chambers with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time The computers reciprocated this action by allowing the redundant computer systems to begin the firing phase ",
			"after": " The three main engines SSMEs started at T 6 6 seconds The main engines ignited sequentially via the Shuttle s general purpose computers GPCs at 120 millisecond intervals All three SSMEs were required to reach 90 rated thrust within three seconds otherwise the onboard computers would initiate an RSLS abort If all three engines indicated nominal performance by T 3 seconds they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the SRBs for ignition at T 0 72 Between T 6 6 seconds and T 3 seconds while the SSMEs were firing but the SRBs were still bolted to the pad the offset thrust caused the entire launch stack boosters tank and Shuttle to pitch down 650 mm 25 5 in measured at the tip of the external tank The three second delay after confirmation of SSME operation was to allow the stack to return to nearly vertical At T 0 seconds the 8 frangible nuts holding the SRBs to the pad were detonated the SSMEs were commanded to 100 throttle and the SRBs were ignited By T 0 23 seconds the SRBs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence and reached maximum chamber pressure by T 0 6 seconds 73 The Johnson Space Center s Mission Control Center assumed control of the flight once the SRBs had cleared the launch tower ",
