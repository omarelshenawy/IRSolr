			"after": " The Tasmanian devil is the largest surviving carnivorous marsupial It has a squat thick build with a large head and a tail which is about half its body length Unusually for a marsupial its forelegs are slightly longer than its hind legs and devils can run up to 13 km h 8 1 mph for short distances The fur is usually black often with irregular white patches on the chest and rump although approximately 16 of wild devils do not have white patches 37 38 These markings suggest that the devil is most active at dawn and dusk and they are thought to draw biting attacks toward less important areas of the body as fighting between devils often leads to a concentration of scars in that region 38 Males are usually larger than females having an average head and body length of 652 mm 25 7 in a 258 mm 10 2 in tail and an average weight of 8 kg 18 lb Females have an average head and body length of 570 mm 22 in a 244 mm 9 6 in tail and an average weight of 6 kg 13 lb 37 although devils in western Tasmania tend to be smaller 39 Devils have five long toes on their forefeet four pointing to the front and one coming out from the side which gives the devil the ability to hold food The hind feet have four toes and the devils have non retractable claws 35 The stocky devils have a relatively low centre of mass 40 ",
