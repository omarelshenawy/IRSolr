			"previous": " In February 1917 the first prototype of the Felixstowe F 3 was flown It was larger and heavier than the F 2 giving it greater range and heavier bomb load but poorer agility Approximately 100 Felixstowe F 3s were produced before the end of the war ",
			"after": " The Felixstowe F 5 was intended to combine the good qualities of the F 2 and F 3 with the prototype first flying in May 1918 The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but to ease production the production version was modified to make extensive use of components from the F 3 which resulted in lower performance than the F 2A or F 5 ",
