			"previous": " In 1953 Vickers had started building the swept wing VC 7 V 1000 with Rolls Royce Conway turbofan engines but BOAC short sightedly decided the Britannia and Comet 4 would be adequate for its purposes and when the military version of the V 1000 was cancelled in 1955 the 75 complete prototype was scrapped In October 1956 BOAC ordered 15 Boeing 707s with Conway engines briefly the most economical commercial engine option They entered service in 1960 The British Airworthiness Authorities insisted on tail fin modifications which Boeing made available to all 707 users Sir Giles Guthrie 5 who took charge of BOAC in 1964 preferred Boeing aircraft for economic reasons and indeed BOAC began turning a profit in the late 1960s After a row in Parliament the government instructed BOAC to purchase 17 Vickers VC 10 aircraft from a 30 aircraft order which Guthrie had cancelled 6 The Standard VC 10 had higher operating costs than the 707 largely due to BOAC s requirement at the design stage for the aircraft to have excellent hot and high performance for Commonwealth African Asian routes but the larger Super VC 10 was a success with American passengers on the North Atlantic and was profitable ",
			"after": " The next major order of Boeing aircraft was for 11 747 100s On 22 April 1970 BOAC received its first 747 but the aircraft did not enter commercial service until 14 April 1971 due to BOAC s inability to settle crewing and pay rates with the British Air Line Pilots Association BOAC s successor British Airways later became the largest Boeing customer outside North America citation needed ",
