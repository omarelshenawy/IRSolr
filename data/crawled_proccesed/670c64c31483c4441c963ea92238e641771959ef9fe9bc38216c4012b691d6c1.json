			"after": " The Jain Temple at Lakkundi marked an important step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave chhajja used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples 33 The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified dravida outline Miniature towers of both dravida and nagara types are used as ornamentation on the walls With further development the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked until they almost lost their individuality This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal where the original dravida structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey 27 ",
