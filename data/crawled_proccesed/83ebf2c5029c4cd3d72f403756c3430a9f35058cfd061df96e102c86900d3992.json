			"previous": " Like all Phallus species P indusiatus is saprobic deriving nutrients from breaking down wood and plant organic matter The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips In Asia it grows among bamboo forests and typically fruits after heavy rains 22 42 The method of reproduction for stinkhorns including P indusiatus is different from most agaric mushrooms which forcibly eject their spores Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp sickly sweet odor of carrion 43 The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies detectable from a considerable distance is attractive to certain insects 22 Species recorded visiting the fungus include stingless bees of the genus Trigona 44 and flies of the families Drosophilidae and Muscidae Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to germinate elsewhere 22 Although the function of the indusium is not known definitively it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba 45 ",
			"after": " In eastern Asia P indusiatus is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac 46 Previously only collected in the wild where it is not abundant it was difficult to procure The mushroom s scarcity meant that it was usually reserved for special occasions In the time of China s Qing Dynasty the species was collected in Yunnan Province and sent to the Imperial Palaces to satisfy the appetite of Empress Dowager Cixi who particularly enjoyed meals containing edible fungi 47 It was one of the eight featured ingredients of the Bird s Nest Eight Immortals Soup served at a banquet to celebrate her 60th birthday This dish served by descendants of the Confucius family in celebrations and longevity banquets contained ingredients that were all precious food delicacies from land and sea fresh tender and crisp appropriately sweet and salty 48 Another notable use was a state banquet held for American diplomat Henry Kissinger on his visit to China to reestablish diplomatic relations in the early 1970s 49 One source writes of the mushroom It has a fine and tender texture fragrance and is attractive beautiful in shape fresh and crispy in taste 50 The dried fungus commonly sold in Asian markets is prepared by rehydrating and soaking or simmering in water until tender 51 Sometimes used in stir frys it is traditionally used as a component of rich chicken soups 52 The rehydrated mushroom can also be stuffed and cooked 53 ",
