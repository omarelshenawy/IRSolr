			"previous": " A transitional fossil is any fossilized remains of a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group 42 This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence These fossils serve as a reminder that taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation ",
			"after": " Microfossil is a descriptive term applied to fossilized plants and animals whose size is just at or below the level at which the fossil can be analyzed by the naked eye A commonly applied cutoff point between micro and macro fossils is 1 mm Microfossils may either be complete or near complete organisms in themselves such as the marine plankters foraminifera and coccolithophores or component parts such as small teeth or spores of larger animals or plants Microfossils are of critical importance as a reservoir of paleoclimate information and are also commonly used by biostratigraphers to assist in the correlation of rock units ",
