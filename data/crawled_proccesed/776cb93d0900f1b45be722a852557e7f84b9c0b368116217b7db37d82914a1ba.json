			"previous": " Charles Eastlake saw the work in 1858 and again in 1860 during visits to Milan to purchase Northern Renaissance art on behalf of the National Gallery 25 He also viewed three companion pieces but was told they were not on sale His notes described each of these other works which he titled Annunciation now in the J Paul Getty Museum Adoration of the Kings now in a private collection in Germany and Presentation or Resurrection now in the Norton Simon Museum Pasadena California 21 These works are the same size as The Entombment have similar colouring and pigmentation and are painted using the same glue size technique but are not as well preserved It is probable that all were re lined and stretched at the same time by the same restorer indicating that they were kept together until shortly before The Entombment was acquired by the National Gallery 26 ",
			"after": " Art historian Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on the similarity of provenance material technique tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five part polyptych altarpiece 27 Based on the format of Bouts 1464 67 Altar of Holy Sacrament whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right hand wing above the Adoration 26 ",
