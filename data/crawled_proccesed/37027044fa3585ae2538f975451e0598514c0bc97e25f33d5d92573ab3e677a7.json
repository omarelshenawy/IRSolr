			"after": " While animal products were to be avoided during times of penance pragmatic compromises often prevailed The definition of fish was often extended to marine and semi aquatic animals such as whales barnacle geese puffins and even beavers The choice of ingredients may have been limited but that did not mean that meals were smaller Neither were there any restrictions against moderate drinking or eating sweets Banquets held on fish days could be splendid and were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways fish could be molded to look like venison and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking it in coals While Byzantine church officials took a hard line approach and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy their Western counterparts were far more lenient 3 There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigors of fasting among the laity During Lent kings and schoolboys commoners and nobility all complained about being deprived of meat for the long hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins At Lent owners of livestock were even warned to keep an eye out for hungry dogs frustrated by a hard siege by Lent and fish bones 4 ",
