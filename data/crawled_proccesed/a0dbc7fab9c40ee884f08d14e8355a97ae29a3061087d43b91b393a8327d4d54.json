			"after": " Another possible lover was Bill Duckett As a teenager he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles Duckett was fifteen when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street From at least 1880 Duckett and his grandmother Lydia Watson were boarders subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street Because of this proximity it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors Their relationship was close with the youth sharing Whitman s money when he had it Whitman described their friendship as thick Though some biographers describe him as a boarder others identify him as a lover 137 Their photograph pictured is described as modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends and encrypting male male desire 138 Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek and whom he first met when Stafford was 18 in 1876 Whitman gave Stafford a ring which was returned and re given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years Of that ring Stafford wrote to Whitman You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me and that was death 139 ",
