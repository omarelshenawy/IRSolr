			"after": " Stowell s article attracted intense attention 9 11 and placed Albert Victor among the most notable Ripper suspects but his innocence was soon proven Gull died before Albert Victor and so could not have known about Albert Victor s death 12 All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888 he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873 six years before he visited the West Indies 13 Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution when Albert Victor was serving in the British army making regular public appearances and visiting friends at country houses 14 Newspaper reports Queen Victoria s diary family letters and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public or meeting foreign royalty or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders 15 16 ",
