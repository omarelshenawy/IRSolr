			"previous": " Edward s new palace consisted of three courts along the north side of the Upper Ward called Little Cloister King s Cloister and the Kitchen Court 94 At the front of the palace lay the St George s Hall range which combined a new hall and a new chapel This range had two symmetrical gatehouses the Spicerie Gatehouse and the Kitchen Gatehouse The Spicerie Gatehouse was the main entrance into the palace whilst the Kitchen Gatehouse simply led into the kitchen courtyard 95 The great hall had numerous large windows looking out across the ward 96 The range had an unusual unified roof line and with a taller roof than the rest of the palace would have been highly distinctive 97 The Rose Tower designed for the king s private use set off the west corner of the range 94 The result was a great and apparently architecturally unified palace uniform in all sorts of ways as to roof line window heights cornice line floor and ceiling heights 98 With the exception of the Hall Chapel and the Great Chamber the new interiors all shared a similar height and width 99 nb 7 The defensive features however were primarily for show possibly to provide a backdrop for jousting between the two halves of the Order of the Garter 91 ",
