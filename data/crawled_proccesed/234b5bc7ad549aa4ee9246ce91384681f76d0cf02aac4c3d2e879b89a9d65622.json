			"after": " The Rodrigues solitaire probably became extinct sometime between the 1730s and 1760s the exact date is unknown Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750 traders burnt off vegetation hunted solitaires and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks 38 In 1755 Joseph Fran ois Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen as he had been assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island Though trying for 18 months and offering large rewards none could be found He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species but suspected that it was due to hunting by humans instead 38 Alexandre Guy Pingr did not encounter any solitaires when he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus although he had been assured they survived His friend Pierre Charles Le Monnier named the constellation Turdus Solitarius after the bird to commemorate the journey Although the Rodrigues solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation named for it celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked like and star maps depict other birds 29 ",
