			"previous": " The First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the thirteen British Colonies in North America 8 On July 4 1776 the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence referring to the new nation as the United States of America The Articles of Confederation in 1781 created a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions With no executive or judiciary and minimal authority this government was weak 9 and lacked authority to collect taxes regulate commerce or enforce laws 10 11 ",
			"after": " Government powerlessness led to the Convention of 1787 which proposed a revised constitution with a two chamber or bicameral congress 12 Smaller states argued for equal representation for each state 13 The two chamber structure had functioned well in state governments 5 A compromise plan was adopted with representatives chosen by population benefitting larger states and exactly two senators chosen by state governments benefitting smaller states 5 14 The ratified constitution created a federal structure with two overlapping power centers so that each citizen as an individual was subjected to both the power of state government and the national government 15 16 17 To protect against abuse of power each branch of government executive legislative and judicial had a separate sphere of authority and could check other branches according to the principle of the separation of powers 18 Furthermore there were checks and balances within the legislature since there were two separate chambers 19 The new government became active in 1789 18 20 ",
