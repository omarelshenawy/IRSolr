			"after": " Music has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times 156 Although in the early Middle Ages the church was quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe 157 there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as Gregorian chant Outside religious establishments musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music goltraige laughing music geantraige and sleeping music suantraige 158 Vocal and instrumental music e g for the harp pipes and various string instruments was transmitted orally but the Irish harp in particular was of such significance that it became Ireland s national symbol Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas in establishments of Anglo Irish rule such as Dublin Castle St Patrick s Cathedral and Christ Church as well as the country houses of the Anglo Irish ascendancy with the first performance of Handel s Messiah 1742 being among the highlights of the baroque era In the 19th century public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society Yet for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians so the names of the better known Irish composers of this time belong to emigrants ",
