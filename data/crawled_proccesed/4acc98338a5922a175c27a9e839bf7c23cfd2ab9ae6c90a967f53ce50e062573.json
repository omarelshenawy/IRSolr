			"previous": " The large Baroque tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased and was more likely to include personified figures of Death Time Virtues or other figures than angels The late medieval transi tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay such as skulls and skeletons was sometimes re introduced but in a less confrontational manner 119 Neo Classicism led by Antonio Canova revived the classical stela either with a portrait or a personification in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons 120 ",
