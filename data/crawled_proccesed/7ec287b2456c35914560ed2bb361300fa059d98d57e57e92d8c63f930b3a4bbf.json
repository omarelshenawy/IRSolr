			"previous": " The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous trees such as oak birch and beech on chalky soils 34 It is also suspected of being a mycorrhizal associate of subshrub rock roses in the genus Helianthemum 51 Field studies indicate that the fungus when paired as a mycorrhizal partner with seedlings of the conifer Cunninghamia lanceolata increases the seedling s survival rate augments its height and ground diameter and increases the chlorophyll content in the leaves 52 A similar growth enhancing effect had been noted earlier with Pinus taiwanensis seedlings 53 These beneficial effects on plant growth are a result of multiple interactions among the fungus host plant and indigenous soil microbes that increase the biomass of carbon and increase the bacterial diversity in the mycorrhizosphere 54 In a study comparing the salinity resistance of three common ectomycorrhizal fungi the others were Suillus bovinus and S luteus S luridus was the most tolerant to high concentrations of salt and is a good candidate species for the inoculation of tree seedlings to be planted on saline soil 55 Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground 37 from June to November after summer rains S luridus may occur in parks near a single tree though it will not be found in acidic soils 34 ",
