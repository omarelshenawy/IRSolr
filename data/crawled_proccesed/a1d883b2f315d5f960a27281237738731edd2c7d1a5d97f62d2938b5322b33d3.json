			"previous": " According to Muslim tradition Muhammad s wife Khadija was the first to believe he was a prophet 77 She was followed by Muhammad s ten year old cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib close friend Abu Bakr and adopted son Zaid 11 77 Around 613 Muhammad began to preach to the public Quran 26 214 78 Most Meccans ignored him and mocked him 76 though a few became his followers There were three main groups of early converts to Islam younger brothers and sons of great merchants people who had fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it and the weak mostly unprotected foreigners 79 ",
			"after": " According to Ibn Sad the opposition in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and the Meccan forefathers who engaged in polytheism 76 80 However the Quranic exegesis maintains that it began as Muhammad started public preaching 81 As the number of followers increased he became a threat to the local tribes and rulers of the city whose wealth rested upon the Ka aba the focal point of Meccan religious life that Muhammad threatened to overthrow Muhammad s denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe the Quraysh as they were the guardians of the Ka aba 79 The powerful merchants attempted to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching by offering him admission into the inner circle of merchants and establishing his position therein by an advantageous marriage However he refused both 79 ",
