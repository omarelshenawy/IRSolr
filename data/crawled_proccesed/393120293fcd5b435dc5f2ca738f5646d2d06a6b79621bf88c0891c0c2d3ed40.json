			"after": " The newly released eagle and double eagle had provoked considerable controversy over their omission of the motto In God We Trust and with Congress already preparing to require the motto s use Leach ordered work suspended on the half and quarter eagle on January 18 The Mint had not expected to have to put In God We Trust on small coins of the double eagle design on which it was already having trouble finding space for the other required legends On the assumption the bill would succeed Leach had Barber continue with his work and at least one pattern half eagle was struck on February 26 for Leach to show the President 12 ",
