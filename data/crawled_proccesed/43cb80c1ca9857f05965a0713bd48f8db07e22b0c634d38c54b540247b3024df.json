			"previous": " Song crossbowmen comprised their own separate units apart from the infantry and according to the Chinese Wujing Zongyao military manuscript of 1044 the crossbow used in mass was the most effective weapon used against northern nomadic cavalry charges 210 Elite crossbowmen were also valued as long range snipers such was the case when the Liao general Xiao Talin was picked off by a Song crossbow at the Battle of Shanzhou in 1004 210 Crossbows were mass produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on such as the use of a mulberry wood and brass crossbow in 1068 that could pierce a tree at 140 paces 220 Song cavalry used an array of different weapons including halberds swords bows and fire lances that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel 221 In preparation for war government armories manufactured weapons in enormous quantities with tens of millions of arrowheads crafted each year along with armor components by the tens of thousands 209 There were sixteen known varieties of catapults in the Song period designed to fit many different proportions and requiring work crews in sizes ranging from dozens to several hundred men 208 ",
			"after": " Unlike many other Chinese dynasties throughout history the Song dynasty did not model its military infrastructure and organization on the precedent of northern nomadic armies such as the earlier Xianbei and later Mongols 73 Only twice in the Song era were non Chinese people employed in Song cavalry units in the beginning of the dynasty with the campaigns of Emperor Taizu and later 13th century Mongol defectors who came over to fight for the Song 221 With the Khitan and Tangut kingdoms possessing much of the pasture and grazing lands in the north the Song military had a shortage of horses for cavalry 219 To make up for this shortage statesmen like Wang Anshi advocated greater ties with Tibet as the tea horse trade with Tibet was continued by the Ming dynasty 222 223 Still the Song established considerably large navies in the 10th century in the war to reunite China and then a standing navy in the 12th century Many of the warships in the Song dynasty s navy were paddle wheel driven crafts and some Song naval ships could carry up to 1 000 soldiers 224 It was also during the Song period that naval ships were first armed with gunpowder weapons 225 The use of enormous pontoon bridges in the Song era on at least one occasion was essential to victory The Song built a large floating bridge across the Yangtze River in 974 while troops were under attack the pontoon bridge was used as a means of transport for troops and supplies to the other bank during the early Song conquest of the Southern Tang state 225 ",
