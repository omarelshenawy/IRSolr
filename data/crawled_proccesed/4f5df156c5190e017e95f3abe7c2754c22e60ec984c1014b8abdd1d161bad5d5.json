			"previous": " Religious traditions helped this species to survive in one Turkish colony long after the species had disappeared from Europe since it was believed that the ibis migrated each year to guide Hajj pilgrims to Mecca The ibis was protected by its religious significance and a festival was held annually to celebrate its return north 27 The Turkish ibis population was centred near the small town of Birecik in the south east of the country and during the first half of the 20th century the Birecik colony maintained a relatively stable population of about 500 breeding pairs reaching an estimated total population of about 3 000 around 1930 By the 1970s numbers had drastically declined and a captive breeding program was initiated in 1977 with one adult pair and nine chicks taken from the wild This program largely failed to revert the decline there were 400 birds in 1982 five pairs in 1986 and seven pairs in 1987 Only three birds returned from their wintering grounds in 1989 and just one in 1990 The returning birds died before they could reproduce thus rendering the species extinct in the wild in Turkey as of 1992 Once the wild Turkish population became non viable the colony was maintained as a flock which was free flying for most of the year but caged in autumn to prevent migration 28 ",
			"after": " After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen Eritrea Saudi Arabia and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East 31 Intensive field surveys in spring 2002 based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes Following systematic searches 15 old nesting sites were found one near Palmyra was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals 11 32 33 Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier 34 the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline 32 33 ",
