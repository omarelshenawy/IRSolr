			"after": " The creation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was first of all the result of economic political and ethno cultural unification of Belarusian lands 43 Of the principalities held by the Duchy nine were settled by ancestors of the Belarusian people 44 During this time the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns including fighting on the side of Poland against the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe 45 ",
