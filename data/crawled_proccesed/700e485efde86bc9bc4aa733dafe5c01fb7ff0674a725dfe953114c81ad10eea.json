			"after": " Stratigraphy is a key concept to modern archaeological theory and practice Modern excavation techniques are based on stratigraphic principles The concept derives from the geological use of the idea that sedimentation takes place according to uniform principles When archaeological finds are below the surface of the ground as is most commonly the case the identification of the context of each find is vital in enabling the archaeologist to draw conclusions about the site and about the nature and date of its occupation It is the archaeologist s role to attempt to discover what contexts exist and how they came to be created Archaeological stratification or sequence is the dynamic superimposition of single units of stratigraphy or contexts ",
