			"after": " DNA sequencing of remains of two mammoths one from Siberia 44 800 years BP and one from Wrangel Island 4 300 years BP indicates two major population crashes one around 280 000 years ago from which the population recovered and a second about 12 000 years ago near the Ice Age s end from which it did not 95 The Wrangel Island mammoths were isolated for 5000 years and due to the small population present when the island was isolated by rising post ice age sea level about 300 to 1000 individuals 96 experienced a 20 95 to 30 90 loss of heterozygosity and a 65 loss in mitochondrial DNA diversity 90 However the population seems to have subsequently been stable without suffering further significant loss of genetic diversity 90 97 Genetic evidence thus implies the extinction of this final population was sudden rather than the culmination of a gradual decline 90 the disappearance coincides roughly in time with the first evidence for humans on the island 98 The woolly mammoths of eastern Beringia modern Alaska and Yukon had similarly died out about 13 300 years ago soon roughly 1000 years after the first appearance of humans in the area which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene proboscids mammoths gomphotheres and mastodons as well as most of the rest of the megafauna of the Americas 99 In contrast the St Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out prior to human arrival due to habitat shrinkage resulting from the post ice age sea level rise 99 ",
