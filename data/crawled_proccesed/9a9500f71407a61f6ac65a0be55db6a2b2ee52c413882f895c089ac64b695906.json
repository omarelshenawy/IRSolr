			"previous": " Thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions When this rule is broken giving the molecule a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion However the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well separated form such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids for example common sulfate or nitrate ions are generally not considered molecules in chemistry ",
			"after": " The inert or noble gas elements helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way Identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water air and many organic compounds like alcohol sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals ",
