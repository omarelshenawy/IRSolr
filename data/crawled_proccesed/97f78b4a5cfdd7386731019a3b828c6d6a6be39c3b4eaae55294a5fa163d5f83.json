			"after": " Air is blown or sucked through a duct equipped with a viewing port and instrumentation where models or geometrical shapes are mounted for study Typically the air is moved through the tunnel using a series of fans For very large wind tunnels several meters in diameter a single large fan is not practical and so instead an array of multiple fans are used in parallel to provide sufficient airflow Due to the sheer volume and speed of air movement required the fans may be powered by stationary turbofan engines rather than electric motors ",
