			"after": " Unlike wind and wave tidal power is an inherently predictable source However the technology is in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages Today it is known that a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine but twenty five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested 66 This is the current situation with regard to tidal power Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1 2 MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world 67 To date the only installed tidal power plant of any size is the 240 MW rated barrage scheme at the Rance Estuary in Brittany which has been operating successfully for more than 25 years although there are a number of other much smaller projects around the world 68 ",
