			"previous": " In the field of law Justinian I s reforms had a clear effect on the evolution of jurisprudence and Leo III s Ecloga influenced the formation of legal institutions in the Slavic world 173 In the 10th century Leo VI the Wise achieved the complete codification of the whole of Byzantine law in Greek which became the foundation of all subsequent Byzantine law generating interest to the present day 88 ",
