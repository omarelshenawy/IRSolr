			"previous": " Sullivan s only grand opera Ivanhoe based on Walter Scott s novel opened at Carte s new Royal English Opera House on 31 January 1891 Sullivan completed the score too late to meet Carte s planned production date and costs mounted Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of 3 000 for his delay 132 133 The production lasted for 155 consecutive performances an unprecedented run for a serious opera and earned good notices for its music 134 Afterwards Carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions however and Ivanhoe was blamed for the failure of the opera house The opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in 1894 95 134 135 The episode was as the critic Herman Klein observed the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise 136 Sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again Later in 1891 Sullivan composed music for Tennyson s The Foresters which ran well at Daly s Theatre in New York in 1892 but failed in London the following year n 21 ",
			"after": " Sullivan returned to comic opera but because of the fracture with Gilbert he and Carte sought other collaborators Sullivan s next piece was Haddon Hall 1892 with a libretto by Sydney Grundy based loosely on the historical elopement of Dorothy Vernon with John Manners 141 Although still comic the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with Gilbert It enjoyed a modest popularity running for 204 performances and earned critical praise 142 In 1895 Sullivan once more provided incidental music for the Lyceum this time for J Comyns Carr s King Arthur 143 ",
