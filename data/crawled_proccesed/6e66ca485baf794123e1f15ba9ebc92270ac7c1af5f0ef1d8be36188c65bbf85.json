			"after": " Classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognised and well developed before the beginning of the 20th century classical mechanics acoustics optics thermodynamics and electromagnetism Classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration kinematics study of motion without regard to its causes and dynamics study of motion and the forces that affect it mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics known together as continuum mechanics the latter including such branches as hydrostatics hydrodynamics aerodynamics and pneumatics Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced controlled transmitted and received 34 Important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing bioacoustics the physics of animal calls and hearing 35 and electroacoustics the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics 36 Optics the study of light is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility e g reflection refraction interference diffraction dispersion and polarization of light Heat is a form of energy the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy Electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current Electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest electrodynamics with moving charges and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest ",
