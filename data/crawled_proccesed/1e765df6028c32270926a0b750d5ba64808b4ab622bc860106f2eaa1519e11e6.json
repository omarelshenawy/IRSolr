			"previous": "  The fuselage fju z l from the French fusel spindle shaped is an aircraft s main body section that holds crew and passengers or cargo In single engine aircraft it will usually contain an engine although in some amphibious aircraft the single engine is mounted on a pylon attached to the fuselage which in turn is used as a floating hull The fuselage also serves to position control and stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to lifting surfaces required for aircraft stability and maneuverability ",
			"after": " This type of structure is still in use in many lightweight aircraft using welded steel tube trusses A box truss fuselage structure can also be built out of wood often covered with plywood as can be seen on this Ibis canard fuselage Simple box structures may be rounded by the addition of supported lightweight stringers allowing the fabric covering to form a more aerodynamic shape or one more pleasing to the eye ",
