			"previous": " It was only in 1990 after the fall of communism that a new terminal started to be built at Ok cie The main contractor was the German company Hochtief and the work involved some 164 subcontractors of which 121 were Polish companies After 24 months the new terminal was completed at the expense of some 300 million German marks A network of multi storey car parks and access roads was also built and with their completion Warsaw gained a modern terminal with a capacity of 3 5 million passengers a year The terminal began to operate on 1 July 1992 with the first travellers to use it being those returning from Athens Bangkok Dubai and New York Ten days later the airport celebrated the first passengers departing from the new Warsaw Ok cie In the departure hall at that time there were 26 check in desks however in subsequent years of operation passenger traffic grew rapidly In 1993 the airport handled nearly 2 2 million passengers while six years later this figure climbed to 4 million Eventually the decision was taken to increase the number of available check in desks to 33 and then to 46 consequently increasing the terminal s capacity to 6 million passengers a year ",
