			"previous": " The tammar has 324 peripheral vision and 50 binocular vision 5 312 It can distinguish black white gratings of different widths and in different light conditions better than most other small mammals such as rabbits It is nevertheless not as good as a cat or a human 16 Tammars appear to have some colour vision its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones allowing it to see colour in the blue green band of the colour spectrum but not the longer wavelengths of the red yellow band Nevertheless in the band where it can see colour it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as 20 nm 2 0 10 8 m apart 17 The pinna ear of the tammar is mobile allowing it to track sounds from different parts of its surroundings without moving its head A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum s sound pressure by 25 30 dB at 5 kHz When the pinna moves away from the sound source the animal s hearing level quickly drops 18 When born a tammar s sense of smell is already developed this allows the newborn to find its mother s pouch by the scent 19 ",
