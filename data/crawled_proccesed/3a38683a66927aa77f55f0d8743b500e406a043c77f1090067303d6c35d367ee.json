			"previous": " Growth in air combat capability focused on the introduction of improved air to air missiles radar systems and other avionics While guns remained standard equipment early models of F 4 being a notable exception air to air missiles became the primary weapons for air superiority fighters which employed more sophisticated radars and medium range RF AAMs to achieve greater stand off ranges however kill probabilities proved unexpectedly low for RF missiles due to poor reliability and improved electronic countermeasures ECM for spoofing radar seekers Infrared homing AAMs saw their fields of view expand to 45 which strengthened their tactical usability Nevertheless the low dogfight loss exchange ratios experienced by American fighters in the skies over Vietnam led the U S Navy to establish its famous TOPGUN fighter weapons school which provided a graduate level curriculum to train fleet fighter pilots in advanced Air Combat Maneuvering ACM and Dissimilar Air Combat Training DACT tactics and techniques ",
			"after": " This era also saw an expansion in ground attack capabilities principally in guided missiles and witnessed the introduction of the first truly effective avionics for enhanced ground attack including terrain avoidance systems Air to surface missiles ASM equipped with electro optical E O contrast seekers such as the initial model of the widely used AGM 65 Maverick became standard weapons and laser guided bombs LGBs became widespread in effort to improve precision attack capabilities Guidance for such precision guided munitions PGM was provided by externally mounted targeting pods which were introduced in the mid 1960s ",
