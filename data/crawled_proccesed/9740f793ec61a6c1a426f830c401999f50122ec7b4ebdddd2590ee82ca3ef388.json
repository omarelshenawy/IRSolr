			"previous": " In contrast to the chaotic development of ironclad warships in preceding decades the 1890s saw navies worldwide start to build battleships to a common design as dozens of ships essentially followed the design of the British Majestic class 2 The similarity in appearance of battleships in the 1890s was underlined by the increasing number of ships being built New naval powers such as Germany Japan the United States and to a lesser extent Italy and Austria Hungary began to establish themselves with fleets of pre dreadnoughts while the navies of Britain France and Russia expanded to meet these new threats The decisive clash of pre dreadnought fleets was between the Imperial Russian Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905 3 ",
			"after": " These battleships were abruptly made obsolete by the arrival of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 Dreadnought followed the trend in battleship design to heavier longer ranged guns by adopting an all big gun armament scheme of ten 12 inch guns Her innovative steam turbine engines also made her faster 4 The existing pre dreadnoughts were decisively outclassed and new and more powerful battleships were from then on known as dreadnoughts while the ships laid down previously were designated pre dreadnoughts ",
