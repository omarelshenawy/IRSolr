			"previous": " Until the 21st century brief observations and lemur surveys had merely documented the presence of the silky sifaka in special reserves and national parks More recently a 14 month study and two short term studies in Marojejy National Park have revealed previously unknown details about its behavioral biology communication and feeding ecology 20 35 The silky sifaka has a variable social structure and is known to live in male female pairs one male groups and multi male multi female groups Group sizes range from two to nine individuals while the home ranges are estimated to range from 34 to 47 ha 0 13 to 0 18 sq mi varying in size by location 17 20 29 36 ",
			"after": " According to some studies the silky sifaka spends most of its day resting and feeding approximately 44 4 and 25 respectively It also devotes approximately 16 8 of the day to social behavior such as personal grooming social grooming allogrooming and play The rest of the day is spent traveling and sleeping 20 Other sources report that the species divides half of the day between traveling and foraging while the rest is spent resting 17 Daily foraging usually starts at dawn unless delayed by rain Group movement is usually led by females and groups usually travel 700 m 2 300 ft per day and may climb 500 m 1 600 ft along vertical slopes 34 Although the species spends its time in the trees terrestrial play is not uncommon even among adults 36 with play sessions lasting 30 minutes or more 34 Like other sifakas it uses a type of arboreal locomotion known as vertical clinging and leaping 34 Dominance hierarchies have not been documented among female sifakas including the silky sifaka although seasonal hierarchies are known to occur 37 Aggression which is generally infrequent occurs primarily during feeding where females take priority over males 36 although submissive signals are not always obvious 34 ",
