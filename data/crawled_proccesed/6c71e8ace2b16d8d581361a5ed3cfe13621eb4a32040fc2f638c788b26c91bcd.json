			"previous": " Although more than a million were minted in 1881 1 another blow to the three cent piece occurred on October 1 1883 when first class mail rates were lowered from three to two cents for the first 0 5 ounces 14 g Although the rate for pieces weighing up to 1 ounce 28 g initially remained at three cents the two cent rate was extended to one ounce effective July 1 1885 Deprived of the original reason for the denomination s existence 39 no three cent pieces were struck for circulation in 1886 though several thousand proof coins were produced and in the three remaining years of the piece s life a total of less than 60 000 circulation strikes were minted 1 As the production of three cent pieces dwindled the other non specie coins prospered with record numbers of cents being struck in the 1880s to address the need to make change and for penny arcade machines The nickel proved popular in slot machines and street railways which often set fares at five cents With silver again circulating the three cent piece became more unpopular because it was almost the same diameter as the dime leading to confusion and small frauds 40 ",
			"after": " Beginning in 1880 in their annual reports the Mint Director and Treasury Secretary appealed to Congress to discontinue the three cent piece 40 The last three cent pieces were struck in 1889 1 and the denomination was discontinued along with the gold dollar and the three dollar piece by the Act of September 26 1890 14 Many of the coins from 1888 and 1889 were still held at the Treasury Department and were melted after passage of the act the fate of millions more as they flowed back from banks The resultant metal contributed to large mintages of the Liberty Head nickel between 1890 and 1893 41 ",
