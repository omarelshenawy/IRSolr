			"after": " The School for Creative and Performing Arts arose in part as a response to the recurring desegregation battles in the Cincinnati Public Schools CPS in the late 1960s and early 1970s 5 In a 1965 civil rights suit the city prevailed when a federal judge found that the schools were not intentionally segregated but that the racial composition of each school is simply a result of the racial composition of the neighborhoods which they serve 6 By 1971 Cincinnati s neighborhoods and schools had grown more segregated and the Supreme Court of the United States upheld forced busing as a remedy for school segregation in other cities 7 Desiring to avoid such drastic remedies for Cincinnati newly appointed Superintendent Dr Donald Waldrip pushed forward a program of alternative schools later called magnet schools designed to calm the desires of parents for academic choice and to stem the demands of federal judges for court ordered desegregation 5 The theory behind alternative schools was open enrollment students could attend any alternative school they chose at no cost so long as an even racial balance at the new school was maintained 8 So far as possible students were admitted to these programs on a one white for one black basis 9 The School for Creative and Performing Arts was the first alternative school in what would become one of the largest and most robust magnet programs in the country 10 a ",
