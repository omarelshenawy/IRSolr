			"previous": " Pairs are established or confirmed through aerial courtship displays in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to 200 m 660 ft or more calling all the while before the two birds descend together in zigzag glides If the male is carrying a fish he may attract the attention of other males too On the ground the male courts the female by circling her with his tail and neck raised head pointing down and wings partially open If she responds they may both adopt a posture with the head pointed skywards The male may tease a female with the fish not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently 67 Once courtship is complete the male makes a shallow depression in the sand and the female scratches in the same place Several trials may take place until the pair settle on a site for the actual nest 67 The eggs may be laid on bare sand gravel or soil but a lining of debris or vegetation is often added if available 43 or the nest may be rimmed with seaweed stones or shells The saucer shaped scrape is typically 4 cm 1 6 in deep and 10 cm 3 9 in across but may extend to as much as 24 cm 9 4 in wide including the surrounding decorative material 68 Breeding success in areas prone to flooding has been enhanced by the provision of artificial mats made from eelgrass which encourage the terns to nest in higher less vulnerable areas since many prefer the mats to bare sand 69 The common tern tends to use more nest material than roseate or Arctic terns although roseate often nests in areas with more growing vegetation 70 71 ",
