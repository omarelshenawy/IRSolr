			"after": " Acme Structural of Springfield Missouri was the subcontractor for the trellis over the Great Lawn 9 which resulted from the distributed sound system s requirement for speakers every 70 feet 21 m One way to achieve this would have involved placing the speakers on pipes or columns but the resulting forest of columns seemed discordant with the architecture 30 Gehry preferred the trellis although it cost about 3 million more than speakers arranged on posts would have 16 The trellis uses 22 criss crossing arches in a lattice pattern 35 and is noted for its parabolic grid 7 The arches use pipes varying in diameter from 12 20 inches 30 51 cm depending upon the load requirements 35 Arches longer than 300 feet 91 m have four or five different radii where radius describes the extent of pipe curvature 35 The arch pipes connect to the structural steel of the pavilion structure without linking to the metal ribbons 35 The trellis is 600 by 300 feet 183 by 91 m 36 ",
