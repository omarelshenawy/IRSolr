			"previous": " Fossil fuels make up the bulk of the world s current primary energy sources The technology and infrastructure already exist for the use of fossil fuels Petroleum energy density in terms of volume cubic space and mass weight ranks currently above that of alternative energy sources or energy storage devices like a battery Fossil fuels are currently economical and suitable for decentralized energy use ",
			"after": " Dependence on fossil fuels from regions or countries creates energy security risks for dependent countries 16 17 18 19 20 Oil dependence in particular has led to war 21 funding of radicals 22 monopolization 23 and socio political instability 24 Fossil fuels are non renewable un sustainable resources which will eventually decline in production 25 and become exhausted with consequences to societies that remain dependent on them Fossil fuels are actually slowly forming continuously but are being consumed quicker than are formed note 18 Extracting fuels becomes increasingly extreme as society consumes the most accessible fuel deposits Extraction in fuel mines get intensive and oil rigs drill deeper going further out to sea 26 Extraction of fossil fuels results in environmental degradation such as the strip mining and mountaintop removal of coal ",
