			"previous": " These pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved air flow Whenever a fluid follows a curved path there is a pressure gradient perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside 50 This direct relationship between curved streamlines and pressure differences was derived from Newton s second law by Leonhard Euler in 1754 ",
			"after": " The left hand side of this equation represents the pressure difference perpendicular to the fluid flow On the right hand side is the density v is the velocity and R is the radius of curvature This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create larger pressure differentials and that for straight flow R the pressure difference is zero 51 ",
