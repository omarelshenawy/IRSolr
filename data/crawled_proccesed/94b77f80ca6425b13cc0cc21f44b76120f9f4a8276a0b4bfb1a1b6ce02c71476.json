			"previous": " Poole established successful commerce with the North American colonies in the 16th century including the important fisheries of Newfoundland 14 The trade with Newfoundland grew steadily to meet the demand for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe Poole s share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century The trade was a three cornered route ships sailed to Newfoundland with salt and provisions then carried dried and salted fish to Europe before returning to Poole with wine olive oil and salt 18 By the early 18th century Poole had more ships trading with North America than any other English port and vast wealth was brought to Poole s merchants 19 This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town where many of the medieval buildings were replaced with Georgian mansions and terraced housing 18 20 The end of the Napoleonic Wars and the conclusion of the War of 1812 ended Britain s monopoly over the Newfoundland fisheries and other nations took over services provided by Poole s merchants at a lower cost Poole s Newfoundland trade rapidly declined and within a decade most merchants had ceased trading 21 22 ",
			"after": " The town grew rapidly during the industrial revolution as urbanisation took place and the town became an area of mercantile prosperity and overcrowded poverty At the turn of the 19th century nine out of ten workers were engaged in harbour activities but as the century progressed ships became too large for the shallow harbour and the port lost business to the deep water ports at Liverpool Southampton and Plymouth 19 Poole s first railway station opened in Hamworthy in 1847 and later extended to the centre of Poole in 1872 effectively ending the port s busy coastal shipping trade 22 The beaches and landscape of southern Dorset and south west Hampshire began to attract tourists during the 19th century and the villages to the east of Poole began to grow and merge until the seaside resort of Bournemouth emerged Although Poole did not become a resort like many of its neighbours it continued to prosper as the rapid expansion of Bournemouth created a large demand for goods manufactured in Poole 23 ",
