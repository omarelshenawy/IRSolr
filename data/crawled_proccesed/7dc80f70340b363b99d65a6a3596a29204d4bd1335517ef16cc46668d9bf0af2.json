			"previous": " The reverse is based on an early sketch of the statue of Lafayette by Bartlett It depicts a mounted statue of Lafayette riding left His horse has two feet up which by some accounts in art means Lafayette died on the battlefield which he did not one hoof up would mean a battlefield wound and all four feet on the ground means the subject died a natural death Barber s monogram does not appear on the coin but the name Bartlett appears on the base of the statue Also on the base and extending below it is a palm branch The reverse inscription Erected by the youth of the United States in honor of Gen Lafayette Paris 1900 is a tribute to the school fundraising efforts that took place in 1898 Swiatek and Breen pointed out that even if one grants that the 1900 date was intended to be that of the exposition and the erection of the statue the coins would still violate the 1873 act that required the date of mintage to appear on the coins and thus the Lafayette dollars are technically undated and therefore illegal 23 24 ",
			"after": " On the reverse Lafayette holds a sword extended upwards 24 Bartlett described the version of the statue that Barber worked from Lafayette is represented in the statue as a fact and a symbol offering his sword and services to the American colonists in the cause of liberty He appears as the emblem of the aristocratic and enthusiastic sympathy shown by France to our forefathers 25 Swiatek and Breen noted We may take Lafayette s pose on the statue as depicted on the coin to represent him in triumphal procession rather than charging against the enemy note his sheathed sword like a Highland pipe major s baton serving as a standard rather than brandished unsheathed as a weapon 22 ",
