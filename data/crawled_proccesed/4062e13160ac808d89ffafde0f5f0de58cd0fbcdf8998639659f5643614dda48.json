			"after": " The lifting capacity of an aircraft depends on the wing size and its loading the weight per unit area that the wing can support Loading is more or less constant for a given level of technology Thus as aircraft size increases the lifting capacity increases with the surface area For a given aerodynamic form the area in turn increases with the square of the wing span If structural efficiency can be maintained the structural weight of the airframe also increases with its surface area and the square of the span But the internal volume increases with the cube of the span ",
