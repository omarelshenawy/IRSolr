			"after": "  The supreme embodiment of the armored cruiser in historian Robert K Massie s words was the German ship SMS Bl cher 37 An enlarged version of the Scharnhorst class with a speed of 24 25 knots armed with 12 8 2 inch 208 mm and eight 5 9 inch 150 mm guns Bl cher was planned as an armored cruiser in part because the British had misled the Germans on the Invincibles then being constructed The Germans expected these new British ships to be armed with six or eight 9 2 in 23 cm guns 38 One week after the final decision to construct Bl cher the German naval attache learned they would carry eight 30 5 cm 12 0 in guns the same type mounted on battleships With no funds available to redesign Bl cher work was ordered to proceed as scheduled 39 Although much more powerful than a typical armored cruiser she was significantly weaker than the new British battlecruisers 40 ",
