			"previous": " On the one hand the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle s school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle s school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today 95 ",
			"after": " More than 2300 years after his death Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields According to the philosopher Bryan Magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did 96 Among countless other achievements Aristotle was the founder of formal logic 97 pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method 98 99 ",
