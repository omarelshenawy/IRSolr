			"previous": " In case of a rocket or a jet aircraft the force is exactly the thrust produced by the engine If the rocket or aircraft is moving at about a constant speed then distance divided by time is just speed so power is thrust times speed 5 ",
			"after": " This formula looks very surprising but it is correct the propulsive power or power available 6 of a jet engine increases with its speed If the speed is zero then the propulsive power is zero If a jet aircraft is at full throttle but attached to a static test stand then the jet engine produces no propulsive power however thrust is still produced Compare that to a piston engine The combination piston engine propeller also has a propulsive power with exactly the same formula and it will also be zero at zero speed but that is for the engine propeller set The engine alone will continue to produce its rated power at a constant rate whether the aircraft is moving or not ",
