			"previous": " On these basement rocks was deposited the sedimentary formation of the Pahrump Group This occurred after uplift associated erosion removed whatever rocks covered the Proterozoic aged rocks The Pahrump is composed of arkose conglomerate quartz clasts in a concrete like matrix and mud stone in its lower part followed by dolomite from carbonate banks topped by algal mats in stromatolites and finished with basin filling sediment derived from the above including possible glacial till from the hypothesized Snowball Earth glaciation 32 The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are from basaltic lava flows ",
