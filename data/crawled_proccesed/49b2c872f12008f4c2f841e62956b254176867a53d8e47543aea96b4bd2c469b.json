			"after": " In the 15th century West European mariners beginning with Portugal started making still longer voyages of exploration using improvements on translated Islamic star charts and a variation on African fishing boats called the caravel In 1473 Lopes Gon alves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotlean notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached Malindi where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India In 1492 relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth the Genovese Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient Instead he made landfall on an island in the Caribbean Sea The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes corn and chili peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco sugar indigo and cotton plantations In 1519 Juan Sebasti n Elcano completed Magellan s Spanish expedition to sail around the world 6 pp12 13 These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy In 1538 Gerardus Mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings rhumb lines straight 6 pp12 13 In the Arctic in 1594 the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while in the south Anthony de la Roch crossed the Antarctic Convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions one British one American and one Russian all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820 143 144 145 Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910 146 Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century 147 Despite a long standing preference for autarky China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties In the early 15th century Zheng He s fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37 000 men aboard 317 ships reaching as far as the African coast 6 pp12 13 Chinese exploration however was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci ",
