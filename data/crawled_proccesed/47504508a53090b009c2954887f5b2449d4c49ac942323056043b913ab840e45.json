			"after": " Malted grain is used to make malt beer malt whisky malted shakes malt vinegar and some baked goods such as bagels Malting grains develops the enzymes that are required to modify the grain s starches into sugars including monosaccharides glucose fructose etc and disaccharides sucrose etc It also develops other enzymes such as proteases which break down the proteins in the grain into forms which can be utilized by yeast Barley is the most commonly malted grain in part because of its high diastatic power or enzyme content Also very important is the retention of the grain s husk even after threshing unlike the bare seeds of threshed wheat or rye This protects the growing acrospire developing plant embryo from damage during malting which can easily lead to mold growth It also allows the mash of converted grain to create a filter bed during lautering see brewing Other grains may be malted especially wheat ",
