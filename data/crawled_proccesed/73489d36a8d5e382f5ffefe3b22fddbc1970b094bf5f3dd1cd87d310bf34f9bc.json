			"previous": " The Snake River fine spotted cutthroat trout or Snake River cutthroat trout is the only native trout species in Grand Teton National Park 102 It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers Various researchers have not been able to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout though in terms of appearances the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches 103 The Snake River fine spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid 1990s and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana 103 104 Snake River fine spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho Other non native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone 105 Today five trout species inhabit park waters 102 Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish longnose dace mountain sucker and non native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling 102 ",
