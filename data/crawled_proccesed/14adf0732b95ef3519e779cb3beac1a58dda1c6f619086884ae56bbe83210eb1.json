			"after": " The cosmic microwave background is radiation left over from decoupling after the epoch of recombination when neutral atoms first formed At this point radiation produced in the Big Bang stopped Thomson scattering from charged ions The radiation first observed in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson has a perfect thermal black body spectrum It has a temperature of 2 7 kelvins today and is isotropic to one part in 105 Cosmological perturbation theory which describes the evolution of slight inhomogeneities in the early universe has allowed cosmologists to precisely calculate the angular power spectrum of the radiation and it has been measured by the recent satellite experiments COBE and WMAP and many ground and balloon based experiments such as Degree Angular Scale Interferometer Cosmic Background Imager and Boomerang One of the goals of these efforts is to measure the basic parameters of the Lambda CDM model with increasing accuracy as well as to test the predictions of the Big Bang model and look for new physics The recent measurements made by WMAP for example have placed limits on the neutrino masses ",
