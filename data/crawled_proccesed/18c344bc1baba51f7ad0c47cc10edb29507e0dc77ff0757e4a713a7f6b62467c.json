			"previous": " During the Permian period synapsids including the ancestors of mammals may have dominated land environments 71 but the Permian Triassic extinction event 251 million years ago came very close to wiping out complex life 72 The extinctions were apparently fairly sudden at least among vertebrates 73 During the slow recovery from this catastrophe a previously obscure group archosaurs became the most abundant and diverse terrestrial vertebrates One archosaur group the dinosaurs were the dominant land vertebrates for the rest of the Mesozoic 74 and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs 70 During this time mammals ancestors survived only as small mainly nocturnal insectivores but this apparent set back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair 75 After the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago killed off the non avian dinosaurs birds are the only surviving dinosaurs mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity and some took to the air and the sea 76 77 78 ",
			"after": " Fossil evidence indicates that flowering plants appeared and rapidly diversified in the Early Cretaceous between 130 million years ago and 90 million years ago 79 Their rapid rise to dominance of terrestrial ecosystems is thought to have been propelled by coevolution with pollinating insects 80 Social insects appeared around the same time and although they account for only small parts of the insect family tree now form over 50 of the total mass of all insects 81 ",
