			"previous": " The design began life in a requirement by American Airlines for an airliner to replace its Douglas DC 3s Convair s original design the unpressurised Model 110 was a twin engined low wing monoplane of all metal construction with 30 seats It was powered by Pratt Whitney R 2800 Double Wasp radial engines and had a tricycle landing gear and a ventral airstair for passenger boarding 2 The prototype Model 110 registration NX90653 first flew on July 8 1946 2 By this time American had changed their requirements to require pressurization and deemed the design too small The first prototype was used by Convair for development work for the 240 series before being broken up in 1947 3 ",
			"after": " To meet the requirements of airlines for a pressurized airliner Convair produced a revised design the Model 240 This had a longer but thinner fuselage than the Model 110 accommodating 40 passengers in the first pressurized twin engined airliner 4 The 240 first flew on March 16 1947 5 ",
