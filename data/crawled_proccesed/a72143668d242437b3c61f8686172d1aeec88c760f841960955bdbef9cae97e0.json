			"previous": " The arrival in Malta of Caravaggio who painted at least seven works during his 15 month stay on these islands further revolutionised local art Two of Caravaggio s most notable works The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist and Saint Jerome Writing are on display in the Oratory of the Conventual Church of St John His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino 1582 1637 and Stefano Erardi 1630 1716 However the Baroque movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture The glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist Mattia Preti transformed the severe Mannerist interior of the Conventual Church St John into a Baroque masterpiece Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta where he created many of his finest works now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in Valletta During this period local sculptor Melchior Gaf 1639 1667 emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School ",
			"after": " During the 17th and 18th century Neapolitan and Rococo influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters Luca Giordano 1632 1705 and Francesco Solimena 1657 1747 and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as Giovanni Nicola Buhagiar 1698 1752 and Francesco Zahra 1710 1773 The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of Antoine de Favray 1706 1798 who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744 ",
