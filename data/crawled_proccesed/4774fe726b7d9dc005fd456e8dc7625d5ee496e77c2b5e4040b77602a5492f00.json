			"previous": " One of the best known sauropods Diplodocus was a very large long necked quadrupedal animal with a long whip like tail Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hind limbs resulting in a largely horizontal posture The long necked long tailed animal with four sturdy legs has been mechanically compared with a suspension bridge 6 In fact Diplodocus is the longest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton 6 The partial remains of D hallorum have increased the estimated length though not as much as previously thought when first described in 1991 discoverer David Gillette calculated it may have been up to 52 m 170 ft long 7 making it the longest known dinosaur excluding those known from exceedingly poor remains such as Amphicoelias Some weight estimates ranged as high as 113 tons 125 US short tons The estimated length was later revised downward to 33 metres 108 ft 8 based on findings that show that Gillette had originally misplaced vertebrae 12 19 as vertebrae 20 27 The nearly complete Diplodocus skeleton at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania on which estimates of Seismosaurus are based also was found to have had its 13th tail vertebra come from another dinosaur throwing size estimates for Seismosaurus further off While dinosaurs such as Supersaurus were probably longer fossil remains of these animals are only fragmentary 9 Modern mass estimates for Diplodocus exclusive of D hallorum have tended to be in the 10 to 16 tonne 11 17 6 ton range 10 tonnes 11 tons 10 11 5 tonnes 12 7 tons 11 12 7 tonnes 14 tons 12 and 16 tonnes 17 6 tons 13 ",
			"after": " Diplodocus had an extremely long tail composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae 14 which is almost double the number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails such as Shunosaurus with 43 and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had such as Camarasaurus with 53 There has been speculation as to whether it may have had a defensive 15 or noisemaking by cracking it like a coachwhip function 16 The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck The middle part of the tail had double beams oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside which gave Diplodocus its name They may have provided support for the vertebrae or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal s heavy tail pressed against the ground These double beams are also seen in some related dinosaurs 17 ",
