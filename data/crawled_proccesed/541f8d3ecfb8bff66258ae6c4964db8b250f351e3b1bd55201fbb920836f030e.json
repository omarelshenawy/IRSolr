			"after": " Some species of rodent are monogamous with an adult male and female forming a lasting pair bond Monogamy can come in two forms obligate and facultative In obligate monogamy both parents care for the offspring and play an important part in their survival This occurs in species such as California mice oldfield mice Malagasy giant rats and beavers In these species males usually mate only with their partners In addition to increased care for young obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female In facultative monogamy the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity 66 ",
