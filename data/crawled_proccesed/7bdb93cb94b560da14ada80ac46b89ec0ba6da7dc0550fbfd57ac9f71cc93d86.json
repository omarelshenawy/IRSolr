			"previous": " The threat evolved by World War I with the development of the submarine or U boat The submarine had the potential to hide from gunfire and close underwater to fire torpedoes Early war destroyers had the speed and armament to intercept submarines before they submerged either by gunfire or by ramming Destroyers also had a shallow enough draft that torpedoes would find it difficult to hit them ",
			"after": " The desire to attack submarines underwater led to rapid destroyer evolution during the war they were quickly equipped with strengthened bows for ramming depth charges and hydrophones for identifying submarine targets The first submarine casualty to a destroyer was the German U 19 rammed by HMS Badger on 29 October 1914 While U 19 was only damaged the next month Garry successfully sank U 18 The first depth charge sinking was on 4 December 1916 when UC 19 30 was sunk by HMS Llewellyn ",
