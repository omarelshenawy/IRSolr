			"previous": " The majority of the battleships up through World War I vintage had armor disposed in belts of varying thickness around the hull concentrating the main thickness at the point where the majority of the enemy shells would impact The result of long years of experience these bands of armor were effective protection when ships fought at close range As the caliber of guns grew and fire control systems improved engagement ranges increased so that a greater number of hits would result from plunging fire against the ship s thin deck armor rather than its well protected sides ",
			"after": " Although the U S Navy had begun work on the first all or nothing ship in 1911 with the Nevada the Royal Navy did not believe that long range gunnery would be important nor of the vulnerability of the ship s magazine spaces 5 However experiences in the First World War particularly the Battle of Jutland showed that a ship could survive extensive damage as long as this was outside their magazine spaces but any shell that breached the defenses of these spaces had catastrophic effects The logical conclusion was that there was no point in having armor which could not stop a shell penetrating into the magazine spaces and that any armor that did not contribute to this goal was wasted armor The most important finding of the gunnery trials on SMS Baden was that the 7 inch 18 cm thick medium armor was completely useless against large caliber shells As a result the British navy adopted in the Nelson class 6 the all or nothing armor pioneered by the United States Navy 6 7 ",
