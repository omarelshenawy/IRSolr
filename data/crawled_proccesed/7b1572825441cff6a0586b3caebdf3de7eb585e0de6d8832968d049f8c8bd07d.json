			"after": " The tooth is recurved with a backward bend and is oval in cross section Its front and back cutting edges are finely serrated extending two thirds down each edge 6 There are six denticles per millimeter 0 04 in and each denticle is square and chiseled The overall form of the tooth its width and shape in cross section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla upper jawbone and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America Blood grooves are indistinct or absent also similar to Dromaeosaurus and differing from members of the Velociraptorinae subfamily Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that the cutting edge at the front side is further from the middle of the tooth Although the tooth is larger and the denticles similar each denticle was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus which had only 13 20 denticles per 5 millimetres 0 20 in instead of Dromaeosauroides 30 1 The second known tooth is smaller 15 millimetres 0 59 in with the same features as the holotype 2 ",
