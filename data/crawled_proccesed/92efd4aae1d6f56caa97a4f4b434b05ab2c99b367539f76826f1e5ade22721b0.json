			"after": " An intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM is a guided ballistic missile with a minimum range of more than 5 500 kilometres 3 400 mi 1 primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery delivering one or more thermonuclear warheads Similarly conventional chemical and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness but have never been deployed on ICBMs Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles MIRVs allowing a single missile to carry several warheads each of which can strike a different target ",
