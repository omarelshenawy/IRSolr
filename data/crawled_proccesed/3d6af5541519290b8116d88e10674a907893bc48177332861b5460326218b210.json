			"previous": " Lemur communication can be transmitted through sound sight and smell olfaction The ring tailed lemur for instance uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent marking and vocalizations 90 Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions 88 Given their poor vision whole body postures are probably more noticeable However the ring tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare pulled back lips for submission and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent marking 90 This species has also been observed using yawns as threats 115 116 Their ringed tails also communicate distance warn off neighboring troops and help locate troop members 90 Sifakas are known to exhibit an open mouth play face 117 as well as a submissive teeth baring grimace used in agonistic interactions 70 ",
			"after": " Olfaction is particularly important to lemurs 2 except for the indri which lacks most common lemur scent glands and has a greatly reduced olfactory region in the brain 79 Olfaction can communicate information about age sex reproductive status as well as demarcate the boundaries of a territory It is most useful for communication between animals that rarely encounter each other 52 Small nocturnal lemurs mark their territories with urine while the larger diurnal species use scent glands located on various parts of their anatomy The ring tailed lemur engages in stink fights by rubbing its tail across scent glands on its wrists and then flicking its tail at other male opponents Some lemurs defecate in specific areas otherwise known as latrine behavior Although many animals exhibit this behavior it is a rare trait among primates Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling 18 ",
