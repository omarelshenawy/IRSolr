			"after": " Air is mainly composed of nitrogen oxygen and argon which together constitute the major gases of the atmosphere Water vapor accounts for roughly 0 25 of the atmosphere by mass The concentration of water vapor a greenhouse gas varies significantly from around 10 ppmv in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5 by volume in hot humid air masses and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically provided for dry air without any water vapor 4 The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases 5 among which are the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample including dust of mineral and organic composition pollen and spores sea spray and volcanic ash Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols such as chlorine elemental or in compounds fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide SO2 may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution ",
