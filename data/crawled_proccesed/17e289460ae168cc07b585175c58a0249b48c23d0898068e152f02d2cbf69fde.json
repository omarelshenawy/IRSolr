			"previous": " First the piece was rifled which allowed for a much more accurate and powerful action Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the 15th century the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery was only available by the mid 19th century Martin von Wahrendorff and Joseph Whitworth independently produced rifled cannon in the 1840s but it was Armstrong s gun that was first to see widespread use during the Crimean War 25 The cast iron shell of the Armstrong gun was similar in shape to a Mini ball and had a thin lead coating which made it fractionally larger than the gun s bore and which engaged with the gun s rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell This spin together with the elimination of windage as a result of the tight fit enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smooth bore muzzle loaders with a smaller powder charge ",
			"after": " His gun was also a breech loader Although attempts at breech loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times the essential engineering problem was that the mechanism couldn t withstand the explosive charge It was only with the advances in metallurgy and precision engineering capabilities during the Industrial Revolution that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution The gun combined all the properties that make up an effective artillery piece The gun was mounted on a carriage in such a way as to return the gun to firing position after the recoil ",
