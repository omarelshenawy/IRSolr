			"after": " Extending the flaps also increases the drag coefficient of the aircraft Therefore for any given weight and airspeed flaps increase the drag force Flaps increase the drag coefficient of an aircraft due to higher induced drag caused by the distorted spanwise lift distribution on the wing with flaps extended Some flaps increase the planform area of the wing and for any given speed this also increases the parasitic drag component of total drag 1 ",
