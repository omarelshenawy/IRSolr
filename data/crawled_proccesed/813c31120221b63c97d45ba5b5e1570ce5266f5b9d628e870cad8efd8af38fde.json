			"previous": " In 1834 the state of Pennsylvania built the Allegheny Portage Railroad across the Allegheny Mountains to connect Philadelphia and Pittsburgh 7 as part of the Main Line of Public Works The Portage Railroad was a series of canals and inclined planes and remained in use until the mid 19th century The Pennsylvania Railroad was incorporated in 1847 to build a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh replacing the cumbersome Portage Railroad 7 ",
			"after": " Using surveys completed in 1842 12 the state s engineers recommended a route west from Lewistown that followed the ridges with a maximum grade of 0 852 percent on the 84 mile 135 km line 13 The Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad John Edgar Thomson instead chose a route on lower flatter terrain along the Juniata River and accepted the resulting steeper grade west of Altoona The valley west of Altoona was split into two ravines by a mountain surveys had already found a route with an acceptable grade east from Gallitzin to the south side of the valley and Horseshoe Curve allowed the same grade to continue to Altoona Engineers built an earth fill over the first ravine encountered while ascending formed by Kittanning Run cut the point of the mountain between the ravines and filled in the second ravine formed by Glenwhite Run 9 ",
