			"previous": " In actuality of the 262 pilots selected 140 were Reserve junior officers with less than two years flying experience The Air Corps had made a decision not to draw from its training schools where most of its experienced pilots were assigned Only 48 of those selected had logged at least 25 hours of flight time in bad weather only 31 had 50 hours or more of night flying and only 2 had 50 hours of instrument time 7 ",
			"after": " The Air Corps during the Great Depression hampered by pay cuts and a reduction of flight time operated almost entirely in daylight and good weather Duty hours were limited and relaxed usually with four hours or less of flight operations a day and none on weekends Experience levels were also limited by obsolete aircraft most of them single engine and open cockpit planes Because of a high turnover rate policy in the War Department most pilots were Reserve officers unfamiliar with the civilian airmail routes 8 ",
