			"previous": " Cassatt decided to end her studies at that time no degree was granted After overcoming her father s objections she moved to Paris in 1866 with her mother and family friends acting as chaperones 14 Since women could not yet attend the cole des Beaux Arts she applied to study privately with masters from the school 15 and was accepted to study with Jean L on G r me a highly regarded teacher known for his hyper realistic technique and his depiction of exotic subjects A few months later G r me also accepted Eakins as a student 15 Cassatt augmented her artistic training with daily copying in the Louvre she obtained the required permit which was necessary to control the copyists usually low paid women who daily filled the museum to paint copies for sale The museum also served as a social meeting place for Frenchmen and American female students who like Cassatt were not allowed to attend cafes where the avant garde socialized In this manner fellow artist and friend Elizabeth Jane Gardner met and married famed academic painter William Adolphe Bouguereau 16 ",
			"after": " Toward the end of 1866 she joined a painting class taught by Charles Chaplin a noted genre artist In 1868 Cassatt also studied with artist Thomas Couture whose subjects were mostly romantic and urban 17 On trips to the countryside the students drew from life particularly the peasants going about their daily activities In 1868 one of her paintings A Mandoline Player was accepted for the first time by the selection jury for the Paris Salon With Elizabeth Jane Gardner whose work was also accepted by the jury that year Cassatt was one of two American women to first exhibit in the Salon 4 A Mandoline Player is in the Romantic style of Corot and Couture 18 and is one of only two paintings from the first decade of her career that can be documented today 19 ",
