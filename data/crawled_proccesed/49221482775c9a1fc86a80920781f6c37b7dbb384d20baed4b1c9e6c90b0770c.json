			"previous": " According to Pelin he walked to the upper sector console holding JP550 s flight progress strip He asked Tasi if the DC 9 could climb to FL350 Tasi took the strip from Pelin and looked at it then asked where the aircraft was at the moment Pelin then pointed to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica Tasi s response was yes it could climb Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasi about it who said wait until they cross Pelin referred to the middle sector screen to make sure that he had identified the DC 9 positively on the upper sector screen He then returned to Tasi and they both watched the targets pass each other at which point Tasi authorised JP550 to climb Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said yes climb it Upon Erjevec receiving the OK from Pelin he instructed the DC 9 to climb to FL350 That was at 10 07 40 ",
			"after": " At 10 12 03 JP550 called the Zagreb middle sector controller to inform them that the aircraft was out of flight level 310 The last instructions given by Erjavec to JP550 were to call the upper sector controller on 134 45 MHz and to stop squawking the assigned squawk code By instructing JP550 to squawk Standby Erjavec simply released a code allocated for the middle sector The data tag for the DC 9 would now disappear from his screen and the aircraft would become merely a point among many others If everything about this handover had been normal the DC 9 would have been given a new code on initial contact with the upper sector controller and would have been positively identified on the upper sector screen with its flight number and altitude readout But this had not been a normal handover because of the ill handled co ordination for the climb Also Tasi was busy with other traffic and JP550 did not immediately contact the upper sector controller This could have been because the frequency was busy but the pilots might also have delayed the call for some unknown reason ",
