			"previous": " Magpies have a long breeding season which varies in different parts of the country in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September but not commence until August or September in cooler regions and may continue until January in some alpine areas 73 The nest is a bowl shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark Near human habitation synthetic material may be incorporated 74 Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork often in an exposed position 75 The trees used are most commonly eucalypts although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine Crataegus and elm have been recorded 76 Other bird species such as the yellow rumped thornbill Acanthiza chrysorrhoa willie wagtail Rhipidura leucophrys Southern Whiteface Aphelocephala leucopsis and less commonly noisy miner Manorina melanocephala often nest in the same tree as the magpie The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest while the diminutive striated pardalote Pardalotus striatus has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies 77 The channel billed cuckoo Scythrops novaehollandiae is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia magpies will raise cuckoo young which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings 78 ",
			"after": " The Australian magpie produces a clutch of two to five light blue or greenish eggs which are oval in shape and about 30 by 40 mm 1 2 by 1 6 in 79 The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after incubation begins like all passerines the chicks are altricial they are born pink naked and blind with large feet a short broad beak and a bright red throat Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head back and wings in the first week and pinfeathers in the second week The black and white colouration is noticeable from an early stage 80 Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female though the male magpie will feed his partner 81 The Australian magpie is known to engage in cooperative breeding and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young 33 This does vary from region to region and with the size of the group the behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups 33 ",
