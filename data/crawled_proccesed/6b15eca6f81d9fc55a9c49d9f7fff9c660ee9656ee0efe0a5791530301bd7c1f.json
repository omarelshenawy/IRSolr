			"after": " Wake turbulence also known as jetwash is turbulence that forms behind an aircraft as it passes through the air This turbulence can be especially hazardous during the landing and take off phases of flight where an aircraft s proximity to the ground makes a timely recovery from turbulence induced problems unlikely Wingtip vortices make up the primary and most dangerous component of wake turbulence but normal wake effects are also an important part A method of reducing wingtip vortices employs the use of winglets ",
