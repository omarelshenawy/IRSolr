			"after": " A mathematical space exists whenever we have a set of observations and quantitative measures of their attributes For example we can represent individuals incomes or years of education within a coordinate system where the location of each individual can be specified with respect to both dimensions The distances between individuals within this space is a quantitative measure of their differences with respect to income and education However in spatial analysis we are concerned with specific types of mathematical spaces namely geographic space In geographic space the observations correspond to locations in a spatial measurement framework that captures their proximity in the real world The locations in a spatial measurement framework often represent locations on the surface of the Earth but this is not strictly necessary A spatial measurement framework can also capture proximity with respect to say interstellar space or within a biological entity such as a liver The fundamental tenet is Tobler s First Law of Geography if the interrelation between entities increases with proximity in the real world then representation in geographic space and assessment using spatial analysis techniques are appropriate ",
