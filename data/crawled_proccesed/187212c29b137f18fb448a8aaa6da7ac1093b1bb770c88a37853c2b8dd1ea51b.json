			"previous": " Offensive tactics include improving a team s position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one s zone towards the opponent s zone progressively by gaining lines first your own blue line then the red line and finally the opponent s blue line NHL rules instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two line pass legal a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line past both that blue line and the centre red line to a player on the near side of the opponents blue line Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent s goal he or she is said to shoot the puck ",
			"after": " A deflection is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal A one timer is a shot struck directly off a pass without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions Headmanning the puck also known as breaking out is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice Loafing also known as cherry picking is when a player usually a forward skates behind an attacking team instead of playing defense in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance ",
