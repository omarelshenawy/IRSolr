			"after": " The relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890 during the run of The Gondoliers when Gilbert objected to Carte s financial accounts for the production including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone 128 Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan s forthcoming grand opera and Sullivan sided with Carte going so far as to testify erroneously as to certain old debts 129 Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan and vowed to write no more for the Savoy and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end 130 Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was physically and mentally ill over this wretched business I have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds 131 ",
