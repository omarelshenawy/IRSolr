			"previous": " On 14 March 1673 Browne sent a short autobiography to the antiquarian John Aubrey presumably for Aubrey s collection of Brief Lives which provides an introduction to his life and writings ",
			"after": " Browne is widely considered one of the most original writers in the English language The freshness and ingenuity of his mind invested everything he touched with interest while on more important subjects his style if frequently rugged and pedantic often rises to the highest pitch of stately eloquence His paradoxical place in the history of ideas as equally a devout Christian a promoter of the new inductive science and adherent of ancient esoteric learning have greatly contributed to his ambiguity in the history of ideas For these reasons the literary critic Robert Sencourt succinctly assessed him as an instance of scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the Church of England 9 However the complexity of Browne s labyrinthine thought processes his ornate language along with his many allusions to Biblical Classical and contemporary learning along with esoteric authors are each contributing factors towards accounting for why he remains obscure little read and thus misunderstood ",
