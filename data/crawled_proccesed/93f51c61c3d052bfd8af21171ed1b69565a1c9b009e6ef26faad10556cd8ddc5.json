			"after": " The Comet is widely regarded jointly as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy nevertheless the aircraft s legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were perhaps some of the most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place establishing precedents in accident investigation many of the deep sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry 136 In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood at the time of the aircraft s development nor was the concept of metal fatigue While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft corrections could be only retroactively applied to the Comet 137 ",
