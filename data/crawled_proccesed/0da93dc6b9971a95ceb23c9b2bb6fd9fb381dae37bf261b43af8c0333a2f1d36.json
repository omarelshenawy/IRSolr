			"previous": " In the late 2000s RNC underwent significant restructuring as it responded to changes in the world of employment and therefore the courses that it offered its students 42 However some of the college s changes provoked criticism from staff and students who argued these were not in RNC s best interest 43 There was some controversy over the college s decision to reduce the availability of courses in piano tuning traditionally regarded as a secure profession for visually impaired people while fears were expressed that the decrease in A Level subjects would lead to RNC becoming a sport rather than an academic orientated college 29 42 Responding to these concerns in July 2008 the then principal Christine Steadman told In Touch the BBC Radio 4 news programme for visually impaired listeners It s about what the local authorities what the learning and skills council what the Welsh Assembly for government will purchase from us And at the moment we are reducing a small number of A Level courses but at the same time we re extending other courses for example we ve got level 3 Braille being taught for the first time at the college we re not cutting A Levels we re just responding to the needs of the learners that are coming through our doors 42 In an interview in January 2010 current principal Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be taught at the college if there was a demand for it and suggested RNC could look to bringing in international students to fill places 44 ",
			"after": " The changes led to significant department reorganisations within RNC with several dozen staff members being summarily dismissed without explanation some were replaced by volunteers A number of former college employees made complaints regarding the manner in which their employment was ended 42 45 In July 2008 the college lecturers union the University and College Union called for greater consultation between management and staff at the college 46 Speaking in a 2009 interview with In Touch Ian Pickford who was brought in as interim principal following Christine Steadman s departure claimed that the atmosphere of the college had changed and issued a challenge to any student or member of staff who was still unhappy to meet with him to discuss their concerns 47 ",
