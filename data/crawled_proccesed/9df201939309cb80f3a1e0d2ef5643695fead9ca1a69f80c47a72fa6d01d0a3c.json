			"after": " The above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation in which y would cause This belief can be established in one of several ways First the variable may be a non economic variable for example if rainfall amount is hypothesized to affect the futures price y of some agricultural commodity it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount provided that cloud seeding is never attempted Second the instrumental variables technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables instruments that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable Third the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable this principle is invoked for example in testing for Granger causality and in its multivariate analog vector autoregression both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables ",
