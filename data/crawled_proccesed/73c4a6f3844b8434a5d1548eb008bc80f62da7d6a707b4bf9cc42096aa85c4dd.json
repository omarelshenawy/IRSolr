			"after": " The initial plan implemented at the direction of President Franklin D Roosevelt as a promise to China and called Operation Matterhorn was to use B 29s to attack Japan from four forward bases in southern China with five main bases in India and to attack other targets in the region from China and India as needed 29 The Chengdu region was eventually chosen over the Guilin region to avoid having to raise equip and train 50 Chinese divisions to protect the advanced bases from Japanese ground attack 30 The XX Bomber Command initially intended to be two combat wings of four groups each was reduced to a single wing of four groups because of the lack of availability of aircraft automatically limiting the effectiveness of any attacks from China ",
