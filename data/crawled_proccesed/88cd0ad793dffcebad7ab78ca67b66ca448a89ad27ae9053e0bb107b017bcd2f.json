			"previous": " Troops are classified as multi male groups with a matriline as the core group 37 As with most lemurs females socially dominate males in all circumstances including feeding priority Dominance is enforced by lunging chasing cuffing grabbing and biting Young females do not always inherit their mother s rank and young males leave the troop between three and five years of age 32 37 Both sexes have separate dominance hierarchies females have a distinct hierarchy while male rank is correlated with age Each troop has one to three central high ranking adult males who interact with females more than other group males and lead the troop procession with high ranking females Recently transferred males old males or young adult males that have not yet left their natal group are often lower ranking Staying at the periphery of the group they tend to be marginalized from group activity 37 ",
			"after": " For males social structure changes can be seasonal During the six month period between December and May a few males immigrate between groups Established males transfer on average every 3 5 years 32 although young males may transfer approximately every 1 4 years Group fission occurs when groups get too large and resources become scarce 37 ",
