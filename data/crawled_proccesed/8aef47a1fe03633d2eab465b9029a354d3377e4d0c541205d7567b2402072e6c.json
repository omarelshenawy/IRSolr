			"after": " where h is Planck s constant named in honor of Max Planck and is the frequency of the photon Although modern quantum optics tells us that there also is a semi classical explanation of the photoelectric effect the emission of electrons from metallic surfaces subjected to electromagnetic radiation the photon was historically although not strictly necessarily used to explain certain observations It is found that increasing the intensity of the incident radiation so long as one remains in the linear regime increases only the number of electrons ejected and has almost no effect on the energy distribution of their ejection Only the frequency of the radiation is relevant to the energy of the ejected electrons ",
