			"previous": " The earliest example of a true short range jet is the BAe 146 produced by BAE Systems However like the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 before it the BAe 146 was tuned to a very specific market city center to city center service where low noise and excellent takeoff performance were paramount Like the Dash 7 the market niche for this design proved to be fairly small and its four engines meant it had higher maintenance costs than twin engine designs Unlike the Dash 7 example BAe did not respond by producing a twin engine design that filled the same range requirements but offering lower operational costs The BAe 146 was produced in three differently sized versions being the BAe 146 100 the BAe 146 200 and the largest example the BAe 146 300 The aircraft would later be manufactured as the Avro Regional Jet ARJ ",
			"after": " This was addressed by Bombardier s twin engine Canadair Regional Jet which became a best seller The CRJ s range is enough to fill mid range routes as well routes previously served by larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and DC 9 These aircraft were originally intended to be used for direct airport to airport flights bypassing hubs and led to industry wide discussions about the decline of the hub and spoke model Although not as economical as the turboprop by flying directly to and from smaller airports they reduced the need for low cost regional airliners And although turboprops are quiet to outside observers propwash makes them very noisy inside 1 Passengers greatly preferred jets both for real and perception reasons ",
