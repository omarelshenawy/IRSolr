			"previous": " The primary flight controls of the Tornado are a fly by wire hybrid consisting of an analogue quadruplex Command and Stability Augmentation System CSAS connected to a digital Autopilot Flight Director System AFDS 61 in addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure 62 To enhance pilot awareness artificial feel was built into the flight controls such as the centrally located stick because of the Tornado s variable wings enabling the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude 63 As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted the resulting changes to the aircraft s flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system 64 ",
			"after": " The Tornado incorporates a combined navigation attack doppler radar that simultaneously scans for targets and conducts fully automated terrain following for low level flight operations being readily able to conduct all weather hands off low level flight was considered one of the core advantages of the Tornado 65 The Tornado ADV has a different radar system to other variants designated AI 24 Foxhunter as it is designed for air defence operations it is capable of continuously keeping track of up to 20 targets at ranges of up to 160 kilometres 100 mi 45 The Tornado was one of the earliest aircraft to fitted with a digital data bus for data transmission A link 16 JTIDS integration on the F3 variant enabled the exchange of radar and other sensory information with nearby friendly aircraft 66 ",
