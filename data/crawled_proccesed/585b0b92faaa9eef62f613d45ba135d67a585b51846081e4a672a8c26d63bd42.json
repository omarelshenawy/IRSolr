			"previous": " Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November 1942 but did not capture it until January 1943 The Allied force comprised the exhausted 7th Division and the inexperienced and ill trained US 32nd Infantry Division and was short of artillery and supplies Due to a lack of supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey s insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred around infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943 114 Throughout the fighting in Papua most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered In response Australian soldiers aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents for the remainder of the war The Australians generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel and some prisoners of war were murdered 115 ",
			"after": " Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea In order to secure their important bases at Lae and Salamaua they attempted to capture Wau in January 1943 Reinforcements were flown into the town and defeated the Japanese force in its outskirts following heavy fighting The Japanese force began to withdraw towards the coast on 4 February Following their defeat at Wau the Japanese attempted to reinforce Lae in preparation for an expected Allied offensive in the area This ended in disaster when during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea a troop convoy was destroyed by USAAF and RAAF aircraft from the US Fifth Air Force and No 9 Operational Group RAAF with the loss of about 3 000 troops 116 ",
