			"previous": " The modern day Parliament of Canada came into existence in 1867 in which year the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland passed the British North America Act 1867 uniting the provinces of New Brunswick Nova Scotia and Canada with the Province of Canada split into Quebec and Ontario into a single federation called the Dominion of Canada Though the form of the new federal legislature was again nearly identical to the parliament of the United Kingdom the decision to retain this model was made with heavy influence from the just concluded American Civil War which indicated to many Canadians the faults of the American federal system with its relatively powerful states and a less powerful federal government The British North America Act limited the powers of the provinces providing that all subjects not explicitly delegated to them by that document remain within the authority of the federal parliament while simultaneously giving the provinces unique powers in certain agreed upon areas of funding ",
			"after": " Full legislative autonomy was granted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 passed by the United Kingdom and ratified by the Canadian parliament Though the statute allowed the Parliament of Canada to repeal or amend previously British laws as they applied to Canada it did not permit the abrogation of Canada s constitution including the British North America Acts Hence whenever a constitutional amendment was sought by the Canadian parliament the enactment of a British law became necessary though Canada s consent was required The Parliament of Canada was granted limited power to amend the constitution by a British Act of Parliament in 1949 but it was not permitted to affect the powers of provincial governments the official positions of the English and French languages or the maximum five year term of the legislature ",
