			"previous": " This method of economic analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how men and women differ in their consumption investment or saving behavior Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender Korkut Ert rk and Nil fer a atay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings 33 This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate in the labor force more instead of devoting their time to housework 4 ",
			"after": " This approach demonstrates the effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously 34 That fails to account for the fact that inputs are produced through caring labor which is disproportionately performed by women Stephen Knowels et al use a neoclassical growth model to show that women s education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity more robust than that of men s education 35 In both of these cases economists highlight and address the gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models outcomes ",
