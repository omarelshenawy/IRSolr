			"previous": " During this early period of change Chadderton s parliamentary representation was limited to two Members of Parliament for Lancashire Nationally the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and unemployment for textile workers 21 Nevertheless despite years of distress and unrest major disturbances of machine breaking did not occur until 1826 22 By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions coupled with the lack of suffrage in northern England had enhanced the appeal of political Radicalism in the region 21 The Manchester Patriotic Union a group agitating for parliamentary reform began to organise a mass public demonstration in Manchester to demand the reform of parliamentary representation Organised preparations took place and a spy reported that in neighbouring Thornham seven hundred men drilled as well as any army regiment would 23 A few days later on 3 August a royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling was posted in Manchester 24 On 16 August 1819 Chadderton like its neighbours sent a contingent of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration now known as the Peterloo Massacre owing to the 15 deaths and 400 700 injuries which followed 16 25 Two of the 15 deceased were from the area John Ashton of Cowhill and Thomas Buckley of Baretrees 26 ",
			"after": " New markets in Europe and South America increased the demand for Britain s cheap cotton goods Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in the United States to Manchester 27 28 From the markets in Manchester mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into yarn and cloth Supplies were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861 65 as a result of the American Civil War leading to the formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873 whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis 29 Despite a brief economic depression the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton s plentiful cheap open land used for farming since antiquity vanished under distinctive rectangular multi storey brick built factories 35 by 1891 18 Chadderton s former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a mill town around these factories and a network of newly created roads canals and railways 19 30 31 The Chadderton landscape was dominated by mill chimneys many with the mill name picked out in white brick 32 Neighbouring Oldham which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world 17 33 encroached upon Chadderton s eastern boundary urbanising the town and surrounds 34 and forming a continuous urban cotton spinning district with Royton Lees and Shaw and Crompton the Oldham parliamentary constituency which at its peak was responsible for 13 per cent of the world s cotton production 35 These Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road by Chadderton s eastern boundary with Oldham 12 30 Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926 18 and 6 000 people a quarter of Chadderton s population worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century 36 Industries ancillary to cotton spinning such as engineering coal mining bleaching and dyeing became established during this period meaning the rest of Chadderton s population were otherwise involved in the sector Philip Stott was a Chadderton born architect civil engineer and surveyor of cotton mills Stott s mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom multiplying the town s industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity 33 ",
