			"after": " By the 1850s the Press was using steam powered machine presses employing two to three hundred people and occupying several buildings in the Silver Street and Mill Lane area including the one that the Press still occupies the Pitt Building 1833 which was built specifically for the Press and in honour of William Pitt the Younger Under the stewardship of C J Clay who was University Printer from 1854 to 1882 the Press increased the size and scale of its academic and educational publishing operation An important factor in this increase was the inauguration of its list of schoolbooks including what came to be known as the Pitt Press Series During Clay s administration the Press also undertook a sizable co publishing venture with Oxford the Revised Version of the Bible which was begun in 1870 and completed in 1885 It was in this period as well that the Syndics of the Press turned down what later became the Oxford English Dictionary a proposal for which was brought to Cambridge by James Murray lexicographer before he turned to Oxford ",
