			"previous": " The gradual development of Hindu Arabic numerals independently devised the place value concept and positional notation which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing 0 This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers This approach eventually replaced all other systems In the early 6th century AD the Indian mathematician Aryabhata incorporated an existing version of this system in his work and experimented with different notations In the 7th century Brahmagupta established the use of 0 as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication division addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers except for the result of division by 0 His contemporary the Syriac bishop Severus Sebokht described the excellence of this system as valuable methods of calculation which surpass description The Arabs also learned this new method and called it hesab ",
			"after": " Although the Codex Vigilanus described an early form of Arabic numerals omitting 0 by 976 AD Fibonacci was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout Europe after the publication of his book Liber Abaci in 1202 He considered the significance of this new representation of numbers which he styled the Method of the Indians Latin Modus Indorum so fundamental that all related mathematical foundations including the results of Pythagoras and the algorism describing the methods for performing actual calculations were almost a mistake in comparison ",
