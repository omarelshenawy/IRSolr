			"previous": " Malagasy farmers continue to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration The fires sometimes burn out of control and destroy forest edges along with the natural flora increasing the damage even further than intended 15 Due to the nature of Madagascar s geology and soil tavy also depletes the fertility of the soil accelerating the crop rotation rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests 25 ",
			"after": " Although coal is the preferred cooking fuel of the Malagasy people the most affordable and prominent source of energy is timber known as kitay Wood is also used as a primary building material only adding further incentive to remove trees from the forest With the depletion of dead wood from the forest patches the people have begun to remove young healthy trees This is seen most commonly in areas closest to villages Although the shapes and sizes of forest fragments around the Daraina region have been mostly stable for 50 years prior to a study in 2002 the six years preceding the study had seen 5 of the small to medium sized forest fragments disappear due to increased human encroachment 15 ",
