			"previous": " The party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of World War I In 1918 a league called the Freien Arbeiterausschuss f r einen guten Frieden Free Workers Committee for a good Peace 27 was created in Bremen Germany On 7 March 1918 Anton Drexler an avid German nationalist formed a branch of this league in Munich called the Committee of Independent Workmen 28 Drexler was a local locksmith in Munich who had been a member of the militarist Fatherland Party 29 during World War I and was bitterly opposed to the armistice of November 1918 and the revolutionary upheavals that followed Drexler followed the typical views of militant nationalists of the day such as opposing the Treaty of Versailles having antisemitic anti monarchist and anti Marxist views as well as believing in the superiority of Germans whom nationalists claimed to be part of the Aryan master race Herrenvolk but he also accused international capitalism of being a Jewish dominated movement and denounced capitalists for war profiteering in World War I 30 Drexler saw the situation of political violence and instability in Germany as the result of the new Weimar Republic being out of touch with the masses especially the lower classes 30 Drexler emphasized the need for a synthesis of v lkisch nationalism with a form of economic socialism in order to create a popular nationalist oriented workers movement that could challenge the rise of Communism and internationalist politics 31 These were all well known themes popular with various Weimar paramilitary groups such as the Freikorps ",
			"after": " Though very small Drexler s movement did receive attention and support from some influential figures Supporter Dietrich Eckhart brought military figure Count Felix Graf von Bothmer a prominent supporter of the concept of national socialism to address the movement 32 Later in 1918 Karl Harrer a journalist and member of the Thule Society along with Drexler and several others formed the Politischer Arbeiterzirkel Political Workers Circle 27 The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and racism directed against the Jews 27 In December 1918 Drexler decided a new political party should be formed based on the political principles which he endorsed by combining his Committee of Independent Workmen with the Political Workers Circle 27 33 ",
