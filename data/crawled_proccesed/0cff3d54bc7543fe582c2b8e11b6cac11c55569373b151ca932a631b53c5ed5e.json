			"previous": " The noisy miner is a gregarious species and the birds are rarely seen singly or in twos they forage move and roost in colonies that can consist of several hundred birds 39 ",
			"after": " Within a colony a male bird will occupy an activity space which will overlap with the activity spaces of other males Males with overlapping activity spaces form associations called coteries usually consisting of 10 to 25 birds Coteries are the most stable unit within the colony The birds also form temporary flocks when engaged in the same activity These flocks called coalitions usually comprise five to eight birds although coalitions of up to 40 birds can occur when mobbing a potential predator Membership of the coalition changes frequently as individuals leave the group as it passes beyond the boundary of their activity space or the activity ends or changes as when the breeding season begins 40 Females use activity spaces that overlap with those of male birds but not other females so that females will join coalitions with males in their area but only rarely will there be more than one female in the coalition The exclusivity of female activity spaces leads to young females being driven out of the colony in which they were born but it also makes it difficult for them to gain a place in a new colony A study of banded nestlings that survived in one colony until the next breeding season found that they were all male birds suggesting that all female nestlings had died or left the colony 40 Emigration of males does not seem to occur until the population density of the colony reaches a critical level 39 ",
