			"previous": " In 1936 a team of Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French physicist Yvette Cauchois claimed to have discovered element 85 via X ray analysis In 1939 they published another paper which supported and extended previous data In 1944 Hulubei published a summary of data he had obtained up to that time claiming it was supported by the work of other researchers He chose the name dor presumably from the Romanian for longing for peace as the world had been at war for almost five years by then As Hulubei was writing in French a language which does not accommodate the ine suffix dor would likely have been rendered in English as dorine had it been adopted In 1947 Hulubei s claim was effectively rejected by the Austrian chemist Friedrich Paneth who would later chair the IUPAC committee responsible for recognition of new elements Even though Hulubei s samples did contain astatine his means to detect it were too weak by current standards to enable correct identification 86 Even though Hulubei s samples did contain astatine his means to detect it were too weak by current standards to enable correct identification He had also been involved in an earlier false claim as to the discovery of element 87 francium and this is thought to have caused other researchers to downplay his work 87 ",
			"after": " In 1940 the Swiss chemist Walter Minder announced the discovery of element 85 as the beta decay product of radium A polonium 218 choosing the name helvetium from Helvetia Switzerland Karlik and Bernert were unsuccessful in reproducing his experiments and subsequently attributed Minder s results to contamination of his radon stream radon 222 is the parent isotope of polonium 218 88 h In 1942 Minder in collaboration with the English scientist Alice Leigh Smith announced the discovery of another isotope of element 85 presumed to be the product of thorium A polonium 216 beta decay They named this substance anglo helvetium 89 but Karlik and Bernert were again unable to reproduce these results 54 ",
