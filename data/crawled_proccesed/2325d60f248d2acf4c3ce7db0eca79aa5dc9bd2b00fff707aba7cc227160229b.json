			"previous": " Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways Mesopotamia the so called cradle of civilization was situated between the major rivers Tigris and Euphrates the ancient society of the Egyptians depended entirely upon the Nile Large metropolises like Rotterdam London Montreal Paris New York City Buenos Aires Shanghai Tokyo Chicago and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade Islands with safe water ports like Singapore have flourished for the same reason In places such as North Africa and the Middle East where water is more scarce access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development ",
			"after": " Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation or by a range of other methods  Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water and is sometimes called safe water or safe for bathing Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations typically 1 part per million ppm for drinking water and 1 2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet light ",
