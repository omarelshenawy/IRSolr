			"previous": " As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism s genome changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes 107 Consequently these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development The specificity of these transcription factors interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases allowing them to read the DNA sequence Most of these base interactions are made in the major groove where the bases are most accessible 27 ",
