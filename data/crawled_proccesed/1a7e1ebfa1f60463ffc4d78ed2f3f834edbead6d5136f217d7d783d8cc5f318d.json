			"previous": " Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe for instance when Edward I of England who had himself been on Crusade built castles in Wales in the late 13th century four of the eight he founded had a concentric design 90 91 Not all the features of the Crusader castles from the 13th century were emulated in Europe For instance it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe 90 ",
			"after": " One of the effects of the Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the introduction of stone and brick fortifications Although there were hundreds of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries their design was heterogeneous however this period saw the emergence of a standard plan in the region a square plan with four wings around a central courtyard 92 It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall Arrowslits did not compromise the wall s strength but it was not until Edward I s programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe 34 ",
