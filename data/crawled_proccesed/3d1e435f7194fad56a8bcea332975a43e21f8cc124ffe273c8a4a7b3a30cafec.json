			"previous": " known as the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers  Much of analytic number theory was inspired by the prime number theorem Let x be the prime counting function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to x for any real number x For example 10 4 because there are four prime numbers 2 3 5 and 7 less than or equal to 10 The prime number theorem then states that x ln x is a good approximation to x in the sense that the limit of the quotient of the two functions x and x ln x as x approaches infinity is 1 ",
			"after": " Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet is credited with the creation of analytic number theory 3 a field in which he found several deep results and in proving them introduced some fundamental tools many of which were later named after him In 1837 he published Dirichlet s theorem on arithmetic progressions using mathematical analysis concepts to tackle an algebraic problem and thus creating the branch of analytic number theory In proving the theorem he introduced the Dirichlet characters and L functions 3 4 In 1841 he generalized his arithmetic progressions theorem from integers to the ring of Gaussian integers 5 ",
