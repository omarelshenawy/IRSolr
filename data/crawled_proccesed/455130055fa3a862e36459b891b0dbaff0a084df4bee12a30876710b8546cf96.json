			"previous": " Adrien Marie Legendre 1752 1833 was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity He also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet s theorem on arithmetic progressions He gave a full treatment of the equation 62 and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss 63 In his old age he was the first to prove Fermat s last theorem for completing work by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and crediting both him and Sophie Germain 64 ",
			"after": " In his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae 1798 Carl Friedrich Gauss 1777 1855 proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms in particular defining their composition He also introduced some basic notation congruences and devoted a section to computational matters including primality tests 65 The last section of the Disquisitiones established a link between roots of unity and number theory ",
