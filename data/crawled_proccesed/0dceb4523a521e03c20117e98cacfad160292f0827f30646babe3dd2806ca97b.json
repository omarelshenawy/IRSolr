			"after": " Dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics It is a kind of matter that accounts for gravitational effects that appear to be the result of invisible mass Dark matter cannot be seen directly with telescopes evidently it neither emits nor absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation at any significant level It is otherwise hypothesized to simply be matter that is not reactant to light 1 Instead the existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter radiation and the large scale structure of the universe According to the Planck mission team and based on the standard model of cosmology the total mass energy of the known universe contains 4 9 ordinary matter 26 8 dark matter and 68 3 dark energy Thus dark matter is estimated to constitute 84 5 of the total matter in the universe while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95 1 of the total content of the universe ",
