			"previous": " After winning the division in 2005 the Bucs suffered through an abysmal 2006 season The season was plagued by injuries with starters such as guard Dan Buenning wide receiver Michael Clayton running back Cadillac Williams defensive end Simeon Rice cornerback Brian Kelly and quarterback Chris Simms all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs such as quarterback Bruce Gradkowski tackle Jeremy Trueblood and guard Davin Joseph ",
			"after": " The Bucs started off the season 0 3 with Simms throwing only 1 touchdown to 7 interceptions In the third game of the season a last minute loss to the Panthers Simms s spleen was ruptured and he was placed on injured reserve for the balance of the season After their bye week the Bucs elected to start Gradkowski a 6th round pick from Toledo After nearly beating the Saints Gradkowski led the team to last minute wins over the Bengals and Eagles The success was short lived however and the Bucs lost five of the next six games Tim Rattay replaced Gradkowski as quarterback late in the season and the team finished 4 12 The aged defense with 5 starters who had played there for a decade or more was ranked 17th overall the first time a Tampa defense was not ranked in the top ten since 1996 ",
