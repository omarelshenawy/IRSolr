			"previous": " Since 1870 koalas have been introduced to several coastal and offshore islands including Kangaroo Island and French Island Their numbers have significantly increased 153 and since the islands are not large enough to sustain such high koala numbers overbrowsing has become a problem 154 In the 1920s Lewis initiated a program of large scale relocation and rehabilitation programs to transfer koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced to new regions with the intent of eventually returning them to their former range For example in 1930 31 165 koalas were translocated to Quail Island After a period of population growth and subsequent overbrowsing of gum trees on the island about 1300 animals were released into mainland areas in 1944 The practice of translocating koalas became commonplace Victorian State manager Peter Menkorst estimated that from 1923 to 2006 about 25 000 animals were translocated to more than 250 release sites across Victoria 155 Since the 1990s government agencies have tried to control their numbers by culling but public and international outcry has forced the use of translocation and sterilisation instead 156 ",
			"after": " One of the biggest anthropogenic threats to the koala is habitat destruction and fragmentation In coastal areas the main cause of this is urbanisation while in rural areas habitat is cleared for agriculture Native forest trees are also taken down to be made into wood products 157 In 2000 Australia ranked fifth in the world by deforestation rates having cleared 564 800 hectares 1 396 000 acres 158 The distribution of the koala has shrunk by more than 50 since European arrival largely due to fragmentation of habitat in Queensland 48 The koala s vulnerable status in Queensland and New South Wales means that developers in these states must consider the impacts on this species when making building applications 143 In addition koalas live in many protected areas 1 ",
