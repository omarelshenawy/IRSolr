			"previous": " The body plumage of Archaeopteryx is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well preserved Berlin specimen Thus as more than one species seems to be involved the research into the Berlin specimen s feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of Archaeopteryx In the Berlin specimen there are trousers of well developed feathers on the legs some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure but are somewhat decomposed they lack barbicels as in ratites 24 However in part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight 25 ",
			"after": " A patch of pennaceous feathers is found running along its back which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm although not so stiff as the flight related feathers Apart from that the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of proto down not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx being decomposed and fluffy and possibly even appeared more like fur than like feathers in life although not in their microscopic structure These occur on the remainder of the body as far as such structures are both preserved and not obliterated by preparation and the lower neck 24 ",
