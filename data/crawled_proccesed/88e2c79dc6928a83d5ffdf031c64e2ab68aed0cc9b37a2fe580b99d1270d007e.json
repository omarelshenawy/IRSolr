			"after": " On April 6 1909 Robert Peary claimed to be the first person in recorded history to reach the North Pole 8 although whether he actually reached the Pole is doubted by some 1 12 He traveled with the aid of dogsleds and three separate support crews who turned back at successive intervals before reaching the Pole Many modern explorers including Olympic skiers using modern equipment contend that Peary could not have reached the pole on foot in the time he claimed In 2005 British explorer Tom Avery with four colleagues completed a trek to the pole in 36 days 22 hours and 11 minutes using 16 husky dogs and pulling two sledges which were replicas of those used by Peary Some believe Avery s expedition has vindicated Peary showing that Peary s speeds were not so impossible after all since Avery s time was some four hours faster than Peary s claim However a close examination of Avery s speeds only casts more doubt on Peary s claim while Peary claimed to have made good an incredible 135 nautical miles 250 km 155 mi in his final five days Avery managed only 71 Indeed Avery never exceeded 90 nautical miles 170 km made good in any five day stretch Further Avery had the luxury of an airlift back to shore and so had lightly loaded sledges in his final five days while Peary was loaded down with all food and supplies needed for his return Avery was able to equal Peary s 37 day total time only because Peary spent five days encamped by a big lead making no progress at all ",
