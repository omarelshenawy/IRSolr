			"previous": " The thermal columns in the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun as the solar granulation and supergranulation The turbulent convection of this outer part of the solar interior sustains small scale dynamo action over the near surface volume of the Sun 67 The Sun s thermal columns are B nard cells and take the shape of hexagonal prisms 77 ",
			"after": " The visible surface of the Sun the photosphere is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light 78 Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space and its energy escapes the Sun entirely The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H ions which absorb visible light easily 78 Conversely the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H ions 79 80 The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick being slightly less opaque than air on Earth Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk in a phenomenon known as limb darkening 78 The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black body radiating at about 6 000 K interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere The photosphere has a particle density of 1023 m 3 about 0 37 of the particle number per volume of Earth s atmosphere at sea level The photosphere is not fully ionized the extent of ionization is about 3 leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form 81 ",
