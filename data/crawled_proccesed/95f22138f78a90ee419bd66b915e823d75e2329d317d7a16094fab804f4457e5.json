			"previous": " The first person to stand on the Moon was Neil Armstrong who was followed by Buzz Aldrin while Michael Collins orbited above Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon the last in December 1972 Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights twelve men walked on the Moon These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381 7 kilograms 842 lb of lunar samples Topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics meteoroids seismology heat flow lunar ranging magnetic fields and solar wind 41 The Moon landing marked the end of the space race and as a gesture Armstrong mentioned mankind 42 when he stepped down on the Moon ",
			"after": " Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit and landing humans on another celestial body 43 Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world notably at the Smithsonian s Air and Space Museums ",
