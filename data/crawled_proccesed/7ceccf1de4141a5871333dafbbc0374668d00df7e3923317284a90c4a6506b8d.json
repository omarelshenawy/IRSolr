			"after": " Programming of drum machines are varied by the products On most products it can be done in real time the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a drum kit were being played or using step sequencing the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them as with the TR 808 and TR 909 along a 16 step bar For example a generic 4 on the floor dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd 7th 11th and 15th steps then a kick drum on the 1st 5th 9th and 13th steps and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain fills break downs and other elements that the programmer sees fit which in turn could be sequenced with song sequence essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen The machine will quantize entries that are slightly off beat in order to make them exactly in time ",
