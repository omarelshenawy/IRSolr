			"previous": " Once he became established Gilbert was the stage director for his plays and operas and had strong opinions on how they should best be performed 40 He was strongly influenced by the innovations in stagecraft now called stage direction by the playwrights James Planch and especially Tom Robertson 27 Gilbert attended rehearsals directed by Robertson to learn this art firsthand from the older director and he began to apply it in some of his earliest plays 26 He sought realism in acting settings costumes and movement if not in content of his plays although he did write a romantic comedy in the naturalist style as a tribute to Robertson Sweethearts shunned self conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes 41 ",
			"after": " In Gilbert s 1874 burlesque Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the character Hamlet in his speech to the players sums up Gilbert s theory of comic acting I hold that there is no such antick fellow as your bombastical hero who doth so earnestly spout forth his folly as to make his hearers believe that he is unconscious of all incongruity With his work along these lines Gilbert set the ground for later playwrights such as George Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde to be able to flourish on the English stage 26 ",
