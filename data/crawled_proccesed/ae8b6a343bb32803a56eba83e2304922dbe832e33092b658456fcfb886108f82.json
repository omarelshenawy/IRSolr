			"previous": " Jones has not explained how the amount of explosive needed to do this could have been positioned in the two buildings without drawing attention but mentioned efforts to research the buildings maintenance activity in the weeks prior to the event Federal investigators at the National Institute of Standards and Technology state that enormous quantities of thermite would have to be applied to the structural columns to damage them but Jones disputed this saying that he and others were investigating superthermite 86 Brent Blanchard author of A History of Explosive Demolition in America 89 who corresponded with Jones states that questions about the viability of Jones theories remain unanswered such as the fact that no demolition personnel noticed any telltale signs of thermite during the eight months of debris removal following the towers collapse Blanchard also said that a verifiable chain of possession needs to be established for the tested beams which did not occur with the beams Jones tested raising questions of whether the metal pieces tested could have been cut away from the debris pile with acetylene torches shears or other potentially contaminated equipment while on site or exposed to trace amounts of thermite or other compounds while being handled while in storage or while being transferred from Ground Zero to memorial sites 90 ",
			"after": " Jones also said that molten steel found in the rubble was evidence of explosives as an ordinary airplane fire would not generate enough heat to produce this citing photographs of red debris being removed by construction equipment but Blanchard said that if there had been any molten steel in the rubble any excavation equipment encountering it would have been immediately damaged 86 Other sampling of the pulverized dust by United States Geological Survey and RJ Lee did not report any evidence of thermite or explosives It has been theorized the thermite material found was primer paint 91 Dave Thomas of Skeptical Inquirer magazine noting that the residue in question was claimed to be thermitic because of its iron oxide and aluminum composition pointed out that these substances are found in many items common to the towers Thomas said that in order to cut through a vertical steel beam special high temperature containment must be added to prevent the molten iron from dropping down and that the thermite reaction is too slow for it to be practically used in building demolition Thomas pointed out that when Jesse Ventura hired New Mexico Tech to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam even though it was in a horizontal and therefore optimal position 92 ",
