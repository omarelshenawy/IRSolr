			"after": " The F 16 was the first production fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable also known as relaxed static stability RSS to improve maneuverability 64 Most aircraft are designed with positive static stability which induces aircraft to return to straight and level flight attitude if the pilot releases the controls this reduces maneuverability as the inherent stability has to be overcome Aircraft with negative stability are designed to deviate from controlled flight and thus be more maneuverable At supersonic speeds the F 16 gains stability eventually positive due to aerodynamic changes 65 66 ",
