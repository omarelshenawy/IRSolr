			"after": " While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics Plutarch wrote He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life 49 Archimedes was able to use infinitesimals in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus Through proof by contradiction reductio ad absurdum he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy while specifying the limits within which the answer lay This technique is known as the method of exhaustion and he employed it to approximate the value of In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step As the number of sides increases it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle After four such steps when the polygons had 96 sides each he was able to determine that the value of lay between 31 7 approximately 3 1429 and 310 71 approximately 3 1408 consistent with its actual value of approximately 3 1416 50 He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle r2 In On the Sphere and Cylinder Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude This is the Archimedean property of real numbers 51 ",
