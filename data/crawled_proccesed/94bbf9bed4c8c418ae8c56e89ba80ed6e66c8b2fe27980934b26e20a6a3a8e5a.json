			"after": " Darwin had convinced most scientists that evolution as descent with modification was correct and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas Though few agreed with his view that natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification he was honoured in June 1909 by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in Cambridge to commemorate his centenary and the fiftieth anniversary of On the Origin of Species 153 During this period which has been called the eclipse of Darwinism scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms which eventually proved untenable The development of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s incorporating natural selection with population genetics and Mendelian genetics brought broad scientific consensus that natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution This synthesis set the frame of reference for modern debates and refinements of the theory 8 ",
