			"previous": " Symmetric key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message though a message or group of messages may have a different key than others A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely Each distinct pair of communicating parties must ideally share a different key and perhaps each ciphertext exchanged as well The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret The difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two communicating parties when a secure channel does not already exist between them also presents a chicken and egg problem which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world ",
			"after": " In a groundbreaking 1976 paper Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public key also more generally called asymmetric key cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used a public key and a private key 28 A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key the private key is computationally infeasible from the other the public key even though they are necessarily related Instead both keys are generated secretly as an interrelated pair 29 The historian David Kahn described public key cryptography as the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance 30 ",
