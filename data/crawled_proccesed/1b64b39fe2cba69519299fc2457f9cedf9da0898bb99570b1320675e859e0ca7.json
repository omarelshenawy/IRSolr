			"previous": " Banksia ericifolia depends on fire for regeneration if fires are too infrequent populations age and eventually die out 30 However too frequent fires also threaten this species which takes around six years to reach maturity and flower One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15 30 years 31 For a large part of its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia s eastern coastline Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas 32 33 The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival 30 ",
