			"previous": " Suppose that a Brownian particle of mass M is surrounded by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u Then reasons Smoluchowski in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu M This ratio is of the order of 10 7 cm s But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle others will tend to decelerate it If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 to 1000 cm s Thus even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion just as the ballot theorem predicts ",
			"after": " In 1906 Smoluchowski published a one dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion 19 The model assumes collisions with M m where M is the test particle s mass and m the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of V If NR is the number of collisions from the right and NL the number of collisions from the left then after N collisions the particle s velocity will have changed by V 2NR N The multiplicity is then simply given by ",
