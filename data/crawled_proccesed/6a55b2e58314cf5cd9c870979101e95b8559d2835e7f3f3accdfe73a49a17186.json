			"previous": " As with nearly all primates strepsirrhines typically reside in tropical rainforests These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar as many as 11 or 12 species share the same forests and prior to human arrival some forests had nearly double that diversity 141 Several species of lemur are found in drier seasonal forests including the spiny forest on the southern tip of the island although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich 142 ",
			"after": " Like all other primates strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity particularly deforestation in tropical regions Much of their habitat has been converted for human use such as agriculture and pasture 19 The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories habitat destruction hunting for bushmeat or traditional medicine and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade Although hunting is often prohibited the laws protecting them are rarely enforced In Madagascar local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species although some are still hunted for traditional medicine 143 ",
