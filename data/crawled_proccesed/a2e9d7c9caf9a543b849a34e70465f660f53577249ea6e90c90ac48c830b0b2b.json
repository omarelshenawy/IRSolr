			"previous": " Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking muscle meat creates heterocyclic amines HCAs 70 High rates of HCA can cause cancer in animals whether such an exposure causes cancer in humans remains unclear 71 Researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that human subjects having eaten beef rare or medium rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer as those having eaten beef medium well or well done While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below 212 F 100 C creates negligible amounts of HCAs Also microwaving meat before cooking may substantially reduce HCAs 71 ",
			"after": " Although microwave cooking may lead to reduced HCA levels in cooked meat products Raw Foodists do not consider it any more favorable than other forms of cooking Microwaving has been shown to cause a great decrease in all studied antioxidants in broccoli compared to other cooking methods 72 Microwaving has also been shown to reduce vitamin B12 levels in beef pork and milk by 30 40 73 Breast milk is commonly stored cold and reheated before use Using the microwave for this purpose has been shown to significantly reduce the anti infective factors in human milk 74 75 ",
