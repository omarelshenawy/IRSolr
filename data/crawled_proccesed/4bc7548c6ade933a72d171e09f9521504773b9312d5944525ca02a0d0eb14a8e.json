			"previous": " Kaleski s standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re issued as their own with local changes His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed However dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science 47 Some of these have persisted for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues The most enduring of Kaleski s myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski s writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog s mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie respectively 48 The genetics of coat colour and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog s tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses 49 The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described so its infusion is unlikely 50 It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier s instinct to bite and hold which would have been an undesirable trait 51 Early in the 1900s there was considerable in fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time While many of these arguments were misleading some irrational and the majority not supported by historical facts they continue to be circulated 44 resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed In recent years information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed 52 ",
