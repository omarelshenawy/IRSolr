			"previous": " Geologists use a number of field laboratory and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth In typical geological investigations geologists use primary information related to petrology the study of rocks stratigraphy the study of sedimentary layers and structural geology the study of positions of rock units and their deformation In many cases geologists also study modern soils rivers landscapes and glaciers investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface ",
