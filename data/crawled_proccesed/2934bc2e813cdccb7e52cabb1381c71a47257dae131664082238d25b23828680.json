			"previous": " Banksia sphaerocarpa is a variable species that differs in plant size flower size and leaf size across its range The variability is marked enough that five varieties are recognised This species is generally a shrub 0 4 2 m 1 7 ft tall Plants are smaller in northern parts of the range and grow larger in the southeast with var dolichostyla and rarely var caesia reaching 4 m 13 ft in height All varieties bear a lignotuber a swollen starchy root crown from which the plant resprouts after bushfire The new stems are finely hairy but become smooth with maturity The leaves are stiff narrow and linear and measure 2 5 10 cm 1 4 in in length on a petiole 2 3 mm 0 1 in long Leaves of most varieties are 1 1 5 mm in width and have a pointed tip 2 but var latifolia has wider leaves 2 2 5 cm 0 8 1 in and a blunter tip 3 The foliage is green or a more pale blue grey in the case of caesia and dolichostyla ",
			"after": " The inflorescences are generally globular and measure 5 to 8 cm 2 3 in in diameter 4 although larger forms such as var dolichostyla are more oval in shape Flowering from January to July the blooms are yellow orange or brownish in colour 2 They take five to eight weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering Anthesis takes place over two weeks as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence Three weeks before the flowers open the spikes develop a strong musky smell The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground 5 The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain curled around the flower spike Up to 60 follicles develop on the globular spikes The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour measuring 1 5 3 cm 0 6 1 2 in long 0 5 0 8 cm 0 2 0 3 in high and 1 2 5 cm 0 4 1 in wide The follicles are flat with pronounced shoulders giving a rectangular appearance in cross section 2 Specimens of var sphaerocarpa in the Whicher Range Jarrah Forest and the vicinity of Nannup have larger follicles 3 The seeds are wedge shaped cuneate and measure 2 0 2 6 cm 0 8 1 in in length containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring 1 1 4 cm 0 4 0 6 in long by 0 5 1 3 cm 0 2 0 5 in wide 2 ",
