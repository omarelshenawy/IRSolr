			"after": " Most studies only sample part of a population so results don t fully represent the whole population Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population Often they are expressed as 95 confidence intervals Formally a 95 confidence interval for a value is a range where if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions yielding a different dataset the interval would include the true population value in 95 of all possible cases This does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95 From the frequentist perspective such a claim does not even make sense as the true value is not a random variable Either the true value is or is not within the given interval However it is true that before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval the probability is 95 that the yet to be calculated interval will cover the true value at this point the limits of the interval are yet to be observed random variables One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by probability that is as a Bayesian probability ",
