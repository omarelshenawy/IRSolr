			"previous": " In 1948 the East German government declared Erfurt as Thuringia s new capital and Weimar lost its influence on German contemporary culture and politics The state of Thuringia itself was dissolved in 1952 and replaced by three Bezirke districts in a local government reform The city was the headquarters of the Soviet Union s 8th Guards Army as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany Due to its fame and importance for tourism Weimar received more financial subsidies from the GDR government and remained in better condition than most East German cities ",
			"after": " After German Reunification in 1990 Weimar experienced significant economic hardship but funding restored much that had deteriorated and it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996 Bauhaus and 1998 Classical Weimar The European Council of Ministers selected the city as European Capital of Culture for 1999 Tourism has become an important economic factor over the decades Weimar is now a popular residence of people working in Erfurt and Jena both less than 20 minutes away ",
