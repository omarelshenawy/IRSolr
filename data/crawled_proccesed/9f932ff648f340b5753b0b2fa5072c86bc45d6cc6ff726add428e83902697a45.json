			"after": " An impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets These jets contain significant kinetic energy which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket like shaped rotor blades as the steam jet changes direction A pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage As the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure atmospheric pressure or more usually the condenser vacuum Due to this high ratio of expansion of steam the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity The steam leaving the moving blades has a large portion of the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss ",
