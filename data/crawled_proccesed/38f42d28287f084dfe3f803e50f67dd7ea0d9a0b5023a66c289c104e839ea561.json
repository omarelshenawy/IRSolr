			"after": " Caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early ion engines designed for spacecraft propulsion on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions The ionization method was to strip the outer electron from the propellant upon contact with a tungsten electrode that had voltage applied Concerns about the corrosive action of caesium on spacecraft components have pushed development in the direction of the use of inert gas propellants such as xenon this is easier to handle in ground based tests and has less potential to interfere with the spacecraft 10 Eventually xenon was used in the experimental spacecraft Deep Space 1 launched in 1998 94 95 Nevertheless Field Emission Electric Propulsion thrusters which use a simple system of accelerating liquid metal ions such as of caesium to create thrust have been built 96 ",
