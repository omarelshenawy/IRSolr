			"previous": " The island s volcanism is associated with the rifting along the Azores Triple Junction the spread of the crust along the existing faults and fractures has produced many of the active volcanic and seismic events 22 while supported by buoyant upwelling in the deeper mantle some associate with an Azores hotspot 23 Most of the volcanic activity has centered primarily along the Terceira Rift From the beginning of the island s settlement around the 15th century there have been 28 registered volcanic eruptions 15 terrestrial and 13 submarine The last significant volcanic eruption the Capelinhos volcano Vulc o dos Capelinhos occurred off the coast of the island of Faial in 1957 the most recent volcanic activity occurred in the seamounts and submarine volcanoes off the coast of Serreta and in the Pico S o Jorge Channel 24 The islands have many examples of volcano built geomorphology including many of the caves and subterranean lava tubes such as the Gruta das Torres Algar do Carv o Gruta do Natal Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras the coastal lava fields like the coast of Feteiras Faial the Mist rio of Prainha or S o Jo o on Pico Island in addition to the currently inactive cones in central S o Miguel Island the aforementioned Capelinhos on Faial the volcanic complexes of Terceira or Plinian caldeira of Corvo Island ",
