			"previous": " In spite of this photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of artistic expression and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality artists focused on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image the very subjectivity that photography eliminated 25 The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature rather than create exact representations This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their tacit imperatives of taste and conscience 26 Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium like colour which photography then lacked The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph 25 ",
			"after": " Another major influence was Japanese ukiyo e art prints Japonism The art of these prints contributed significantly to the snapshot angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism An example is Monet s Jardin Sainte Adresse 1867 with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints 28 ",
