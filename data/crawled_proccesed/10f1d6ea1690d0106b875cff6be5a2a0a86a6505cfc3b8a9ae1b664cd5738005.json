			"previous": " Around 30 seconds into ascent the SSMEs were throttled down usually to 72 though this varied to reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces acting on the Shuttle at a point called Max Q Additionally the propellant grain design of the SRBs caused their thrust to drop by about 30 by 50 seconds into ascent Once the Orbiter s guidance verified that Max Q would be within Shuttle structural limits the main engines were throttled back up to 104 5 this throttling down and back up was called the thrust bucket To maximize performance the throttle level and timing of the thrust bucket was shaped to bring the Shuttle as close to aerodynamic limits as possible 74 ",
			"after": " At around T 126 seconds pyrotechnic fasteners released the SRBs and small separation rockets pushed them laterally away from the vehicle The SRBs parachuted back to the ocean to be reused The Shuttle then began accelerating to orbit on the main engines Acceleration at this point would typically fall to 9 g and the vehicle would take on a somewhat nose up angle to the horizon it used the main engines to gain and then maintain altitude while it accelerated horizontally towards orbit At about five and three quarter minutes into ascent the orbiter s direct communication links with the ground began to fade at which point it rolled heads up to reroute its communication links to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite system ",
