			"after": " The Alpine chough is socially monogamous showing high partner fidelity in summer and winter and from year to year 28 Nesting typically starts in early May and is non colonial although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity 4 The bulky nests are composed of roots sticks and plant stems lined with grass fine twiglets or hair and may be constructed on ledges in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face or in an abandoned building The clutch is 3 5 glossy whitish eggs averaging 33 9 by 24 9 millimetres 1 33 in 0 98 in in size 29 which are tinged with buff cream or light green and marked with small brown blotches 4 they are incubated by the female for 14 21 days before hatching 13 The chicks hatch with a dense covering of natal down in contrast to those of the red billed chough which are almost naked 30 and fledge in a further 29 31 days from hatching 13 The young birds are fed by both parents and may also be fed by other adults when they have fledged and joined the flock 4 Breeding is possible in the high mountains because chough eggs have relatively fewer pores than those of lowland species and lose less water by evaporation at low atmospheric pressure 31 The embryos of bird species that breed at high altitude also have haemoglobin with a genetically determined high affinity for oxygen 32 ",
