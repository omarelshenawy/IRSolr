			"previous": " Normally the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured is the low water line along the coast as marked on large scale charts officially recognized by the coastal state This is either the low water mark closest to the shore or alternatively it may be an unlimited distance from permanently exposed land provided that some portion of elevations exposed at low tide but covered at high tide like mud flats is within 12 nautical miles 22 km 14 mi of permanently exposed land Straight baselines can alternatively be defined connecting fringing islands along a coast across the mouths of rivers or with certain restrictions across the mouths of bays In this case a bay is defined as a well marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast An indentation shall not however be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as or larger than that of the semi circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation The baseline across the bay must also be no more than 24 nautical miles 44 km 28 mi in length ",
			"after": " Waters landward of the baseline are defined as internal waters over which the state has complete sovereignty not even innocent passage is allowed Lakes and rivers are considered internal waters All archipelagic waters within the outermost islands of an archipelagic state such as Indonesia or the Philippines are also considered internal waters and are treated the same with the exception that innocent passage through them must be allowed However archipelagic states may designate certain sea lanes through these waters ",
