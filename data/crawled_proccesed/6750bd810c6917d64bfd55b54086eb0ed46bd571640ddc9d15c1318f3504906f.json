			"previous": " To perform gas metal arc welding the basic necessary equipment is a welding gun a wire feed unit a welding power supply a welding electrode wire and a shielding gas supply 10 ",
			"after": " The typical GMAW welding gun has a number of key parts a control switch a contact tip a power cable a gas nozzle an electrode conduit and liner and a gas hose The control switch or trigger when pressed by the operator initiates the wire feed electric power and the shielding gas flow causing an electric arc to be struck The contact tip normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area It must be firmly secured and properly sized since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact On the way to the contact tip the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle Sometimes a water hose is also built into the welding gun cooling the gun in high heat operations 11 ",
