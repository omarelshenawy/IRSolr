			"after": " A characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity is 80 m s However this quantity varies significantly across space and time particularly within the seasonal cycle spanning a range of 0 100 m s 32 This variability is primarily due to variabliity in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere which are controlled by the large scale dynamics of the tropical climate These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature and underlying ocean dynamics background near surface wind speed and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating 35 The nature of this modulation is complex particularly on climate time scales decades or longer On shorter time scales variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water 36 However this relationship is indirect via the large scale dynamics of the tropics the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on is weak in comparison ",
