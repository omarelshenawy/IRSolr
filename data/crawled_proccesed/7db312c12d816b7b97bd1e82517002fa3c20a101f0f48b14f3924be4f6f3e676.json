			"after": " Madonna in the Church or The Virgin in the Church is a small oil panel by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck Probably executed between c 1438 40 it shows the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel studded crown cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips the hem of her dress in a manner that recalls the 13th century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon Virgin of Tenderness Tracery in the arch at the rear of the nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary s life while a faux sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life 1 In a doorway to the right two angels sing psalms from a hymn book Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary unrealistically large compared to her surroundings The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral s windows It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor The light has symbolic significance alluding simultaneously to Mary s virginal purity and God s ethereal presence 2 ",
