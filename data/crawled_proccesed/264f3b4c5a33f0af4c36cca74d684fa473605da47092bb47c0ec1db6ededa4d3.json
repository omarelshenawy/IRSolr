			"after": " Tree frogs are found high in the canopy where they scramble around on the branches twigs and leaves sometimes never coming down to earth The true tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit a case of convergent evolution These include the glass frogs Centrolenidae the bush frogs Hyperoliidae some of the narrow mouthed frogs Microhylidae and the shrub frogs Rhacophoridae 89 Most tree frogs are under 10 cm 4 in in length with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat topped hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus These toe pads moistened by the mucus provide the grip on any wet or dry surface including glass The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also surface tension and viscosity 102 Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed 103 Some members of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet The reticulated leaf frog Phyllomedusa ayeaye has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat 104 ",
