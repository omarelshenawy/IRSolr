			"previous": " By the Late Middle Ages Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland Power in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms Hiberno Norman lords and the English dominated Lordship of Ireland A similar situation existed in the Principality of Wales which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws During the course of the 15th century the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France thereby also releasing the King of England as from being vassal of the King of France In 1534 King Henry VIII at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope His response was to place the King of England as the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church Ireland which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared a separate kingdom in personal union with England ",
			"after": " Scotland meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom In 1603 that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England and consequently the Crown of Ireland also The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval religious division and war English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament A prime issue was inter alia over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England Ireland largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king Following defeat to the parliaments army large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English Hiberno Norman and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland The new ruling class was Protestant and British whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come When the monarchy was restored in England the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land owners in Ireland The Glorious Revolution of 1688 repeated similar themes a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England The king s army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland Resistance held out and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick However in the evolving political climate the terms of Limerick were superseded a new monarchy was installed and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics ",
