			"after": " The crop factor is relative to the 35mm film format If a smaller sensor is used as in most digicams the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the 35mm full frame format s field of view This narrowing of the field of view may be described as crop factor a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a 35mm film camera Full frame digital SLRs utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of 35mm film ",
