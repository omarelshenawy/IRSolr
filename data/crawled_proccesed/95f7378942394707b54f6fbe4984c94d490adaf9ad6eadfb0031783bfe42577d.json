			"previous": " Film noir has been parodied many times in many manners In 1945 Danny Kaye starred in what appears to be the first intentional film noir parody Wonder Man 139 That same year Deanna Durbin was the singing lead in the comedic noir Lady on a Train which makes fun of Woolrich brand wistful miserablism Bob Hope inaugurated the private eye noir parody with My Favorite Brunette 1947 playing a baby photographer who is mistaken for an ironfisted detective 139 In 1947 as well The Bowery Boys appeared in Hard Boiled Mahoney which had a similar mistaken identity plot they spoofed the genre once more in Private Eyes 1953 Two RKO productions starring Robert Mitchum take film noir over the border into self parody The Big Steal 1949 directed by Don Siegel and His Kind of Woman 1951 b The Girl Hunt ballet in Vincente Minnelli s The Band Wagon 1953 is a ten minute distillation of and play on noir in dance 140 The Cheap Detective 1978 starring Peter Falk is a broad spoof of several films including the Bogart classics The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca Carl Reiner s black and white Dead Men Don t Wear Plaid 1982 appropriates clips of classic noirs for a farcical pastiche while his Fatal Instinct 1993 sends up noirs both classic Double Indemnity and neo Basic Instinct Robert Zemeckis s Who Framed Roger Rabbit 1988 develops a noir plot set in 1940s L A around a host of cartoon characters ",
