			"after": " The common toad reaches maturity at three to seven years old but there is great variability between populations 15 Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds Even when they have heavy worm burdens large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens 33 After several months of heavy worm infection some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles Their parasite induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died 34 Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths It was found that at certain concentrations which were well above any normally found in the field growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated but at others there was no significant difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls Nevertheless certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals 35 ",
