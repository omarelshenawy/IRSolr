			"after": " Rightwise s new market cross only survived in its original form for a short time During the English Reformation of the 1530s the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls In 1549 a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 of the participants in Kett s Rebellion who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich 20 In 1574 a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5 00 am along with the tools of their trade and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury The success of this scheme is not recorded 19 ",
