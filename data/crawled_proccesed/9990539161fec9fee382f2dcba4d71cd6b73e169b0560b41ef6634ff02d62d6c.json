			"previous": " Another version of formalism is often known as deductivism In deductivism the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth but a relative one if you assign meaning to the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true i e true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth preserving then you have to accept the theorem or rather the interpretation you have given it must be a true statement The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements Thus formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold Compare this position to structuralism But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist Many formalists would say that in practice the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics ",
			"after": " A major early proponent of formalism was David Hilbert whose program was intended to be a complete and consistent axiomatization of all of mathematics Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the finitary arithmetic a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial was consistent Hilbert s goals of creating a system of mathematics that is both complete and consistent were dealt a fatal blow by the second of G del s incompleteness theorems which states that sufficiently expressive consistent axiom systems can never prove their own consistency Since any such axiom system would contain the finitary arithmetic as a subsystem G del s theorem implied that it would be impossible to prove the system s consistency relative to that since it would then prove its own consistency which G del had shown was impossible Thus in order to show that any axiomatic system of mathematics is in fact consistent one needs to first assume the consistency of a system of mathematics that is in a sense stronger than the system to be proven consistent ",
