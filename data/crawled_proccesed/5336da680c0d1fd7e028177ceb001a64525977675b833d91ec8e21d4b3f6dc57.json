			"previous": " The origin of the Statue of Liberty project is sometimes traced to a comment made by French law professor and politician douard Ren de Laboulaye in mid 1865 In after dinner conversation at his home near Versailles Laboulaye an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War is supposed to have said If a monument should rise in the United States as a memorial to their independence I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort a common work of both our nations 7 The National Park Service in a 2000 report however deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870 8 In another essay on their website the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences With the abolition of slavery and the Union s victory in the Civil War in 1865 Laboulaye s wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States In order to honor these achievements Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy 9 ",
			"after": " According to sculptor Fr d ric Auguste Bartholdi who later recounted the story Laboulaye s comment was not intended as a proposal but it inspired Bartholdi 7 Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects in the late 1860s he approached Isma il Pasha Khedive of Egypt with a plan to build a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant robed and holding a torch aloft at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said Sketches and models were made of the proposed work though it was never erected There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal the Colossus of Rhodes an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun Helios This statue is believed to have been over 100 feet 30 m high and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships 10 ",
