			"after": " Debate has been going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only as posited by Gilmore in 1914 24 or used as a weapon Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more flexible than that of other dinosaurs as it lacked ossified tendons thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon However as Carpenter 7 has noted the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae movement would be limited Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack 26 More recently a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al 49 which showed a high incidence of trauma related damage lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat This study showed that 9 8 of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fit perfectly 50 ",
