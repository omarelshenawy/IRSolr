			"after": " In common with most of the Orkney isles Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone which is approximately 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks uplifted by the formation of Pangaea eroded and then deposited into river deltas The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth 24 The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone group from the Lower Middle Devonian with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former 3 At Haco s Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal diabase The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations 10 25 26 ",
