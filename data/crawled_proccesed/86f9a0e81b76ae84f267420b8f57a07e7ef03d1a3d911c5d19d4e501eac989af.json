			"previous": " When attacked the common toad adopts a characteristic stance inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered Its chief means of defence lies in the foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it 15 Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs rats and mink and even domestic cats 22 Birds that feed on toads include herons crows and birds of prey Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal s liver thus avoiding the toxin 22 The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae diving beetles and water boatmen These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole s skin and sucking out its juices 22 ",
			"after": " A parasitic fly Lucilia bufonivora attacks adult common toads It lays its eggs on the toad s skin and when these hatch the larvae crawl into the toad s nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences 25 The European fingernail clam Sphaerium corneum is unusual in that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this is believed to be one of the means by which it disperses to new locations 26 ",
