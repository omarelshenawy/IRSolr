			"previous": " Gaelic fonts were first used for the Irish language in 1571 and were used regularly for Irish until the early 1960s though they continue to be used in display type and type for signage Their use was effectively confined to Ireland though Gaelic typefaces were designed and produced in France Belgium and Italy Gaelic typefaces make use of insular letterforms and early fonts made use of a variety of abbreviations deriving from the manuscript tradition Early fonts used for the Anglo Saxon language also using insular letterforms can be classified as Gaelic typefaces distinct from Roman or Antiqua typefaces 20 21 Various forms exist including manuscript traditional and modern styles chiefly distinguished as having angular or uncial features 22 ",
			"after": " Monospaced fonts are typefaces in which every glyph is the same width as opposed to variable width fonts where the w and m are wider than most letters and the i is narrower The first monospaced typefaces were designed for typewriters which could only move the same distance forward with each letter typed Their use continued with early computers which could only display a single font Although modern computers can display any desired typeface monospaced fonts are still important for computer programming terminal emulation and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents Examples of monospaced typefaces are Courier Prestige Elite Fixedsys and Monaco Most monospaced fonts are sans serif or slab serif as these designs are easiest to read printed small though many exceptions exist ",
