			"after": " In the early 19th century medievalism Romanticism and the Gothic Revival reawakened interest in Arthur and the medieval romances A new code of ethics for 19th century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals that the Arthur of romance embodied This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816 when Malory s Le Morte d Arthur was reprinted for the first time since 1634 100 Initially the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets inspiring for example William Wordsworth to write The Egyptian Maid 1835 an allegory of the Holy Grail 101 Pre eminent among these was Alfred Lord Tennyson whose first Arthurian poem The Lady of Shalott was published in 1832 102 Although Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works following in the medieval romance tradition Tennyson s Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with Idylls of the King which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur s life for the Victorian era First published in 1859 it sold 10 000 copies within the first week 103 In the Idylls Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood whose attempt to establish a perfect kingdom on earth fails finally through human weakness 104 Tennyson s works prompted a large number of imitators generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself and brought Malory s tales to a wider audience 105 Indeed the first modernisation of Malory s great compilation of Arthur s tales was published shortly after Idylls appeared in 1862 and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended 106 ",
