			"previous": " In her third chapter Greenwood examines her experiences among London s ceremonial magicians focusing on her training in the Hermetic Qabalah a magical language for exploring the otherworld Adopting Luhrmann s concept of interpretative drift she relates how she shifted her understanding of events to make sense of her magical experiences However in contrast to Luhrmann s emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn the language of another mode of reality through their experiences 11 Chapter four details Greenwood s early involvement in Wicca through three separate covens Offering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations she then discusses the faith s approach to sexual polarity pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the Great Rite and the Gnostic Mass as evidence The chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic 12 ",
			"after": " Chapter five examines the attraction of magic for its practitioners and its uses for psychotherapy and healing Greenwood explores the ways in which occultists use magic as a rebellion against Christianity and their construction of a magical identity believing this to be organized around a deep internal exploration of the self through an interaction with the otherworld She also looks at magic and the acquisition of power and the sense of empowerment discovered by magicians who were former abuse victims 13 The sixth chapter focuses on notions of gender and sexuality highlighting the widespread belief that sexual energy provides the power behind magic and discussing the contrasting views of Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley on this issue the former emphasised harmony and balance between masculine and feminine magical forces while the latter advocated magical anarchy or spiritual autonomy for each individual irrespective of gender Greenwood looks at contrasting views on these issues in High Magic ceremonial magic Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft Drawing upon the typologies advocated by sociologist of religion Susan J Palmer she argues that High Magic emphasises sex polarity a situation in which men and women are seen as unequal and different whereas Wicca holds to a position of sex complementarity in which men and women are seen as different yet equal and Feminist Witchcraft advocates sex unity in which there is a tolerance of sexual ambiguity 14 ",
