			"after": " DNA can be damaged by many sorts of mutagens which change the DNA sequence Mutagens include oxidizing agents alkylating agents and also high energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X rays The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen For example UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers which are cross links between pyrimidine bases 73 On the other hand oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage including base modifications particularly of guanosine and double strand breaks 74 A typical human cell contains about 150 000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage 75 Of these oxidative lesions the most dangerous are double strand breaks as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations insertions and deletions from the DNA sequence as well as chromosomal translocations 76 These mutations can cause cancer Because of inherent limitations in the DNA repair mechanisms if humans lived long enough they would all eventually develop cancer 77 78 DNA damages that are naturally occurring due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species the hydrolytic activities of cellular water etc also occur frequently Although most of these damages are repaired in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging 79 80 81 ",
