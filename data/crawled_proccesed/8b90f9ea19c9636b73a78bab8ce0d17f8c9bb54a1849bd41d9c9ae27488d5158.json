			"previous": " Even if a signal is human communications e g a radio the intelligence collection specialists have to know it exists If the targeting function described above learns that a country has a radar that operates in a certain frequency range the first step is to use a sensitive receiver with one or more antennas that listen in every direction to find an area where such a radar is operating Once the radar is known to be in the area the next step is to find its location ",
			"after": " If operators know the probable frequencies of transmissions of interest they may use a set of receivers preset to the frequencies of interest These are the frequency horizontal axis versus power vertical axis produced at the transmitter before any filtering of signals that do not add to the information being transmitted Received energy on a particular frequency may start a recorder and alert a human to listen to the signals if they are intelligible i e COMINT If the frequency is not known the operators may look for power on primary or sideband frequencies using a spectrum analyzer Information from the spectrum analyzer is then used to tune receivers to signals of interest For example in this simplified spectrum the actual information is at 800 kHz and 1 2 MHz ",
