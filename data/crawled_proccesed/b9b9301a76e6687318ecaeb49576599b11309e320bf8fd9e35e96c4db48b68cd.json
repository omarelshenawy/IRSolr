			"after": " There are various forms of valley associated with glaciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys  A valley carved by glaciers is normally U shaped The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it When the ice recedes or thaws the valley remains often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice Floor gradient does not affect the valley s shape it is the glacier s size that does Continuously flowing glaciers especially in the ice age and large sized glaciers carve wide deep incised valleys ",
