			"previous": " By 900 AD in Europe developments in iron smelting allowed for increased production leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs hand tools and horse shoes The plough was significantly improved developing into the mouldboard plough capable of turning over the heavy wet soils of northern Europe This led to the clearing of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production which in turn led to an increase in population 32 A similar plough which may have developed independently was also found in China as early as the 9th century 33 At the same time farmers in Europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition as the change in rotations led to different crops being planted including legumes such as peas lentils and beans Inventions such as improved horse harnesses and the whippletree also changed methods of cultivation 32 Watermills were initially developed by the Romans but were improved throughout the Middle Ages along with windmills and used to grind grains into flour cut wood and process flax and wool among other uses 34 ",
			"after": " Crops included wheat rye barley and oats Peas beans and vetches became common from the 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals and also for their nitrogen fixation fertilizing properties Crop yields peaked in the 13th century and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century 35 Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages recent studies 36 37 have shown that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times such as the terrible weather of 1315 17 that the needs of the population could not be met 38 The Medieval Warm Period between 900 1300 AD brought generally warmer global temperatures leading to increased harvests throughout Europe and a greater northern range for subtropical crops such as figs and olives Greenland and Iceland were settled by Europeans during this period and supported agricultural activities The long term warming period is generally thought to have occurred mainly in Europe but other areas of the world experienced shorter warming periods at different times during this period including China in the 11th and 12th centuries with similar effects on agriculture The climate variations found in Europe during the Medieval Warm Period returned to more moderate levels in the 15th century and terminated in the Little Ice Age of the 16th mid 19th centuries 39 ",
