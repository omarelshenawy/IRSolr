			"previous": " At Kaufmann s request Denver artist Allen Tupper True 74 was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam True s design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region 76 Although some initially were opposed to these designs True was given the go ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist 77 With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings textiles baskets and ceramics 78 The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain lightning water clouds and local animals lizards serpents birds and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas 76 In these works which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam True also reflected on the machinery of the operation making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern 79 ",
			"after": " With the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers True also devised an innovative color coding for the pipes and machinery which was implemented throughout all BOR projects 80 True s consulting artist job lasted through 1942 it was extended so he could complete design work for the Parker Shasta and Grand Coulee dams and power plants True s work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in The New Yorker part of which read lose the spark and justify the dream but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme 81 ",
