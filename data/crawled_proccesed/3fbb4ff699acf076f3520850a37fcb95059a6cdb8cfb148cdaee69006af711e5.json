			"previous": " The International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN lists more than a third of primates as critically endangered or vulnerable Trade is regulated as all species are listed by CITES in Appendix II except 50 species and subspecies listed in Appendix I which gain full protection from trade 166 167 Common threats to primate species include deforestation forest fragmentation monkey drives resulting from primate crop raiding 168 and primate hunting for use in medicines as pets and for food Large scale tropical forest clearing is widely regarded as the process that most threatens primates 169 170 171 More than 90 of primate species occur in tropical forests 170 172 The main cause of forest loss is clearing for agriculture although commercial logging subsistence harvesting of timber mining and dam construction also contribute to tropical forest destruction 172 In Indonesia large areas of lowland forest have been cleared to increase palm oil production and one analysis of satellite imagery concluded that during 1998 and 1999 there was a loss of 1 000 Sumatran orangutans per year in the Leuser Ecosystem alone 173 ",
			"after": " Primates with a large body size over 5 kg are at increased extinction risk due to their greater profitability to poachers compared to smaller primates 172 They reach sexual maturity later and have a longer period between births Populations therefore recover more slowly after being depleted by poaching or the pet trade 174 Data for some African cities show that half of all protein consumed in urban areas comes from the bushmeat trade 175 Endangered primates such as guenons and the drill are hunted at levels that far exceed sustainable levels 175 This is due to their large body size ease of transport and profitability per animal 175 As farming encroaches on forest habitats primates feed on the crops causing the farmers large economic losses 176 Primate crop raiding gives locals a negative impression of primates hindering conservation efforts 177 ",
