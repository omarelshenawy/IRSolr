			"previous": " Fuller Maitland s followers including Ernest Walker also dismissed Sullivan as merely the idle singer of an empty evening 278 As late as 1966 Frank Howes music critic of The Times condemned Sullivan for a lack of sustained effort a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art and inability to perceive the smugness the sentimentality and banality of the Mendelssohnian detritus to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms this yielding to a fatal facility that excludes Sullivan from the ranks of the good composers 279 ",
			"after": " Thomas F Dunhill wrote a in 1928 that Sullivan s music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles These attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius 280 Sir Henry Wood continued to perform Sullivan s serious music 281 In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the Royal Albert Hall 29 but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan s music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely revived and reassessed In 1960 Hughes published the first full length book about Sullivan s music which while taking note of his weaknesses which are many and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste which were comparatively rare attempted to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship 278 The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society founded in 1977 books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young 1971 and Jacobs 1986 and a growing number of recordings have contributed to the re evaluation of Sullivan s serious music 276 ",
