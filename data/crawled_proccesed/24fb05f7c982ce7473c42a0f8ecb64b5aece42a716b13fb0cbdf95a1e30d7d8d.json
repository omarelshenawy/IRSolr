			"previous": " By virtue of geography the Royal Navy was able to use her imposing battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept Germany s smaller battleship fleet bottled up in the North Sea only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces 38 Both sides were aware that because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline where friendly minefields torpedo boats and submarines could be used to even the odds 39 Germany s submarines were able to break out and raid commerce but even though they sank many merchant ships they could not successfully blockade Great Britain in contrast to Britain s successful battleship blockade of Germany which was a major cause of Germany s economic collapse in 1918 The Royal Navy on the other hand successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany s submarine blockade and eventually defeated it 37 ",
			"after": " The first two years of war saw the Royal Navy s battleships and battlecruisers regularly sweep the North Sea making sure that no German ships could get in or out Only a few German surface ships that were already at sea such as the famous light cruiser Emden were able to raid commerce Even some of those that did manage to get out were hunted down by battlecruisers as in the Battle of the Falklands December 7 1914 The results of sweeping actions in the North Sea were battles such as the Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank and German raids on the English coast all of which were attempts by the Germans to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet in an attempt to defeat the Royal Navy in detail On May 31 1916 a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the Battle of Jutland 40 The German fleet withdrew to port after two short encounters with the British fleet Less than two months later the Germans once again attempted to draw portions of the Grand Fleet into battle The resulting Action of 19 August 1916 proved inconclusive This reinforced German determination not to engage in a fleet to fleet battle 41 ",
