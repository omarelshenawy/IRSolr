			"after": " The base of a reciprocating internal combustion engine is the engine block which is typically made of cast iron or aluminium The engine block contains the cylinders In engines with more than one cylinder they are usually arranged either in 1 row straight engine or 2 rows boxer engine or V engine 3 rows are occasionally used W engine in contemporary engines and other engine configurations are possible and have been used Single cylinder engines are common for motorcycles and in small engines of machinery Water cooled engines contain passages in the engine block where cooling fluid circulate the water jacket Some small engines are air cooled and instead of having a water jacket the cylinder block has fins protruding away from it to cool by directly transferring heat to the air The cylinder walls are usually finished by honing to obtain a cross hatch which is better able to retain the oil A too rough surface would quickly harm the engine by excessive wear on the piston ",
