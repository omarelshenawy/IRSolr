			"after": " Chinatown is an area to the south of Piccadilly Gardens with many oriental restaurants and other facilities of a far eastern character It is the second largest Chinatown in the United Kingdom and the third largest in Europe 46 The first settlers to arrive in the city came in the early 20th century according to the BBC Many arrived alone and were engaged in what was seen as the traditional trade of laundries 47 Manchester s first Chinese restaurant Ping Hong opened on Mosley Street in 1948 47 on the eve of a Chinese immigration wave that would commence during the 1950s 48 Manchester did not have a significant Chinese population reaching only about 2 000 49 However after World War II there were severe labour shortages and in response the government passed the British Nationality Act 1948 which allowed easier access into the country 49 Additionally Hong Kong s rapid urbanisation meant that many farmers and traditional residents homes were being destroyed by the urban sprawl so many decided to migrate 48 49 The area s beginnings are rooted in the restaurant business as many Chinese restaurants surfaced soon after the immigration boom By the 1970s other Chinese businesses began to emerge such as medicine shops Chinese supermarkets as well as financial and legal services all serving the employees of the expanding number of Chinese restaurants in the area 48 49 The area has retained a far eastern character ever since and in 1987 a paifang archway was installed to as a gift to the Chinese community and to reflect the far eastern heritage of the area ",
