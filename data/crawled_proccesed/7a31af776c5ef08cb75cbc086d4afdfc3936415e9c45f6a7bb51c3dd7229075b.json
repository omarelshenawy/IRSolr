			"previous": " Volubilis remained the capital of the region well into the Islamic period Islamic coins dating to the 8th century have been found on the site attesting to the arrival of Islam in this part of Morocco 10 They are concentrated outside the city walls which suggests that Arab settlement remained distinct from the Berber settlement inside them It was here that Moulay Idriss established the Idrisid dynasty of Morocco in 787 8 A direct descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad he escaped to Morocco from Syria following the Battle of Fakhkh in 787 He was proclaimed imam in Volubilis occupied by the Awraba under Ishaq ibn Mohammad He married Kanza from the Awraba and fathered a son Idris II who was proclaimed imam in Volubilis He too lived outside the walls of the city along the banks of the Wadi Khoumane where a complex has recently been excavated that may be identified with his headquarters 15 Idriss I conquered most of Northern Morocco during the three years of his reign founding the city of Fes He was assassinated in Volubilis in 791 on the orders of the caliph of Baghdad Harun al Rashid 16 10 On his majority Idriss II removed to Fes which served as his new capital depriving Volubilis of its last vestiges of political significance 16 ",
