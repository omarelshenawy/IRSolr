			"previous": " Early Anglo Saxon art as it survives is seen mostly in decorated jewellery like brooches buckles beads and wrist clasps some of outstanding quality Characteristic of the 5th century is the quoit brooch with motifs based on crouching animals as seen on the silver quoit brooch from Sarre Kent While the origins of this style are disputed it is either an offshoot of provincial Roman art Frank or Jute art One style flourished from the late 5th century and continued throughout the 6th and is on many square headed brooches it is characterised by chip carved patterns based on animals and masks A different style which gradually superseded it is dominated by serpentine beasts with interlacing bodies 170 ",
			"after": " By the later 6th century the best works from the south east are distinguished by greater use of expensive materials above all gold and garnets reflecting the growing prosperity of a more organised society which had greater access to imported precious materials as seen in the buckle from the Taplow burial and the jewellery from that at Sutton Hoo 171 c 600 and c 625 respectively The possible symbolism of the decorative elements like interlace and beast forms that were used in these early works remains unclear it is clear These objects were the products of a society that invested its modest surpluses in personal display who fostered craftsmen and jewellers of a high standard and a society where the possession of a fine brooch or buckle was a valuable status symbol and possible tribal emblem in death as much as in life 172 ",
