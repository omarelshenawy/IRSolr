			"after": " The long tailed ground roller s silhouette is highly distinctive due to its long tail and plump silhouette 12 The bird is 34 to 47 centimeters 13 to 19 in long although its tail can contribute up to 30 centimeters 12 in of the length which makes it the longest tail of any of the ground rollers 11 12 This ground roller has short wings and long pinkish brown legs 13 The male has a sandy buff crown and dark brown upperparts with black streaks 11 Its supercilium is a pale buff color while the ear coverts are brown 11 The eyes are brown while the short and stout beak is black 1 11 Its tongue is long with a brush like tip to help it collect insects 4 A white stripe is present at the base of the bill and is surrounded by brown and black malar stripes These malar stripes and the black breastband frame a white throat 11 The tail has 15 to 20 dark brown bars marking it while the outer rectrices are sky blue this sky blue is also present on the wing coverts 11 In flight the bird s two black and white bands on the primaries and secondaries are conspicuous 11 The underparts are a light gray and the breast white 11 The toes are zygodactylous with the first and fourth toes turned outwards and the middle two toes turned inwards 13 The female resembles the male but is smaller and has a narrower chestband and a shorter tail 11 14 Also the female loses her tail while nesting 13 These differences make the long tailed ground roller the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism 4 Juveniles of both sexes resemble the adult female but have duller plumage particularly in the black bands on the chest neck and eyes 12 ",
