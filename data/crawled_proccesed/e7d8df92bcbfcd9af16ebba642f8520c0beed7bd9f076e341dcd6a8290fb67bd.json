			"previous": " Their main characteristics developed largely independently of standard Swedish for almost a millennium until 1850 when standard Swedish was introduced to all citizens through the public school system At first they co existed peacefully but during the 1930s the repression of genuine dialects and non North Germanic languages was at its peak and children were prohibited from using their native tongue in school and it was labelled as an ugly and inappropriate way of speaking Standard Swedish is based on the dialects spoken in Svealand and G taland and therefore differed considerably from the Westrobothnian tongues even more than the differences between standard Swedish and the neighbouring languages Norwegian and Danish The cities soon became majority Swedish speaking while the native tongues still maintained a strong stance in rural areas and minor towns for many decades to come The native tongues were gradually weakened as an urbanization process went on and TV and radio broadcasts were exclusively in standard Swedish making the native tongues appear backward The misleading nickname bondska has played a big part in making the native tongues less attractive since it is derived from the Swedish word for peasant it is widely used and causes a lot of misconceptions The name was most likely not invented by the native speakers and should be considered pejorative according to whom since the word bonde or bonnigt is either used pejoratively for denoting something uncultivated or to refer to the occupation of farming But the name was implemented and eventually turned into a self fulfilling prophecy as the city population gradually switched to Swedish and people from the villages were highly discouraged about using their native tongues when moving to the city The correct term in Swedish is V sterbottniska although it is rarely used the notion of a Westrobothnian dialect group that includes Pite Lule and Kalix dialects is unknown to most people but the pejorative name remains in use in the entire region to denote the regional dialect During a large part of the 20th century many citizens did not speak their native tongues in the cities because it was looked down upon but once back in their villages they switched to their native tongue ",
