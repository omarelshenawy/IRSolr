			"previous": " The Keep is 12 metres 39 ft in diameter with a square spurred base in the 13th century there would have been an adjacent turret on the south west side containing latrines but few traces remain 81 There is no evidence that the tower that Burges termed a keep would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower 81 The Kitchen Tower is also 12 metres 39 ft across and rests on a square spurred base 82 It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen Burgess raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys 82 The walls of these two towers are around 3 0 metres 10 ft thick at the base thinning to 0 61 metres 2 ft at the top 80 The Well Tower at 11 5 metres 38 ft in diameter is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground 83 The Well Tower lacks the spurs of the other two towers and has a flat rather than curved back facing onto the courtyard similar to some of the towers built at Caerphilly by the de Clares 84 ",
			"after": " The towers contribute to what the architectural writer Charles Handley Read considered the castle s sculptural and dramatic exterior 85 Almost equal in diameter but of differing conical roof designs and heights and topped with copper gilt weather vanes they combine to produce a romantic appearance 3 78 86 which Matthew Williams described as bringing a Wagnerian flavor to the Taff Valley 87 ",
