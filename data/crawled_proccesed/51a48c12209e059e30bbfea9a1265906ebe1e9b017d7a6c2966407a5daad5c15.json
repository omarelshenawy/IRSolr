			"previous": " A planet or moon s interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body radioactive materials e g uranium thorium and 26Al or tidal heating Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water Smaller bodies without tidal heating cool more quickly and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering 67 ",
			"after": " The study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our understanding of the universe The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding and from computer simulations of the interior 68 Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas known as giant molecular clouds When destabilized cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity to form a protostar A sufficiently dense and hot core region will trigger nuclear fusion thus creating a main sequence star 69 ",
