			"previous": " From this work he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours chromatic aberration As a proof of the concept he constructed a telescope using a mirror as the objective to bypass that problem 45 46 Building the design the first known functional reflecting telescope today known as a Newtonian telescope 46 involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal using Newton s rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes In late 1668 47 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope 48 Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes Of Colours 49 which he later expanded into the work Opticks When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton s ideas Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679 80 when Hooke appointed to manage the Royal Society s correspondence opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions 50 which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector see Newton s law of universal gravitation History and De motu corporum in gyrum But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke s death 51 ",
			"after": " Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films Opticks Bk II Props 12 but still retained his theory of fits that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted Props 13 However later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction Today s quantum mechanics photons and the idea of wave particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton s understanding of light ",
