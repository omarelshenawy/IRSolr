			"previous": " In 1904 Rhodes took 131 wickets the fewest in a season of his career to date 15 He scored 1 537 runs including two hundreds the second and third of his career to complete his second double 16 He generally batted at number six or seven in the batting order but in two games he opened the batting 54 In 1905 Yorkshire won the Championship Rhodes again completed the double with 1 581 runs his two hundreds including a double hundred 16 He took 182 wickets 15 but Wisden judged that he was not as dangerous a bowler on slow wickets as he had been 55 Rhodes played in four of the five Tests against Australia that year He scored 29 and 39 not out in the first Test 56 but in the second suffered an injured finger which reduced his effectiveness and caused him to miss the next Test 57 In the fourth Test Rhodes took five wickets in the match including three for 36 in the second innings 58 However the England captain Stanley Jackson showed in the words of Wisden a curious want of faith in Rhodes even though he was bowling well 59 His fielding was singled out for praise as he took four catches two of them regarded as brilliant 59 England eventually won the series 2 0 Rhodes contributed 146 runs at an average of 48 66 and a top score of 39 not out 60 and ten wickets at an average of 31 40 41 ",
			"after": " The relative deterioration in Rhodes s bowling continued into the 1906 season when Wisden commented that he had lost his sharp spin and was not dangerous on a hard wicket 55 Rhodes scored 1 721 runs 16 now regularly opening the batting and completed another double with 128 wickets but the Wisden correspondent did not believe this compensated for his lost bowling 15 61 In 1907 Rhodes scored fewer runs and increased his bowling aggregate securing 173 wickets in a wet season 15 Wisden believed his greater bowling success was due to a reduced batting contribution but he still completed the double by scoring 1 045 runs 16 62 During that season Rhodes was again asked to open the batting for Yorkshire and he was chosen as the permanent replacement for John Tunnicliffe as Yorkshire s opening batsman Several batsmen had been tried in the position 63 but Rhodes s superior defensive technique with the bat secured him the role 64 Despite the increase in wickets Rhodes was not picked for any of the Tests that year against South Africa Colin Blythe being preferred 65 ",
