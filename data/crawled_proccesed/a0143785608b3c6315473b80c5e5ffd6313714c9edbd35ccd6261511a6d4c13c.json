			"after": " The Magdalen Reading is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid 15th century oil on oak altarpiece by the early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden Completed some time between 1435 and 1438 it has been in the National Gallery London since 1860 It shows a woman with the pale skin high cheek bones and oval eyebrows typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period The woman is identifiable as the Magdalen from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground which according to the Gospels she used to clean Christ s feet The background of the painting had been overpainted with a thick layer of brown paint A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalen and the kneeling figure with bare feet protruding in front of her with a landscape visible through a window The original altarpiece was a sacra conversazione known only through a drawing Virgin and Child with Saints The panel was purchased by the National Gallery from a collector in Paris It is described by art historian Lorne Campbell as one of the great masterpieces of 15th century art and among van der Weyden s most important early works ",
