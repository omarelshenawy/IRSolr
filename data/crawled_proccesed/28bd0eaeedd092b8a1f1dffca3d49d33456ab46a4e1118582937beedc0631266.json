			"previous": " Transport phenomena occur frequently in industrial problems These include fluid dynamics heat transfer and mass transfer which mainly concern momentum transfer energy transfer and transport of chemical species respectively Basic equations for describing the three phenomena in the macroscopic microscopic and molecular levels are very similar Thus understanding transport phenomena requires thorough understanding of mathematics 31 ",
			"after": " Chemical engineers develop economic ways of using materials and energy 33 Chemical engineers use chemistry and engineering to turn raw materials into usable products such as medicine petrochemicals and plastics on a large scale industrial setting They are also involved in waste management and research Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of computers 32 ",
