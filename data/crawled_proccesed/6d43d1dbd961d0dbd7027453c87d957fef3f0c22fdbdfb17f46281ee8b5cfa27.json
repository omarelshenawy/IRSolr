			"previous": " The architectural correspondent of The Times wrote that the architecture of the college was incongruous it was remarkable that a college with connections to modern industry should be looking backwards in this way That a college devoted to modern scientific studies should be dressed up in the style of an antique Cotswold manor house has already been the subject of puzzled comment by many foreign visitors to Oxford 45 Writing in The Observer Patience Gray also disliked the college s design referring to the Cotswold dementia of the architecture and the college s pokey windows and grotesque sugarloaf tower 42 The chapel was described by the travel writer Jan Morris as one of the sweetest little sanctuaries in Oxford 46 very simple almost stern with a contrast between the black and white pews and the rich colour of the stained glass 46 However she said that whilst Oxford colleges change in style over time as buildings are added or altered Nuffield was a hodge podge from the start with a faintly Levantine tower upon a Cotswold Gothic base 6 ",
			"after": " The writer Miles Jebb considered the contrast between the hall s black and white floor and red panelled roof to be most effective 37 He thought that the enclosed layout of the college was a principal attraction but wrote that the tower s palpably utilitarian function detracts from its aesthetic attraction even though it made the emphatic addition to the skyline of Oxford that Nuffield wanted 37 A R Woolley author of an Oxford University Press guide to the city and university was more positive He described the tower as an exciting breakaway from the conventional with its spire as a secular contribution to the sky line 38 He said that the buildings make a picturesque group of gabled Cotswold roofs adding that t heir design is simple and depends for its effects upon its just proportions It is at once traditional and original 38 ",
