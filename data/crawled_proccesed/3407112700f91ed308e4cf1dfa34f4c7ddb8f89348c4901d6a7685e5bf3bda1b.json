			"previous": " Within the swallow family the white eyed river martin is one of only two members of the river martin subfamily Pseudochelidoninae the other being the African river martin Pseudochelidon eurystomina of the Congo basin in Africa These two species possess a number of distinctive features which mark them out from other swallows and martins including their robust legs and feet and stout bills 3 The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of the two martins suggest that they are relict populations of a group of species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolution 3 The separation of this subfamily is supported by genetic evidence 4 and their habit of nesting in burrows is thought to be characteristic of the earliest members of the swallow family 5 ",
