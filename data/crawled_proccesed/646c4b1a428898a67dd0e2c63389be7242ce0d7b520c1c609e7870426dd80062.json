			"previous": " The British epitomized this shift Their standard early war fighters mounted eight 303 inch 7 7 mm calibre machine guns whereas by mid war they often featured a combination of machine guns and 20 mm cannons and late in the war often only cannons The Americans in contrast had problems designing a native cannon design so instead placed multiple 50 caliber 12 7 mm heavy machine guns on their fighters Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and air to surface ordnance such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings and pressed into close air support roles as fighter bombers Although they carried less ordnance than light and medium bombers and generally had a shorter range they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability made it easier for them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles Moreover if they encountered enemy fighters their ordnance which reduced lift and increased drag and therefore decreased performance could be jettisoned and they could engage the enemy fighters which eliminated the need for fighter escorts that bombers required Heavily armed and sturdily constructed fighters such as Germany s Focke Wulf Fw 190 Britain s Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest and America s P 40 Corsair P 47 and P 38 all excelled as fighter bombers and since the Second World War ground attack has been an important secondary capability of many fighters ",
			"after": " World War II also saw the first use of airborne radar on fighters The primary purpose of these radars was to help night fighters locate enemy bombers and fighters Because of the bulkiness of these radar sets they could not be carried on conventional single engined fighters and instead were typically retrofitted to larger heavy fighters or light bombers such as Germany s Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88 Britain s Mosquito and Beaufighter and America s A 20 which then served as night fighters The Northrop P 61 Black Widow a purpose built night fighter was the only fighter of the war that incorporated radar into its original design Britain and America cooperated closely in the development of airborne radar and Germany s radar technology generally lagged slightly behind Anglo American efforts while other combatants developed few radar equipped fighters ",
