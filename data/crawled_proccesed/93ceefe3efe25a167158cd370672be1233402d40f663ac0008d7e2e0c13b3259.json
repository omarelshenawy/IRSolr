			"after": " Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts 12 One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks It was positioned eastward in the morning and was turned west at noon Obelisks functioned in much the same manner the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon as well as the summer and winter solstices 6 16 A third shadow clock developed c 1500 BC was similar in shape to a bent T square It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non linear rule The T was oriented eastward in the mornings and turned around at noon so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction 17 ",
