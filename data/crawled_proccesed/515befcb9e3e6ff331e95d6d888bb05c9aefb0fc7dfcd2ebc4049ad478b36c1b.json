			"after": " Modular origami otherwise known as unit folding is a form of origami involving the use of several pieces of paper to create one model Each individual sheet of paper is folded into a module or unit and then the pieces are assembled into a flat shape or three dimensional structure by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding process This process creates tension in the model allowing this units to remain together Modular origami can be viewed as a sub set of multi piece origami and therefore the rules of origami still apply ",
