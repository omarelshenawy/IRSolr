			"after": " Motor vehicles are a threat to localised populations of non abundant Tasmanian mammals 127 128 and a 2010 study showed that devils were particularly vulnerable A study of nine species mostly marsupials of a similar size showed that devils were more difficult for drivers to detect and thus avoid At high beam devils had the lowest detection distance 40 closer than the median This requires a 20 reduction in speed for a motorist to avoid the devil For low beam the devils are the seventh worst in terms of detection distance 16 below the median For avoidance of roadkill to be feasible motorists would have to drive at around half the current speed limit in rural areas 127 A study in the 1990s on a localised population of devils in a national park in Tasmania recorded a halving of the population after a hitherto gravel access road was upgraded surfaced with bitumen and widened At the same time there was a large increase in deaths caused by vehicles along the new road there had been none in the preceding six months 128 The vast majority of deaths occurred in the sealed portion of the road believed to be due to an increase in speeds 128 It was also conjectured that the animals were harder to see against the dark bitumen instead of the light gravel 128 The devil and quoll are especially vulnerable as they often try to retrieve roadkill for food and travel along the road To alleviate the problem traffic slowing measures man made pathways that offer alternative routes for devils education campaigns and the installation of light reflectors to indicate oncoming vehicles have been implemented They are credited with decreases in roadkill 128 Devils have often been victims of roadkill when they are retrieving other roadkill Work by scientist Menna Jones and a group of conservation volunteers to remove dead animals from the road resulted in a significant reduction in devil traffic deaths 83 It was estimated that 3 392 devils or between 3 8 and 5 7 of the population were being killed annually by vehicles in 2001 04 56 ",
