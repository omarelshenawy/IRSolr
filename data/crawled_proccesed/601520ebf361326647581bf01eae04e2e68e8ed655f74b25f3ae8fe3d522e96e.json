			"previous": " Lions usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey However they are not particularly known for their stamina for instance a lioness heart makes up only 0 57 of her body weight a male s is about 0 45 of his body weight whereas a hyena s heart is close to 1 of its body weight 76 Thus they only run fast in short bursts 77 and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility many kills take place near some form of cover or at night 78 They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately 30 metres 98 feet or less ",
			"after": " The prey consists mainly of medium sized mammals with a preference for wildebeest zebras buffalo and warthogs in Africa and nilgai wild boar and several deer species in India Many other species are hunted based on availability mainly ungulates weighing between 50 and 300 kg 110 and 660 lb such as kudu hartebeest gemsbok and eland 4 Occasionally they take relatively small species such as Thomson s gazelle or springbok Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals even healthy adults but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male giraffes due to the danger of injury Giraffes and buffaloes are almost invulnerable to a solitary lion as well 79 ",
