			"previous": " Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs superior to Donald Bradman often regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket on difficult pitches 282 In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances 278 Murphy suggests Before Bradman he was the most consistent run getter of all time yet no one worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores 283 Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110 and was not particularly interested in most statistics 284 An article in Wisden in 2000 stated He was never as dominant as Bradman he never wanted to be But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim whatever the conditions 285 ",
			"after": " Hobbs technique was based on strong forearms and good foot movement R C Robertson Glasgow suggested that his footwork was as near as is humanly possible perfect In every stroke he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over taxing energy of mind or body 286 He played every type of shot he did not have a signature shot like other batsmen but selected his strokes effectively 287 according to Alec Kennedy who bowled to Hobbs it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do 156 In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot 288 Capable of playing all the strokes he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run 283 he also ran well between the wickets 283 He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings before the bowlers had settled on occasion Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them 289 Early in his career mainly before the First World War Hobbs was an aggressive fast scoring batsman who played many shots 284 After the war he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age 283 and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods many critics including Hobbs himself recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914 However commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period 290 291 Cardus wrote that he scored his centuries effortlessly now we hardly noted the making of them 277 This was the period in which he became known as The Master 292 and he was more consistent than before the war This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection 283 98 of his centuries and 26 411 of his runs at an average of 58 62 in first class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40 292 ",
