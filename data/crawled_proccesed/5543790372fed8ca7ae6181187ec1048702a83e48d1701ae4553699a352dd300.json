			"previous": " Mary Cassatt s brother Alexander Cassatt was president of the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1899 until his death in 1906 She was shaken as they had been close but she continued to be very productive in the years leading up to 1910 64 An increasing sentimentality is apparent in her work of the 1900s her work was popular with the public and the critics but she was no longer breaking new ground and her Impressionist colleagues who once provided stimulation and criticism were dying off She was hostile to such new developments in art as post Impressionism Fauvism and Cubism 65 Two of her works appeared in the Armory Show of 1913 both images of a mother and child 66 ",
			"after": " A trip to Egypt in 1910 impressed Cassatt with the beauty of its ancient art but was followed by a crisis of creativity not only had the trip exhausted her but she declared herself crushed by the strength of this Art saying I fought against it but it conquered it is surely the greatest Art the past has left us how are my feeble hands to ever paint the effect on me 67 Diagnosed with diabetes rheumatism neuralgia and cataracts in 1911 she did not slow down but after 1914 she was forced to stop painting as she became almost blind ",
