			"previous": " This was addressed by Bombardier s twin engine Canadair Regional Jet which became a best seller The CRJ s range is enough to fill mid range routes as well routes previously served by larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and DC 9 These aircraft were originally intended to be used for direct airport to airport flights bypassing hubs and led to industry wide discussions about the decline of the hub and spoke model Although not as economical as the turboprop by flying directly to and from smaller airports they reduced the need for low cost regional airliners And although turboprops are quiet to outside observers propwash makes them very noisy inside 1 Passengers greatly preferred jets both for real and perception reasons ",
			"after": " As had happened with the turboprops of only a few years earlier the success of the CRJ led to the introduction of a host of competitors The only successful example citation needed is the Embraer ERJ 145 which has seen excellent sales and has competed strongly with the CRJ in most markets Bombardier and Embraer have been locked in a series of counter lawsuits over export taxes and subsidies ever since The ERJ s success led to a totally new version the Embraer E Jets series Bombardier plans to build competing aircraft in response the CSeries It is currently in its developing stages ",
