			"previous": " Remains assignable to Paraceratherium have been found in early to late Oligocene 34 23 million years ago formations across Eurasia in modern day China Mongolia India Pakistan Kazakhstan Georgia Turkey Romania Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia 5 Their distribution may be correlated with the palaeogeographic development of the Alpine Himalayan mountain belt The range of Paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this 43 The fauna which coexisted with Paraceratherium included other rhinoceroses artiodactyls rodents beardogs weasels hyaenodonts nimravids and cats 26 ",
			"after": " The habitat of Paraceratherium appears to have varied across its range based on the types of geological formations it has been found in 26 The Hsanda Gol Formation of Mongolia represents an arid desert basin and the environment is thought to have had few tall trees and limited brush cover as the fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to the ground 44 A study of fossil pollen showed that much of China was woody shrubland with plants such as saltbush mormon tea Ephedra and nitre bush Nitraria all adapted to arid environments Trees were rare and concentrated near groundwater 45 The parts of China where Paraceratherium lived had dry lakes and abundant sand dunes and the most common plant fossils are leaves of the desert adapted Palibinia Trees in Mongolia and China included birch elm oaks and other deciduous trees while Siberia and Kazakhstan also had walnut trees 26 Dera Bugti in Pakistan had dry temperate to subtropical forest 41 ",
