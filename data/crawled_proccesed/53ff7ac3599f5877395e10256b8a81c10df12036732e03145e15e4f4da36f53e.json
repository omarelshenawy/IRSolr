			"after": " On Friday 31 August prostitute Mary Ann Nichols was murdered in Buck s Row since renamed Durward Street a back street in Whitechapel Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3 45 am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound Several shallower incisions across the abdomen and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards 23 As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or Bethnal Green Division of the Metropolitan Police it was at first investigated by the local detectives On the same day James Monro resigned as the head of the Criminal Investigation Department CID over differences with Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Charles Warren 24 Initial investigations into the murder had little success although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang as in the case of Smith 25 The Star newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline 26 Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline Henry Moore and Walter Andrews from the Central Office at Scotland Yard 27 On the available evidence Coroner Baxter concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3 am where she was found In his summing up he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram as the lethal weapons were different in those cases and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat 28 However by the time the inquest into Nichols death had concluded a fourth woman had been murdered and Baxter noted The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable 29 ",
