			"after": " Sources  A street grid stretches from downtown Miami throughout the county This grid was adopted by the City of Miami following World War I after the United States Post Office threatened to cease mail deliveries in the city because the original system of named streets with names often changing every few blocks and multiple streets in the city sharing the same name was too confusing for the mail carriers 64 The new grid was later extended throughout the county as the population grew west south and north of city limits The grid is laid out with Miami Avenue as the meridian going North South and Flagler Street the baseline going east west The grid is primarily numerical so that for example all street addresses north of Flagler and west of Miami Avenue have NW in their address e g NW 27th Avenue Because its point of origin is in downtown Miami which is close to the coast the NW and SW quadrants are much larger than the SE and NE quadrants Many roads especially major ones are also named although with a few notable exceptions the number is in more common usage among locals Although this grid is easy to understand once one is oriented to it it is not universal in the entire county Hialeah uses its own grid system which is entirely different in its orientation Coral Gables and Miami Lakes use named streets almost exclusively and various smaller municipalities such as Florida City and Homestead use their own grid system along with the Miami Dade grid system adding to the confusion In the beach cities and parks of Miami Beach Surfside Bal Harbor Haulover Sunny Isles and Golden Beach the streets are coordinated with the main grid however their avenues are named ",
