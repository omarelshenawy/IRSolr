			"previous": "  Seventeen hundred years after Eratosthenes death while Christopher Columbus studied what Eratosthenes had written about the size of the Earth he chose to believe that the Earth s circumference was much smaller Had Columbus set sail knowing that Eratosthenes larger circumference value was more accurate he would have known that the place where he made landfall was not Asia but rather a New World 18 ",
			"after": " Eratosthenes continued from his knowledge about the Earth his discoveries of its size and shape and began to sketch it In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format 19 In his three volume work Geography Greek Geographika he described and mapped his entire known world even dividing the Earth into five climate zones 20 two freezing zones around the pole two temperate zones and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics 21 He had invented geography He created terminology that is still used today He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world It was now possible to estimate one s distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth In the Geography the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown this had never been achieved before 3 Unfortunately his Geography has been lost to history but fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like Pliny Polybius Strabo and Marcianus ",
