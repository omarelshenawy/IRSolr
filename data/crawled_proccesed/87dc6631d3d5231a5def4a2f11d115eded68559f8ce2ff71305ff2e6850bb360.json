			"previous": " A phagocyte has many types of receptors on its surface that are used to bind material 2 They include opsonin receptors scavenger receptors and Toll like receptors Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with immunoglobulin G IgG antibodies or with complement Complement is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction 27 Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells and Toll like receptors so called because of their similarity to well studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the Toll gene bind to more specific molecules Binding to Toll like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause inflammation 2 ",
