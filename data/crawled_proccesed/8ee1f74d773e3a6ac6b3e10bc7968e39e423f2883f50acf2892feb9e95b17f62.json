			"previous": " Rather than try to fit more guns onto a ship it was possible to increase the power of each gun This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration 44 ",
			"after": " Both methods offered advantages and disadvantages though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear As guns fire their barrels wear out losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement At times this became problematic the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 because of the wear on the barrels 45 The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier and heavier shells which are fired at lower velocities require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range Heavier shells have the advantage of being slowed less by air resistance retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges 46 ",
