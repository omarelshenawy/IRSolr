			"previous": " Prior to the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682 up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods more than 31 000 square miles 80 000 km2 of eastern white pine eastern hemlock and a mix of hardwoods 12 The forests near the three original counties Philadelphia Bucks and Chester were the first to be harvested as the early settlers used the readily available timber and cleared land for agriculture By the time of the American Revolution logging had reached the interior and mountainous regions 12 13 and became a leading industry in Pennsylvania 12 Trees furnished fuel to heat homes tannin for the state s many tanneries and wood for construction furniture and barrel making Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber as were a wide variety of household utensils and the first Conestoga wagons 12 ",
			"after": " By the early 19th century the demand for lumber reached the Pine Creek Gorge where the surrounding mountainsides were covered with eastern white pine 3 to 6 feet 1 to 2 m in diameter and 150 feet 50 m or more tall eastern hemlock 9 feet 3 m in circumference and huge hardwoods 6 Each acre 0 4 ha of these virgin forests produced 100 000 board feet 200 m3 of white pine and 200 000 board feet 500 m3 of hemlock and hardwoods For comparison the same area of forest today produces a total of only 5 000 board feet 10 m3 on average According to Steven E Owlett environmental lawyer and author shipbuilders considered pine from Pine Creek the best timber in the world for making fine ship masts 14 so it was the first lumber to be harvested on a large scale The original title to the land that became Colton Point State Park was sold to the Wilhelm Wilkins Company in 1792 14 Pine Creek was declared a public highway by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 16 1798 6 and rafts of spars were floated down the creek to the Susquehanna River then to the Chesapeake Bay and the shipbuilders at Baltimore 14 b The lumbermen would then walk home following the old Pine Creek Path at the end of their journey 10 ",
