			"previous": " Copyright is a legal concept which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the duplication and public performance of his or her work In many jurisdictions this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the public domain During the time period of copyright the author s work may only be copied modified or publicly performed with the consent of the author unless the use is a fair use Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the authors content or limit their use to fair use Secondly it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found 4 Finally it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works such as mashups and collaborative content 5 ",
