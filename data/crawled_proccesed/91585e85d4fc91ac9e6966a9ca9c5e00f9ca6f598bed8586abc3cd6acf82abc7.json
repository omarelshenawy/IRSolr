			"previous": " The black vulture lays its eggs on the ground in a wooded area a hollow log or some other cavity seldom more than 3 m 9 8 ft above the ground 28 While it generally does not use any nesting materials it may decorate the area around the nest with bits of brightly colored plastic shards of glass or metal items such as bottle caps 36 Clutch size is generally two eggs though this can vary from one to three The egg is oval and on average measures 7 56 cm 5 09 cm 2 98 in 2 00 in The smooth gray green bluish or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end 36 Both parents incubate the eggs which hatch after 28 to 41 days 36 Upon hatching the young are covered with white down 42 Both parents feed the nestlings regurgitating food at the nest site The young remain in the nest for two months and after 75 to 80 days they are able to fly skillfully 39 Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as raccoons coatis and foxes Due to its aggressiveness and size few predators can threaten the fully grown vulture However various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts and even the ornate hawk eagle a slightly smaller bird than the vulture have preyed on adult black vultures 48 ",
			"after": " The black vulture is considered a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle 49 The droppings produced by black vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation 50 The bird is also considered a threat to the safety of aerial traffic especially when it congregates in large numbers in the vicinity of garbage dumps 51 as is the case in the Rio de Janeiro Tom Jobim International Airport 52 ",
