			"previous": " The emerging discipline of geology also brought natural history and natural philosophy closer together the establishment of the stratigraphic column linked the spacial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution a key precursor to concepts of evolution Georges Cuvier and others made great strides in comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world as had been widely believed 35 Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell William Buckland Mary Anning and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an age of reptiles that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth 36 Most of these geologists held to catastrophism but Charles Lyell s influential Principles of Geology 1830 popularised Hutton s uniformitarianism a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms 37 ",
			"after": " The most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin s was that of Jean Baptiste Lamarck based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans 38 The British naturalist Charles Darwin combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt the uniformitarian geology of Lyell Thomas Malthus s writings on population growth and his own morphological expertise created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions 39 ",
