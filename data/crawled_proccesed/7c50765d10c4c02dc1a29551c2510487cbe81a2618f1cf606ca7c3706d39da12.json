			"previous": " The body and the broad flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense brown fur that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm 6 11 The fur is waterproof and the texture is akin to that of a mole 15 The platypus uses its tail for storage of fat reserves an adaptation also found in animals such as the Tasmanian devil 16 and fat tailed sheep It has webbed feet and a large rubbery snout these features appear closer to those of a duck than to those of any known mammal The webbing is more significant on the front feet and is folded back when walking on land 11 Unlike a bird s beak in which the upper and lower parts separate to reveal the mouth the snout of the platypus is a sensory organ with the mouth on the underside The nostrils are located on the dorsal surface of the snout while the eyes and ears are located in a groove set just back from it this groove is closed when swimming 11 Platypuses have been heard to emit a low growl when disturbed and a range of other vocalizations have been reported in captive specimens 6 ",
