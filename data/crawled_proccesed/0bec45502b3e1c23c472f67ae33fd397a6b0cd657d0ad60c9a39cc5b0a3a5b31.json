			"after": " Parasaurolophus is often hypothesized to have used its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other members of a group or its species 23 This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P tubicen He noted that the crests internal structures are similar to those of a swan and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise 23 16 However the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus Corythosaurus and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size shape and nasal passage length most obvious in P cyrtocristatus interpreted as a possible female 23 Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing There is at least one example in the related Corythosaurus of a slender stapes reptilian ear bone in place which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear Furthermore the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian s indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well developed 24 Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies such as their offspring might produce According to Weishampel this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating 23 ",
