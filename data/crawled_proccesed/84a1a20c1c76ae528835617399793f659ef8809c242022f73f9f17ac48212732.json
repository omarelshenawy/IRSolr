			"after": " Euclid s Elements contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry One of these the parallel postulate has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries It states that on any plane on which there is a straight line L1 and a point P not on L1 there is exactly one straight line L2 on the plane that passes through the point P and is parallel to the straight line L1 Until the 19th century few doubted the truth of the postulate instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms 13 Around 1830 though the Hungarian J nos Bolyai and the Russian Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate called hyperbolic geometry In this geometry an infinite number of parallel lines pass through the point P Consequently the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180 and the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter is greater than pi In the 1850s Bernhard Riemann developed an equivalent theory of elliptical geometry in which no parallel lines pass through P In this geometry triangles have more than 180 and circles have a ratio of circumference to diameter that is less than pi ",
