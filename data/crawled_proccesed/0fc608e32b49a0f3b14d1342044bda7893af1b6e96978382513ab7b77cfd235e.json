			"previous": " There are ancient prehistoric copper mines along Lake Superior and metallic copper was still found there near the surface in colonial times 15 16 17 Indians availed themselves of this copper starting at least 5 000 years ago 15 and copper tools arrowheads and other artifacts that were part of an extensive native trade network have been discovered In addition obsidian flint and other minerals were mined worked and traded 16 Early French explorers who encountered the sites clarification needed made no use of the metals due to the difficulties of transporting them 16 but the copper was eventually traded throughout the continent along major river routes In Saskatchewan Canada there also are ancient quartz mines near Waddy Lake and surrounding regions 18 ",
