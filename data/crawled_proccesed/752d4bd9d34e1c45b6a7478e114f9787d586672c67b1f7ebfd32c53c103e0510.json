			"previous": " Although the mine produced more than 1 million equivalent to about 24 million in 2009 27 in bullion in its first three years its shares declined from 23 a share in historical dollars to less than 3 38 In February 1908 a committee of minority stockholders suspecting that the mine was overvalued hired a British mining engineer to conduct an inspection The engineer s report was unfavorable and news of this caused a sudden further decline in share value from 3 to 75 cents 39 Schwab expressed disappointment when he learned that the wonderful high grade ore that had brought the mine fame was confined to only a few stringers and that what he had actually bought was a large low grade mine 38 Although the mine was still profitable by 1909 no new ore was being discovered and the value of the remaining ore steadily decreased In 1910 the mine operated at a loss for most of the year and on March 14 1911 it was closed By then the stock which had fallen to 10 cents a share slid to 4 cents and was dropped from the exchanges 40 ",
			"after": " Rhyolite began to decline before the final closing of the mine At roughly the same time that the Bullfrog mines were running out of high grade ore the 1906 San Francisco earthquake diverted capital to California while interrupting rail service and the financial panic of 1907 restricted funding for mine development As mines in the district reduced production or closed unemployed miners left Rhyolite to seek work elsewhere businesses failed and by 1910 the census reported only 675 residents 41 All three banks in the town closed by March 1910 The newspapers including the Rhyolite Herald the last to go all shut down by June 1912 The post office closed in November 1913 the last train left Rhyolite Station in July 1914 and the Nevada California Power Company turned off the electricity and removed its lines in 1916 42 Within a year the town was all but abandoned 42 and the 1920 census reported a population of only 14 36 A 1922 motor tour by the Los Angeles Times found only one remaining resident a 92 year old man who died in 1924 43 ",
