			"previous": " In 2007 a modified 3D model was developed by Wikimedia Taiwan for Wikimania when they distributed a 3 inch diameter spherical puzzle based on the logo that attendees could piece together It did not add other letters on the parts that cannot be seen on the 2D logo but used that space to include small logos of the sister projects and information about Wikimania A variant of that model was used to build a person sized Wikiball that spun on a stand featured during the event 7 This led to a renewed interest in getting a proper 3D model for the logo ",
			"after": " By 2007 users on listservs discovered that the logo had some minor errors The errors were not immediately fixed because according to Friedland he could not locate the original project file Friedland added that I have tried to reconstruct it but it never looks right and that the logo should be redrawn by a professional illustrator 5 Kizu Naoko a Wikipedian said that most Japanese users supported correcting the errors In an e mail to Noam Cohen of The New York Times Kizu said that It could be an option to leave them as they are Most people don t take it serious sic and think the graphical logo is a sort of pot au feu of various letters without meaning 5 ",
