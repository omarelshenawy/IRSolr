			"previous": " It would be nearly four years after Thespis was produced before the two men worked together again In 1868 Gilbert had published a short comedic sketch libretto in Fun magazine entitled Trial by Jury An Operetta In 1873 Gilbert arranged with the theatrical manager and composer Carl Rosa to expand the piece into a one act libretto Rosa s wife was to sing the role of the plaintiff However Rosa s wife died in childbirth in 1874 Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to Richard D Oyly Carte but Carte could not use the piece at that time By early 1875 Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach s La P richole He contacted Gilbert asked about the piece and suggested Sullivan to set the work Sullivan was enthusiastic and Trial by Jury was composed in a matter of weeks The little piece was a runaway hit outlasting the run of La P richole and being revived at another theatre 53 ",
			"after": " Gilbert continued his quest to gain respect in and respectability for his profession One thing that may have been holding dramatists back from respectability was that plays were not published in a form suitable for a gentleman s library as at the time they were generally cheaply and unattractively published for the use of actors rather than the home reader To help rectify this at least for himself Gilbert arranged in late 1875 for publishers Chatto and Windus to print a volume of his plays in a format designed to appeal to the general reader with an attractive binding and clear type containing Gilbert s most respectable plays including his most serious works but mischievously capped off with Trial by Jury 26 ",
