			"previous": " The events described in the poem take place in the late 5th century after the Angles and Saxons had begun their migration to England and before the beginning of the 7th century a time when the Anglo Saxon people were either newly arrived or still in close contact with their Germanic kinsmen in Northern Germany and Scandinavia and possibly England The poem may have been brought to England by people of Geatish origins 8 It has been suggested that Beowulf was first composed in the 7th century at Rendlesham in East Anglia as the Sutton Hoo ship burial also shows close connections with Scandinavia and also that the East Anglian royal dynasty the Wuffings may have been descendants of Geatish Wulfings 9 10 Others have associated this poem with the court of King Alfred or with the court of King Cnut 11 pages needed ",
