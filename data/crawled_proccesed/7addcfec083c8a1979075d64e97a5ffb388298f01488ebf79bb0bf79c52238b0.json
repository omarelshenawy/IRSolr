			"previous": " In China the art of printmaking developed some 1 100 years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper Initially images were mainly religious but in the Song Dynasty artists began to cut landscapes During the Ming 1368 1644 and Qing 1616 1911 dynasties the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings 15 16 ",
			"after": " Woodblock printing in Japan Japanese moku hanga is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo e artistic genre however it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period Woodblock printing had been used in China for centuries to print books long before the advent of movable type but was only widely adopted in Japan surprisingly late during the Edo period 1603 1867 Although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards moku hanga differs greatly in that water based inks are used as opposed to western woodcut which uses oil based inks allowing for a wide range of vivid color glazes and color transparency ",
