			"previous": " One of Gilbert s favourite comic themes is the elevation of an unqualified person to a position of high responsibility In The Happy Land 1873 for example Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position In particular the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty 146 147 In Pinafore Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph who rises to the same position by never go ing to sea 117 148 In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas the characters Major General Stanley in Pirates and Ko Ko in The Mikado are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics implying that when Sir Joseph always voted at his party s call he sacrificed his personal integrity 149 The commercial middle class which was Gilbert s main audience is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed 150 In addition the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain even though they were babies nursed together satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl 29 The Times wrote in reviewing the 1929 production that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a paternal Captain and the ethics of all romanticism are accepted unflinchingly and taken to their logical conclusion It is the reference to actuality that is essential without it the absurdity will not stand starkly out 150 ",
			"after": " A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Sorcerer a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different social classes 151 In Pinafore the captain s daughter Josephine loves and is loved by a common sailor but she dutifully tells him your proffered love I haughtily reject He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with I am a British sailor and I love you It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she This is a parody of the Victorian equality drama such as Lord Lytton s The Lady of Lyons 1838 where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech ending with I am a peasant 152 It then turns out that he has become her social superior Furthermore in Pinafore Sir Joseph assures Josephine that love levels all ranks In Tom Taylor s The Serf the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank and she declares happily at the end that love levels all 152 In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical melodrama Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are any man s equal excepting his and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor Conversely he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him dance a hornpipe on the cabin table 152 Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine becomes acceptable only through the absurd second act revelation of Buttercup s inadvertent switching of the infants and concludes that Gilbert is a conservative satirist who ultimately advocated preserving the status quo and set out to show that love definitely does not level all ranks 137 ",
