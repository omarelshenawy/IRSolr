			"previous": " Secular trends such as carbonatites granulites eclogites and greenstone belt deformation events are all possible indicators of Precambrian supercontinent cyclicity although the Protopangea Paleopangea solution implies that Phanerozoic style of supercontinent cycles did not operate during these times Also there are instances where these secular trends have a weak uneven or lack of imprint on the supercontinent cycle secular methods for supercontinent reconstruction will produce results that have only one explanation and each explanation for a trend must fit in with the rest 4 ",
			"after": " The causes of supercontinent assembly and dispersal are thought to be driven by processes in the mantle 2 Approximately 660 km into the mantle a discontinuity occurs affecting the surface crust through processes like plumes and superplumes When a slab of crust that is subducted is denser than the surrounding mantle it sinks to the discontinuity Once the slabs build up they will sink through to the lower mantle in what is known as a slab avalanche This displacement at the discontinuity will cause the lower mantle to compensate and rise elsewhere The rising mantle can form a plume or superplume ",
