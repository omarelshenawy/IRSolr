			"previous": " The United Nations designated Redwood National and State Parks a World Heritage Site on September 5 1980 The evaluation committee noted 50 prehistoric archaeological sites spanning 4 500 years It also cited ongoing research in the park by Humboldt State University researchers among others 17 The park is part of a much larger region designated the California Coast Ranges International Biosphere Reserve on June 30 1983 18 The California Coast Ranges biosphere is overseen by the University of California Natural Reserve System ",
			"after": " Redwood National Park headquarters is located in Crescent City California with a service office located in Arcata and an operations center located in Orick California  Lack of money has precluded major improvements however and timber companies have replanted much of the logged area with non native tree species Coastline areas including dunes and coastal prairie have been invaded by exotic species partly due to the suppression of forest fires until the 1980s A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility with inaccessible areas being cut last large old growth forest sections were isolated from one another sometimes by many miles In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem 19 ",
