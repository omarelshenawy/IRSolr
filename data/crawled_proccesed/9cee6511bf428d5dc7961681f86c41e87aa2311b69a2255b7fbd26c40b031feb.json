			"after": " During Roman times Volubilis was a major producer of olive oil The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible as are the remains of the original presses and olive mills One such building has been reconstructed with a full size replica of a Roman olive press 39 Olive oil was central to the life of the city as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps bathing and medicines while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses For this reason even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses 40 Fifty eight oil pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis They housed a standard set of elements a mill used to crush the olives a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives and a press that comprised a counterweight a prelum or cross bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed The olives were first crushed into a paste then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae 38 There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far many of them bakeries 41 and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks 42 ",
