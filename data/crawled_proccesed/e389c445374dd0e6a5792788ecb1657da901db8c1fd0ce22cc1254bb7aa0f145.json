			"previous": " Notable German physicists before the 20th century include Hermann von Helmholtz Joseph von Fraunhofer and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit among others Albert Einstein introduced the relativity theories for light and gravity in 1905 and 1915 respectively Along with Max Planck he was instrumental in the introduction of quantum mechanics in which Werner Heisenberg and Max Born later made major contributions 141 Wilhelm R ntgen discovered X rays 142 Otto Hahn was a pioneer in the fields of radiochemistry and discovered nuclear fission 143 while Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch were founders of microbiology Numerous mathematicians were born in Germany including Carl Friedrich Gauss David Hilbert Bernhard Riemann Gottfried Leibniz Karl Weierstrass Hermann Weyl and Felix Klein ",
			"after": " Germany has been the home of many famous inventors and engineers such as Johannes Gutenberg credited with the invention of movable type printing in Europe Hans Geiger the creator of the Geiger counter and Konrad Zuse who built the first fully automatic digital computer 144 German inventors engineers and industrialists such as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin 145 Otto Lilienthal Gottlieb Daimler Rudolf Diesel Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology German institutions like the German Aerospace Center DLR are the largest contributor to ESA Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket Heinrich Rudolf Hertz s work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication 146 ",
