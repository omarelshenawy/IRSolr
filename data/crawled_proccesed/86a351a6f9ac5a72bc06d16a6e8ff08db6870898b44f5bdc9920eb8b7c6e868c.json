			"previous": " From a general point of view the various fields in 3 dimensional vector calculus are uniformly seen as being k vector fields scalar fields are 0 vector fields vector fields are 1 vector fields pseudovector fields are 2 vector fields and pseudoscalar fields are 3 vector fields In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields scalar vector pseudovector pseudoscalar corresponding to 0 1 n 1 n dimensions which is exhaustive in dimension 3 so one cannot only work with pseudo scalars and pseudo vectors ",
			"after": " There are two important alternative generalizations of vector calculus The first geometric algebra uses k vector fields instead of vector fields in 3 or fewer dimensions every k vector field can be identified with a scalar function or vector field but this is not true in higher dimensions This replaces the cross product which is specific to 3 dimensions taking in two vector fields and giving as output a vector field with the exterior product which exists in all dimensions and takes in two vector fields giving as output a bivector 2 vector field This product yields Clifford algebras as the algebraic structure on vector spaces with an orientation and nondegenerate form Geometric algebra is mostly used in generalizations of physics and other applied fields to higher dimensions ",
