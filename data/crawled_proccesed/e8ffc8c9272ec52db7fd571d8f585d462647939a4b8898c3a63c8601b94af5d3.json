			"after": " As Southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors respectively In Louisiana Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it Lincoln s Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans political aspirations On the other hand the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the Wade Davis Bill in 1864 When Lincoln vetoed the bill the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana Arkansas and Tennessee 261 ",
