			"previous": " During the Crimean War Captain Cowper Phipps Coles constructed a raft with guns protected by a cupola and used the raft a named the Lady Nancy to shell the Russian town of Taganrog in the Black Sea The Lady Nancy proved a great success 1 and Coles patented his rotating turret after the war Following Coles patenting the British Admiralty ordered a prototype of Coles design in 1859 which was installed in the floating battery vessel HMS Trusty for trials in 1861 becoming the first warship to be fitted with a revolving gun turret Coles design aim was to create a ship with the greatest possible all round arc of fire as low in the water as possible to minimise the target 2 ",
			"after": " The Admiralty accepted the principle of the turret gun as a useful innovation and incorporated it into other new designs Coles submitted a design for a ship having ten domed turrets each housing two large guns The design was rejected as impractical although the Admiralty remained interested in turret ships and instructed its own designers to create better designs Coles enlisted the support of Prince Albert who wrote to the first Lord of the Admiralty the Duke of Somerset supporting the construction of a turret ship In January 1862 the Admiralty agreed to construct a ship the HMS Prince Albert which had four turrets and a low freeboard intended only for coastal defence Coles was allowed to design the turrets but the ship was the responsibility of the chief Constructor Isaac Watts 2 ",
