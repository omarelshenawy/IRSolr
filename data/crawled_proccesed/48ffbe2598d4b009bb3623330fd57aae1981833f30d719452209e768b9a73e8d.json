			"previous": " Finite model theory is the area of model theory which has the closest ties to universal algebra Like some parts of universal algebra and in contrast with the other areas of model theory it is mainly concerned with finite algebras or more generally with finite structures for signatures which may contain relation symbols as in the following example ",
			"after": " A homomorphism is a map that commutes with the operations and preserves the relations in This definition gives rise to the usual notion of graph homomorphism which has the interesting property that a bijective homomorphism need not be invertible Structures are also a part of universal algebra after all some algebraic structures such as ordered groups have a binary relation What distinguishes finite model theory from universal algebra is its use of more general logical sentences as in the example above in place of identities In a model theoretic context an identity t t is written as a sentence ",
