			"after": " Forms of idealism were prevalent in philosophy from the 18th century to the early 20th century Transcendental idealism advocated by Immanuel Kant is the view that there are limits on what can be understood since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment Kant wrote his Critique of Pure Reason 1781 1787 in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics Kant s intention with this work was to look at what we know and then consider what must be true about it as a logical consequence of the way we know it One major theme was that there are fundamental features of reality that escape our direct knowledge because of the natural limits of the human faculties 98 Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a conceptual or categorical framework on the stream of pure sensory data a framework including space and time themselves he maintained that things in themselves existed independently of our perceptions and judgments he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense Kant s account of things in themselves is both controversial and highly complex Continuing his work Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy ",
