			"after": "  The raw data are stored in an unsorted binary contingency table indicating which design style can be found in which context by a star symbol For example consider the first column context 3 contains the design styles blackrim bottle and handle A beaker is contained in contexts 1 and 2 Contextual seriation sorts the design styles and the contexts in such a way that the star symbols are found as close as possible to the diagonal of the table Of course for a small examples like this no computer programs are needed to find the best ordering but for larger data sets like the 900 graves studied by Petrie they are extremely helpful ",
