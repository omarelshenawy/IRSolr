			"previous": "  Earth science or geoscience is an all embracing term referring to the fields of science dealing with planet Earth 2 It can be considered to be a branch of planetary science but with a much older history There are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth sciences The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere Typically Earth scientists will use tools from physics chemistry biology chronology and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works and how it evolved to its current state ",
