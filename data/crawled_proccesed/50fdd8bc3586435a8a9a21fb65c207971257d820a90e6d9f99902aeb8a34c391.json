			"previous": " In 1970 Boeing s 747 became the first wide body jetliner to enter service 3 The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a twin aisle cabin 4 Two years later the manufacturer began a development study code named 7X7 for a new wide body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow body jets 5 6 The aircraft would also provide twin aisle seating but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747 McDonnell Douglas DC 10 and Lockheed L 1011 TriStar wide bodies 5 To defray the high cost of development Boeing signed risk sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation CTDC a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies 7 This marked the manufacturer s first major international joint venture and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation 7 The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take off and landing airliner intended for short distance flights but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept leading to its redefinition as a mid size transcontinental range airliner 5 At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines with possible configurations including over wing engines and a T tail 3 ",
			"after": " By 1976 a twinjet layout similar to the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300 became the baseline configuration 8 The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new generation jet powerplants 8 While airline requirements for new wide body aircraft remained ambiguous 8 the 7X7 was generally focused on mid size high density markets 3 As such it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities 9 Advancements in civil aerospace technology including high bypass ratio turbofan engines new flight deck systems aerodynamic improvements and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7 5 10 Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid size narrow body airliner code named 7N7 which would become the 757 10 Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s 11 12 ",
