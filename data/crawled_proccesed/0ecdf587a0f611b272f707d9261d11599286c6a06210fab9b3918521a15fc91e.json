			"previous": " The exponential growth in computing technology suggested by Moore s Law is commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of Moore s Law Computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec proposed in a 1998 book 24 that the exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies prior to the integrated circuit Futurist Ray Kurzweil postulates a law of accelerating returns in which the speed of technological change and more generally all evolutionary processes 25 increases exponentially generalizing Moore s Law in the same manner as Moravec s proposal and also including material technology especially as applied to nanotechnology medical technology and others 26 Between 1986 and 2007 machines application specific capacity to compute information per capita has roughly doubled every 14 months the per capita capacity of the world s general purpose computers has doubled every 18 months the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months and the world s storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months 27 Like other authors though Kurzweil reserves the term singularity for a rapid increase in intelligence as opposed to other technologies writing for example that The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains There will be no distinction post Singularity between human and machine 28 He believes that the design of the human brain while not simple is nonetheless a billion times simpler than it appears due to massive redundancy 29 According to Kurzweil the reason why the brain has a messy and unpredictable quality is because the brain like most biological systems is a probabilistic fractal 30 He also defines his predicted date of the singularity 2045 in terms of when he expects computer based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower writing that advances in computing before that date will not represent the Singularity because they do not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence 31 ",
