			"after": " Pneumatic systems like the oleo strut generally have long operating lives and the construction is not unusually complex for maintenance purposes 10  An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston which is attached to the wheel axle and which moves up and down in an outer or upper metal tube or cylinder that is attached to the airframe The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas usually nitrogen sometimes air especially on light aircraft and oil usually hydraulic fluid and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice ",
