			"previous": " Roberts launched his main attack on 10 February 1900 and although hampered by a long supply route managed to outflank the Boers defending Magersfontein On 14 February a cavalry division under Major General John French launched a major attack to relieve Kimberley Although encountering severe fire a massed cavalry charge split the Boer defences on 15 February opening the way for French to enter Kimberley that evening ending its 124 days siege ",
			"after": " Meanwhile Roberts pursued Piet Cronje s 7 000 strong force which had abandoned Magersfontein to head for Bloemfontein General French s cavalry was ordered to assist in the pursuit by embarking on an epic 50 kilometre 31 mi drive towards Paardeberg where Cronje was attempting to cross the Modder River At the Battle of Paardeberg from 18 to 27 February Roberts then surrounded General Piet Cronje s retreating Boer army On 17 February a pincer movement involving both French s cavalry and the main British force attempted to take the entrenched position but the frontal attacks were uncoordinated and so were easily repulsed by the Boers Finally Roberts resorted to bombarding Cronje into submission but it took a further ten precious days and with the British troops using the polluted Modder River as water supply resulting in a typhoid epidemic killing many troops General Cronje was forced to surrender at Surrender Hill with 4000 men ",
