			"previous": " As mentioned above stubs lend themselves to band pass designs General forms of these are similar to stub low pass filters except that the main line is no longer a narrow high impedance line Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from some of which produce identical responses An example stub filter is shown in figure 12 it consists of a row of 4 short circuit stubs coupled together by 4 impedance transformers The stubs in the body of the filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti resonators A filter with similar properties can be constructed with 4 open circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with 4 impedance transformers although this structure is not possible in planar technologies 63 ",
			"after": " Yet another structure available is 2 open circuit stubs across the line coupled with 4 impedance transformers This topology has both low pass and band pass characteristics Because it will pass DC it is possible to transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors Also since short circuit links are not required no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline The disadvantages are i the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding 4 stub filter since the stubs are all twice as long ii the first spurious passband is at 2 0 as opposed to 3 0 for the 4 stub filter 64 ",
