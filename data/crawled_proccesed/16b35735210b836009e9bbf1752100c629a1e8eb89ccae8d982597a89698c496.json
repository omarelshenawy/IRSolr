			"previous": " The VSI also sometimes called a variometer or rate of climb indicator senses changing air pressure and displays that information to the pilot as a rate of climb or descent in feet per minute meters per second or knots ",
			"after": " Most aircraft are equipped with a standard set of flight instruments which give the pilot information about the aircraft s attitude airspeed and altitude  Most aircraft built since about 1953 have four of the flight instruments located in a standardized pattern called the T arrangement The attitude indicator is in the top center airspeed to the left altimeter to the right and heading indicator under the attitude indicator The other two turn coordinator and vertical speed are usually found under the airspeed and altimeter but are given more latitude in placement The magnetic compass will be above the instrument panel often on the windscreen centerpost In newer aircraft with glass cockpit instruments the layout of the displays conform to the basic T arrangement ",
