			"after": " The scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad its collections of over 75 000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent from East South Central and South East Asia and from the Neolithic up to the present day Until recently this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi urban societies across the Asian continent Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the British Empire especially the Indian subcontinent Examples include the collections made by individuals such as Charles Stuart James Prinsep Charles Masson Sir Alexander Cunningham Sir Harold Deane and Sir John Marshall A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo Greek banker George Eumorfopoulos in the 1930s In the second half of the twentieth century the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the philanthropist PT Brooke Sewell which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection 71 72 73 ",
