			"previous": " Although most cells have other enzymes that can degrade RNA either from the 3 or from the 5 end of the RNA the exosome complex is essential for cell survival When the expression of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped for example by RNA interference growth stops and the cells eventually die Both the core proteins of the exosome complex as well as the two main associated proteins are essential proteins 34 Bacteria do not have an exosome complex however similar functions are performed by a simpler complex that includes the protein PNPase called the degradosome 35 ",
			"after": " The exosome is a key complex in cellular RNA quality control Unlike prokaryotes eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis processed RNA protein complexes such as ribosomes prior to their exit from the nucleus It is presumed that this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as protein synthesis 36 ",
