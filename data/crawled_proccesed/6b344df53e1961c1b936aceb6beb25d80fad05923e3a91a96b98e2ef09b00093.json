			"previous": " The debate about whether Tyrannosaurus was a predator or a pure scavenger is as old as the debate about its locomotion Lambe 1917 described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear 122 This argument is no longer taken seriously because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was a predator like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator s kill if it had the opportunity 123 ",
			"after": " Paleontologist Jack Horner has been a major advocate of the idea that Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all 69 124 125 though Horner himself has claimed that he never published this idea in the peer reviewed scientific literature and used it mainly as a tool to teach a popular audience particularly children the dangers of making assumptions in science such as assuming T rex was a hunter without using evidence 126 Nevertheless Horner presented several arguments in the popular literature to support the pure scavenger hypothesis ",
