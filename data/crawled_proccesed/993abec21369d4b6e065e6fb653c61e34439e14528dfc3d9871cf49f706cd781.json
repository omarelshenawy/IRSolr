			"previous": " The Euclidean distance between two objects may also be generalized to the case where the objects are no longer points but are higher dimensional manifolds such as space curves so in addition to talking about distance between two points one can discuss concepts of distance between two strings Since the new objects that are dealt with are extended objects not points anymore additional concepts such as non extensibility curvature constraints and non local interactions that enforce non crossing become central to the notion of distance The distance between the two manifolds is the scalar quantity that results from minimizing the generalized distance functional which represents a transformation between the two manifolds ",
