			"previous": " The first working steam powered vehicle was designed and most likely built by Ferdinand Verbiest a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672 It was a 65 cm long scale model toy for the Chinese Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger 8 20 21 It is not known if Verbiest s model was ever built 21 ",
			"after": " Nicolas Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full scale self propelled mechanical vehicle or automobile in about 1769 he created a steam powered tricycle 22 He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts 23 His inventions were however handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure 23 In 1801 Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam powered road vehicle It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use ",
