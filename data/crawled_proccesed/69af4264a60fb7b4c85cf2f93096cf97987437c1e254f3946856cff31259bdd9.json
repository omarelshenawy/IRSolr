			"after": " Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by Louisa Marchioness of Waterford Maria La Touche a minor Irish poet and novelist asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858 Rose La Touche was ten Ruskin nearly 39 Ruskin gradually fell in love with her Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin s own religious faith was under strain This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting 140 Ruskin s love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him and always a source of anxiety 141 Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867 but she asked him to wait three years for an answer until she was 21 A chance meeting at the Royal Academy in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter She finally rejected him in 1872 but they still occasionally met for the final time on 15 February 1875 After a long illness she died on 25 May 1875 at the age of 27 These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions The first of these had occurred in 1871 at Matlock Derbyshire a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels whose flora fauna and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature Ruskin turned to spiritualism and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose ",
