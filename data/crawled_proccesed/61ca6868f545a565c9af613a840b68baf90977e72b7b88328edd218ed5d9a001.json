			"previous": " One famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is Chichen Itza Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus s appearances in the sky 69 These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl 70 Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza ",
			"after": " The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan This means that the building s alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky when it coincides with the rainy season may be meaningful 71 Aveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol 72 This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building s upper platform were painted black and red These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star 73 However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots making them poor at letting light in but providing a suitable place to view out 74 ",
