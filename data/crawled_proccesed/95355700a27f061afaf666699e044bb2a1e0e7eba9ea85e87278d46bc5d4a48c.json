			"after": " The video starts off with a blue monitor screen with an eye showing the inscription Welcome 41 The video progresses inside a blue space ship style room with Madonna lying prostrate in what seems to be a scientific experiment The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism 41 The video progresses into a sequence of dreams containing varied surrealistic mystic new age Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower and images of a woman with long hair an alchemist type man holding a cube with Madonna s face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers Some scenes were inspired by the 1969 Armenian film The Color of Pomegranates 42 The dream sequence progresses with surreal and unusual clips including Madonna in a pool with half shown skulls A scene in which Madonna dressed in a light dressing gown gives birth to doves can also be seen the image has been compared to the work of Ren Magritte and Frida Kahlo s 1932 painting My Birth 40 Suddenly she floats down a corridor in a white gown until she appears in a black and white projection in a cinema like room As the music gets more dramatic the dream grows intense with images of skulls and scars appearing and the singer can be seen wading through space A scene in which Madonna s eyes are replaced with her mouth and her mouth with an eye precedes the ending influenced by the work of Frida Kahlo in which she wakes up and looks out ",
