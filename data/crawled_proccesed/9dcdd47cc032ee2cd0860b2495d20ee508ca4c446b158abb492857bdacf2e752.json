			"previous": " The orthogonality properties of the eigenvectors allows decoupling of the differential equations so that the system can be represented as linear summation of the eigenvectors The eigenvalue problem of complex structures is often solved using finite element analysis but neatly generalize the solution to scalar valued vibration problems ",
			"after": " In image processing processed images of faces can be seen as vectors whose components are the brightnesses of each pixel 32 The dimension of this vector space is the number of pixels The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix associated with a large set of normalized pictures of faces are called eigenfaces this is an example of principal components analysis They are very useful for expressing any face image as a linear combination of some of them In the facial recognition branch of biometrics eigenfaces provide a means of applying data compression to faces for identification purposes Research related to eigen vision systems determining hand gestures has also been made ",
