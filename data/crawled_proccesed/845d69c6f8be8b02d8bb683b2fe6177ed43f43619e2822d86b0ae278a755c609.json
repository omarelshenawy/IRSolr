			"after": " A set T of sentences is called a first order theory A theory is satisfiable if it has a model i e a structure of the appropriate signature which satisfies all the sentences in the set T Consistency of a theory is usually defined in a syntactical way but in first order logic by the completeness theorem there is no need to distinguish between satisfiability and consistency Therefore model theorists often use consistent as a synonym for satisfiable ",
