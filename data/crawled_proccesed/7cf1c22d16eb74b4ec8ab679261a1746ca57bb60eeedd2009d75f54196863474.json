			"previous": " In 1843 the Padarn Railway become the first quarry railway to use steam locomotives and the transport of slate by train rather than by ship was made easier when the London and North Western Railway built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852 26 The Corris Railway opened as the horse worked Corris Machynlleth River Dovey Tramroad in 1859 connecting the slate quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni with wharves on the estuary of the River Dyfi 32 The Ffestiniog Railway converted to steam in 1863 and the Talyllyn Railway was opened in 1866 to serve the Bryn Eglwys quarry above the village of Abergynolwyn Bryn Eglwys grew to be one of the largest quarries in mid Wales employing 300 men and producing 30 of the total output of the Corris district 33 The Cardigan Railway was opened in 1873 partly to carry slate traffic and enabled the Glogue quarry in Pembrokeshire to grow to employ 80 men 34 ",
			"after": " Mechanization was gradually introduced to make most aspects of the industry more efficient particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north and therefore easier to work by machine The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860 powered by a single line shaft running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing planing and dressing 35 In 1859 J W Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate 36 The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization and continued to be done with a mallet and chisel An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of slab thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes for example flooring tombstones and billiard tables 2 ",
