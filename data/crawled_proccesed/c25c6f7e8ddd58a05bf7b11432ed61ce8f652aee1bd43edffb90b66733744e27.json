			"previous": " Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other s and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin skinned though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness while Sullivan eschewed conflict 75 In addition Gilbert imbued his libretti with topsy turvy situations in which the social order was turned upside down After a time these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan s desire for realism and emotional content 76 Also Gilbert s political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage 77 ",
			"after": " Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore which were less successful than the seven other operas from H M S Pinafore to The Gondoliers Sullivan asked to leave the partnership saying that he found Gilbert s plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him While the two artists worked out their differences Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works On each occasion after a few months pause Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan s objections and the partnership was able to continue successfully 8 ",
