			"previous": " Bacon s relationships prior to Dyer had all been with older men who were as tumultuous in temperament as the artist himself but each had been the dominating presence Peter Lacy his first lover would often tear up the young artist s paintings beat him up in drunken rages and leave him on the street half conscious 9 Bacon was attracted to Dyer s vulnerability and trusting nature Dyer was impressed by Bacon s self confidence and his artistic success and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man 10 Dyer was like Bacon a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance Pale faced and a chain smoker Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality the art critic Michael Peppiatt described him as having the air of a man who could land a decisive punch Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair and by 1970 Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk 10 ",
			"after": " As Bacon s work moved from the extreme subject matter of his early paintings to portraits of friends in the mid 1960s Dyer became a dominating presence in the artist s work 11 Bacon s treatment of his lover in these canvasses emphasises his subject s physicality while remaining uncharacteristically tender More than any other of the artist s close friends portrayed during this period Dyer came to feel inseparable from his effigies The paintings gave him stature a raison d etre and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer s brief interlude between life and death 12 Many critics have cited Dyer s portraits as favourites including Michel Leiris and Lawrence Gowling Yet as Dyer s novelty diminished within Bacon s circle of sophisticated intellectuals the younger man became increasingly bitter and ill at ease Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him he did not pretend to understand or even like them All that money an I fink they re reely orrible he observed with choked pride 13 He abandoned crime but soon descended into alcoholism Bacon s money allowed Dyer to attract hangers on who would accompany him on massive benders around London s Soho Withdrawn and reserved when sober Dyer was insuppressible when drunk and would often attempt to pull a Bacon by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle Dyer s erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin with his cronies with Bacon and with Bacon s friends Most of Bacon s art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance an intrusion into the world of high culture to which their Bacon belonged 14 Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent By 1971 he was drinking alone and was only in occasional contact with his former lover ",
