			"after": " When the Sun is shining its apparent position in the sky moves during a day reflecting the rotation of the Earth Shadows cast by stationary objects move correspondingly so their positions can be used to indicate the time of day A sundial shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a usually flat surface which has markings that correspond to the hours 7 Sundials can be horizontal vertical or in other orientations Sundials were widely used in ancient times 8 With the knowledge of latitude a well constructed sundial can measure local solar time with reasonable accuracy within a minute or two Sundials continued to be used to monitor the performance of clocks until the modern era citation needed However practical limitations such as that sundials work only when the Sun shines and never during the night encouraged the use of other techniques for measuring and displaying time ",
