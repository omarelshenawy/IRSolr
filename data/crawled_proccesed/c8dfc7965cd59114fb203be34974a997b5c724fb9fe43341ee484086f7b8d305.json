			"previous": " The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain Physically objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing Some objects not only reflect light but also transmit light or emit light themselves which also contribute to the color A viewer s perception of the object s color depends not only on the spectrum of the light leaving its surface but also on a host of contextual cues so that color differences between objects can be discerned mostly independent of the lighting spectrum viewing angle etc This effect is known as color constancy ",
