			"previous": " A lineman s handset is a telephone designed for testing the telephone network and may be attached directly to aerial lines and other infrastructure components  At the same time the DC voltage across the line causes a DC current which is split between the resistor coil A8 A3 branch and the microphone coil A2 A3 branch The DC current through the resistor coil branch has no effect on the incoming audio signal But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC current in response to voice sounds which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil s A3 primary winding which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding This causes a small portion of the microphone output to be fed back to the speaker while the rest of the AC current goes out through the phone line ",
