			"previous": " All modern Thoroughbreds trace back to three stallions imported into England from the Middle East in the late 17th and early 18th centuries the Byerley Turk 1680s the Darley Arabian 1704 and the Godolphin Arabian 1729 17 18 Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed These included the Alcock s Arabian 19 D Arcy s White Turk Leedes Arabian and Curwen s Bay Barb 20 21 notes 1 Another was the Brownlow Turk who among other attributes is thought to be largely responsible for the gray coat color in Thoroughbreds 19 In all about 160 stallions of Oriental breeding have been traced in the historical record as contributing to the creation of the Thoroughbred The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines whether Arabian Barb or Turk to the native English mares 22 ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book GSB in 1791 and the practice of official registration of horses 12 According to Peter Willett about 50 of the foundation stallions appear to have been of Arabian bloodlines with the remainder being evenly divided between Turkoman and Barb breeding 22 notes 2 ",
