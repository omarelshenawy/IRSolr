			"after": " The Great Depression of the 1930s caused a near collapse of the colonial economy as British demand for timber plummeted The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a devastating hurricane that struck the colony in 1931 Perceptions of the government s relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalise labour unions or introduce a minimum wage Economic conditions improved during World War II as many Belizean men entered the armed forces or otherwise contributed to the war effort ",
