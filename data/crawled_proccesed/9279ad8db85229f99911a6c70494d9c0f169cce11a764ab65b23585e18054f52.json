			"previous": " The fuselage was monocoque built from sheets of plywood skinned over wooden ribs Using a large concrete mold a single half of the fuselage shell was laminated in sections with glue and then a rubber bladder was lowered into the mold and inflated with air to compress the lamination into shape Two fuselage halves were then nailed and glued over a previously made rib framework With the fuselage constructed in this fashion the wing spar had to be kept clear so a single spar cantilever was mounted atop the aircraft The only part of the aircraft that was not very streamlined was the landing gear although production versions wore sleek spats It was powered by the Wright Whirlwind which delivered 225 horsepower 168 kW ",
