			"previous": " Also during this period Gilbert wrote his most successful comic play Engaged 1877 which inspired Oscar Wilde s The Importance of Being Earnest Engaged is a parody of romantic drama written in the topsy turvy satiric style of many of Gilbert s Bab Ballads and the Savoy Operas with one character pledging his love in the most poetic and romantic language possible to every single woman in the play the innocent Scottish rustics being revealed to be making a living through throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services and in general romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain Engaged continues to be performed today by both professional and amateur companies 54 ",
			"after": " Carte finally assembled a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company to launch a series of original English comic operas beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan The Sorcerer in November 1877 This work was a modest success 26 and H M S Pinafore followed in May 1878 Despite a slow start mainly due to a scorching summer Pinafore became a red hot favourite by autumn After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes intending to mount a rival production The attempt was repelled by stagehands and others at the theatre loyal to Carte and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed D Oyly Carte Opera Company 55 Indeed Pinafore was so successful that over a hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone Gilbert Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas without success 56 ",
