			"previous": " Microwave heating technologies are based on the same principles as radio wave heating although it is believed that radio wave heating is an improvement over microwave heating because its energy can penetrate farther into the oil shale formation 58 The microwave heating process was tested by Global Resource Corporation 59 Electro Petroleum proposes electrically enhanced oil recovery by the passage of direct current between cathodes in producing wells and anodes located either at the surface or at depth in other wells The passage of the current through the oil shale formation results in resistive Joule heating 10 ",
			"after": " The dominant question for shale oil production is under what conditions shale oil is economically viable According to the United States Department of Energy the capital costs of a 100 000 barrels per day 16 000 m3 d ex situ processing complex are 3 10 billion 60 The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the shale oil production cost in a given region is lower than the price of petroleum or its other substitutes According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation the cost of producing shale oil at a hypothetical surface retorting complex in the United States comprising a mine retorting plant upgrading plant supporting utilities and spent oil shale reclamation would be in a range of US 70 95 per barrel 440 600 m3 adjusted to 2005 values Assuming a gradual increase in output after the start of commercial production the analysis projects a gradual reduction in processing costs to 30 40 per barrel 190 250 m3 after achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels 160 10 6 m3 8 28 The United States Department of Energy estimates that the ex situ processing would be economic at sustained average world oil prices above US 54 per barrel and in situ processing would be economic at prices above 35 per barrel These estimates assume a return rate of 15 60 Royal Dutch Shell announced in 2006 that its Shell ICP technology would realize a profit when crude oil prices are higher than 30 per barrel 190 m3 while some technologies at full scale production assert profitability at oil prices even lower than 20 per barrel 130 m3 11 61 ",
