			"previous": " From the 1920s Australia s defence thinking was dominated by the so called Singapore strategy This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region To this end a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased 73 At the outbreak of war the Australian forces in Malaya comprised the 8th Division less the 23rd Brigade under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett four RAAF squadrons and eight warships 74 The RAAF became the first service to see action in the Pacific when Australian aircraft shadowing the Japanese invasion convoy bound for Malaya were fired at on 6 December 1941 Australian units participated in the unsuccessful Commonwealth attempts to defeat the Japanese landings with RAAF aircraft attacking the beachheads and Vampire accompanying the British battleship Prince of Wales and battlecruiser Repulse during their failed attempt to attack the Japanese invasion fleet 75 ",
			"after": " The 8th Division and its attached Indian Army units was assigned responsibility for the defence of Johor in the south of Malaya and did not see action until mid January 1942 when Japanese spearheads first reached the state The division s first engagement was the Battle of Muar in which the Japanese Twenty Fifth Army was able to outflank the Commonwealth positions due to Bennett misdeploying the forces under his command so that the weak Indian 45th Brigade was assigned the crucial coastal sector and the stronger Australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas While the Commonwealth forces in Johore achieved a number of local victories they were unable to do more than slow the Japanese advance and suffered heavy casualties After being outmanoeuvred by the Japanese the remaining Commonwealth units withdrew to Singapore on the night of 30 31 January 76 ",
