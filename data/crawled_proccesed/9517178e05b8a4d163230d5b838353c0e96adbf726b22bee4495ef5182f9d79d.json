			"previous": " As a result Ford s cars came off the line in fifteen minute intervals much faster than previous methods increasing productivity eightfold while using less manpower from 12 5 man hours to 1 hour 33 minutes 34 It was so successful paint became a bottleneck Only Japan black would dry fast enough forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914 until fast drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926 This is the source of Ford s apocryphal remark any color as long as it s black 34 In 1914 an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months pay 34 ",
			"after": " Ford s complex safety procedures especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about dramatically reduced the rate of injury The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called Fordism and was copied by most major industries The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods ",
