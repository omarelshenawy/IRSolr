			"previous": " In 1970 British surgeon Thomas E A Stowell published an article entitled Jack the Ripper A Solution in the November issue of The Criminologist In the article Stowell proposed that the Ripper was an aristocrat who had contracted syphilis during a visit to the West Indies that it had driven him insane and that in this state of mind he had perpetrated the five canonical Jack the Ripper murders 7 Although Stowell did not directly name his suspect in the article he described in detail the suspect s family and his physical appearance and nicknames all of which pointed to Queen Victoria s grandson Prince Albert Victor Duke of Clarence and Avondale 8 9 Stowell wrote that following a double murder on 30 September 1888 his suspect was restrained by his own family in an institution in the south of England but later escaped to commit a final murder on 9 November before ultimately dying of syphilis To back up his theory Stowell drew comparisons between the evisceration of the women and the disembowelment of deer shot by the aristocracy on their estates 7 Stowell said his information came from the private notes of Sir William Gull a reputable physician who had treated members of the royal family 7 Stowell knew Gull s son in law Theodore Dyke Acland and was an executor of Acland s estate 10 ",
