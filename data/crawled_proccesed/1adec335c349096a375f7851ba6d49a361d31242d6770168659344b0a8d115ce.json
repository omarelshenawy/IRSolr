			"after": " Dade County was once covered in 186 000 acres 750 km2 of pine rockland forests but most of it was harvested by the lumber industry 29 Pineland ecosystems or pine rocklands are characterized by shallow dry sandy loam over a limestone substrate covered almost exclusively by slash pines Pinus elliottii var densa Trees in this ecosystem grow in solution holes where the soft limestone has worn away and filled with soil allowing plants to take hold 30 Pinelands require regular maintenance by fire to ensure their existence South Florida slash pines are uniquely adapted to promote fire by dropping a large amount of dried pine needles and shedding dry bark Pine cones require heat from fires to open allowing seeds to disperse and take hold The trunks and roots of slash pines however are resistant to fire Prescribed burns in these areas take place every three to seven years without regular fires hardwood trees begin to grow in this region and pinelands become recategorized as mixed swamp forests 31 Most plants in the area bloom about 16 weeks after a fire 32 Nearly all pinelands have an understory of palm shrubs and a diverse ground covering of wild herbs 31 ",
