			"previous": " During World War II the Uranium Committee of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development OSRD sponsored an intensive research project on plutonium The research contract was awarded to scientists at the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory Met Lab At the time plutonium was a rare element that had only recently been isolated in a University of California laboratory The Met Lab researchers worked on producing chain reacting piles of uranium to convert it to plutonium and finding ways to separate plutonium from uranium The program was accelerated in 1942 as the United States government became concerned that scientists in Nazi Germany were developing a nuclear weapons program 19 ",
			"after": " In September 1942 the Army Corps of Engineers placed the newly formed Manhattan Project under the command of General Leslie R Groves charging him with the construction of industrial size plants for manufacturing plutonium and uranium 12 Groves recruited the DuPont Company to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex DuPont recommended that it be located far away from the existing uranium production facility at Oak Ridge Tennessee The ideal site was described by these criteria 20 ",
