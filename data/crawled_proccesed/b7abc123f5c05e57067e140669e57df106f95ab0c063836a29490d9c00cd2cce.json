			"after": " The 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large 61 Although technical problems occurred they were relatively minor and quickly solved 62 After the aircraft s introduction with Pan Am other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service 63 Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft s long range rather than its payload capacity 64 65 While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined A moderately loaded 747 one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747 66 ",
