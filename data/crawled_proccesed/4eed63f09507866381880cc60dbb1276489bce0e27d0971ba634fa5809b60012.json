			"after": " The artificial propagation of American paddlefish began with the efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery 31 However it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States 31 Artificial propagation requires broodstock which because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment 32 The fish are injected with LH RH hormone to stimulate spawning The number of eggs a female may produce depends on the size of the fish and can range anywhere from 70 000 300 000 eggs Unlike most teleosts the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries rather they open dorsally into the body cavity In order to determine status of progression toward maturation ova staging is performed The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity 31 ",
