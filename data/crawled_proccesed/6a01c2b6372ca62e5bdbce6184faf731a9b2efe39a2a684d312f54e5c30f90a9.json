			"previous": " Annual variations in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios since loggerheads have temperature dependent sex determination High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios in favor of females Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures over a three year period produced 87 99 females 83 This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction 84 A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings which reduce sun exposure lowering the average sand temperature which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles 61 ",
			"after": " Since the loggerhead occupies such a broad range successful conservation requires efforts from multiple countries 9  Loggerhead sea turtles are classified as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species making international trade illegal 9 In the United States the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service classify them as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act 9 Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Queensland s Nature Conservation Act 1992 The Convention on Migratory Species works for the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa as well as in the Indian Ocean and southeast Asia 85 86 Throughout Japan the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles 87 Greece s ARCHELON works for their conservation 88 The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead conservation in Oman 89 Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems also protects them 9 90 Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices TEDs to exclude even the largest turtles TEDs are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers 9 ",
