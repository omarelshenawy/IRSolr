			"previous": " Low voltage circuit breakers are also made for direct current DC applications such as DC for subway lines Direct current requires special breakers because the arc is continuous unlike an AC arc which tends to go out on each half cycle A direct current circuit breaker has blow out coils that generate a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc Small circuit breakers are either installed directly in equipment or are arranged in a breaker panel ",
			"after": " The DIN rail mounted thermal magnetic miniature circuit breaker is the most common style in modern domestic consumer units and commercial electrical distribution boards throughout Europe The design includes the following components ",
