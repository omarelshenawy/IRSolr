			"previous": " Magma sitting in an underground chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallising out The effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases mostly steam and carbon dioxide in the remaining liquid magma making the subsequent eruption more violent As gas rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption the huge drop in pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock which drops to zero at the surface causes the gases to come out of solution the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma Additionally the removal of the lower melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous adding to the explosive nature of the eruption ",
			"after": " The government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 VEI 4 60 one In this scenario the slopes of the mountain extending out to about 7 kilometres 4 3 mi from the vent may be exposed to pyroclastic flows sweeping down them whilst much of the surrounding area could suffer from tephra falls Because of prevailing winds towns to the south and east of the volcano are most at risk from this and it is assumed that tephra accumulation exceeding 100 kg m at which point people are at risk from collapsing roofs may extend out as far as Avellino to the east or Salerno to the south east Towards Naples to the north west this tephra fall hazard is assumed to extend barely past the slopes of the volcano 59 The specific areas actually affected by the ash cloud will depend upon the particular circumstances surrounding the eruption ",
