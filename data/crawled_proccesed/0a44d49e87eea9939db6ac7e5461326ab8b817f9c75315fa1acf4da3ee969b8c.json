			"after": " An explanation for why polygynous systems persist is explained by the polygyny threshold model This model demonstrates the link between female reproductive success and territory quality or the quality of a breeding situation 4 The polygyny threshold model also shows the effects of female reproductive success when multiple females in the same territory mate with one male In this situation the female has the option of breeding with an unmated male in a poor quality territory or with an already mated male in a high quality territory The second breeding female will receive fewer resources from the male than the first breeding female However if the bigamous threshold is higher than the second female s original resource threshold the female will enter into a polygynous mating system since she would still benefit from acquiring more resources The polygyny threshold model can be applied to more than two females provided there are enough resources to support them 4 ",
