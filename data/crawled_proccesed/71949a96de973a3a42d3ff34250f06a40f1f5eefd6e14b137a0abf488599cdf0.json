			"previous": " The definitive short fuselage DC 8 with the same engine that powered the vast majority of 707s the JT3D Fourteen earlier DC 8s were converted to this standard All but the 55 were certified in 1961 The DC 8 51 DC 8 52 and DC 8 53 all had 17 000 lb 76 1 kN JT3D 1 or 18 000 lb 80 6 kN JT3D 3B engines varying mainly in their weights 276 000 pounds 125 200 kg 300 000 pounds 136 100 kg and 315 000 pounds 142 900 kg respectively The DC 8 55 arrived in June 1964 retaining the JT3D 3B engines but with strengthened structure from the freighter versions and 325 000 pound 147 420 kg maximum weight 88 DC 8 50s were built plus the 14 converted from Series 10 30 citation needed ",
			"after": " The DC 8 71 to DC 8 73 were straightforward conversions of the 61 to 63 replacing the JT3D engines with more fuel efficient 22 000 lb 98 5 kN CFM56 2 high bypass turbofans in new housings built by Grumman along with new engine pylons and fairing of the air intakes below the nose The DC 8 71 achieved the same end but required more modification because the 61 did not have the improved wings and relocated engines of the 62 and 63 Maximum takeoff weights remained the same but there was a slight reduction in payload because of the heavier engines All three models were certified in 1982 and a total of 110 60 Series DC 8s were converted by the time the program ended in 1988 citation needed ",
