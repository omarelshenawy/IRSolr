			"previous": " Domesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more groups of sows or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females 43 Groups of boars may also get along provided their cage has enough space they are introduced at an early age and no females are present 44 Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between 42 Activity is scattered randomly over the day aside from avoidance of intense light no regular circadian patterns are apparent 42 ",
			"after": " Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot ulcerative pododermatitis 45 Cubes and Coroplast or C C style cages are now a common choice 46 Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material Bedding made from red cedar Eastern or Western and pine both softwoods were commonly used in the past but these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols aromatic hydrocarbons and oils 47 Safer beddings made from hardwoods such as aspen paper products and corn cob materials are other alternatives 47 Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces making it difficult to remove 48 After its cage has been cleaned a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory 49 Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages ",
