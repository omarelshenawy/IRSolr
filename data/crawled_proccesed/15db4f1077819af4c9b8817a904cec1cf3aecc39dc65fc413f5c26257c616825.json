			"previous": " The A340 is a low wing cantilever monoplane the wing itself is virtually identical to that of the A330 The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency 57 Nb 1 The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and along with other design features allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0 86 59 60 The wing has a very high thickness to chord ratio of 12 8 per cent which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty 61 For comparison the rival MD 11 has a thickness to chord ratio of 8 9 per cent 61 Each wing also has a 2 74 m 9 0 ft tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft 62 The failure of International Aero Engines radical ultra high bypass V2500 SuperFan which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340 led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate 62 63 Originally designed with a 56 m 184 ft span the wing was later extended to 58 6 m 192 ft and finally to 60 3 m 198 ft 62 At 60 3 m 198 ft the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747 200 but with 35 percent less wing area 59 60 ",
			"after": " The flight deck of the A340 is a glass cockpit based upon the control systems first used on the smaller A320 Instead of a conventional control yoke the flight deck features side stick controls The main instrument panel is dominated by a total of six cathode ray tube monitors which display information to the flight crew on later aircraft these monitors have been replaced by liquid crystal displays 54 Flight information is directed via the Electronic Flight Instrument System EFIS and systems information through the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor ECAM 64 65 The aircraft monitoring system is connected to various sensors throughout the aircraft and automatically alerts the crew to any parameters detected outside of their normal range pilots can also manually inspect systems of their choosing at any time The information display system is designed to be easily interpreted and give a clear picture of the aircraft s operational status 54 Instead of paper manuals electronic CD ROM based manuals are used Airbus offers web based updates to electronic documentation as an option 66 ",
