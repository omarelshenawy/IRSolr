			"previous": " In addition to the compounds where a noble gas atom is involved in a covalent bond noble gases also form non covalent compounds The clathrates first described in 1949 42 consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances The essential condition for their formation is that the guest noble gas atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice For instance argon krypton and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained 43 Neon argon krypton and xenon also form clathrate hydrates where the noble gas is trapped in ice 44 ",
			"after": " Noble gases can form endohedral fullerene compounds in which the noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule In 1993 it was discovered that when C 60 a spherical molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms is exposed to noble gases at high pressure complexes such as He C 60 can be formed the notation indicates He is contained inside C 60 but not covalently bound to it 45 As of 2008 endohedral complexes with helium neon argon krypton and xenon have been obtained 46 These compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of the noble gas atom 47 ",
