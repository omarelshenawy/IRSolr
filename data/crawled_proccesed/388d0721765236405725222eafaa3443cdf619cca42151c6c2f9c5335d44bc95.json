			"previous": " Firearms are qualitatively different from earlier weapons because they release energy from combustible propellants such as gunpowder rather than from a counter weight or spring This energy is released very rapidly and can be replicated without much effort by the user Therefore even early firearms such as the arquebus were much more powerful than human powered weapons Firearms became increasingly important and effective during the 16th century to 19th century with progressive improvements in ignition mechanisms followed by revolutionary changes in ammunition handling and propellant During the U S Civil War various technologies including the machine gun and ironclad warship emerged that would be recognizable and useful military weapons today particularly in limited conflicts In the 19th century warship propulsion changed from sail power to fossil fuel powered steam engines ",
			"after": " The age of edged weapons ended abruptly just before World War I with rifled artillery Howitzers were able to destroy masonry fortresses and other fortifications This single invention caused a Revolution in Military Affairs RMA and established tactics and doctrine that are still in use today See Technology during World War I for a detailed discussion ",
