			"previous": " The number of cross border railways expanded with the passing of the 1922 Border Railways Act 42 with the Benalla Yarrawonga branch line extended to Oaklands in 1938 both lines meeting standard gauge lines that were subsequently closed Victorian Railways commenced construction of a railway from Robinvale to Koorakee and Lette in New South Wales in 1924 the Lette railway line but this railway was never completed The Murray River bridge between Robinvale and Euston was instead converted to a road bridge which will be demolished when the new road bridge currently under construction is completed The Stony Crossing railway line was built from Kerang to Murrabit in 1924 and Stony Crossing originally called Poonboon in 1928 under an agreement with New South Wales 43 No passenger services were carried on the section beyond Murrabit after 1932 and it was closed about 1943 44 ",
