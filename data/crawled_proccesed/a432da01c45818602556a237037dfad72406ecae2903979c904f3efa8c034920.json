			"previous": " Amtrak inherited problems with train stations most notably deferred maintenance and redundant facilities resulting from competing companies that served the same areas On the day it started Amtrak was given the responsibility of rerouting passenger trains from the seven train terminals in Chicago LaSalle Dearborn Grand Central Randolph Chicago Northwestern Terminal Central and Union into just one Union Station In New York City Amtrak had to pay to maintain Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal because of the lack of track connections to bring trains from upstate New York into Penn Station a problem not rectified until the building of the Empire Connection in 1991 ",
			"after": " In many cases Amtrak had to abandon service into large Union Stations and Central Terminals routing trains into smaller Amtrak built facilities down the line jokingly referred as Amshacks due to their basic design In later years Amtrak has pushed to start reusing some older stations that can be salvaged Stations such as Cincinnati Union Terminal Kansas City Union Station and St Paul Union Depot have since had Amtrak passenger service restored Stations like Buffalo Central Terminal and Michigan Central Station continue to wait and stations such as St Louis and Houston have found other uses or have been demolished ",
