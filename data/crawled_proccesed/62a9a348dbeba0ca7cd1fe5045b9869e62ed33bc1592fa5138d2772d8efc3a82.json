			"previous": " At the turn of the 20th century soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought prosperity to the Brazilian economy 11 The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a naval building program in 1904 2 which authorized the construction of a large number of warships including three battleships 12 13 The Minister of the Navy Admiral J lio C sar de Noronha signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906 14 The new dreadnought battleship design which debuted in December 1906 with the completion of the namesake ship rendered the Brazilian ships and all other existing capital ships obsolete 15 The money authorized for naval expansion was redirected by the new Minister of the Navy Rear Admiral Alexandrino Fario de Alencar to building two dreadnoughts with plans for a third dreadnought after the first was completed two scout cruisers which became the Bahia class ten destroyers the Par class and three submarines 16 17 The three battleships on which construction had just begun were scrapped beginning on 7 January 1907 and the design of the new dreadnoughts was approved by the Brazilians on 20 February 1907 15 In South America the ships came as a shock and kindled a naval arms race among Brazil Argentina and Chile The 1902 treaty between the latter two was canceled upon the Brazilian dreadnought order so both could be free to build their own dreadnoughts 8 ",
			"after": " Minas Geraes the lead ship was laid down by Armstrong on 17 April 1907 while S o Paulo followed thirteen days later at Vickers 2 4 18 The news shocked Brazil s neighbors especially Argentina whose Minister of Foreign Affairs remarked that either Minas Geraes or S o Paulo could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets 19 In addition Brazil s order meant that they had laid down a dreadnought before many of the other major maritime powers such as Germany France or Russia E and the two ships made Brazil just the third country to have dreadnoughts under construction behind the United Kingdom and the United States 11 21 Newspapers and journals around the world particularly in Britain and Germany speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful warships 2 22 Despite this the United States actively attempted to court Brazil as an ally caught up in the spirit U S naval journals began using terms like Pan Americanism and Hemispheric Cooperation 2 ",
