			"after": " The common firecrest is monogamous The male sings during the breeding season often with its crest raised and has a display which involves pointing its bill at another bird showing the crest and strong face pattern This differs from the display of the plainer faced goldcrest which bows its head to emphasise the crest The breeding territory is about 0 5 hectares 1 2 acres and may overlap with neighbouring goldcrest territories Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests with the crest raised and a great deal of wing fluttering 26 but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between the species and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other 27 in other circumstances the two kinglets learned to ignore each other s songs In his courtship display the male firecrest raises his crest points it towards his mate and hovers over her before mating takes place 26 ",
