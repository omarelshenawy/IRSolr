			"previous": " In many real world situations the act of weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used This is usually referred to as the apparent weight of the object A common example of this is the effect of buoyancy when an object is immersed in a fluid the displacement of the fluid will cause an upward force on the object making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale 16 The apparent weight may be similarly affected by levitation and mechanical suspension When the gravitational definition of weight is used the operational weight measured by an accelerating scale is often also referred to as the apparent weight 17 ",
			"after": " In modern scientific usage weight and mass are fundamentally different quantities mass is an extrinsic extensive property of matter whereas weight is a force that results from the action of gravity on matter it measures how strongly the force of gravity pulls on that matter However in most practical everyday situations the word weight is used when strictly mass is meant 4 18 For example most people would say that an object weighs one kilogram even though the kilogram is a unit of mass ",
