			"previous": " Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition which took place in London in 1936 In 1937 Roland Penrose purchased an abstract Mother and Child in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings ",
			"after": " At the outbreak of the Second World War the Chelsea School of Art was evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post During the war Moore produced powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from the Blitz 16 Kenneth Clark the chairman of the War Artists Advisory Committee WAAC had previously tried to recruit Moore as a full time salaried war artist and now agreed to purchase some of the shelter drawings and issued contracts for further examples The shelter drawings WAAC acquired were completed between the autumn of 1940 and the spring of 1941 and are regarded as among the finest products of the WAAC scheme 17 In August 1941 WAAC commissioned Moore to draw miners working underground at the Wheldale Colliery in Yorkshire where his father had worked at the start of the century Whereas Moore drew the people in the shelters as passively waiting the all clear he shows the miners aggressively working the coal faces 18 These drawings helped to boost Moore s international reputation particularly in America where examples were included in the WAAC Britain at War exhibition which toured North America throughout the war 17 ",
