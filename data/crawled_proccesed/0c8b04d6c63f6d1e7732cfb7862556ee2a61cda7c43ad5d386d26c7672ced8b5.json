			"after": " During his Increment Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian built Orlan M spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev All three crewmembers of expedition EO 23 performed a fly around in the Soyuz spacecraft first undocking from one docking port of the station then manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location This made Linenger the first American to undock from a space station aboard two different spacecraft Space Shuttle and Soyuz 20 ",
