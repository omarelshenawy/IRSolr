			"after": " The Wankel engine is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion Over the commonly used reciprocating piston designs the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity smoothness compactness high revolutions per minute and a high power to weight ratio The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine although this name applies also to other completely different designs All parts rotate moving in one direction as opposed to the common piston engine which has pistons violently changing direction The four stroke cycle occurs in a moving combustion chamber between the inside of an oval like epitrochoid shaped housing and a rotor that is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter ",
