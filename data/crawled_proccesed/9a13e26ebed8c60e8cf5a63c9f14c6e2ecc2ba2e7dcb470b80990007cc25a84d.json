			"previous": " Bin Laden who orchestrated the attacks initially denied but later admitted involvement 1 13 14 Al Jazeera broadcast a statement by bin Laden on September 16 2001 stating I stress that I have not carried out this act which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation 15 In November 2001 U S forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad Afghanistan In the tape bin Laden is seen talking to Khaled al Harbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks 16 On December 27 2001 a second bin Laden video was released In the video he said It has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam It is the hatred of crusaders Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel which kills our people We say that the end of the United States is imminent whether Bin Laden or his followers are alive or dead for the awakening of the Muslim umma nation has occurred but he stopped short of admitting responsibility for the attacks 17 The transcript references several times to the United States specifically targeting Muslims ",
			"after": " Shortly before the U S presidential election in 2004 in a taped statement bin Laden publicly acknowledged al Qaeda s involvement in the attacks on the U S and admitted his direct link to the attacks He said that the attacks were carried out because we are free and want to regain freedom for our nation As you undermine our security we undermine yours 18 Bin Laden said he had personally directed his followers to attack the World Trade Center 14 19 Another video obtained by Al Jazeera in September 2006 shows bin Laden with Ramzi bin al Shibh as well as two hijackers Hamza al Ghamdi and Wail al Shehri as they make preparations for the attacks 20 The U S never formally indicted bin Laden for the 9 11 attacks but he was on the FBI s Most Wanted List for the bombings of the U S Embassies in Dar es Salaam Tanzania and Nairobi Kenya 21 22 After a nearly 10 year manhunt bin Laden was killed by American special forces in a compound in Abbottabad Pakistan on May 2 2011 23 24 ",
