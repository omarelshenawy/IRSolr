			"previous": " Under the PHMC the museum was open ten months a year closing between early January and early March In 2007 and 2008 the number of visitors held steady after recent declines 93 According to the PHMC in fiscal 2007 08 total visitation was 1 705 with a paid visitation of 1 100 generating 4 125 in program revenue and 2 406 recreational and non ticketed visitors 94 The fiscal 2006 07 operations budget for the house and its two full time staff was 142 901 with 6 900 five percent coming from FJPH and the rest from the state of Pennsylvania 94 ",
			"after": " On March 4 2009 the PHMC released a report examining its 22 museums and historic sites and recommended discontinuing operations at six including the Joseph Priestley House The proposed closure of the Priestley House was based on low visitation and limited potential for growth 94 95 96 Despite public meetings protest letters and a general public outcry against closure 97 98 on August 14 2009 the state closed the Priestley House and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis 99 The sole remaining state employee at Priestley House was furloughed That month the Friends of the Joseph Priestley House submitted a plan to the PHMC to operate the house on weekends from May to October with staffing provided by volunteers The plan depended both on acquiring insurance for the volunteers the house and its contents and on the state passing a budget 100 ",
