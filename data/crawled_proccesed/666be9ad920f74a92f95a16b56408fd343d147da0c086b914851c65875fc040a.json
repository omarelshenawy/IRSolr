			"previous": " The Tomb of Antipope John XXIII in Florence is a grand Early Renaissance wall tomb by Donatello and Michelozzo although classical in style it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs It has a life size effigy lying on the sarcophagus which was common from the Romanesque period through to the Baroque and beyond 106 Ruling dynasties were often buried together usually in monasteries the Chartreuse de Champmol was founded for that purpose by the Valois Dukes of Burgundy in 1383 The Scaliger tombs in Verona are magnificent free standing Gothic canopied tombs they are outside the church in a special enclosure and so are unrestricted in height 107 Important churches like Saint Peter s in Rome Saint Paul s Cathedral London Santi Giovanni e Paolo Venice twenty five Doges and the Basilica of Santa Croce Florence contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good created by the finest architects and sculptors available Local parish churches are also often full of monuments which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use including their tombs in Catholic countries bequests would pay for masses to be said in perpetuity for their souls By the High Renaissance led by Michelangelo s tombs the effigies are often sitting up and later may stand Often they turn towards the altar or are kneeling facing it in profile 108 ",
			"after": " In the late Middle Ages influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb became common in northern Europe and may be found in some funerary art as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi or Art of Dying 109 It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini 1628 1647 where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope s name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy 110 As cities became more crowded bones were sometimes recovered after a period and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones ",
