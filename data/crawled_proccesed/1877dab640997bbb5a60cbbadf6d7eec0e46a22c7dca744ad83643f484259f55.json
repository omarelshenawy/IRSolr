			"after": " The same problems affect modern aircraft as well but are engineered to be less noticeable To start with improvements in materials and design has greatly improved the stiffness of the wing reducing the magnitude of the problem Once the plane is built and flown the flight control software is then adjusted to correct for the loss of control due to aeroelasticity However this simply hides the problem the aeroelasticity still exists and is affecting the overall control authority To correct this the flight controller uses more control input to offset any loss of effectiveness which increases the spanwise torque loads on the aircraft s wing ",
