			"previous": " Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars emphatic rhythms dense bass and drum sound and vigorous vocals Metal subgenres variously emphasize alter or omit one or more of these attributes New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes In the taxonomy of popular music heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard rock the breed with less syncopation less blues more showmanship and more brute force 6 The typical band lineup includes a drummer a bassist a rhythm guitarist a lead guitarist and a singer who may or may not be an instrumentalist Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound 7 ",
			"after": " The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal 8 The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion 9 With rhythm guitar parts the heavy crunch sound in heavy metal is created by palm muting the strings with the right hand and using distortion 10 Palm muting creates a tighter more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end 11 ",
