			"previous": " The Rodrigues solitaire probably became extinct sometime between the 1730s and 1760s the exact date is unknown Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750 traders burnt off vegetation hunted solitaires and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks 38 In 1755 Joseph Fran ois Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen as he had been assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island Though trying for 18 months and offering large rewards none could be found He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species but suspected that it was due to hunting by humans instead 38 Alexandre Guy Pingr did not encounter any solitaires when he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus although he had been assured they survived His friend Pierre Charles Le Monnier named the constellation Turdus Solitarius after the bird to commemorate the journey Although the Rodrigues solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation named for it celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked like and star maps depict other birds 29 ",
			"after": " In 1786 subfossil Rodrigues solitaire bones encrusted in stalagmite were discovered in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier about 1830 For unknown reasons he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius which caused confusion until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found to belong to the same species 39 These finds confirmed Leguat s descriptions but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens In 1831 a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires Rodrigues covers only 104 square kilometres 40 sq mi making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected 23 ",
