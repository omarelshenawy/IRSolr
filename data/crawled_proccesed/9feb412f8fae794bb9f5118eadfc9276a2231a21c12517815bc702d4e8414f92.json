			"previous": " As far back as the 3rd century BC Eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the Earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two different locations Alexandria and Syene modern day Aswan 29 Eratosthenes s results were confirmed by a comparison of stellar observations at Alexandria and Rhodes carried out by Posidonius in the 1st century BC These measurements were widely known among scholars but confusion about the old fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed had led in Columbus s day to some debate about the exact size of the Earth ",
			"after": " From d Ailly s Imago Mundi Columbus learned of Alfraganus s estimate that a degree of latitude or a degree of longitude along the equator spanned 56 miles but did not realize that this was expressed in the Arabic mile rather than the shorter Roman mile with which he was familiar 1 480 m 30 He therefore estimated the circumference of the Earth to be about 30 200 km whereas the correct value is 40 000 km 25 000 mi ",
