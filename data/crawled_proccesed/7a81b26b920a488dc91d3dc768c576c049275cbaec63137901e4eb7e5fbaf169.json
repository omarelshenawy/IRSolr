			"after": " Graph theory the study of graphs and networks is often considered part of combinatorics but has grown large enough and distinct enough with its own kind of problems to be regarded as a subject in its own right 17 Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human made structures They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical biological and social systems In computer science they can represent networks of communication data organization computational devices the flow of computation etc In mathematics they are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology e g knot theory Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory There are also continuous graphs however for the most part research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics ",
