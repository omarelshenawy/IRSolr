			"previous": " Some composers wrote their own libretti Richard Wagner is perhaps most famous in this regard with his transformations of Germanic legends and events into epic subjects for his operas and music dramas Hector Berlioz too wrote the libretti for two of his best known works La Damnation de Faust and Les Troyens Alban Berg adapted Georg B chner s play Woyzeck for the libretto of Wozzeck ",
			"after": " Sometimes the libretto is written in close collaboration with the composer this can involve adaptation as was the case with Rimsky Korsakov and his librettist Bel sky or an entirely original work In the case of musicals the music the lyrics and the book i e the spoken dialogue and the stage directions may each have their own author Thus a musical such as Fiddler on the Roof has a composer Jerry Bock a lyricist Sheldon Harnick and the writer of the book Joseph Stein In rare cases the composer writes everything except the dance arrangements music lyrics and libretto as Lionel Bart did for Oliver ",
