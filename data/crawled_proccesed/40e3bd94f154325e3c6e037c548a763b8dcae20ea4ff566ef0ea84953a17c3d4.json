			"previous": " The diffeomorphism group of spacetime sometimes appears in attempts to quantize gravity  Some of the examples that have been studied include  Lie groups are often defined to be finite dimensional but there are many groups that resemble Lie groups except for being infinite dimensional The simplest way to define infinite dimensional Lie groups is to model them on Banach spaces and in this case much of the basic theory is similar to that of finite dimensional Lie groups However this is inadequate for many applications because many natural examples of infinite dimensional Lie groups are not Banach manifolds Instead one needs to define Lie groups modeled on more general locally convex topological vector spaces In this case the relation between the Lie algebra and the Lie group becomes rather subtle and several results about finite dimensional Lie groups no longer hold ",
