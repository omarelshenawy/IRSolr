			"after": " Studies have sought to find the precise function of Mups in pheromone communication Mup proteins have been shown to promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects 38 45 However in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males even in the absence of urine 19 In addition Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ VNO a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors of mice and rats 19 46 Together this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves independent of their ligands 47 ",
