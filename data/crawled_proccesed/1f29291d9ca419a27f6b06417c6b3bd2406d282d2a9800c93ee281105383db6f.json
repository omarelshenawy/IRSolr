			"after": " The popularity of Geoffrey s Historia and its other derivative works such as Wace s Roman de Brut is generally agreed to be an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries particularly in France 71 It was not however the only Arthurian influence on the developing Matter of Britain There is clear evidence for a knowledge of Arthur and Arthurian tales on the Continent before Geoffrey s work became widely known see for example the Modena Archivolt 72 as well as for the use of Celtic names and stories not found in Geoffrey s Historia in the Arthurian romances 73 From the perspective of Arthur perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself much of this 12th century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere Percival Galahad Gawain and Tristan and Iseult Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre Galfridian material and Geoffrey s Historia itself in the romances he is rapidly sidelined 74 His character also alters significantly In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns 75 whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fain ant the do nothing king whose inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society 76 Arthur s role in these works is frequently that of a wise dignified even tempered somewhat bland and occasionally feeble monarch So he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot s affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu whilst in Chr tien de Troyes s Yvain the Knight of the Lion he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap 77 Nonetheless as Norris J Lacy has observed whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances his prestige is never or almost never compromised by his personal weaknesses his authority and glory remain intact 78 ",
