			"previous": " When laying eggs females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs This medullary bone which is rich in calcium is used to make eggshells A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and for the first time allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaurs this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs 97 ",
			"after": " Another widespread trait among modern birds is parental care for young after hatching Jack Horner s 1978 discovery of a Maiasaura good mother lizard nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods suggesting this behavior might also have been common to all dinosaurs 98 There is evidence that other non theropod dinosaurs like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods 1997 discovery also nested in large groups 99 A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken like brooding position in 1993 100 which indicates that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm 101 Parental care being a trait common to all dinosaurs is supported by other finds For example a dinosaur embryo pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus was found without teeth indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaurs 102 Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland 103 Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching 104 ",
