			"after": " Several ecosystems are present in the Everglades and boundaries between them are subtle or do not exist The primary feature of the Everglades is the sawgrass marsh The iconic water and sawgrass combination in the shallow river 100 miles 160 km long and 60 miles 97 km wide that spans from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay is often referred to as the true Everglades or just the Glades 39 40 Prior to the first drainage attempts in 1905 the sheetflow occupied nearly a third of the lower Florida peninsula 30 Sawgrass thrives in the slowly moving water but may die in unusually deep floods if oxygen is unable to reach its roots It is particularly vulnerable immediately after a fire 41 The hydroperiod for the marsh is at least nine months and can last longer 42 Where sawgrass grows densely few animals or other plants live although alligators choose these locations for nesting Where there is more room periphyton grows 43 Periphyton supports larval insects and amphibians which in turn are consumed as food by birds fish and reptiles It also absorbs calcium from water which adds to the calcitic composition of the marl 44 ",
