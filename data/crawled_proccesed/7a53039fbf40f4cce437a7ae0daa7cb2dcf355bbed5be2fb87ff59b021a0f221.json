			"previous": " The noisy miner breeds all year long with most activity from July through November though the peak period is subject to seasonal variations with sharp peaks in laying activity when conditions are particularly favourable for raising young The nest is built in prickly or leafy trees and the noisy miner is often recorded nesting in eucalypts and also in wattles Araucaria Banksia Bursaria Hibiscus mistletoe Melaleuca Pittosporum Schinus and jacaranda It seems to prefer moderately dense foliage for nesting often near the end of drooping horizontal branches Support for the nest may be the primary criterion of a suitable nest site rather than characteristics of the vegetation or location 54 The female alone builds the nest which is deep and cup shaped woven of twigs and grasses with other plant material animal hair and spider webs Occasionally the nest will include man made materials such as twine scraps of material and tissue paper It is lined with wool hair feathers flowers or plant down and padded with a circular mat woven from fibres pulled from the cocoons of the processional caterpillar 23 The female noisy miner walks around on the ground close to the nest site picking up material 54 She gathers material from disused nests of other birds or dismantles its most recent nest to build a new one The female completes the nest in five or six days 54 On average nests have an external diameter of 15 17 8 centimetres 5 9 7 0 in and an external depth of 9 11 4 centimetres 3 5 4 5 in The internal depth of the nest is around 5 5 centimetres 2 2 in 23 ",
			"after": " Eggs vary greatly in size shape and markings but are generally elongated ovals white to cream or pinkish or buff coloured freckled spotted or blotched with reddish brown to chestnut or a purplish red sometimes with underlying markings of violet or purplish grey 55 The clutch consists of two to four eggs Incubation is by the female only and the incubation period is around sixteen days Hatching is asynchronous with up to six days being recorded between the hatching of the first and last chicks in a clutch 56 Young are naked at hatching and develop a cover of down within two to three days The fledging period is around sixteen days and young begin to find food for themselves between twenty six and thirty days after fledging but are still regularly fed by adults to thirty five days 56 The young leave the nest before they are fully fledged and only able to fly downwards and scramble up They do not go far from the nest return to it at night and take some weeks to completely leave the nest Many fledglings are found on the ground and in low shrubs during this period where they continue to be cared for until they can make their way up into the trees These birds are often mistakenly rescued The fledglings seek out siblings if separated and huddle together for up to three weeks after fledging 57 ",
