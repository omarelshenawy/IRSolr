			"previous": " Unlike the laminar boundary layer equations the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales i e the inner and outer scaling has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent boundary layer difficult and controversial To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow Such analysis will yield either the so called log law or power law ",
			"after": " A constant stress layer exists in the near wall region Due to the damping of the vertical velocity fluctuations near the wall the Reynolds stress term will become negligible and we find that a linear velocity profile exists This is only true for the very near wall region ",
