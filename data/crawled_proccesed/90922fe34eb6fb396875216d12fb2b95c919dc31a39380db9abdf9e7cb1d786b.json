			"after": " Printers used natural colour dyes made from mineral or vegetable sources The dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from primary red blue and yellow pigments 201 In the 18th century Prussian blue became popular and was particularly prominent in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige 201 as was bokashi where the printer produced gradations of colour or the blending of one colour into another 202 Cheaper and more consistent synthetic aniline dyes arrived from the West in 1864 The colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments and the effects could be garish The Meiji government promoted their use as part of broader policies of Westernization 203 ",
