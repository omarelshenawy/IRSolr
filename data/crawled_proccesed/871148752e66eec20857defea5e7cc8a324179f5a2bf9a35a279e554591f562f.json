			"after": " Diplodocines have highly unusual teeth compared to other sauropods The crowns are long and slender elliptical in cross section while the apex forms a blunt triangular point 18 The most prominent wear facet is on the apex though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial cheek side of both the upper and lower teeth 18 What this means is Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus 48 49 50 as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth coming from tooth food contact In unilateral branch stripping one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer With the elongated preorbital in front of the eyes region of the skull longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action 18 Also the palinal backwards motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour 1 an increased gape and 2 allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows creating a smooth stripping action 18 ",
