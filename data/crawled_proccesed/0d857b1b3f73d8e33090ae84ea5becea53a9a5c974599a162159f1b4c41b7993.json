			"previous": " One of the most important operations conducted predominantly by the Royal Navy after the Second World War was the 1982 defeat of Argentina in the Falkland Islands War Despite losing four naval ships and other civilian and RFA ships the Royal Navy fought and won a war over 8 000 miles 12 000 km from Great Britain HMS Conqueror is the only nuclear powered submarine to have engaged an enemy ship with torpedoes sinking the cruiser ARA General Belgrano The war also underlined the importance of aircraft carriers and submarines and exposed the weaknesses of the service s late 20th century dependence on chartered merchant vessels ",
			"after": " Before the Falklands War Defence Secretary John Nott had advocated and initiated a series of cutbacks to the Navy 64 The Falklands War though provided a reprieve in Nott proposed cutbacks and proved a need for the Royal Navy to regain an expeditionary and littoral capability which with its resources and structure at the time would prove difficult At the beginning of the 1980s the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue water anti submarine warfare Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force For a time Hermes was retained along with all three of the Invincible class light aircraft carriers More Sea Harriers were ordered not just to replace losses but to also increase the size of the Fleet Air Arm New and more capable ships were built notably the Sheffield class destroyers the Type 21 Type 22 and Type 23 frigates and new LPDs of the Albion class and HMS Ocean but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced As a result the RN surface fleet continues to reduce in size A 2013 report found that the current RN was already too small and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked 65 ",
