			"previous": " While Australia s contribution to the pre war plans to defend South East Asia from Japanese aggression was focused on the defence of Malaya and Singapore small Australian forces were also deployed to defend several islands to the north of Australia The role of these forces was to defend strategic airfields which could be used to launch attacks on the Australian mainland 81 Detachments of coastwatchers were also stationed in the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands to report on any Japanese operations there 82 ",
			"after": " At the start of the Pacific War the strategic port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by Lark Force which comprised the 2 22nd Infantry Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military 83 it was not possible to reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942 The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle Few members of Lark Force survived the war as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1 057 Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan Montevideo Maru was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942 84 ",
