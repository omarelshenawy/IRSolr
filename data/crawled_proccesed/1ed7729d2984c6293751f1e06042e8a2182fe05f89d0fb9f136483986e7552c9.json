			"after": " In archaeology palaeontology and geomorphology lichenometry is a geomorphic method of geochronologic dating that uses lichen growth to determine the age of exposed rock based on a presumed specific rate of increase in radial size over time 1 2 9 Measuring the diameter of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface can therefore be used to determine the length of time the rock has been exposed Lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to citation needed 10 000 years providing the maximum age limit of the technique though it is most accurate within 10 error when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1 000 years 3 Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period 4 The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera Rhizocarpon e g the species Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria ",
