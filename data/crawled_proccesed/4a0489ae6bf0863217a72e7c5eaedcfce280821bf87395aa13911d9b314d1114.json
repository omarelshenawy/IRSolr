			"after": " A flying wing is a tailless aircraft which has no definite fuselage with most of the crew payload and equipment being housed inside the main wing structure 26  The flying wing configuration was studied extensively in the 1930s and 1940s notably by Jack Northrop and Cheston L Eshelman in the United States and Alexander Lippisch and the Horten brothers in Germany After the war a number of experimental designs were based on the flying wing concept Some general interest continued until the early 1950s but designs did not necessarily offer a great advantage in range and presented a number of technical problems leading to the adoption of conventional solutions like the Convair B 36 and the B 52 Stratofortress Due to the practical need for a deep wing the flying wing concept is most practical for designs in the slow to medium speed range and there has been continual interest in using it as a tactical airlifter design ",
