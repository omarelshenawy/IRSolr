			"previous": " The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle Tacoma Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett Seattle service came to an end in 1939 replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system Rails on city streets were paved over or removed and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941 This left an extensive network of privately owned buses later public as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region 226 ",
			"after": " King County Metro provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county as well as a South Lake Union Streetcar line between the South Lake Union neighborhood and Westlake Center in downtown 227 Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses Sound Transit currently provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and downtown its Central Link light rail line which opened in 2009 between downtown and Sea Tac Airport gives the city its first rapid transit line that has intermediate stops within the city limits Washington State Ferries which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world connects Seattle to Bainbridge and Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula 228 ",
