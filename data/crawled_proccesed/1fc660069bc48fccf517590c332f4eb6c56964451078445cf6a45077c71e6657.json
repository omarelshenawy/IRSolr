			"previous": " The Romans built many dams and reservoirs for water collection such as the Subiaco Dams two of which fed the Anio Novus one of the largest aqueducts of Rome 266 They built 72 dams just on the Iberian peninsula and many more are known across the Empire some still in use Several earthen dams are known from Roman Britain including a well preserved example from Longovicium Lanchester ",
			"after": " The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts A surviving treatise by Frontinus who served as curator aquarum water commissioner under Nerva reflects the administrative importance placed on ensuring the water supply Masonry channels carried water from distant springs and reservoirs along a precise gradient using gravity alone After the water passed through the aqueduct it was collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains baths toilets or industrial sites 267 The main aqueducts in the city of Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia 268 The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a sinuous route of more than 336 km 269 Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance and to a technological standard that was not to be equalled until modern times 270 The Romans also made use of aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire at sites such as Las Medulas and Dolaucothi in South Wales 271 ",
