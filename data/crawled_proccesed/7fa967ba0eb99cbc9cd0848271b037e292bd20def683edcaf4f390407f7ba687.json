			"previous": " Resistance welding was also developed during the final decades of the 19th century with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885 who produced further advances over the next 15 years Thermite welding was invented in 1893 and around that time another process oxyfuel welding became well established Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900 when a suitable torch was developed 12 At first oxyfuel welding was one of the more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost As the 20th century progressed however it fell out of favor for industrial applications It was largely replaced with arc welding as metal coverings known as flux for the electrode that stabilize the arc and shield the base material from impurities continued to be developed 13 ",
			"after": " World War I caused a major surge in the use of welding processes with the various military powers attempting to determine which of the several new welding processes would be best The British primarily used arc welding even constructing a ship the Fullagar with an entirely welded hull 14 15 Arc welding was first applied to aircraft during the war as well as some German airplane fuselages were constructed using the process 16 Also noteworthy is the first welded road bridge in the world the Maurzyce Bridge designed by Stefan Bry a of the Lw w University of Technology in 1927 and built across the river S udwia near owicz Poland in 1928 17 ",
