			"previous": " Norfolk has a long history of human occupation Both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area before the last glaciation between 100 000 and 10 000 years ago and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards The archaeological record is poor until about 20 000 years ago partly because of the prevailing conditions but also because the coastline was much further north than at present As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic the sea level rose filling what is now the North Sea This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line so that many ancient sites are now under the sea The oldest signs of habitation on the marshes are prehistoric Clactonian flint blades possibly from 400 000 years ago but few other prehistoric remains have been recorded here 1 ",
			"after": " The Romans left fragments of a vase and a jug on the beach and Saxon building foundations were described as the ruins of Cley Chapel on a 1797 map although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn A 1588 map showed Black Joy Forte which may have been intended as a defence against the Spanish Armada There are a number of post medieval earthworks presumably sea defences and pits which may have been associated with salt making 2 ",
