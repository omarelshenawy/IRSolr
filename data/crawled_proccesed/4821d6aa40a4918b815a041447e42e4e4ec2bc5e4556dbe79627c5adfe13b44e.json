			"previous": " Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war In May 1942 WCBW like almost all television stations sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were canceled since the station temporarily suspended studio operations resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war related technical research and to prolong the life of the early unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts ",
			"after": " In May 1944 as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned briefly anchored by Ned Calmer and then by Everett Holles 6 After the war expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule whose call letters were changed to WCBS TV in 1946 first anchored by Milo Boulton and later by Douglas Edwards On May 3 1948 Edwards began anchoring CBS Television News a regular 15 minute nightly newscast on the CBS television network including WCBS TV It aired every weeknight at 7 30 p m and was the first regularly scheduled network television news program featuring an anchor the nightly Lowell Thomas NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC s WNBT now WNBC for a time in the early 1940s and the previously mentioned Richard Hubbell Ned Calmer Everett Holles and Milo Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid 1940s but these were local television broadcasts seen only in New York City NBC s offering at the time NBC Television Newsreel which premiered in February 1948 was simply film footage with voice narration ",
