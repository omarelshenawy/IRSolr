			"previous": " Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category area within the state and time period Regulations for big game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle loading black powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons ",
			"after": " Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture a 2006 poll showed seventy eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting 25 although relatively few Americans actually hunt At the beginning of the 21st century just six percent of Americans hunted Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent slightly below the national average and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average 26 Overall in the 1996 2006 period the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits 27 ",
