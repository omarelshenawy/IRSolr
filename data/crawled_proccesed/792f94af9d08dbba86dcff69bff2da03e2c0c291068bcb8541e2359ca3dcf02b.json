			"previous": " Thus blended wing bodied aircraft incorporate design features from both a futuristic fuselage and flying wing design The purported advantages of the blended wing body approach are efficient high lift wings and a wide airfoil shaped body This enables the entire craft to contribute to lift generation with the result of potentially increased fuel economy ",
			"after": " A lifting body is a configuration in which the body itself produces lift In contrast to a flying wing which is a wing with minimal or no conventional fuselage a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at subsonic speeds by eliminating non lifting surfaces lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic supersonic and hypersonic flight or spacecraft re entry All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight stability ",
