			"after": " Early turbojet engines were very fuel inefficient as their overall pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature were severely limited by the technology available at the time In 1939 1941 Soviet designer Arkhip Lyulka elaborated the design for the World s first turbofan engine and acquired a patent for this new invention on April 22 1941 Although several prototypes were built and ready for state tests Lyulka was in 1941 forced to abandon his research and evacuate to the Urals following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union So the first tested turbofan was apparently the German Daimler Benz DB 670 designated as the 109 007 by the RLM which was operated on its testbed on April 1 1943 citation needed The engine was abandoned later while the war went on and problems could not be solved The British wartime Metrovick F 2 axial flow jet was given a fan as the Metrovick F 3 in 1943 to create the first British turbofan 4 ",
