			"previous": " In 1989 a Kakapo Recovery programme was developed and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it 61 The New Zealand Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kakapo without rehabilitation by extensive re vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors Four islands were finally chosen Maud Hauturu Little Barrier Codfish and Mana 60 Sixty five kakapo 43 males 22 females were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations 60 Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats stoats and weka kept appearing Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape the thick forest and the continued presence of rats and its birds were evacuated in 1998 62 Along with Mana Island it was replaced with two new kakapo sanctuaries Chalky Island Te Kakahu and Anchor Island 3 The entire kakapo population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to Pearl Island in Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from Codfish 63 All kakapo on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005 64 ",
			"after": " A key part of the Recovery Plan is the supplementary feeding of females The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years when a certain type of plant species primarily Dacrydium cupressinum rimu produces protein rich fruit and seeds Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant s mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency 65 In 1989 six preferred foods apples sweet potatoes almonds Brazil nuts sunflower seeds and walnuts were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations Males and females ate the supplied foods and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989 91 for the first time since 1982 although nesting success was low 66 ",
