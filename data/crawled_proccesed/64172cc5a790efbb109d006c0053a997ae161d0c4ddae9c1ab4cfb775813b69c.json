			"previous": " Propaganda can be classified according to the source and nature of the message White propaganda generally comes from an openly identified source and is characterized by gentler methods of persuasion such as standard public relations techniques and one sided presentation of an argument Black propaganda is identified as being from one source but is in fact from another This is most commonly to disguise the true origins of the propaganda be it from an enemy country or from an organization with a negative public image Grey propaganda is propaganda without any identifiable source or author A major application of grey propaganda is making enemies believe falsehoods using straw arguments As phase one to make someone believe A one releases as grey propaganda B the opposite of A In phase two B is discredited using some strawman The enemy will then assume A to be true ",
			"after": " In scale these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda For example opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source Opposition to grey propaganda when revealed often by an inside source may create some level of public outcry Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported ",
