			"previous": " Like extant organisms fossils vary in size from microscopic even single bacterial cells 6 one micrometer in diameter to gigantic such as dinosaurs and trees many meters long and weighing many tons A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive such as animal tracks or feces coprolites These types of fossil are called trace fossils or ichnofossils as opposed to body fossils Finally past life leaves some markers that cannot be seen but can be detected in the form of biochemical signals these are known as chemofossils or biomarkers ",
