			"previous": " In 1954 the Air Force placed an initial order for 29 KC 135As the first of an eventual 820 of all variants of the basic C 135 family The first aircraft flew in August 1956 and the initial production Stratotanker was delivered to Castle Air Force Base California in June 1957 The last KC 135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965 ",
			"after": " Developed in the early 1950s the basic airframe is characterized by 35 degree aft swept wings and tail four underwing mounted engine pods a horizontal stabilizer mounted on the fuselage near the bottom of the vertical stabilizer with positive dihedral on the two horizontal planes and a hi frequency radio antenna which protrudes forward from the top of the vertical fin or stabilizer These basic features make it strongly resemble the commercial Boeing 707 and 720 aircraft although it is actually a different aircraft ",
