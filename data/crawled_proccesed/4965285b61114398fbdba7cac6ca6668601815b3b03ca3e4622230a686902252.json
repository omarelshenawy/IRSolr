			"after": "  The first two types are known as analytical or nonparametric representations of curves and in general tend to be unsuitable for use in CAD applications opinion For instance the first one is dependent upon the choice of a coordinate system and does not lend itself well to geometric transformations such as rotations translations and scaling In addition with the implicit representation it is more difficult of generating points on a curve These problems are made easier by rewriting the equations in parametric form 4 ",
