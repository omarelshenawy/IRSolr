			"previous": " Aside from alloy improvements a major breakthrough was the development of directional solidification DS and single crystal SC production methods These methods help greatly increase strength against fatigue and creep by aligning grain boundaries in one direction DS or by eliminating grain boundaries all together SC 6 ",
			"after": " Another major improvement to turbine blade material technology was the development of thermal barrier coatings TBC Where DS and SC developments improved creep and fatigue resistance TBCs improved corrosion and oxidation resistance both of which become greater concerns as temperatures increased The first TBCs applied in the 1970s were aluminide coatings Improved ceramic coatings became available in the 1980s These coatings increased turbine blade temperature capability by about 200 F 90 C 6 The coatings also improve blade life almost doubling the life of turbine blades in some cases 9 ",
