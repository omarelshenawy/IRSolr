			"previous": " The practical source of an emperor s power and authority was the military The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor sacramentum 160 The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis Most emperors indicated their choice of successor usually a close family member or adopted heir The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape No emperor could hope to survive much less to reign without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions To secure their loyalty several emperors paid the donativum a monetary reward In theory the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians 161 ",
			"after": " The soldiers of the Imperial Roman army were professionals who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves The transition to a professional military had begun during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism under which an army of conscripts had exercised their responsibilities as citizens in defending the homeland in a campaign against a specific threat For Imperial Rome the military was a full time career in itself 162 ",
