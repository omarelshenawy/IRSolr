			"after": " Weight is commonly measured using one of two methods A spring scale or hydraulic or pneumatic scale measures local weight the local force of gravity on the object strictly apparent weight force Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0 5 at different locations spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object the same mass at different locations To standardize weights scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal standard gravity of 9 80665 m s2 approx 32 174 ft s2 However this calibration is done at the factory When the scale is moved to another location on Earth the force of gravity will be different causing a slight error So to be highly accurate and legal for commerce spring scales must be re calibrated at the location at which they will be used ",
