			"previous": " In an approach based on limits the symbol dy dx is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above Leibniz however did intend it to represent the quotient of two infinitesimally small numbers dy being the infinitesimally small change in y caused by an infinitesimally small change dx applied to x We can also think of d dx as a differentiation operator which takes a function as an input and gives another function the derivative as the output For example ",
			"after": " In this usage the dx in the denominator is read as with respect to x Even when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals it is common to manipulate symbols like dx and dy as if they were real numbers although it is possible to avoid such manipulations they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the total derivative ",
