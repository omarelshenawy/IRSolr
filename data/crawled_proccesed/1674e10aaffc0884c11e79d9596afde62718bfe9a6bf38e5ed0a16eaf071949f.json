			"after": " Vasa sank because it had very little initial stability which can be thought of as resistance to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast guns provisions and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship The center of gravity is too high and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over and there is not enough righting moment force trying to make the ship return to an upright position The reason that the ship has such a high center of gravity is not due to the guns These weighed little over 60 tonnes or about 5 of the total displacement of the loaded ship This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size The problem is in the hull construction itself The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were on average only 1 67 meters 5 feet 5 inches tall and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed In addition the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works 52 ",
