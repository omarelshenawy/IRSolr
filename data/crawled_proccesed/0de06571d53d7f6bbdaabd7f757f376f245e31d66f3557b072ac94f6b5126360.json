			"previous": " The main improvement in engine performance during the pre dreadnought period came from the adoption of increasingly higher pressure steam from the boiler Scotch marine boilers were superseded by more compact water tube boilers allowing higher pressure steam to be produced with less fuel consumption Water tube boilers were also safer with less risk of explosion and more flexible than fire tube types The Belleville type water tube boiler had been introduced in the French fleet as early as 1879 but it took until 1894 for the Royal Navy to adopt it for armoured cruisers and pre dreadnoughts other water tube boilers followed in navies worldwide 27 ",
			"after": " The engines drove either two or three screw propellers France and Germany preferred the three screw approach which allowed the engines to be shorter and hence more easily protected they were also more maneuverable and had better resistance to accidental damage Triple screws were however generally larger and heavier than the twin screw arrangements preferred by most other navies 26 The French also built the only class of turbine powered pre dreadnought battleships the Danton class of 1907 ",
