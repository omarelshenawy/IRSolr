			"previous": " At the time of Augustus as many as 35 percent of the people in Italy were slaves 98 making Rome one of five historical slave societies in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy 99 Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility 100 In urban settings slaves might be professionals such as teachers physicians chefs and accountants in addition to the majority of slaves who provided trained or unskilled labour in households or workplaces Agriculture and industry such as milling and mining relied on the exploitation of slaves Outside Italy slaves made up on average an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the population sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries would have affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces 101 Although the institution of slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries it remained an integral part of Roman society until the 5th century Slavery ceased gradually in the 6th and 7th centuries along with the decline of urban centres in the West and the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy that had created the demand for it 102 ",
			"after": " Laws pertaining to slavery were extremely intricate 103 Under Roman law slaves were considered property and had no legal personhood They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens sexual exploitation torture and summary execution A slave could not as a matter of law be raped since rape could be committed only against people who were free a slave s rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the Aquilian Law 104 Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called conubium but their unions were sometimes recognized and if both were freed they could marry 105 Following the Servile Wars of the Republic legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups and for hunting down fugitive slaves 106 ",
