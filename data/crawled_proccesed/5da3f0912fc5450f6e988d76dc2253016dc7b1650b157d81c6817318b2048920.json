			"after": " Two years after Wizard s publication Baum and Denslow teamed up with composer Paul Tietjens and director Julian Mitchell to produce a musical stage version of the book under Fred R Hamlin 24 Baum and Tietjens had worked on a musical of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1901 and based closely upon the book but it was rejected This stage version the first to use the shortened title The Wizard of Oz opened in Chicago in 1902 then ran on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903 It returned to Broadway in 1904 where it played from March to May and again from November to December It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast as was done in those days until 1911 and then became available for amateur use The stage version starred David C Montgomery and Fred Stone as the Tin Woodman and Scarecrow respectively which shot the pair to instant fame The stage version differed quite a bit from the book and was aimed primarily at adults Toto was replaced with Imogene the Cow and Tryxie Tryfle a waitress and Pastoria a streetcar operator were added as fellow cyclone victims The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script and the plot became about how the four friends being allied with the usurping Wizard were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II the rightful King of Oz It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script it appears that many of the changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin Jokes in the script mostly written by Glen MacDonough called for explicit references to President Theodore Roosevelt Senator Mark Hanna Rev Andrew Danquer and oil magnate John D Rockefeller Although use of the script was rather free form the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904 ",
