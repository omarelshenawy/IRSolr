			"previous": " Supersonic aerodynamics is simpler than subsonic aerodynamics because the airsheets at different points along the plane often can t affect each other Supersonic jets and rocket vehicles require several times greater thrust to push through the extra aerodynamic drag experienced within the transonic region around Mach 0 85 1 2 At these speeds aerospace engineers can gently guide air around the fuselage of the aircraft without producing new shock waves but any change in cross sectional area farther down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body Designers use the Supersonic area rule and the Whitcomb area rule to minimize sudden changes in size ",
			"after": " However in practical applications a supersonic aircraft will have to operate stably in both subsonic and supersonic profiles hence aerodynamic design is more complex ",
