			"after": " Otto Julius Zobel 1887 1970 was a design engineer who worked for the American Telephone Telegraph Company AT T in the early part of the 20th century Zobel s work on filter design was revolutionary and led in conjunction with the work of John R Carson to significant commercial advances for AT T in the field of frequency division multiplex FDM telephone transmissions Although much of Zobel s work has been superseded by more modern filter designs it remains the basis of filter theory and his papers are still referenced today Zobel invented the m derived filter and the constant resistance filter which remains in use Zobel and Carson helped to establish the nature of noise in electric circuits concluding that contrary to mainstream belief it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise will always be a limiting factor in what it is possible to transmit Thus they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to the noise of the channel ",
