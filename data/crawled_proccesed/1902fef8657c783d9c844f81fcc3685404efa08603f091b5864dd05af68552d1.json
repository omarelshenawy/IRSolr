			"after": " The book aroused international interest 160 and a widespread debate with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological social and religious implications 161 Much of the initial reaction was hostile but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation which had been rejected by scientists 160 but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws 29 The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges 162 Darwin s book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism not just his own ideas By the mid 1870s evolutionism was triumphant 161 ",
