			"previous": " During construction the underground parking garage remained open 44 An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs while accommodating two levels of underground parking underneath The challenge was solved by combining a T bar grid to absorb weight with about 150 outriggers or tiebacks inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads This design allows for the removal of individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning 2 45 Crown Fountain s design not only included interior access for technical repairs but also incorporated exemplary non discriminatory barrier free accessibility because its interactivity is not limited to the able bodied The force of the water accounts for the entire range of possible interactive visitors 3 9 ",
