			"previous": " To get an impression of the expectation it is sufficient to give an estimate The appropriate estimator is the sample mean  A machine fills cups with a liquid and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of liquid As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250 g the content added to individual cups shows some variation and is considered a random variable X This variation is assumed to be normally distributed although this assumption is not necessary for the theory to work around the desired average of 250 g with a standard deviation of 2 5 g To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated a sample of n 25 cups of liquid are chosen at random and the cups are weighed The resulting measured masses of liquid are X1 X25 a random sample from X ",
