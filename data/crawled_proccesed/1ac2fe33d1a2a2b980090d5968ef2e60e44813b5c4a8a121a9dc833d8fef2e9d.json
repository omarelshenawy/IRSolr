			"previous": " In the 1930s Dobzhansky and his co workers collected Drosophila pseudoobscura and D persimilis from wild populations in California and neighbouring states Using Painter s technique 100 they studied the polytene chromosomes and discovered that the wild populations were polymorphic for chromosomal inversions All the flies look alike whatever inversions they carry this is an example of a cryptic polymorphism Accordingly Dobzhansky favoured the idea that the morphs became fixed in the population by means of Sewall Wright s drift 101 However evidence rapidly accumulated to show that natural selection was responsible ",
