			"previous": " Otto P cht and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky s work They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience 217 The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult a problem compounded by the workshop system It was not until the late 1950s after the research of Friedl nder Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro that the attributions generally accepted today were established 199 O ",
			"after": " More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters 219 The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid 1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works allowing for more accurate attributions Van Eyck s work for example typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus work These discoveries too hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations with Memling s underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden s influence 67 ",
