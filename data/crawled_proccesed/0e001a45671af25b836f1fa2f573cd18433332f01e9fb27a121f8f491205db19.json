			"previous": " Many environmental scientists believe amphibians including frogs are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health because of their intermediate positions in food chains their permeable skins and typically biphasic lives aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults 170 It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline while those with direct development are the most resistant 171 ",
			"after": " Frog mutations and genetic defects have increased since the 1990s These often include missing legs or extra legs Various causes have been identified or hypothesized including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn on the surface of ponds chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors environmental factors contributing to rates of disease and vulnerability to attack by parasites Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood An increase in the number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs because the trematode s complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds 172 173 ",
