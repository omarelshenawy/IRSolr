			"after": " Lift is most commonly associated with the wing of a fixed wing aircraft although lift is also generated by propellers kites helicopter rotors rudders sails and keels on sailboats hydrofoils wings on auto racing cars wind turbines and other streamlined objects Lift is also exploited in the animal world and even in the plant world by the seeds of certain trees 2 While the common meaning of the word lift assumes that lift opposes weight lift in the technical sense used in this article can be in any direction with respect to gravity since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity When an aircraft is flying straight and level cruise most of the lift opposes gravity 3 However when an aircraft is climbing descending or banking in a turn the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical 4 Lift may also be entirely downwards in some aerobatic manoeuvres or on the wing on a racing car In this last case the term downforce is often used Lift may also be largely horizontal for instance on a sail on a sailboat ",
