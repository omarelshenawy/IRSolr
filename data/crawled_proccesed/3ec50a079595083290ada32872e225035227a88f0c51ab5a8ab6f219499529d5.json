			"previous": "  Currently the Earth is tilted at 23 44 degrees from its orbital plane roughly halfway between its extreme values The tilt is in the decreasing phase of its cycle and will reach its minimum value around the year 11 800 CE the last maximum was reached in 8 700 BCE This trend in forcing by itself tends to make winters warmer and summers colder i e milder seasons as well as cause an overall cooling trend ",
