			"previous": " Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food and can accurately remember a learned path for months Their strongest problem solving strategy is motion 57 While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles they are poor climbers and are not particularly agile They startle extremely easily and either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid darting motions when they sense danger 42 Larger groups of startled guinea pigs stampede running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators 58 When excited guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air known as popcorning a movement analogous to the ferret s war dance 59 They are also exceedingly good swimmers 60 ",
			"after": " Like many rodents guinea pigs sometimes participate in social grooming and they regularly self groom 61 A milky white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process 62 Groups of boars often chew each other s hair but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group rather than a social gesture 60 Dominance is also established through biting especially of the ears piloerection aggressive noises head thrusts and leaping attacks 63 Non sexual simulated mounting for dominance is also common among same sex groups ",
