			"after": " Some sightings have generated a large amount of publicity In 1973 Gary and Liz Doyle shot ten seconds of 8 mm film showing an unidentified animal running across a South Australian road Attempts to positively identify the creature as a thylacine have been impossible due to the poor quality of the film 87 In 1982 a researcher with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service Hans Naarding observed what he believed to be a thylacine for three minutes during the night at a site near Arthur River in northwestern Tasmania The sighting led to an extensive year long government funded search 88 In 1985 Aboriginal tracker Kevin Cameron produced five photographs which appear to show a digging thylacine which he stated he took in Western Australia 89 In January 1995 a Parks and Wildlife officer reported observing a thylacine in the Pyengana region of northeastern Tasmania in the early hours of the morning Later searches revealed no trace of the animal 90 In 1997 it was reported that locals and missionaries near Mount Carstensz in Western New Guinea had sighted thylacines 91 92 The locals had apparently known about them for many years but had not made an official report 93 In February 2005 Klaus Emmerichs a German tourist claimed to have taken digital photographs of a thylacine he saw near the Lake St Clair National Park but the authenticity of the photographs has not been established 94 The photos were published in April 2006 fourteen months after the sighting The photographs which showed only the back of the animal were said by those who studied them to be inconclusive as evidence of the thylacine s continued existence 95 Due to the uncertainty of whether the species is still extant or not the thylacine is sometimes regarded as a cryptid 96 97 ",
