			"after": " In order for the Tornado to perform well as a low level supersonic strike aircraft it was considered necessary for it to possess good high speed and low speed flight characteristics To achieve high speed performance a swept wing or delta wing planform is typically adopted but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness the Tornado uses a variable sweep wing 5 This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft such as the American General Dynamics F 111 Aardvark strike fighter and the Soviet Mikoyan Gurevich MiG 23 fighter The F 111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado however the Tornado differs in being a multi role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics 51 ",
