			"previous": " Early pre modern accounts of flight are in most cases difficult to verify and it is unclear whether each craft was a glider kite or parachute and to what degree they were truly controllable Often the event is only recorded a long time after it allegedly took place A 17th century account reports an attempt at flight by the 9th century poet Abbas Ibn Firnas near Cordoba Spain which ended in heavy back injuries 3 The monk Eilmer of Malmesbury is reported by William of Malmesbury c 1080 1143 a fellow monk and historian to have flown off the roof of his Abbey in Malmesbury England sometime between 1000 and 1010 AD gliding about 200 metres 220 yd before crashing and breaking his legs 4 According to these reports both used a set of feathery wings and both blamed their crash on the lack of a tail 5 ",
			"after": " The first heavier than air i e non balloon man carrying aircraft that were based on published scientific principles were Sir George Cayley s series of gliders which achieved brief wing borne hops from around 1849 Thereafter gliders were built by pioneers such as Jean Marie Le Bris John J Montgomery Otto Lilienthal Percy Pilcher Octave Chanute and Augustus Moore Herring to develop aviation Lilienthal was the first to make repeated successful flights eventually totaling over 2 000 and was the first to use rising air to prolong his flight Using a Montgomery tandem wing glider Daniel Maloney was the first to demonstrate high altitude controlled flight using a balloon launched glider launched from 4 000 feet in 1905 6 ",
