			"previous": " The design featured a twin aisle interior with a maximum of 400 passengers a three engine layout low noise emissions in the early 1970s Eastern Air Lines nicknamed the L 1011 WhisperLiner improved reliability and efficient operation The main visible difference between the TriStar and its similar trijet competitor the McDonnell Douglas DC 10 is the middle tail engine the DC 10 s engine is mounted above the fuselage for simplicity of design and more economical construction while the TriStar s engine is mounted to the rear fuselage and fed through an S duct similar to the Boeing 727 for reduced drag improved stability and easier replacement 6 A further major difference between the L 1011 and the DC 10 was Lockheed s selection of the Rolls Royce RB211 as the only engine for the L 1011 7 8 As originally designed the RB211 turbofan was an advanced three spool design with a carbon fibre fan 9 which would have better efficiency and power to weight ratio than any competing design This would make the L 1011 more efficient a major selling point ",
			"after": " American Airlines opted for the Douglas DC 10 although they showed considerable interest in the L 1011 American s intent was to convince Douglas to lower their price for the DC 10 which they did 10 Without the support of American the TriStar was launched on orders from TWA and Eastern Air Lines Although the TriStar s design schedule closely followed that of its competitor Douglas beat Lockheed to market by a year due to delays in powerplant development ",
