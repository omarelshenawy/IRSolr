			"previous": " There are three persistent sandbars in the Camel estuary the Doom Bar the Town Bar at Padstow about 1 mile 1 6 km upstream and the Halwyn Bank just upstream of Padstow where the estuary changes direction 3 All three are of similar composition a large proportion of their sediment is derived from marine mollusc shells 4 and as a consequence it includes a high level of calcium carbonate measured in 1982 at 62 per cent 5 The high calcium carbonate content of the sand has meant that it has been used for hundreds of years to improve agricultural soil by liming This use is known to date back to before 1600 6 High calcium carbonate levels combined with natural sea salt made the sand valuable to farmers as an alkaline fertiliser when mixed with manure 7 ",
			"after": " In a report published in 1839 Henry De la Beche estimated that the sand from the Doom Bar accounted for between a fifth and a quarter of the sand used for agriculture in Devon and Cornwall 8 He also stated that around 80 men were permanently employed to dredge the area from several barges removing an estimated 100 000 long tons 100 000 000 kg of sand per year which he said he had been assured by competent persons had caused a reduction in height of the bar of between 6 and 8 feet 180 and 240 cm in the 50 years before 1836 8 Another report published about twenty years earlier by Samuel Drew stated however that although the sandbars had been pillaged for ages they remained undiminished 9 An estimated ten million tons of sediment was removed from the estuary between 1836 and 1989 mostly for agricultural purposes and mostly from the Doom Bar 4 Sand is still regularly dredged from the area in 2009 an estimated 120 000 tons of sand were removed from the bar and the surrounding estuary 10 ",
