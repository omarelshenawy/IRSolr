			"previous": " Nearly all biplane aircraft have their upper and lower planes connected by interplane struts which divide the wings into bays braced by diagonal wires The wires that run outward from the upper to the lower planes resist the distortion on the bay under gravity and are termed landing wires those from the lower plane outwards to the upper lift or flying wires resist bay distortion under the aerodynamic lifting force The resulting combination of struts and wires is a quite rigid box girder like structure independent of its fuselage mountings ",
			"after": " In contrast early monoplanes relied entirely on external wire bracing either directly to the fuselage or to kingposts above it and undercarriage struts below to resist the same forces of lift and gravity Many later monoplanes have used cantilever wings with their lift bracing within the wing to avoid the drag penalties of external wires and struts but significant numbers have had and continue to have one or more external braces called lift struts for each wing These are rigid struts rather than wires and so can resist compressive loads as well as extensions 1 ",
