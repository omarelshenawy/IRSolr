			"previous": " Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation wavelengths longer than red light The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light such as planets circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust Longer infrared wavelengths can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light allowing the observation of young stars in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies Observations from the Wide field Infrared Survey Explorer WISE have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters 44 45 With the exception of wavelengths close to visible light infrared radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere or masked as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission Consequently infrared observatories have to be located in high dry places or in space 46 Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared This allows the study the chemistry of space more specifically it can detect water in comets 47 ",
			"after": " Historically optical astronomy also called visible light astronomy is the oldest form of astronomy 48 Optical images of observations were originally drawn by hand In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century images were made using photographic equipment Modern images are made using digital detectors particularly detectors using charge coupled devices CCDs and recorded on modern medium Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 to 7000 400 nm to 700 nm 48 that same equipment can be used to observe some near ultraviolet and near infrared radiation ",
