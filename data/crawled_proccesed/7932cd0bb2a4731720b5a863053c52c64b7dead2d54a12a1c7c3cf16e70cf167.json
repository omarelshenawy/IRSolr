			"after": " Yellow tailed black cockatoos can cause damage in pine and eucalyptus plantations by weakening stems through gouging out pieces of wood in order to extract moth larvae In places with these gum plantations the population of the larva of the cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali grows which then leads to increased predation and hence tree damage by cockatoos Furthermore plantations generally lack undergrowth which might have prevented cockatoos from damaging younger trees 35 Yellow tailed black cockatoos were shot as pests in some districts of New South Wales until the 1940s because of this 24 The yellow tailed black cockatoo is promoted by the Shoalhaven City Council local government on the NSW south coast as the region s bird Within the Jervis bay area the birds can be seen feasting on the many casuarina trees native to the area ",
