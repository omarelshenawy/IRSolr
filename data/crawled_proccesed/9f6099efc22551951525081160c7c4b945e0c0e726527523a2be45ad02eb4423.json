			"previous": " Rescue efforts began immediately after the crash Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within half an hour of the impact 63 Initially rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building Within minutes the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards 63 The Arlington County Fire Department ACFD assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10 minutes of the crash ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system ICS to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies 64 It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational 65 Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived within minutes 66 67 Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors 68 ",
			"after": " As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse One firefighter remarked that they pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking 68 Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation Minutes later at 10 10 the upper floors of the damaged area of the Pentagon collapsed 68 The collapsed area was about 95 feet 29 m at its widest point and 50 feet 15 m at its deepest 68 The amount of time between impact and collapse allowed everyone on the fourth and fifth levels to evacuate safely before the structure collapsed 69 After the collapse the interior fires intensified spreading through all five floors 70 After 11 00 firefighters mounted a two pronged attack against the fires Officials estimated temperatures of up to 2 000 F 1 090 C 70 While progress was made against the interior fires by late afternoon firefighters realized a flammable layer of wood under the Pentagon s slate roof had caught fire and begun to spread 71 Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it 71 Firefighters instead made firebreaks in the roof on September 12 to prevent further spreading At 18 00 on the 12th Arlington County issued a press release stating the fire was controlled but not fully extinguished Firefighters continued to put out smaller fires that ignited in the succeeding days 71 ",
