			"previous": " The first design of the AMCA was a pure triple delta wing configuration with two V shaped tail wings with tailless configuration and only two air brakes with a total length of 13 9 metres with a wing span of 11 4 m and an empty weight of around 12 tonnes with advance stealth capability 22 The only empennage mounted control surfaces are the single piece rudder and two air brakes located in the upper rear part of the fuselage one each on either side of the fin ",
