			"previous": " Further improvements in core thermal efficiency can be achieved by raising the overall pressure ratio of the core Improved blade aerodynamics reduces the number of extra compressor stages required With multiple compressors i e LPC IPC and HPC dramatic increases in overall pressure ratio have become possible Variable geometry i e stators enable high pressure ratio compressors to work surge free at all throttle settings ",
			"after": " The first high bypass conventional turbofan engine the earlier Bristol Siddeley Pegasus was a specialised VTOL engine was the General Electric TF39 designed in mid 1960s to power the Lockheed C 5 Galaxy military transport aircraft 3 The civil General Electric CF6 engine used a derived design Other high bypass turbofans are the Pratt Whitney JT9D the three shaft Rolls Royce RB211 and the CFM International CFM56 also the smaller TF34 More recent large high bypass turbofans include the Pratt Whitney PW4000 the three shaft Rolls Royce Trent the General Electric GE90 GEnx and the GP7000 produced jointly by GE and P W ",
