			"previous": " Medieval scribes writing in Latin increased writing speed by combining characters and by introduction of scribal abbreviation For example in blackletter letters with right facing bowls b o and p and those with left facing bowls c e o d g and q were written with the facing edges of the bowls superimposed In many script forms characters such as h m and n had their vertical strokes superimposed Scribes also used scribal abbreviations to avoid having to write a whole character at a stroke Manuscripts in the fourteenth century employed hundreds of such abbreviations ",
			"after": " In hand writing a ligature is made by joining two or more characters in a way they wouldn t usually be either by merging their parts writing one above another or one inside another while in printing a ligature is a group of characters that is typeset as a unit and the characters don t have to be joined for example in some cases fi ligature prints letters f and i more separated than when they are typeset as separate letters When printing with movable type was invented around 1450 4 typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters as they were based on handwriting Ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one block would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another ",
