			"previous": " There are many accounts of Johnson suffering from bouts of depression and what Johnson thought might be madness As Walter Jackson Bate puts it one of the ironies of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense of the strong imaginative grasp of concrete reality should have begun his adult life at the age of twenty in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that at least from his own point of view it seemed the onset of actual insanity 210 To overcome these feelings Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities but this did not seem to help Taylor said that Johnson at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide 211 Boswell claimed that Johnson felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia with perpetual irritation fretfulness and impatience and with a dejection gloom and despair which made existence misery 212 ",
			"after": " Early on when Johnson was unable to pay off his debts he began to work with professional writers and identified his own situation with theirs 214 During this time Johnson witnessed Christopher Smart s decline into penury and the madhouse and feared that he might share the same fate 214 Hester Thrale Piozzi claimed in a discussion on Smart s mental state that Johnson was her friend who feared an apple should intoxicate him 126 To Hester Thrale what separated Johnson from others who were placed in asylums for madness like Christopher Smart was his ability to keep his concerns and emotions to himself 126 ",
