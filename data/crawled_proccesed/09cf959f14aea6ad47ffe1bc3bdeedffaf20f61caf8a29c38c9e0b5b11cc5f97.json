			"previous": " For some visitors the greater solitude of the backcountry requires using hiking trails to backpacking or horseback riding into more remote destinations There are dozens of trails which total over 1 600 mi 2 600 km located throughout the forest 37 Many of the trailheads can be accessed at campgrounds with shorter day hikes available as well 98 The Continental Divide Trail has a 20 mile 32 km section which passes through the forest and crosses the Continental Divide at Sheridan Pass 99 There is also the Nez Perce National Historic Trail and the Beartooth Loop National Recreation Trail both of which are in the northern regions of the forest 100 101 Some remote areas can also be accessed by horseback Trailheads usually provide enough room for horse and pack animal trailers plus personal vehicles 37 Along forest access roads all terrain vehicles ATV are allowed but since wilderness areas do not permit access by way of motorized transport those who wish to visit such areas usually do so either by hiking in or on horseback 102 103 ",
			"after": " Hunting and fishing are popular recreational activities permitted throughout the forest Many of the streams and rivers are considered to be Blue Ribbon Trout Streams 104 Though many streams and lakes have excellent opportunities to catch various species of trout the north and south forks of the Shoshone River the Greybull River and the Clark s Fork of the Yellowstone the only federally designated Wild and Scenic River in Wyoming are a few of the better locations to reign in a trophy level Rainbow or Yellowstone cutthroat trout 104 1 000 miles 1 600 km of streams and a hundred lakes that can be legally fished from provide plenty of elbow room during even the most crowded of fishing seasons Hunting and fishing licenses are sponsored by the state of Wyoming and are available through the Wyoming Game and Fish Department 105 ",
