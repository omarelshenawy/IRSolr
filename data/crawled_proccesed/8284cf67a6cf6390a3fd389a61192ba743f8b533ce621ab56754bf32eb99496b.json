			"previous": " Four companies submitted proposals with the Air Force eliminating General Dynamics and awarding contracts to Fairchild Republic North American Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas for the definition phase in December 1968 The companies submitted technical proposals by June 1969 The Air Force announced the selection of McDonnell Douglas on 23 December 1969 25 The winning design resembled the twin tailed F 14 but with fixed wings both designs were based on configurations studied in wind tunnel testing by NASA 26 ",
			"after": " The Eagle s initial versions were the F 15 single seat variant and TF 15 twin seat variant After the F 15C was first flown the designations were changed to F 15A and F 15B These versions would be powered by new Pratt Whitney F100 engines to achieve a combat thrust to weight ratio in excess of 1 1 A proposed 25 mm Ford Philco GAU 7 cannon with caseless ammunition suffered development problems It was dropped in favor of the standard M61 Vulcan gun The F 15 used conformal carriage of four Sparrow missiles like the Phantom The fixed wing was put onto a flat wide fuselage that also provided an effective lifting surface The first F 15A flight was made on 27 July 1972 with the first flight of the two seat F 15B following in July 1973 27 ",
