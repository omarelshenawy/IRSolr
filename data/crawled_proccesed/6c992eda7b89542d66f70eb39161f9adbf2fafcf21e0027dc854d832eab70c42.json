			"previous": " Immediately to the west of the town is Brownhills Common a 100 acre 0 40 km2 heathland which once formed part of Cannock Forest also known as Canke Wood 32 Although the forest was felled in the 15th and 16th centuries the spread of heather and the grazing of sheep led to the creation of a huge area of heathland The area was affected by mine workings but has now returned to a more natural state and lizards and dragonflies may be observed 33 The area now supports various habitat types with the heathland mixing with marshy grassland with scattered scrub and pools 34 In 1926 when ownership of the Common was transferred to the local Council a large area of barren land at the eastern end closest to the town was landscaped with new trees planted 35 Lying south of the Common Birch Coppice is a large area of predominantly oak and birch woodland which although crossed by a now dismantled railway line mostly escaped the destruction caused to other wooded areas by mining and other industry 15 ",
			"after": " To the south Brownhills is separated from the nearby village of Clayhanger by Clayhanger Common which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and considered one of the best wetland sites in the county 36 In 2007 a new 445 000 bridge was erected across the canal at Brownhills providing pedestrian disabled and cycling access to the Common and to the village of Clayhanger beyond 37 To the east lies the village of Stonnall and a large area of green belt land 38 ",
