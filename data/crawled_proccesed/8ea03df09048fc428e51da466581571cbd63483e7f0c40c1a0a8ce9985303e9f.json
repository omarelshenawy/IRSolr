			"previous": " In 1612 Galileo Galilei proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of the orbits of the moons of Jupiter one could use their positions as a universal clock and this would make possible the determination of longitude but the method he devised was impracticable for navigators on ships 4 In 1714 the British government passed the Longitude Act which offered large financial rewards to the first person to demonstrate a practical method for determining the longitude of a ship at sea These rewards motivated many to search for a solution ",
			"after": " John Harrison a self educated English clockmaker invented the marine chronometer a key piece in solving the problem of accurately establishing longitude at sea thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long distance sea travel 3 Though the Board of Longitude rewarded John Harrison for his marine chronometer in 1773 chronometers remained very expensive and the lunar distance method continued to be used for decades Finally the combination of the availability of marine chronometers and wireless telegraph time signals put an end to the use of lunars in the 20th century ",
