			"previous": " Due to the limited budget the restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem Within fifteen years the gallery walls were sagging and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration 37 Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported into the rest of the construction This caused some problems so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed ",
			"after": " Small restorations have been performed since then but not sufficient for complete protection During World War II and Indonesian National Revolution in 1945 to 1949 Borobudur restoration efforts were halted The monument suffered further from the weather and drainage problems which caused the earth core inside the temple to expand pushing the stone structure and tilting the walls By 1950s some parts of Borobudur were facing imminent danger of collapsing In 1965 Indonesia asked the UNESCO for advice on ways to counteract the problem of weathering at Borobudur and other monuments In 1968 Professor Soekmono then head of the Archeological Service of Indonesia launched his Save Borobudur campaign in an effort to organize a massive restoration project 38 ",
