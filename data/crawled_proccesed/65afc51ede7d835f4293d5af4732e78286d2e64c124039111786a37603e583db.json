			"previous": " In the 17th century formal gardens were created around the Samwell Hall these included such features as parterres and canals 36 However they were costly to maintain and in the later part of the 18th century fashions changed to favour a more informal type of garden layout 37 Credit for designing the informal gardens at Eaton Hall has been given to Lancelot Capability Brown 38 Although one of Brown s documents dated 1764 shows that payment was made to him by the estate it also notes that a plan for the garden had been drawn up by William Emes From this Marion Mako concludes that as Brown was an engineer as well as a landscape gardener the payment was for an engineering project rather than for landscaping 39 Emes had been influenced by Brown although he had not been his pupil With his clerk of works Thomas Leggett Emes worked in the estate for the next 10 years 40 When Robert Grosvenor later the 1st Marquess inherited the estate at the beginning of the 19th century it had become run down The marquess appointed John Webb a pupil of Emes to improve the garden and the landscaping Among Webb s innovations were new terrace walls behind the house the levelling of Belgrave Avenue and the planting of 130 000 trees along it and a serpentine lake to the east of the house alongside the River Dee He also arranged for the construction of greenhouses and a kitchen garden 41 ",
			"after": " Fashions changed again and in the 1820s William Andrews Nesfield was employed to design new parterres He also built more terracing and a balustraded wall Statues stone urns and vases on pedestals were added to the garden 42 In 1852 the Camellia House was built this was extended in 1870 to its final size of 385 feet 117 m long 10 feet 3 m wide and 18 feet 5 m high The present kitchen garden was created the same year this provided the food not only for the hall but also for Grosvenor House in London More greenhouses were built and by about 1880 56 gardeners were employed There were other building works in the grounds Waterhouse created a grotto between the chapel and the stable yard and designed the Parrot House and a loggia now known as the Temple The Chester architect John Douglas designed the Dutch Tea House in the Tea Garden and a number of service buildings in the estate In 1897 98 Edwin Lutyens started to improve what had been known as the Italian Garden and is now the Dragon Garden 43 ",
