			"previous": " Algebraic combinatorics is an area of mathematics that employs methods of abstract algebra notably group theory and representation theory in various combinatorial contexts and conversely applies combinatorial techniques to problems in algebra Algebraic combinatorics is continuously expanding its scope in both topics and techniques and can be seen as the area of mathematics where the interaction of combinatorial and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant ",
