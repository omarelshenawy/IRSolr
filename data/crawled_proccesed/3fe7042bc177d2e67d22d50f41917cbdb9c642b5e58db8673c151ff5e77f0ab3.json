			"previous": " In 1970 President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat Sadat switched Egypt s Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States expelling Soviet advisors in 1972 He launched the Infitah economic reform policy while clamping down on religious and secular opposition In 1973 Egypt along with Syria launched the October War a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier it presented Sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the Sinai later in return for peace with Israel 56 ",
			"after": " In 1975 Sadat shifted Nasser s economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah Through this policy incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction abandoning Egypt s infant industries 57 Even though Sadat s policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class it mainly benefited the higher class and because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots ",
