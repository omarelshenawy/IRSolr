			"after": " Intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon and weather stations being relatively sparse are rarely available on the site of the storm itself In general surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area or if there is a nearby ship Real time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated For this reason there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall 105 ",
