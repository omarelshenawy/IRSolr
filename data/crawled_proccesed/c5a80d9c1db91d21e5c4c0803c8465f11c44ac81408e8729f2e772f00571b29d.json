			"previous": " Diderot was above all things interested in the life of individuals He did not care about the abstract life of the race but the incidents of individual character the fortunes of a particular family the relations of real and concrete motives in this or that special case He was delighted with the enthusiasm of a born casuist in curious puzzles of right and wrong and in devising a conflict between the generalities of ethics and the conditions of an ingeniously contrived practical dilemma Diderot s interest expressed itself in didactic and sympathetic form However in two of his most remarkable pieces this interest is not sympathetic but ironic Jacques le fataliste written in 1773 but not published until 1792 in German and 1796 in French is similar to Tristram Shandy and The Sentimental Journey His dialogue Le Neveu de Rameau Rameau s Nephew is a farce tragedy reminiscent of the Satires of Horace A favorite classical author of Diderot s Horace s words Vertumnis quotquot sunt natus iniquis are quoted at the top of the Nephew Diderot s intention in writing the dialogue is disputed whether it is merely a satire on contemporary manners or a reduction of the theory of self interest to an absurdity or the application of irony to the ethics of ordinary convention or a mere setting for a discussion about music or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a parasite and a human original Whatever its intent it is a remarkable conversation representing an era that held the art of conversation in the highest regard ",
			"after": " The writing and publication history of the Nephew is likewise a bit mysterious Diderot never saw the work through to publication during his lifetime but there is every indication it was of continual interest to him Though the original draft was written in 1761 he made additions to it year after year until his death twenty three years later Goethe s translation 1805 was the first introduction of Le Neveu de Rameau to the European public After executing it he gave back the original French manuscript to Friedrich Schiller from whom he had it No authentic French copy of it appeared until the writer had been dead for forty years 1823 Diderot s miscellaneous pieces range from a graceful trifle like the Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre Regrets for my Old Dressing Gown up to Le R ve de d Alembert where he plunges into the depths of the controversy as to the ultimate constitution of matter and the meaning of life Diderot was not a coherent and systematic thinker but rather a philosopher in whom all the contradictions of the time struggle with one another Rosenkranz He did not develop a comprehensive system of materialism but he may have made some contributions to the atheistic materialist works of his friend Paul Henri Thiry baron d Holbach ",
