			"previous": " Before the 11th century Swedes adhered to Norse paganism worshiping sir gods with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala With Christianisation in the 11th century the laws of the country were changed forbidding worship of other deities into the late 19th century After the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s a change led by Martin Luther s Swedish associate Olaus Petri the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished The church and state were separated allowing Lutheranism to prevail This process was completed by the Uppsala Synod of 1593 Lutheranism became Sweden s official religion During the era following the Reformation usually known as the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy small groups of non Lutherans especially Calvinist Dutchmen the Moravian Church and Walloons or French Huguenots from Belgium played a significant role in trade and industry and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile The Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion but they converted to Lutheranism by the work of Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries ",
			"after": " With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths including Judaism and Roman Catholicism were allowed to openly live and work in the country However until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another religion The 19th century saw the arrival of various evangelical free churches and towards the end of the century secularism leading many to distance themselves from Church rituals Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so called dissenter law of 1860 but only under the provision of entering another Christian denomination The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the Law on Freedom of Religion in 1951 In 2000 the Church of Sweden was separated from the state and Sweden ceased to have any official church ",
