			"after": " The first Ediacaran fossils discovered were the disc shaped Aspidella terranovica in 1868 Their discoverer Scottish geologist Alexander Murray found them useful aids for correlating the age of rocks around Newfoundland 12 However since they lay below the Primordial Strata of the Cambrian that was then thought to contain the very first signs of animal life a proposal four years after their discovery by Elkanah Billings that these simple forms represented fauna was dismissed by his peers Instead they were interpreted as gas escape structures or inorganic concretions 12 No similar structures elsewhere in the world were then known and the one sided debate soon fell into obscurity 12 In 1933 Georg G rich discovered specimens in Namibia 13 but the firm belief that life originated in the Cambrian led to them being assigned to the Cambrian Period and no link to Aspidella was made In 1946 Reg Sprigg noticed jellyfishes in the Ediacara Hills of Australia s Flinders Ranges 14 but these rocks were believed to be Early Cambrian so while the discovery sparked some interest little serious attention was garnered ",
