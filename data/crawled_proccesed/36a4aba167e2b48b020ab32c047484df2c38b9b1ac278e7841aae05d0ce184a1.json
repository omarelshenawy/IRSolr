			"after": " The AN APY 7 radar can operate in wide area surveillance ground moving target indicator GMTI fixed target indicator FTI target classification and synthetic aperture radar SAR modes  To pick up moving targets the radar looks at the Doppler frequency shift of the returned signal It can look from a long range which the military refers to as a high standoff capability The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft for a 120 degree field of view covering nearly 50 000 km 19 305 mile and can simultaneously track 600 targets at more than 250 km 152 miles The GMTI modes cannot pick up objects that are too small insufficiently dense or stationary Data processing allows the APY 7 to differentiate between armored vehicles tracked tanks and trucks allowing targeting personnel to better select the appropriate ordnance for various targets ",
