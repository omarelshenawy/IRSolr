			"previous": " The distinction between coast assault battleship and cruising battleship became blurred with the Admiral class ordered in 1880 These ships reflected developments in ironclad design being protected by iron and steel compound armour rather than wrought iron Equipped with breech loading guns of between 12 inch and 16 inch 305 mm and 413 mm calibre the Admirals continued the trend of ironclad warships towards gigantic weapons The guns were mounted in open barbettes to save weight Some historians see these ships as a vital step towards pre dreadnoughts others view them as a confused and unsuccessful design 6 ",
			"after": " The subsequent Royal Sovereign class of 1889 retained barbettes but were uniformly armed with 13 5 inch 343 mm guns they were also significantly larger at 14 000 tons displacement and faster due to triple expansion steam engines than the Admirals Just as importantly the Royal Sovereigns had a higher freeboard making them unequivocally capable of the high seas battleship role 7 8 ",
