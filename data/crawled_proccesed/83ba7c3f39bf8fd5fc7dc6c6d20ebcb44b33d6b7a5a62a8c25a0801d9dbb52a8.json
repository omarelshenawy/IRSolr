			"previous": " Several prototype fighter programs begun early in 1945 continued on after the war and led to advanced piston engine fighters that entered production and operational service in 1946 A typical example is the Lavochkin La 9 Fritz which was an evolution of the successful wartime Lavochkin La 7 Fin Working through a series of prototypes the La 120 La 126 and La 130 the Lavochkin design bureau sought to replace the La 7 s wooden airframe with a metal one as well as fit a laminar flow wing to improve maneuver performance and increased armament The La 9 entered service in August 1946 and was produced until 1948 it also served as the basis for the development of a long range escort fighter the La 11 Fang of which nearly 1200 were produced 1947 1951 Over the course of the Korean War however it became obvious that the day of the piston engined fighter was coming to a close and that the future would lie with the jet fighter ",
			"after": " This period also witnessed experimentation with jet assisted piston engine aircraft La 9 derivatives included examples fitted with two underwing auxiliary pulsejet engines the La 9RD and a similarly mounted pair of auxiliary ramjet engines the La 138 however neither of these entered service One that did enter service with the U S Navy in March 1945 was the Ryan FR 1 Fireball production was halted with the war s end on VJ Day with only 66 having been delivered and the type was withdrawn from service in 1947 The USAAF had ordered its first 13 mixed turboprop turbojet powered pre production prototypes of the Consolidated Vultee XP 81 fighter but this program was also canceled by VJ Day with 80 of the engineering work completed ",
