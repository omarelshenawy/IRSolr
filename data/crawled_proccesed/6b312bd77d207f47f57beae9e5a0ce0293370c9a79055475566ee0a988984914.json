			"previous": " Since the 1990s airlines have increasingly turned from four engine or three engine airliners to twin engine airliners to operate Transatlantic flight and Transpacific flight routes On a nonstop flight from America to Asia the long range aircraft usually follows the great circle route Hence in case of an engine failure in a twinjet like Boeing 777 it is never too far from an emergency landing field in western Canada Alaska or eastern Russia The Boeing 777 has also been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration for flights between North America and Hawaii which is the world s longest citation needed regular airline route with no emergency landing fields along the way ",
