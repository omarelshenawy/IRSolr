			"previous": " Main memory in a parallel computer is either shared memory shared between all processing elements in a single address space or distributed memory in which each processing element has its own local address space 23 Distributed memory refers to the fact that the memory is logically distributed but often implies that it is physically distributed as well Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non local processors Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non local memory ",
			"after": " Computer architectures in which each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as Uniform Memory Access UMA systems Typically that can be achieved only by a shared memory system in which the memory is not physically distributed A system that does not have this property is known as a Non Uniform Memory Access NUMA architecture Distributed memory systems have non uniform memory access ",
