			"previous": " The pair of propellers on each wing of the A400M turn in opposite directions with the tips of the propellers advancing from above towards the midpoint between the two engines This is in contrast to the overwhelming majority of multi engine propeller driven aircraft where all propellers turn in the same direction citation needed The counter rotation is achieved by the use of a gearbox fitted to two of the engines and only the propeller turns the opposite direction all four engines are identical and turn in the same direction This eliminates the need to have two different handed engines on stock for the same aircraft simplifying maintenance and supply costs This configuration dubbed DBE Down Between Engines allows the aircraft to produce more lift and lessens the torque and prop wash on each wing It also reduces yaw in the event of an outboard engine failure 71 ",
