			"after": " Traditionally watches have displayed the time in analog form with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer rotating minute hand Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand although it is actually not gliding the hand merely moves in smaller steps typically 1 5 of a second corresponding to the beat half period of the balance wheel In some escapements for example the duplex escapement the hand advances every two beats full period of the balance wheel typically 1 2 second in those watches or even every four beats two periods 1 second in the double duplex escapement A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the tri synchro regulator of Spring Drive watches All of the hands are normally mechanical physically rotating on the dial although a few watches have been produced with hands that are simulated by a liquid crystal display ",
