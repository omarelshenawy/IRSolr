			"previous": " The white stork s decline due to industrialisation and agricultural changes principally the draining of wetlands and conversion of meadows to crops such as maize began in the 19th century the last wild individual in Belgium was seen in 1895 in Sweden in 1955 in Switzerland in 1950 and in the Netherlands in 1991 However the species has since been reintroduced to many regions 113 It has been rated as Least Concern by the IUCN since 1994 after being evaluated as Near Threatened in 1988 1 The white stork is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds AEWA applies 114 Parties to the agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation management of human activities research education and implementation 115 Threats include the continued loss of wetlands collisions with overhead power lines use of persistent pesticides such as DDT to combat locusts in Africa and largely illegal hunting on migration routes and wintering grounds 8 ",
