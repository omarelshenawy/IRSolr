			"after": " Pan Am had invested in a large fleet of new Boeing 747s in the expectation that demand for air travel would continue to rise This was not the case as the simultaneous introduction of a large number of these high capacity aircraft by Pan Am and its principal competitors coincided with an economic slowdown Reduced demand for air travel following the 1973 oil crisis made the airline industry s overcapacity problem worse leaving Pan Am with its high overheads and fixed costs as a result of a large decentralized infrastructure in a vulnerable position In addition high jet fuel prices and the large number of older less fuel efficient narrowbodied airplanes in its fleet significantly increased the airline s operating costs Federal route awards to other airlines such as the Transpacific Route Case further reduced the number of passengers Pan Am carried as well as its profit margins 10 58 ",
