			"previous": " Stanley as Port Jackson was soon renamed officially became the seat of government in 1845 45 Early in its history Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo shipping losses only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape Horn stop at the port 46 Nevertheless the Falklands geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the Wrecking Trade the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes 47 Aside from this trade commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures Economic growth began only after the Falkland Islands Company which bought out Lafone s failing enterprise in 1851 I successfully introduced Cheviot sheep for wool farming spurring other farms to follow suit 49 The high cost of importing materials combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive After 1870 it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America by 1914 with the opening of the Panama Canal the trade effectively ended 50 In 1881 the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain 45 For more than a century the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago in addition it owned most housing in Stanley which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK 49 ",
			"after": " In the first half of the 20th century the Falklands served an important role in Britain s territorial claims to subantarctic islands and a section of Antarctica The Falklands governed these territories as the Falkland Islands Dependencies starting in 1908 and retained them until their dissolution in 1985 51 The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic In the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 a Royal Navy fleet defeated an Imperial German squadron In the Second World War following the December 1939 Battle of the River Plate the battle damaged HMS Exeter steamed to the Falklands for repairs 16 In 1942 a battalion en route to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago 52 After the war ended the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina 46 ",
