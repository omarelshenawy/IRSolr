			"previous": " A book published in 1999 by the Royal Collection Department reported that the palace contained 19 state rooms 52 principal bedrooms 188 staff bedrooms 92 offices and 78 bathrooms 71 This is actually small in comparison to the Russian imperial palaces in Saint Petersburg and at Tsarskoe Selo the Papal Palace in Rome the Royal Palace of Madrid the Stockholm Palace or indeed the former Palace of Whitehall and tiny compared to the Forbidden City and Potala Palace A minor change was made in 1938 in which the north west pavilion designed by Nash as a conservatory and altered in 1911 13 to a racquets court was converted into a swimming pool ",
			"after": " During World War I the palace then the home of King George V and Queen Mary escaped unscathed Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ The King imposed rationing at the palace much to the dismay of his guests and household 72 To the King s later regret David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence 73 ",
