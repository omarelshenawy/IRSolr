			"after": " There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla chimpanzee and hominin lineages 26 27 The earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are Sahelanthropus tchadensis dating from 7 million years ago and Orrorin tugenensis dating from 5 7 million years ago and Ardipithecus kadabba dating to 5 6 million years ago Each of these has been argued to be a bipedal ancestor of later hominins but in each case the claims have been contested It is also possible that either of these species is an ancestor of another branch of African apes or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other Hominoidea The question of the relation between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved From these early species the australopithecines arose around 4 million years ago diverged into robust also called Paranthropus and gracile branches one of which possibly A garhi went on to become ancestors of the genus Homo citation needed ",
