			"after": " The identification in 2000 of a probable Deinonychus egg associated with one of the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure nesting and reproduction In their 2006 examination of the specimen Grellet Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg or that the egg fragments had been associated with the Deinonychus skeleton by coincidence They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a meal for the theropod noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones making it impossible that they represented contents of the animal s stomach In addition the manner in which the egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial and was broken by the fossilization process The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur was also found to be unlikely the bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation The fact that these bones were belly ribs gastralia which are very rarely found articulated supported this interpretation All the evidence according to Grellet Tinner and Makovicky indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the Deinonychus when it was buried It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in Deinonychus similar to that seen in the related troodontids and oviraptorids or that the egg was in fact inside the oviduct when the animal died 23 ",
