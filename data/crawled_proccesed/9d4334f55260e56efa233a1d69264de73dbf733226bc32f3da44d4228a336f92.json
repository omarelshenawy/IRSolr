			"previous": " The C 2 Greyhound a derivative of the E 2 Hawkeye shares wings and power plants with the E 2 but has a widened fuselage with a rear loading ramp The first of two prototypes flew in 1964 After successful testing Grumman began production of the aircraft in 1965 The C 2 replaced the piston engined Grumman C 1 Trader in the COD role The original C 2A aircraft were overhauled to extend their operational life in 1973 ",
			"after": " Powered by two Allison T56 turboprop engines the C 2A can deliver up to 10 000 pounds 4 500 kg of cargo passengers or both It can also carry litter patients in medical evacuation missions A cage system or transport stand restrains cargo during carrier launch and landing The large aft cargo ramp and door and a powered winch allow straight in rear cargo loading and unloading for fast turnaround The Greyhound s ability to airdrop supplies and personnel fold its wings and generate power for engine starting and other uses provide an operational versatility found in no other cargo aircraft ",
