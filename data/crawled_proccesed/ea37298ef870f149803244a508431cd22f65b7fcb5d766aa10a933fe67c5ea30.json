			"previous": " In response to the above criticisms HLS eventually implemented the once criticized 20 but now dominant approach pioneered by Dean Robert Hutchins at Yale Law School of shifting the competitiveness to the admissions process while making law school itself a more cooperative experience Robert Granfield and Thomas Koenig s 1992 study of Harvard Law students that appeared in The Sociological Quarterly found that students learn to cooperate with rather than compete against classmates and that contrary to less eminent law schools students learn that professional success is available for all who attend and that therefore only neurotic gunners try to outdo peers 23 ",
			"after": " Under Dean Elena Kagan the second half of the 2000s saw significant academic changes since the implementation of the Langdell curriculum In 2006 the faculty voted unanimously to approve a new first year curriculum placing greater emphasis on problem solving administrative law and international law The new curriculum was implemented in stages over the next several years 25 26 with the last new course a first year practice oriented problem solving workshop being instituted in January 2010 In late 2008 the faculty decided that the school should move to an Honors Pass Low Pass H P LP grading system much like those in place at Yale and Stanford Law Schools The system applied to half the courses taken by students in the Class of 2010 and fully started with the Class of 2011 27 ",
