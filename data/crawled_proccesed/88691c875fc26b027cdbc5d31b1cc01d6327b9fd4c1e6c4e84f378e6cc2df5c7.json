			"after": " The show received positive reviews and critical acclaim David Segal from The Washington Post noted that the difference between this show and the last the Drowned World Tour of 2001 was striking That show seems standoffish compared with this one in part because Madonna has finally worked through whatever issues prevented her from performing her earliest hits Madonna has created a new performance hybrid 10 Segal s view was shared by Elizabeth Smith from The New York Times who also commented that Unlike 2001 s Drowned World Tour which was dark often hostile Re Invention returns Madonna to the light She looks as if she is having a good time 20 Edna Gunderson of USA Today gave the concert four out of four stars and said Madonna seems to be having a jolly good time Whereas her last outing had technical strengths but lacked warmth Reinvention finds Madonna reinvested emotionally The show doesn t have the degree of flesh carnal content or shock value that past outings delivered but this time Madonna is opting for more heart than cleavage and more personality than profanity 19 Joshua Klein from Chicago Tribune commented that Madonna s show displayed more spectacle than substance 22 ",
