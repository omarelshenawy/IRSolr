			"previous": " Throughout the 1950s an SST looked possible from a technical standpoint but it was not clear if it could be made economically viable Lift is generated using different means at supersonic speeds and these methods are considerably less efficient than subsonic methods with approximately one half the lift to drag ratio This implies that for any given required amount of lift the aircraft will have to supply about twice the thrust leading to considerably greater fuel use This effect is pronounced at speeds close to the speed of sound as the aircraft is using twice the thrust to travel at about the same speed The relative effect is reduced as the aircraft accelerates to higher speeds Offsetting this increase in fuel use was the potential to greatly increase sortie rates of the aircraft at least on medium and long range flights where the aircraft spends a considerable amount of time in cruise SST designs flying at least three times as fast as existing subsonic transports were possible and would thus be able to replace as many as three planes in service and thereby lower costs in terms of manpower and maintenance ",
			"after": " Serious work on SST designs started in the mid 1950s when the first generation of supersonic fighter aircraft were entering service In Britain and France government subsidized SST programs quickly settled on the delta wing in most studies including the Sud Aviation Super Caravelle and Bristol 223 although Armstrong Whitworth proposed a more radical design the Mach 1 2 M Wing Avro Canada proposed several designs to TWA that included Mach 1 6 double ogee wing and Mach 1 2 delta wing with separate tail and four under wing engine configurations Avro s team moved to the UK where its design formed the basis of Hawker Siddeley s designs 2 By the early 1960s the designs had progressed to the point where the go ahead for production was given but costs were so high that the Bristol Aeroplane Company and Sud Aviation eventually merged their efforts in 1962 to produce Concorde ",
