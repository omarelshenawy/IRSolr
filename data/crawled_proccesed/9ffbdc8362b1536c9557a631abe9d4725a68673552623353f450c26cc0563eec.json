			"after": " A former French colony Lebanon designates Arabic as the sole official language while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used French is widely used as a second language by the Lebanese and is taught in many schools as a secondary language along with Arabic and English The language is also used on bank notes on road signs and on official buildings alongside Arabic Similarly Syria was also a French colony until 1943 but the French language is largely extinct in the country and is only limited to some members of the elite and middle classes A significant French speaking community is also present in Israel primarily among the community of Maghrebi Jews and many secondary schools offer French as a foreign language The United Arab Emirates has joined the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie as an observer and Qatar has joined as a member state However in both countries French is not spoken by almost any of the general population or migrant workers but spoken by a small minority of those who invest in Francophone countries or have other financial or family ties Their entrance into the organisation was aided a good deal by their investments into the Organisation and France itself 33 ",
