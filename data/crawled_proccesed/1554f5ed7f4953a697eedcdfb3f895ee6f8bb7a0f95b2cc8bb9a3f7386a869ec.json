			"after": " The spores of C micaceus are reddish brown with dimensions of 7 10 by 4 5 6 m Generally they are lentiform shaped like a biconvex lens but viewed from the side they appear more almond shaped or spindle shaped while in front view they appear oval or mitriform roughly the shape of a miter a peaked cap Spores have a germ pore a flattened area in the center of the spore surface through which a germ tube may emerge 21 The spore bearing cells the basidia are four spored club shaped and measure 10 15 by 4 7 m 25 Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations The first generation basidia are the most protuberant and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies When a living gill is viewed with a microscope the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly Arthur Buller coined the term inaequihymeniiferous to describe this mode of hymenial development The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release 26 ",
