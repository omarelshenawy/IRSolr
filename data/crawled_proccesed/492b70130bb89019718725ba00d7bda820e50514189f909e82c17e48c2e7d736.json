			"after": " All of Florida s abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants As rains fall most of the water is directed to lakes streams and rivers 66 However a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay shells and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content 51 Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below The Floridan Aquifer underneath the confining layer underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia Alabama and South Carolina It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee 67 ",
