			"previous": " After the start of the war with Japan President Franklin D Roosevelt signed an order for internment of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast About 1 700 of them lived in Portland and some had farms or businesses near the slough When the government removed them from their homes in 1942 it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center Expo Center in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland They were not allowed to return until 1945 56 ",
			"after": " In 1942 Kaiser Shipbuilding Company began making ships for the war at three huge installations near the lower slough one in St Johns one on Swan Island in Portland s Overlook neighborhood and one in Vancouver Washington 57 St Johns and Vancouver made Liberty ships while Swan Island made tankers 57 The St Johns shipyard became the nation s leading producer of Liberty ships 57 To house shipyard workers and their families Henry J Kaiser bought 650 acres 260 ha of former marsh pasture and farmland in the lower slough watershed surrounded on all sides by dikes between 15 and 25 feet 5 and 8 m high 55 Here he built a new city at first called Kaiserville and later Vanport By 1943 Vanport s population of 39 000 made it the second largest city in Oregon and the largest wartime housing project in the U S 55 After the war the population fell to about 18 500 55 This was roughly the number of people living there on May 30 1948 when a flood broke through Vanport s western levee 55 The break occurred during the afternoon of a day with mild weather 58 The first rush of water soon became a creeping inundation 58 slowed in its advance for 35 to 40 minutes by water absorbing sloughs 58 The water s gradual rise within the city allowed most of the residents to escape drowning The county coroner s official list of bodies recovered was set at fifteen and seven people on a list of missing people were never found 59 The flood destroyed the city which was never rebuilt 55 ",
