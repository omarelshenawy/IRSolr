			"previous": " In addition to the Song gentry s antiquarian pursuits of art collecting scholar officials during the Song became highly interested in retrieving ancient relics from archaeological sites in order to revive the use of ancient vessels in ceremonies of state ritual 202 Scholar officials of the Song period claimed to have discovered ancient bronze vessels that were created as far back as the Shang dynasty 1600 1046 BCE which bore the written characters of the Shang era 203 Some attempted to recreate these bronze vessels by using imagination alone not by observing tangible evidence of relics this practice was criticized by Shen Kuo in his work of 1088 202 Yet Shen Kuo had much more to criticize than this practice alone Shen objected to the idea of his peers that ancient relics were products created by famous sages in lore or the ancient aristocratic class Shen rightfully attributed the discovered handicrafts and vessels from ancient times as the work of artisans and commoners from previous eras 202 He also disapproved of his peers pursuit of archaeology simply to enhance state ritual since Shen not only took an interdisciplinary approach with the study of archaeology but he also emphasized the study of functionality and investigating what was the ancient relics original processes of manufacture 202 Shen used ancient texts and existing models of armillary spheres to create one based on ancient standards Shen described ancient weaponry such as the use of a scaled sighting device on crossbows while experimenting with ancient musical measures Shen suggested hanging an ancient bell by using a hollow handle 202 ",
