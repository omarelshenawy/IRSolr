			"previous": " Lewis Paul patented the roller spinning machine and the flyer and bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of Birmingham Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with fifty spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt s machines This operated until about 1764 A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster but this burnt down Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748 Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill Lewis s invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule ",
			"after": " In 1764 in the village of Stanhill Lancashire James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny which he patented in 1770 It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles 33 The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel by first clamping down on the fibres then by drawing them out followed by twisting 34 It was a simple wooden framed machine that only cost about 6 for a 40 spindle model in 1792 35 and was used mainly by home spinners The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft not warp 36 ",
