			"previous": " Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun between 42 000 and 48 000 years ago 46 possibly with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now South East Asia These first inhabitants may have been ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians 47 At the time of European settlement in the late 18th century most Indigenous Australians were hunter gatherers with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime The Torres Strait Islanders ethnically Melanesian were originally horticulturalists and hunter gatherers 48 The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by fishermen from Maritime Southeast Asia 49 ",
			"after": " The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent are attributed to the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606 and made landfall on 26 February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York 50 The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent New Holland during the 17th century but made no attempt at settlement 50 William Dampier an English explorer and privateer landed on the north west coast of New Holland in 1688 and again in 1699 on a return trip 51 In 1770 James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain 52 With the loss of its American colonies in 1783 the British Government sent a fleet of ships the First Fleet under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales A camp was set up and the flag raised at Sydney Cove Port Jackson on 26 January 1788 15 a date which became Australia s national day Australia Day although the British Crown Colony of New South Wales was not formally promulgated until 7 February 1788 The first settlement led to the foundation of Sydney the establishment of farming industry and commerce and the exploration and settlement of other regions ",
