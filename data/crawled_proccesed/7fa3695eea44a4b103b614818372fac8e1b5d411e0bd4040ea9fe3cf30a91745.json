			"previous": " The Comet had a total of four hydraulic systems two primaries one secondary and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage 41 The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand pump 42 Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics cabin air conditioning and the de icing system these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active 18 The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay 43 A pressurised refuelling system developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd allowed the Comet s fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods 44 ",
			"after": " The cockpit was significantly altered for the Comet 4 s introduction on which an improved layout focusing on the onboard navigational suite was introduced 45 An EKCO E160 radar unit was installed in the Comet 4 s nose cone providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities 38 and a radar interface was built into the Comet 4 cockpit along with redesigned instruments 45 ",
