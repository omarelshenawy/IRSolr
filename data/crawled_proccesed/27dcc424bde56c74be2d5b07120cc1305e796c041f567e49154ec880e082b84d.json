			"previous": " The renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many dolphinaria around the world making dolphins accessible to the public Criticism and animal welfare laws forced many to close although hundreds still exist around the world In the United States the best known are the SeaWorld marine mammal parks In the Middle East the best known are Dolphin Bay at Atlantis The Palm and the Dubai Dolphinarium ",
			"after": " Although dolphins generally interact well with humans some attacks have occurred most of them resulting in small injuries 114  Orcas the largest species of dolphin have been involved in fatal attacks on humans in captivity The record holder of documented orca fatal attacks a male named Tilikum that belongs to SeaWorld has played a role in the death of three people in three different incidents 1991 1999 and 2010 115 Tilikum s behaviour sparked the production of the documentary Blackfish which focuses on the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity There are documented incidents in the wild too but none of them fatal 116 ",
