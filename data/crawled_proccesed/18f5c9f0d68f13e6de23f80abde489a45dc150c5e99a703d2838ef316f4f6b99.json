			"previous": " In mammals the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right in the giraffe it is over 30 cm 12 in longer These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal 51 the left nerve is over 2 m 6 ft 7 in long 52 Each nerve cell in this path begins in the brainstem and passes down the neck along the vagus nerve then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx Thus these nerve cells have a length of nearly 5 m 16 ft in the largest giraffes 51 The structure of a giraffe s brain resembles that of domestic cattle 32 31 The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass 53 Its long neck gives it a large amount of dead space in spite of its narrow windpipe These factors increase the resistance to airflow Nevertheless the animal can still supply enough oxygen to its tissues 53 ",
			"after": " The circulatory system of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height Its heart which can weigh more than 11 kg 25 lb and measures about 60 cm 2 ft long must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain As such the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7 5 cm 3 0 in 15 Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size at 150 beats per minute 31 76 In the upper neck a rete mirabile prevents excess blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head 17 The jugular veins also contain several most commonly seven valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered 54 Conversely the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them To solve this problem the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight preventing too much blood from pouring into them 17 ",
