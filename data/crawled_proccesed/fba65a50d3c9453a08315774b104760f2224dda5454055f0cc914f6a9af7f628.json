			"after": " William of Poitiers describes a council called by Duke William in which the writer gives an account of a great debate that took place between William s nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held it is unlikely that any debate took place as the duke had by then established control over his nobles and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England 78 William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion along with a papal banner The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and King Sweyn II of Denmark Henry was still a minor however and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king so these claims should be treated with caution Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion m 79 Events after the invasion which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval To deal with Norman affairs William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion 2 ",
