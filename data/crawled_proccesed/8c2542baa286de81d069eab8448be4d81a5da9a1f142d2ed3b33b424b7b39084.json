			"previous": " The common starling s gift for mimicry has long been recognised In the medieval Welsh Mabinogion Branwen tamed a common starling taught it words and sent it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brothers Bran and Manawydan who then sailed from Wales to Ireland to rescue her 127 Pliny the Elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole sentences in Latin and Greek and in Henry IV William Shakespeare had Hotspur declare The king forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer But I will find him when he is asleep and in his ear I ll holler Mortimer Nay I ll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but Mortimer and give it to him to keep his anger still in motion ",
			"after": " Mozart had a pet common starling which could sing part of his Piano Concerto in G Major KV 453 117 He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously which had not yet been performed in public He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke K 522 might be written in the comical inconsequential style of a starling s vocalisation 34 Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions The words have no meaning for the starling so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs 128 Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak 34 ",
