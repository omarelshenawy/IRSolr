			"previous": " Outraged Don Salvador demanded that his son recant publicly Dal refused perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on December 28 1929 His father told him that he would be disinherited and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu s again The following summer Dal and Gala rented a small fisherman s cabin in a nearby bay at Port Lligat He bought the place and over the years enlarged it by buying the neighbouring fishermen cabins gradually building his much beloved villa by the sea Dal s father would eventually relent and come to accept his son s companion 26 ",
			"after": " In 1931 Dal painted one of his most famous works The Persistence of Memory 27 which introduced a surrealistic image of soft melting pocket watches The general interpretation of the work is that the soft watches are a rejection of the assumption that time is rigid or deterministic This idea is supported by other images in the work such as the wide expanding landscape and other limp watches shown being devoured by ants 28 ",
