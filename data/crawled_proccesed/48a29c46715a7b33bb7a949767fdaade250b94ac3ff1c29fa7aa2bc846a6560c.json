			"after": " Much of classical economics can be presented in simple geometric terms or elementary mathematical notation Mathematical economics however conventionally makes use of calculus and matrix algebra in economic analysis in order to make powerful claims that would be more difficult without such mathematical tools These tools are prerequisites for formal study not only in mathematical economics but in contemporary economic theory in general Economic problems often involve so many variables that mathematics is the only practical way of attacking and solving them Alfred Marshall argued that every economic problem which can be quantified analytically expressed and solved should be treated by means of mathematical work 126 ",
