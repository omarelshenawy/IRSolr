			"previous": " By December 1992 the airline became a joint stock company as a transitional step towards partial privatisation which was effected in late 1999 State Treasury 67 97 of shares in the company Regionalny Fundusz Gospodarczy S A 25 1 the employees 6 93 In 1994 the airline signed a code sharing agreement with American Airlines on flights to and from Warsaw as well as onward flights in the United States and Poland operated by both companies flights to Thessaloniki Zagreb and Nice were inaugurated and according to an IATA report in this year LOT had the youngest fleet of any airline in the world After years of planning in 1997 LOT set up a sister airline EuroLOT which essentially operating as its parent airline s regional subsidiary took over domestic flights The airline was developed with the hope that it would increase transit passenger flow through Warsaw s Chopin Airport whilst at the same time providing capacity on routes with smaller load factors and play a part in developing LOT s reputation as the largest transit airline in Central and Eastern Europe By 1999 LOT had purchased a number of small Embraer 145 regional jets in order to expand its short haul fleet and had with the approval of the Minister of the State Treasury begun a process of selling shares to the Swiss company SAirGroup Holding this then led to the airline s incorporation into the then nascent Qualiflyer Group ",
			"after": " Expansion of LOT s route network continued in the early 2000s and the potential of the airline s hub at Warsaw Chopin Airport to become a major transit airport was realised with more and more success In 2000 LOT took delivery of its largest ever order of 11 aircraft and by 2001 had reached a milestone passengers carried figure of 3 million customers in one year such an expansion led to the reconstruction of much of LOT s ground infrastructure and by 2002 a new central Warsaw head office was opened on Ul 17 Stycznia On 26 October 2003 LOT after the collapse of the Qualiflyer Group became the 14th member of the Star Alliance By 2006 a new base of operations with the reconstruction of Warsaw Chopin Airport had opened thus allowing LOT s full transit airline potential to be developed for the first time ever The new airport is much larger than any previous airport in Poland and has since provided LOT passengers with comfortable high quality service In that same year Pope Benedict XVI returned to Rome on a LOT flight following his pilgrimage to Poland ",
