			"after": " Knigge was recruited late in 1780 at a convention of the Rite of Strict Observance by Costanzo Marchese di Costanzo an infantry captain in the Bavarian army and a fellow Freemason Knigge still in his twenties had already reached the highest initiatory grades of his order and had arrived with his own grand plans for its reform Disappointed that his scheme found no support Knigge was immediately intrigued when Costanzo informed him that the order that he sought to create already existed Knigge and three of his friends expressed a strong interest in learning more of this order and Costanzo showed them material relating to the Minerval grade The teaching material for the grade was liberal literature which was banned in Bavaria but common knowledge in the Protestant German states Knigge s three companions became disillusioned and had no more to do with Costanza but Knigge s persistence was rewarded in November 1780 by a letter from Weishaupt Knigge s connections both within and outside of Freemasonry made him an ideal recruit Knigge for his own part was flattered by the attention and drawn towards the order s stated aims of education and the protection of mankind from despotism Weishaupt managed to acknowledge and pledge to support Knigge s interest in alchemy and the higher sciences Knigge replied to Weishaupt outlining his plans for the reform of Freemasonry as the Strict Observance began to question its own origins 12 ",
