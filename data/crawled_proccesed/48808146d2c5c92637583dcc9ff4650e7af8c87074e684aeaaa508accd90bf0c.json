			"after": " Helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions 48 It is an electrical insulator unless ionized As with the other noble gases helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential 10 Helium can form unstable compounds known as excimers with tungsten iodine fluorine sulfur and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge to electron bombardment or else is a plasma for another reason The molecular compounds HeNe HgHe10 and WHe2 and the molecular ions He 2 He2 2 HeH and HeD have been created this way 65 HeH is also stable in its ground state but is extremely reactive it is the strongest Br nsted acid known and therefore can exist only in isolation as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it comes into contact with This technique has also allowed the production of the neutral molecule He2 which has a large number of band systems and HgHe which is apparently held together only by polarization forces 10 ",
