			"previous": " Two major methods are employed to produce 100 million tonnes of O 2 extracted from air for industrial uses annually 68 The most common method is to fractionally distill liquefied air into its various components with N 2 distilling as a vapor while O 2 is left as a liquid 68 ",
			"after": " The other major method of producing O 2 gas involves passing a stream of clean dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 to 93 O 2 68 Simultaneously nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen saturated zeolite bed by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it in the reverse direction of flow After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline This is known as pressure swing adsorption Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non cryogenic technologies see also the related vacuum swing adsorption 76 ",
