			"previous": " Despite Australian fears the Japanese never intended to invade the Australian mainland While an invasion was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942 it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military s capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken 99 Instead in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands Fiji Samoa and New Caledonia 100 This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway 101 While these battles ended the threat to Australia the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid 1943 99 ",
			"after": " The collapse of British power in the Pacific also led Australia to reorient its foreign and military policy towards the United States In February 1942 the US and British Governments agreed that Australia would become a strategic responsibility of the United States and the Allied ANZAC Force was created specifically to defend the Australian continent In March General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Australia after escaping from the Philippines and assumed command of the South West Pacific Area SWPA All of the Australian military s combat units in this area were placed under MacArthur s command and MacArthur replaced the Australian Chiefs of Staff as the Australian Government s main source of military advice until the end of the war 102 Australian General Thomas Blamey was appointed the Allied land force commander but MacArthur did not permit him to command American forces 103 MacArthur also rejected US Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall s request that he appoint Australians to senior posts in his General Headquarters Nevertheless the partnership between Curtin and MacArthur proved beneficial for Australia between 1942 and 1944 as MacArthur was able to communicate Australian requests for assistance to the US Government 104 ",
