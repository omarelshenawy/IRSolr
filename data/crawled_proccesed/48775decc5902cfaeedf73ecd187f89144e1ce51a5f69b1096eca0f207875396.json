			"previous": " Armament also advanced during the war The rifle caliber machine guns that were common on prewar fighters could not easily down the more rugged warplanes of the era Air forces began to replace or supplement them with cannons which fired explosive shells that could blast a hole in an enemy aircraft rather than relying on kinetic energy from a solid bullet striking a critical component of the aircraft such as a fuel line or control cable or the pilot Cannons could bring down even heavy bombers with just a few hits but their slower rate of fire made it difficult to hit fast moving fighters in a dogfight Eventually most fighters mounted cannons sometimes in combination with machine guns ",
			"after": " The British epitomized this shift Their standard early war fighters mounted eight 303 inch 7 7 mm calibre machine guns whereas by mid war they often featured a combination of machine guns and 20 mm cannons and late in the war often only cannons The Americans in contrast had problems designing a native cannon design so instead placed multiple 50 caliber 12 7 mm heavy machine guns on their fighters Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and air to surface ordnance such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings and pressed into close air support roles as fighter bombers Although they carried less ordnance than light and medium bombers and generally had a shorter range they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability made it easier for them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles Moreover if they encountered enemy fighters their ordnance which reduced lift and increased drag and therefore decreased performance could be jettisoned and they could engage the enemy fighters which eliminated the need for fighter escorts that bombers required Heavily armed and sturdily constructed fighters such as Germany s Focke Wulf Fw 190 Britain s Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest and America s P 40 Corsair P 47 and P 38 all excelled as fighter bombers and since the Second World War ground attack has been an important secondary capability of many fighters ",
