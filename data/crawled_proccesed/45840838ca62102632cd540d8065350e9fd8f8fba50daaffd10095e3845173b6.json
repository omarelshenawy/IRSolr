			"previous": " Beckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates sitting on the bench in street clothes It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster Due to security concerns it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match rather than flying commercial MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches claiming they provide competitive advantage but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues Also instead of the usual MLS mandated modest hotels LA Galaxy stayed at the five star Le M ridien King Edward in downtown Toronto an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest 101 ",
			"after": " Two weeks after his 12 minute appearance vs Chelsea still not fully healed Beckham finally made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus DC United in front of the sellout crowd of 46 686 nearly three times the average DC United home crowd at the RFK Stadium coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute 102 Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal even if only 70 percent fit Beckham left a mark during the remaining twenty plus minutes He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pav n failed to finish on for the equaliser and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Donovan s path that United s keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment the Galaxy lost 1 0 The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium s artificial surface ",
