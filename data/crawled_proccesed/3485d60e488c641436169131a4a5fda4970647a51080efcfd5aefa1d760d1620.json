			"after": " Boletus frostii is a mycorrhizal species 24 meaning that the fungus forms associations with the roots of various species of trees These associations are mutualistic because the fungus absorbs mineral nutrients from the soil and channels these into the plant while the plant provides the fungus with sugars a product of photosynthesis The characteristic feature of the mycorrhiza is the presence of a sheath of fungal tissue that encases the terminal nutrient absorbing rootlets of the host plant The fungus forms an extensive underground network of hyphae that radiate outward from the surface of the root sheath effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption The hyphae also invade between the root cortical cells to form a Hartig net 25 Using pure culture techniques Boletus frostii has been shown to form mycorrhizae with Virginia pine Pinus virginiana 24 while a field study confirms a similar association with the oak Quercus laurina 26 ",
