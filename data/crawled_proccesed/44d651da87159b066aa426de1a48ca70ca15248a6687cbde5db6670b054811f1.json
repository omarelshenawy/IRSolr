			"previous": " Harold Innis s study of the effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on Canadian development and European empire sparked his interest in the complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and communications 51 During the 1940s Innis also began studying pulp and paper an industry of central importance to the Canadian economy This research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies 52 Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages newspapers and journalism books and advertising In other words from looking at a natural resource based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information and ultimately knowledge was a commodity that circulated had value and empowered those who controlled it 53 ",
			"after": " One of Innis s primary contributions to communications studies was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media He divided media into time binding and space binding types Time binding media are durable They include clay or stone tablets Space binding media are more ephemeral They include modern media such as radio television and mass circulation newspapers 54 ",
