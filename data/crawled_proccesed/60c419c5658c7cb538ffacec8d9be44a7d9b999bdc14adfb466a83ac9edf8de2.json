			"previous": " Shortly after Kelly s murder stories that the Ripper had drowned in the Thames began to circulate 27 In February 1891 the MP for West Dorset Henry Richard Farquharson announced that Jack the Ripper was the son of a surgeon who had committed suicide on the night of the last murder Although Farquharson did not name his suspect the description resembles Druitt Farquharson lived 10 miles 16 km from the Druitt family and was part of the same social class 78 The Victorian journalist George R Sims noted in his memoirs The Mysteries of Modern London 1906 the Ripper s body was found in the Thames after it had been in the river for about a month 79 Similar comments were made by Sir John Moylan Assistant Under Secretary of the Home Office the Ripper escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of 1888 and Sir Basil Thomson made Assistant Commissioner of the CID in 1913 the Ripper was an insane Russian doctor who escaped arrest by committing suicide in the Thames at the end of 1888 80 Neither Moylan nor Thomson was involved in the Ripper investigation 81 ",
			"after": " Assistant Chief Constable Sir Melville Macnaghten named Druitt as a suspect in the case in a private handwritten memorandum of 23 February 1894 Macnaghten highlighted the coincidence between Druitt s disappearance and death shortly after the last of the five murders on 9 November 1888 and claimed to have unspecified private information that left little doubt Druitt s own family believed him to have been the murderer 82 Macnaghten s memo was eventually discovered in his personal papers by his daughter Lady Aberconway who showed them to British broadcaster Dan Farson A slightly different abridged copy of the memo found in the Metropolitan Police archive was released to the public in 1966 83 Farson first revealed Druitt s initials MJD in a television programme in November 1959 84 ",
