			"previous": " In cold or inclement weather several nightjar species can slow their metabolism and go into torpor 21 notably the common poorwill which will maintain that state for weeks 22 The European nightjar has been observed in captivity to be able to maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown 19 ",
			"after": " Breeding is normally from late May to August but may be significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan Returning males arrive about two weeks before the females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V shape and tail fanned chasing intruders while wing clapping and calling Fights may take place in flight or on the ground The male s display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral If she lands he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground In good habitat there may be 20 pairs per square kilometre 50 per square mile 3 ",
