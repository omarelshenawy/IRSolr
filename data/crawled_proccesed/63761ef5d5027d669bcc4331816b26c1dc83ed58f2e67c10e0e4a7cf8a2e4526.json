			"previous": "  This figure was prepared by Robert A Rohde from public domain data and is incorporated into the Global Warming Art project  This plot is based on the NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis GISTEMP which combines the 2001 GISS land station analysis data set Hansen et al 2001 with the Rayner Reynolds oceanic sea surface temperature data set Rayner 2000 Reynolds et al 2002 The data itself was prepared through the GISTEMP online mapping tool and the specific dataset used is available here This data was replotted in a Mollweide projection with a continuous and symmetric color scale The smoothing radius is 1200 km meaning that the reported temperature may depend on measurement stations located up to 1200 km away if necessary ",
