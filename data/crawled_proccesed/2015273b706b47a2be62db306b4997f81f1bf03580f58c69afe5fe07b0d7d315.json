			"after": " Terrorism is the main systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion At present there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear terror are perpetrated for an ideological goal as opposed to a lone wolf attack and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non combatants Some definitions also include acts of unlawful violence and war The history of terrorist organizations suggests that they do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives which are often murky and undefined The word terrorism is politically and emotionally charged and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition Studies have found over 100 definitions of terrorism The concept of terrorism is itself controversial because it is often used by states to delegitimize political or foreign opponents and potentially legitimize the state s own use of terror against them A less politically and emotionally charged and better defined term used not only for terrorists and not including all those who have been described as terrorists is violent non state actor Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations for furthering their objectives It has been practiced by both right wing and left wing political parties nationalistic groups religious groups revolutionaries and ruling governments One form is the use of violence against noncombatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group cause or individual ",
