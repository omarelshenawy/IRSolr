			"previous": " The square of any positive or negative number is positive and the square of 0 is 0 Therefore no negative number can have a real square root However it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers called the complex numbers that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number This is done by introducing a new number denoted by i sometimes j especially in the context of electricity where i traditionally represents electric current and called the imaginary unit which is defined such that i2 1 Using this notation we can think of i as the square root of 1 but notice that we also have i 2 i2 1 and so i is also a square root of 1 By convention the principal square root of 1 is i or more generally if x is any non negative number then the principal square root of x is",
