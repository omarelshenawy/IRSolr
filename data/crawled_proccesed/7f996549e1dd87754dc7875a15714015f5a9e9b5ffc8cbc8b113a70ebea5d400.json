			"after": " The mile is an English unit of length standardised as exactly 1 609344 kilometres by international agreement in 1959  With qualifiers mile is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the Roman mile such as the nautical mile now 1 852 km exactly the Italian mile roughly 1 852 km and the Chinese mile now 500 m exactly The Romans divided their mile into 5 000 feet but the greater importance of furlongs in pre modern England meant that the statute mile was made equivalent to 5 280 feet or 1 760 yards in 1593 This form of the mile then spread to the British colonized nations who continue to employ the mile The US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate US survey mile 6336 3937 km continues to see some use While most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units the international mile continues to be used in some countries such as Liberia Myanmar the United Kingdom the United States and a number of countries with vastly less than a million inhabitants most of which are UK or US territories or have close historical ties with the UK or US ",
