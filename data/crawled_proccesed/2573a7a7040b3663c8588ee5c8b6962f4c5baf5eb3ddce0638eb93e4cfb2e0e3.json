			"previous": " Waxwings are not highly territorial and although normally solitary breeders several pairs may nest close together where there are a number of good nest sites 2 Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates and females may squabble over nest sites Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest showing the black throat and opening the bill The breeding display is almost the opposite of this the male erects his body and crest feathers and turns his head away from the female The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item often food to his partner placing it in her open bill In about 90 of cases this display does not lead to copulation 30 Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females 23 ",
			"after": " The nest built by both sexes is a cup of thin twigs lined with softer material such as fine grass moss fur or lichen It is constructed 1 3 15 m 4 50 ft above the ground in a pine or scrub commonly close to the trunk The eggs are a glossy pale blue spotted with black and grey and the clutch is 3 7 eggs although five or six is most common 14 19 The average size of the egg is 24 mm 18 mm 0 94 in 0 71 in and it weighs 3 8 g 0 13 oz of which 5 is shell The eggs are incubated for 13 14 days by the female alone 17 She is fed regurgitated berries by her mate and rarely leaves the nest The chicks are altricial and naked and have bright red mouths they are fed by both parents although the male brings most of the food mainly insects in the first few days The young are subsequently fed largely with fruit The chicks fledge about 14 16 days after hatching 2 They are fed by the adults for about two weeks after fledging 23 ",
