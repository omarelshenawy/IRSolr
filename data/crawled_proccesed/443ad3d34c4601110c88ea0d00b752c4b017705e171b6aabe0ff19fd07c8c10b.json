			"after": " All known Daspletosaurus fossils have been found in formations dating to the middle to late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period between 77 and 74 million years ago Since the middle of the Cretaceous North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface However the uplift of the Rocky Mountains in the Laramide Orogeny to the west which began during the time of Daspletosaurus forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards Rivers flowed down from the mountains and drained into the seaway carrying sediment along with them that formed the Two Medicine Formation the Judith River Group and other sedimentary formations in the region About 73 million years ago the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale 34 35 36 ",
