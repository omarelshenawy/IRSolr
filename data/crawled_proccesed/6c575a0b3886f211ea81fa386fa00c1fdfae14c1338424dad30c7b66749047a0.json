			"previous": " The spores are narrowly ellipsoid to ovoid thin walled hyaline translucent with dimensions of 4 5 5 by 2 3 m When stained with Melzer s reagent the spores turn a light blue color The basidia the spore bearing cells are four spored measure 16 20 by 3 5 4 m and taper gradually towards the base Cystidia are not differentiated in this species The cap surface is made of a cuticle of radial somewhat agglutinated rather coarse hyphae that differ chiefly in size from the underlying tissue initially 1 3 m in diameter becoming 5 7 m wide in the underlying tissue The hyphae are clamped and encrusted with shallow irregularly shaped masses that are most conspicuous in the surface cells The gill tissue is made of hyphae that project downward from the cap and arranged in a subparallel fashion meaning that the hyphae are mostly parallel to one another and are slightly intertwined The hyphae are clamped with a narrow branched compact subhymenium a narrow zone of small short hyphae immediately beneath the hymenium composed of hyphae 2 3 m in diameter The conidia are 8 5 12 by 4 5 m peanut shaped non amyloid not changing color when stained with Melzer s reagent clamped and produced by fragmentation of the coarse mycelium 1 Clamp connections are present in the hyphae 17 Asexual spores are 10 0 15 5 by 3 4 m ellipsoid to oblong non amyloid and contain granular contents 13 The grayish color of the fruit bodies is caused by encrusted pigments crystalline aggregates of pigment molecules possibly melanin that occur throughout the tissue of the stem and cap including the gills these pigments are absent in Collybia species 4 ",
