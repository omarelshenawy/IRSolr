			"previous": " Aside from Dutch traders who had had trading relations dating to the beginning of the Edo period 95 Westerners paid little notice to Japanese art before the mid 19th century and when they did they rarely distinguished it from other art from the East 95 Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg spent a year in the Dutch trading settlement Dejima near Nagasaki and was one of the earliest Westerners to collect Japanese prints The export of ukiyo e thereafter slowly grew and at the beginning of the 19th century Dutch merchant trader Isaac Titsingh s collection drew the attention of connoisseurs of art in Paris 96 ",
			"after": " The arrival in Edo of American Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 led to the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854 which opened Japan to the outside world after over two centuries of seclusion Ukiyo e prints were amongst the items he brought back to the United States 97 Such prints had appeared in Paris from at least the 1830s and by the 1850s were numerous 98 reception was mixed and even when praised ukiyo e was generally thought inferior to Western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy 99 Japanese art drew notice at the International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris 95 and became fashionable in France and England in the 1870s and 1880s 95 The prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping Western perceptions of Japanese art 100 At the time of their introduction to the West woodblock printing was the most common mass medium in Japan and the Japanese considered it of little lasting value 101 ",
