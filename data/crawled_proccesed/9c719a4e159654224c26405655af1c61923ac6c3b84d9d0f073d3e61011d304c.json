			"after": " The AV 8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack aircraft of metal and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral downward slope The aircraft is powered by a single Rolls Royce Pegasus turbofan engine which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine Two of these nozzles are located near the forward cold end of the engine and two are near the rear hot end of the engine This arrangement contrasts with most fixed wing aircraft which have engine nozzles only at the rear The Harrier II also has smaller valve controlled nozzles in the nose tail and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds 63 ",
