			"after": " Crag martin pairs nest alone or in small colonies usually containing fewer than ten nests 12 Nests are on average 30 m 100 ft apart and each pair aggressively defends its breeding territory against other crag martin and most other bird species Nesting takes place from May to August and usually two broods are raised The nest built by both adults is an open half cup made of mud and lined with soft material such as feathers or dry grass 26 It is constructed under an overhang on a rock cliff face in a crevice or cave or on a man made structure It takes one to three weeks to build and is re used for the second brood and in subsequent years The clutch is two to five eggs with an average of three The eggs are white with brownish blotches particularly at the wide end and average 20 2 x 14 0 mm 0 80 x 0 55 in with a weight of 2 08 g 0 073 oz The eggs are incubated mainly by the female for 13 17 days to hatching and the chicks take another 24 27 days to fledge Both parents feed the chicks bringing food every two to five minutes and the young are fed for 14 21 days after fledging 6 With such frequent feeding rates the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest since the further they fly to forage the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest 15 In an Italian study the hatching rate was 80 2 percent and the average number of fledged young was 3 1 27 ",
