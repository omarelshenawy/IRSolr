			"after": " There are public and private universities which provide medical tuition in Argentina with the fundamental and unresolved dispute being which system of education is of higher quality A person who can afford to attend a private university quite expensive for the average person will choose that over public education citation needed Nevertheless quality of education is generally not the reason they make that choice private universities have smaller groups of students in each class which means the professor can deliver a more tailored education by not having to deal with hundreds of students at a time The Universidad Adventista del Plata for instance has about 70 students in each class turning classes into an environment in which the students feel freer to participate and ask questions Another advantage of private over public is that it is considerably easier to be admitted In general the admission process for a public School of Medicine which involves a very competitive examination is more difficult than that of a private institution the main reason being a large number of applicants in public universities and not enough place for all who apply When it comes to educational quality however it is now generally believed that inequalities are not significant between public and private education citation needed ",
