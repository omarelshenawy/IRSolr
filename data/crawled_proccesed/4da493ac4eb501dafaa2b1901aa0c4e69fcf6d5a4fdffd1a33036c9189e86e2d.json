			"previous": " Euclid took a more abstract approach in his Elements one of the most influential books ever written Euclid introduced certain axioms or postulates expressing primary or self evident properties of points lines and planes He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical reasoning The characteristic feature of Euclid s approach to geometry was its rigor and it has come to be known as axiomatic or synthetic geometry At the start of the 19th century the discovery of non Euclidean geometries by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky 1792 1856 J nos Bolyai 1802 1860 and Carl Friedrich Gauss 1777 1855 and others led to a revival of interest in this discipline and in the 20th century David Hilbert 1862 1943 employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry ",
