			"after": " While most tanks are manufactured some fuel tanks are still fabricated by metal craftsmen or hand made in the case of bladder style tanks These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive aircraft motorcycles and even tractors Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank usually out of foam board Next design issues that affect the structure of the tank are addressed such as where the outlet drain fluid level indicator seams and baffles go Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and or ends and baffles for the tank Many fuel tanks baffles particularly in aircraft and racecars contain lightening holes These flanged holes serve two purposes they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles Toward the end of construction openings are added for the filler neck fuel pickup drain and fuel level sending unit Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell other times they are added at the end of the fabrication process Baffles and ends can be riveted into place The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered or flanged and brazed and or sealed with an epoxy type sealant or the ends can be flanged and then welded Once the soldering brazing or welding is complete the fuel tank is leak tested 1 ",
