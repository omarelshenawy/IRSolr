			"after": " The appearance of the woolly mammoth is probably the best known of any prehistoric animal due to the many frozen specimens with preserved soft tissue and depictions by contemporary humans in their art Fully grown males reached shoulder heights between 2 7 and 3 4 m 9 and 11 ft and weighed up to 6 tonnes 6 6 short tons This is almost as large as extant male African elephants which commonly reach 3 3 4 m 9 8 11 2 ft and is less than the size of the earlier mammoth species M meridionalis and M trogontherii and the contemporary M columbi The reason for the smaller size is unknown Female woolly mammoths averaged 2 6 2 9 m 8 5 9 5 ft in height and were built more lightly than males weighing up to 4 tonnes 4 4 short tons A newborn calf would have weighed about 90 kg 200 lb These sizes are deduced from comparison with modern elephants of similar size 29 Few frozen specimens have preserved genitals so the gender is usually determined through examination of the skeleton The best indication of sex is the size of the pelvic girdle as the birth canal is always wider in females than in males 30 Though the mammoths on Wrangel Island were smaller than those of the mainland their size varied and they were not small enough to be considered dwarves 31 It has been claimed that the last woolly mammoth populations decreased in size and increased their sexual dimorphism but this was dismissed in a 2012 study 32 ",
