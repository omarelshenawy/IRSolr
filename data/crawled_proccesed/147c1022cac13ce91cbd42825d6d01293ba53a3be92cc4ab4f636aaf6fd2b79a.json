			"after": " The reentry capsule Russian Spuskaemyi apparat SA also known as descent module is used for launch and the journey back to Earth Half of the reentry capsule is covered by a heat resistant covering to protect it during reentry this half faces the Earth during re entry It is slowed initially by the atmosphere then by a braking parachute followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing At one meter above the ground solid fuel braking engines mounted behind the heat shield are fired to give a soft landing One of the design requirements for the reentry capsule was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency internal volume divided by hull area The best shape for this is a sphere but such a shape can provide no lift which results in a purely ballistic reentry Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and cannot be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn That is why it was decided to go with the headlight shape that the Soyuz uses a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section seven degrees to a classic spherical section heat shield This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution The nickname was thought up at a time when nearly every headlight was circular Small dimensions of the reentry capsule led to it having only two man crews after the death of the Soyuz 11 crew The later Soyuz T spacecraft solved this issue Internal volume of Soyuz SA is 4 m 2 5 m is usable for crew living space ",
