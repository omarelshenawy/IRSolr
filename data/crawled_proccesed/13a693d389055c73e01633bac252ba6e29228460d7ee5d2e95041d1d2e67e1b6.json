			"after": " A substance can often be classified as an acid or a base There are several different theories which explain acid base behavior The simplest is Arrhenius theory which states than an acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when it is dissolved in water and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water According to Br nsted Lowry acid base theory acids are substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a chemical reaction by extension a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion ",
