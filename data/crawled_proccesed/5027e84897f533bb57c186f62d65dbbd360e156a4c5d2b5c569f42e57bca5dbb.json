			"previous": " The colt arrived at Churchill Downs in Louisville Kentucky on April 28 2014 and was one of the last Derby contenders to arrive He was flown in from California his first time on a plane and traveled quietly Once the plane landed however his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground based transportation 58 Upon arrival at Churchill Downs the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special saddle cloth to wear while exercising on the track identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name 104 The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error with California misspelled as Califorina 105 He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling 104 Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake 106 but Sherman s strategy was backed by Lukas 100 In the days leading up to the race California Chrome galloped on the track 107 was walked in the saddling paddock and became familiar with the starting gate 108 Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not particularly like that particular track saying he never actually felt comfortable on it 109 ",
