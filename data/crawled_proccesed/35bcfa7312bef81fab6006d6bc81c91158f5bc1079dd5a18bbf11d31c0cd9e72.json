			"after": " All large commercial aircraft have escape slides on the main doors of the plane but some do not have slides over the wings because when the flaps are fully lowered the wings are low enough to the ground that passengers can evacuate safely Some of these aircraft are the Embraer 190 Boeing 707 717 727 and 737 However other aircraft require the use of overwing slides for the window exits to ensure that passengers can reach the ground quickly and safely These include the Boeing 767 Boeing 757 and Airbus A320 series aircraft Typically overwing evacuation slides are not designed for use in ditching situations as they cannot be detached and will not operate as the system is disabled by the aspirators on the slide taking in water and Boeing recommends disarming the doors of a 747 before opening in a ditching situation ",
