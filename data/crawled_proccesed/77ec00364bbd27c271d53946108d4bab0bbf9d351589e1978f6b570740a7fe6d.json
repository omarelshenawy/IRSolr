			"previous": " The bog turtle s karyotype is composed of 50 chromosomes 4 Studies of variations in mitochondrial DNA indicate low levels of genetic divergence among bog turtle colonies This is unusual in species such as the bog turtle which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups fewer than 50 individuals in bog turtle colonies These conditions limit gene flow typically leading to divergence between isolated groups Data indicate that the bog turtle suffered dramatic reductions in numbers a population bottleneck as colonies were forced south in the face of glaciation Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post Pleistocene expansion as the bog turtles moved back into their former northern range This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity 33 The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia s Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War 31 ",
			"after": " The bog turtle is primarily diurnal active during the day and sleeping at night It wakes in the early morning basks until fully warm then begins its search for food 31 It is a seclusive species making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat 11 During colder days the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush underwater or buried in mud 10 Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle s ability to survive without oxygen 34 On warmer days the bog turtle s activities include scavenging mating during early spring and basking in sunlight the last of which it spends a great deal of the day doing 21 However the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day 31 Occasionally during times of extreme heat the turtle will either estivate 35 or become subterranean sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water 35 At night the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels 36 ",
