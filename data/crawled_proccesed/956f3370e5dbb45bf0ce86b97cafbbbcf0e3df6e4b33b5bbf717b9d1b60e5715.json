			"after": " Darwin proposes sexual selection driven by competition between males for mates to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes deer antlers peacock tails bird songs and the bright plumage of some male birds 105 He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex 1871 Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species but given the effectiveness of artificial selection he could see no limit to the amount of change to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings one with another and with their physical conditions of life which may be effected in the long course of time by nature s power of selection Using a tree diagram and calculations he indicates the divergence of character from original species into new species and genera He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred while new branches formed in the great Tree of life with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications 106 ",
