			"previous": " In 1861 there were concerns that the old style Poitevin was becoming extinct and questions about whether the Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had 28 The large Poitevin mares became rarer due to large amounts of crossbreeding and a lack of care shown towards breeding stock selection 16 Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses especially at the stud farms in St Maixent and La Roche sur Yon created the Anglo Poitevin type a half blood used by the army The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed 21 Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old type Poitevin bloodstock However a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed blood horses and farmers who preferred the former preserved the type which formed the base for the creation of the breed studbook 16 ",
			"after": " The studbook for the Poitevin horse was created by the Soci t Centrale d Agriculture des Deux S vres on June 26 1884 29 with a horse section and a donkey section 30 The first edition was released December 31 1885 29 setting the physical criteria for the breeding and ending the practice of promoting crossbred horses as purebreds It also marked the end of government intervention against the mule breeding industry although bonuses were paid to encourage farmers to breed purebred horses 16 In 1902 a breeding syndicate to promote Poitou mules was created but disappeared after a lack of advertising by stock breeders On August 6 1912 the French government released a decree officially supporting the mule breeding industry backed by the purchase of mules by the French National Stud and bonuses given to the best stallions 31 ",
