			"after": " Sylvanus Morley was an American archaeologist epigrapher and Mayanist scholar who made significant contributions towards the study of the pre Columbian Maya civilization in the early 20th century He is particularly noted for his extensive excavations of the Maya site of Chichen Itza He also published several large compilations and treatises on Maya hieroglyphic writing and wrote popular accounts on the Maya for a general audience To his contemporaries he was one of the leading Mesoamerican archaeologists of his day although more recent developments in the field have resulted in a re evaluation of his theories and works his publications particularly on calendric inscriptions are still cited Overall his commitment and enthusiasm for Maya studies would generate the interest and win the necessary sponsorship and backing to finance projects which would ultimately reveal much about the Maya of former times His involvement in clandestine espionage activities at the behest of the U S Office of Naval Intelligence was another surprising aspect of his career which came to light only well after his death ",
