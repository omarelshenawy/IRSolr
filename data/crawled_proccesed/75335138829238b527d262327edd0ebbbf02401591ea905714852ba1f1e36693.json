			"previous": " 1  The total energy of the aircraft is  Most modern sailplanes are equipped with Total Energy compensated variometers  Compensated variometers also include information about the speed of the aircraft so the total energy potential and kinetic is used not just the change in altitude For example if a pilot pushes forward on the stick speeding up as the plane dives an uncompensated variometer only indicates that altitude is being lost But the pilot could pull back on the stick trading the extra speed for altitude again A compensated variometer uses both speed and altitude to indicate the change in total energy So the pilot that pushes the stick forward diving to gain speed and then pulls back again to regain altitude will notice no change in total energy on a compensated variometer neglecting energy loss due to drag ",
