			"after": " When the term OpenContent was first used by Wiley it described works licensed under the Open Content License a non free share alike license see Free content below and perhaps other works licensed under similar terms 2 It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions The openness of content can be assessed under the 5Rs Framework based on the extent to which it can be reused revised remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law 3 Unlike open source and free content there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as open content ",
