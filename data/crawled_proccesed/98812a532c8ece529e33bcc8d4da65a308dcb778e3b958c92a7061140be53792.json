			"after": " Artillery powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly Handguns which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons were not recorded until the 1380s 96 Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces averaging between 19 6 and 22 kg 43 and 49 lb to fire from towers These guns were too heavy for a man to carry and fire but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature that of a horizontal timber across the opening A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon This adaptation is found across Europe and although the timber rarely survives there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands Gunports were keyhole shaped with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim 97 ",
