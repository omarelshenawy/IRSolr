			"after": " Other exercises were performed to demonstrate the AV 8A s suitability for operating from various amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers including a deployment of 14 Harriers aboard USS Franklin D Roosevelt for six months in 1976 108 The tests showed amongst other things that the Harrier was capable of performing in weather where conventional carrier aircraft could not 108 In support of naval operations the USMC devised and studied several methods to further integrate the Harrier One result was Arapaho a stand by system to rapidly convert civilian cargo ships into seagoing platforms for operating and maintaining a handful of Harriers to be used to augment the number of available ships to deploy upon 113 N 13 ",
