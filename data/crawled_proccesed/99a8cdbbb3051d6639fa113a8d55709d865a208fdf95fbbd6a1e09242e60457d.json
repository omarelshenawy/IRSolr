			"previous": " Channel coding is concerned with finding such nearly optimal codes that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity  This capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate R where R is usually bits per symbol For any information rate R C and coding error 0 for large enough N there exists a code of length N and rate R and a decoding algorithm such that the maximal probability of block error is that is it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error In addition for any rate R C it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error ",
