			"after": " Early Netherlandish painting refers to the work of artists sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives active in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands during the 15th and 16th century Northern Renaissance especially in the flourishing cities of Tournai Bruges Ghent and Brussels in modern day Belgium Their work followed the International Gothic style and began approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the early 1420s It lasted at least until the death of Gerard David in 1523 3 although many scholars extend it to the start of the Dutch Revolt in 1566 or 1568 Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but is seen as an independent artistic culture separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy Because the works of these painters represent the culmination of the northern European medieval artistic heritage and the incorporation of Renaissance ideals the painters are sometimes categorised as belonging to both the Early Renaissance and Late Gothic ",
