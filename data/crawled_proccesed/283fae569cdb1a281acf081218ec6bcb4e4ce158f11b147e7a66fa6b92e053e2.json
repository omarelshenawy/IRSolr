			"previous": " Gertie was McCay s first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds 62 McCay drew the foreground characters while art student neighbor John A Fitzsimmons traced the backgrounds 70 McCay pioneered the McCay Split System of inbetweening in which major poses or positions were drawn first and the intervening frames drawn after This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film s actions McCay refused to patent his system 71 and was sued in 1914 by animator John Randolph Bray 72 who took advantage of McCay s lapse by patenting many of McCay s techniques including the use of registration marks tracing paper the Mutoscope action viewer and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action 73 The lawsuit was unsuccessful and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued he thereafter received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques 74 ",
			"after": " Hearst was disappointed with the quality of McCay s newspaper work Infuriated that he couldn t reach McCay during a vaudeville performance Hearst pulled from his papers advertising for the theatre where McCay performed 75 Editor Arthur Brisbane told him that he was a serious artist not a comic cartoonist 76 and that he was to give up his comic strip work to focus on editorial illustrations 76 Hearst pressured McCay s agents to reduce the number of his vaudeville appearances and he was induced to sign a contract with Hearst that limited his vaudeville appearances to greater New York 69 with occasional exceptions 77 In February 1917 Hearst had McCay give up entirely on vaudeville and all other paid work outside the Hearst empire though he was occasionally granted permission for particular shows Hearst increased McCay s salary to cover the loss of income 78 ",
