			"after": " New Forest ponies have a gentle temperament and a reputation for intelligence strength and versatility 3 On the whole they are a sturdy and hardy breed 5 The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia a muscular condition also found in humans dogs cats and goats It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009 after a clinically affected foal was presented to the Equine Clinic of Utrecht University DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1 a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle 6 7 The mutated allele was found in both the foal s parents its siblings and two other related animals none of whom exhibited any clinical signs The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin the founder of the mutated gene as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion 6 8 The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje s Ronaldo testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding Cattle Society s stud book and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested whether or not they descend from Kantje s Ronaldo to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested 9 ",
