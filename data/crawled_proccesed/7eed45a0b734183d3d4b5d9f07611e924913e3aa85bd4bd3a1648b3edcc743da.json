			"previous": " Although psilocybin may be prepared synthetically outside of the research setting it is not typically used in this form The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies by preparing a herbal tea or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste 27 In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously 46 The effects of the drug begin 10 40 minutes after ingestion and last 2 6 hours depending on dose species and individual metabolism 99 The half life of psilocybin is 163 64 minutes when taken orally or 74 1 19 6 minutes when injected intravenously 1 A dosage of 4 10 mg corresponding roughly to 50 300 micrograms per kilogram g kg of body weight is required to induce psychedelic effects A typical recreational dosage is 10 50 mg psilocybin which is roughly equivalent to 10 50 grams of fresh mushrooms or 1 5 grams of dried mushrooms 46 A small number of people are unusually sensitive to psilocybin such that a normally threshold level dose of about 2 mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses In contrast there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person s response to psilocybin 99 ",
