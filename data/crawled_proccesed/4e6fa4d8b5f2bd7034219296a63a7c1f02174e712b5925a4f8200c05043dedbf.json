			"previous": " Outside the temple building proper was the temple enclosure surrounded by a rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder 109 On occasion this function was more than symbolic especially during the last native dynasties in the fourth century BC when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion 110 In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks so that the top of the wall undulated vertically This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos 111 ",
			"after": " The walls enclosed many buildings related to the temple s function Some enclosures contain satellite chapels dedicated to deities associated with the temple god including mammisis celebrating the birth of the god s mythological child The sacred lakes found in many temple enclosures served as reservoirs for the water used in rituals as places for the priests to ritually cleanse themselves and as representations of the water from which the world emerged 96 Mortuary temples sometimes contain a palace for the spirit of the king to whom the temple was dedicated built against the temple building proper 112 The temple of Seti I at Abydos incorporates an unusual underground structure the Osireion which may have served as a symbolic tomb for the king 113 Sanatoria in some temples provided a place for the sick to await healing dreams sent by the god Other temple buildings included kitchens workshops and storehouses to supply the temple s needs 114 Especially important was the pr n or house of life where the temple edited copied and stored its religious texts including those used for temple rituals The house of life also functioned as a general center of learning containing works on non religious subjects such as history geography astronomy and medicine 115 Although these outlying buildings were devoted to more mundane purposes than the temple itself they still had religious significance even granaries might be used for specific ceremonies 114 ",
