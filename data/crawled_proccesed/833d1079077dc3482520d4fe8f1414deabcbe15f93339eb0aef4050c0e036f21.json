			"previous": " It has been suggested that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island 55 A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct 88 ",
			"after": " Some controversy surrounds the date of their extinction The last widely accepted record of a dodo sighting is the 1662 report by shipwrecked mariner Volkert Evertsz of the Dutch ship Arnhem who described birds caught on a small islet off Mauritius now suggested to be Amber Island ",
