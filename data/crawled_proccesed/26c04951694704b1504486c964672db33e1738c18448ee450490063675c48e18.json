			"after": " In oscilloscope CRTs electrostatic deflection is used rather than the magnetic deflection commonly used with television and other large CRTs The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an electric field between a pair of plates to its left and right and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size ",
