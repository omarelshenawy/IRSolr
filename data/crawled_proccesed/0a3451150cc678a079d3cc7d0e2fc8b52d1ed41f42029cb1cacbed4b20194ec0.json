			"previous": " On April 18 1985 a few months after taking his Senate seat Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country s president Daniel Ortega Though Ortega had won internationally certified elections the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses The Sandinista government was opposed by the right wing CIA backed rebels known as the Contras While in Nicaragua Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict Through the senators Ortega offered a cease fire agreement in exchange for the US dropping support of the Contras The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a propaganda initiative designed to influence a House vote on a 14 million Contra aid package but Kerry said I am willing to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas The House voted down the Contra aid but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a 200 million loan the next day which in part prompted the House to pass a larger 27 million aid package six weeks later 76 ",
			"after": " Meanwhile Kerry s staff began their own investigations and on October 14 issued a report that exposed illegal activities on the part of Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North who had set up a private network involving the National Security Council and the CIA to deliver military equipment to right wing Nicaraguan rebels Contras In effect North and certain members of the President s administration were accused by Kerry s report of illegally funding and supplying armed militants without the authorization of Congress Kerry s staff investigation based on a year long inquiry and interviews with fifty unnamed sources is said to raise serious questions about whether the United States has abided by the law in its handling of the contras over the past three years 77 ",
