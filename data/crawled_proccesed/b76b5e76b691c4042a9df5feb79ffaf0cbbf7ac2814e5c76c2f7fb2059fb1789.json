			"previous": " Yinreng proved to be unworthy of the succession despite his father showing favoritism towards him He was said to have beaten and killed his subordinates and was alleged to have had sexual relations with one of his father s concubines which was deemed incest and a capital offence Yinreng also purchased young children from Jiangsu to satisfy his pedophiliac pleasure In addition Yinreng s supporters led by Songgotu gradually formed a Crown Prince Party that aimed to help Yinreng get the throne as soon as possible even if it meant using unlawful methods ",
			"after": " Over the years Kangxi kept constant watch over Yinreng and became aware of his son s many flaws while their relationship gradually deteriorated In 1707 Kangxi decided that he could no longer tolerate Yinreng s behavior which he partially mentioned in the imperial edict as never obeying ancestors virtues never obliged to my order only doing inhumanity and devilry only showing maliciousness and lust 20 and decided to strip Yinreng of his position as crown prince Kangxi placed his oldest surviving son Yinzhi in charge of overseeing Yinreng s house arrest Yinzhi an unfavored Shu son knowing he had no chance of being selected recommended the eighth prince Yinsi and requested his father to order Yinreng s execution Kangxi was enraged and stripped Yinzhi of his titles Kangxi commanded his subjects to cease debating the succession issue but despite this and attempts to reduce rumours and speculation as to who the new crown prince might be the imperial court s daily activities were disrupted Yinzhi s actions caused Kangxi to suspect that Yinreng might have been framed so he restored Yinreng as crown prince in 1709 with the support of the 4th and 13th princes and on the excuse that Yinreng had previously acted under the influence of mental illness ",
