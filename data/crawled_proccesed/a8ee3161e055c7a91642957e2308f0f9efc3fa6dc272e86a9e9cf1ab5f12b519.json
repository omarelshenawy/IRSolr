			"previous": " Samuel Hartlib who was exiled in Britain and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms wrote in 1641 that the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people knowing their own rights and liberties will not be governed by way of oppression 21 Both churchmen and governments were concerned that print allowed readers eventually including those from all classes of society to study religious texts and politically sensitive issues by themselves instead of having their thinking mediated by the religious and political authorities citation needed ",
			"after": " In the Muslim world printing especially in Arabic scripts was strongly opposed throughout the early modern period though sometimes printing in Hebrew or Armenian script was permitted Thus the first movable type printing in the Ottoman Empire was in Hebrew in 1493 22 According to an imperial ambassador to Istanbul in the middle of the sixteenth century it was a sin for the Turks to print religious books In 1515 Sultan Selim I issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death At the end of the sixteenth century Sultan Murad III permitted the sale of non religious printed books in Arabic characters yet the majority were imported from Italy Ibrahim Muteferrika established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the Ulama It operated until 1742 producing altogether seventeen works all of which were concerned with non religious utilitarian matters Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century 23 ",
