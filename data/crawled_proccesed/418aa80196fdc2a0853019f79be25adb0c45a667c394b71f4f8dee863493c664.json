			"after": " The delta wing is a triangle shape which may be used for a number of reasons As a flexible Rogallo wing it allows a stable shape under aerodynamic forces and so is often used for kites and other ultralight craft As a supersonic wing it combines high strength with low drag and so is often used for fast jets ",
