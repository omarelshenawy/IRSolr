			"after": " Crocodilians are ectotherms producing relatively little heat internally and relying on external sources to raise their body temperatures The sun s heat is the main means of warming for any crocodilian while immersion in water may either raise its temperature by conduction or cool the animal in hot weather The main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural For example an alligator in temperate regions may start the day by basking in the sun on land A bulky animal it warms up slowly but at some time later in the day it moves into the water still exposing its dorsal surface to the sun At night it remains submerged and its temperature slowly falls The basking period is extended in winter and reduced in summer For crocodiles in the tropics avoiding overheating is generally the main problem They may bask briefly in the morning but then move into the shade remaining there for the rest of the day or submerge themselves in water to keep cool Gaping with the mouth can provide cooling by evaporation from the mouth lining 61 By these means the temperature range of crocodilians is usually maintained between 25 and 35 C 77 and 95 F and mainly stays in the range 30 to 33 C 86 to 91 F 62 ",
