			"previous": " The behaviour and appearance for an individual male remain constant through its adult life and are determined by a simple genetic polymorphism 33 Territorial behaviour and appearance is recessive to satellite behaviour and appearance 38 It was originally thought that the difference between the two types of males was due to a sex linked genetic factor but in fact the genetic locus relevant for the mating strategy is located on an autosome or non sex chromosome That means that both sexes can carry the two different forms of the gene not just males The non territorial female does not normally show evidence of its genetic type but when females are given testosterone implants they display the male territorial behaviour corresponding to their genotype 39 ",
			"after": " Although satellite males are on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents the nutrition of the chicks does not as previously thought influence mating strategy rather the inherited mating strategy influences body size Resident type chicks will if provided with the same amount of food grow heavier than satellite type chicks Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory and can spend more time foraging so they do not need to be as bulky as the residents indeed since they fly more there would be a physiological cost to additional weight 33 ",
