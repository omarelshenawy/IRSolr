			"previous": " Economic efficiency describes how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs or in other words the amount of waste is reduced A widely accepted general standard is Pareto efficiency which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off ",
			"after": " The production possibility frontier PPF is an expository figure for representing scarcity cost and efficiency In the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods say guns and butter The PPF is a table or graph as at the right showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs which limit feasible total output Each point on the curve shows potential total output for the economy which is the maximum feasible output of one good given a feasible output quantity of the other good ",
