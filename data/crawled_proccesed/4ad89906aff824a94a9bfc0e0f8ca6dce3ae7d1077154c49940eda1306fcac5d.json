			"previous": " The type object most commonly used to define Ringerike Style is a 2 15 m high carved stone from Vang in Oppland Apart from a runic memorial inscription on its right edge the main field of the Vang Stone is filled with a balanced tendril ornament springing from two shell spirals at the base the main stems cross twice to terminate in lobed tendrils At the crossing further tendrils spring from loops and pear shaped motifs appear from the tendril centres on the upper loop Although axial in conception a basic asymmetry arises in the deposition of the tendrils Surmounting the tendril pattern appears a large striding animal in double contoured rendering with spiral hips and a lip lappet Comparing the Vang Stone animal design with the related animal from the Mammen axe head the latter lacks the axiality seen in the Vang Stone and its tendrils are far less disciplined the Mammen scroll is wavy while the Vang scroll appears taut and evenly curved these features marking a key difference between Mammen and Ringerike ornament The inter relationship between the two styles is obvious however when comparing the Vang Stone animal with that found on the Jelling Stone ",
