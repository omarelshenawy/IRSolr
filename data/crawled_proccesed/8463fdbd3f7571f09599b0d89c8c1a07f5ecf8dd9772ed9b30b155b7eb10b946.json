			"after": " Classically metabolism is studied by a reductionist approach that focuses on a single metabolic pathway Particularly valuable is the use of radioactive tracers at the whole organism tissue and cellular levels which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products 120 The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome Overall these studies give a good view of the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell 121 ",
