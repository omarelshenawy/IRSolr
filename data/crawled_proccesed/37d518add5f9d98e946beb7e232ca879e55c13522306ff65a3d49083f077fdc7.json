			"previous": " The most important fundamental initiating causes and failure mechanisms are to be identified and analyzed with engineering tools A diverse set of practical guidance and practical performance and reliability requirements should be provided to designers so they can generate low stressed designs and products that protect or are protected against damage and excessive wear Proper Validation of input loads requirements may be needed and verification for reliability performance by testing may be needed ",
			"after": " One of the most important design techniques is redundancy This means that if one part of the system fails there is an alternate success path such as a backup system The reason why this is the ultimate design choice is related to the fact that high confidence reliability evidence for new parts items is often not available or extremely expensive to obtain By creating redundancy together with a high level of failure monitoring and the avoidance of common cause failures even a system with relative bad single channel part reliability can be made highly reliable mission reliability on system level No testing of reliability has to be required for this Furthermore by using redundancy and the use of dissimilar design and manufacturing processes different suppliers for the single independent channels less sensitivity for quality issues early childhood failures is created and very high levels of reliability can be achieved at all moments of the development cycles early life times and long term Redundancy can also be applied in systems engineering by double checking requirements data designs calculations software and tests to overcome systematic failures ",
