			"previous": " Ragusa Ibla the lower city boasts an impressive array of Baroque architecture which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi designed in 1738 Illustration 12 In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps 38 a Baroque feature especially exploited in Sicily due to the island s topography The tower seems to explode from the fa ade accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls Above the doorways and window apertures pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820 ",
			"after": " In an alley connecting Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore is the church of Santa Maria delle Scale This church is interesting though badly damaged in the earthquake Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman with Gothic features thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque ",
