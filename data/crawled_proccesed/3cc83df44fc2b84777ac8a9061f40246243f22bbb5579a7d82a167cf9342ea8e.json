			"previous": " Considering the extent of Priestley s influence relatively little scholarship has been devoted to him In the early 20th century Priestley was most often described as a conservative and dogmatic scientist who was nevertheless a political and religious reformer 186 In a historiographic review essay historian of science Simon Schaffer describes the two dominant portraits of Priestley the first depicts him as a playful innocent who stumbled across his discoveries the second portrays him as innocent as well as warped for not understanding their implications better Assessing Priestley s works as a totality has been difficult for scholars because of his wide ranging interests His scientific discoveries have usually been divorced from his theological and metaphysical publications to make an analysis of his life and writings easier but this approach has been challenged recently by scholars such as John McEvoy and Robert Schofield Although early Priestley scholarship claimed that his theological and metaphysical works were distractions and obstacles to his scientific work scholarship published in the 1960s 1970s and 1980s maintained that Priestley s works constituted a unified theory However as Schaffer explains no convincing synthesis of his work has yet been expounded 187 More recently in 2001 historian of science Dan Eshet has argued that efforts to create a synoptic view have resulted only in a rationalisation of the contradictions in Priestley s thought because they have been organized around philosophical categories and have separate d the producers of scientific ideas from any social conflict 188 ",
