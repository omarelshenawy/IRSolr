			"previous": " While the Tomcat was being used by Iran in combat against Iraq in its intended air superiority mission in the early 1980s the U S Navy found itself flying regular daily combat missions over Lebanon to photograph activity in the Bekaa Valley At the time the Tomcat had been thought too large and vulnerable to be used over land but the need for imagery was so great that Tomcat aircrews developed high speed medium altitude tactics to deal with considerable AAA and SA 7 SAM threat in the Bekaa area The first exposure of a Navy Tomcat to a SA 2 missile was over Somalia in April 1983 when a local battery was unaware of two Tomcats scheduled for a TARPS mission in prelude to an upcoming international exercise in vicinity of Berbera An SA 2 was fired at the second Tomcat while conducting 10 000 ft mapping profile at max conserve setting The Tomcat aircrews spotted the missile launch and dove for the deck thereby evading it without damage The unexpected demand for combat TARPS laid the way for high altitude sensors such as the KA 93 36 in 910 mm Long Range Optics LOROP to be rapidly procured for the Tomcat as well as an Expanded Chaff Adapter ECA to be incorporated in an AIM 54 Phoenix Rail Commercial Fuzz buster type radar detectors were also procured and mounted in pairs in the forward cockpit as a stop gap solution to detect SAM radars such as the SA 6 The ultimate solution was an upgrade to the ALR 67 then being developed but it would not be ready until the advent of the F 14A later in 1980s citation needed ",
			"after": " The participation of the F 14 in the 1991 Operation Desert Storm consisted of Combat Air Patrol CAP over the Red Sea and Persian Gulf and overland missions consisting of strike escort and reconnaissance Until the waning days of Desert Storm in country air superiority was tasked to USAF F 15 Eagles due to the way the Air Tasking Orders ATO delegated primary overland CAP stations to the F 15 Eagle The governing Rules of Engagement ROE also dictated a strict Identification Friend or Foe IFF requirement when employing Beyond Visual Range weapons such as the AIM 7 Sparrow and particularly the AIM 54 Phoenix This hampered the Tomcat from using its most powerful weapon Furthermore the powerful emissions from the AWG 9 radar are detectable at great range with a radar warning receiver Iraqi fighters routinely retreated as soon as the Tomcats lit them up with the AWG 9 45 46 The U S Navy suffered its only F 14 loss from enemy action on 21 January 1991 when BuNo 161430 an F 14A upgraded to an F 14A from VF 103 was shot down by an SA 2 surface to air missile while on an escort mission near Al Asad airbase in Iraq Both crew survived ejection with the pilot being rescued by USAF Special Forces and the RIO being captured by Iraqi troops as a POW until the end of the war 47 The F 14 also achieved its final kill in US service an Mi 8 Hip helicopter with an AIM 9 Sidewinder ",
