			"after": " Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils have been found in the Twin Mountains Formation of northern Texas the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma and the Cloverly Formation of north central Wyoming These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age Based on changes in ammonite taxa the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage which lasted from 125 to 112 million years ago 40 The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages suggesting a similar age for the Antlers 41 Therefore Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago 5 ",
