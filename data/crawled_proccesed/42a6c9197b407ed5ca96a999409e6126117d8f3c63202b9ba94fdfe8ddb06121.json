			"previous": " Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC though it didn t expand outside Italy until the 3rd century BC In a sense then it was an empire long before it had an Emperor 9 The Roman Republic was not a nation state in the modern sense but a network of towns left to rule themselves though with varying degrees of independence from the Roman Senate and provinces administered by military commanders It was ruled not by Emperors but by annually elected magistrates Roman Consuls above all in conjunction with the Senate 10 For various reasons the 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval which ultimately led to rule by Emperors 11 The consuls military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium which literally means command though typically in a military sense 12 Occasionally successful consuls were given the honorary title Imperator commander and this is the origin of the word Emperor and Empire since this title among others was always bestowed to the early Emperors upon their accession 13 ",
			"after": " Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts conspiracies and civil wars from the late second century BC onwards while greatly extending its power beyond Italy Towards the end of this period in 44 BC Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Phillipi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar s adopted son Octavian Antony and Octavian s division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian s forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps first citizen with proconsular imperium thus beginning the Principate the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284 and gave him the name Augustus the venerated Though the old constitutional machinery remained in place Augustus came to predominate it Although the Republic stood in name contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome 14 Since his rule ended a century of civil wars and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure During the years of his rule a new constitutional order emerged in part organically and in part by design so that upon his death this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new Emperor The 200 years that began with Augustus rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana Roman Peace During this period the cohesion of the Empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent but put down mercilessly and swiftly when they occurred 15 The sixty years of Jewish Roman wars in the second half of the first century and the first half of the 2nd century were exceptional in their duration and violence 16 ",
