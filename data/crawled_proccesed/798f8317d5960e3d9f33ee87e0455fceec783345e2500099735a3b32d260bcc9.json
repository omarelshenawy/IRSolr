			"after": " The term subfossil can be used to refer to remains such as bones nests or defecations whose fossilization process is not complete either because the length of time since the animal involved was living is too short less than 10 000 years or because the conditions in which the remains were buried were not optimal for fossilization Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years 46 The main importance of subfossil vs fossil remains is that the former contain organic material which can be used for radiocarbon dating or extraction and sequencing of DNA protein or other biomolecules Additionally isotope ratios can provide much information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology ",
