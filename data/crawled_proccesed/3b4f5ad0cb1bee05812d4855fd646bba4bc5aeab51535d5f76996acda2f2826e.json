			"previous": " The Atlas Mountains which extend across much of Morocco northern Algeria and Tunisia are part of the fold mountain system that also runs through much of Southern Europe They recede to the south and east becoming a steppe landscape before meeting the Sahara desert which covers more than 75 percent of the region The sediments of the Sahara overlie an ancient plateau of crystalline rock some of which is more than four billion years old ",
			"after": " Sheltered valleys in the Atlas Mountains the Nile Valley and delta and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals rice and cotton and woods such as cedar and cork are grown Typical Mediterranean crops such as olives figs dates and citrus fruits also thrive in these areas The Nile Valley is particularly fertile and most of the population in Egypt and Sudan live close to the river Elsewhere irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins ",
