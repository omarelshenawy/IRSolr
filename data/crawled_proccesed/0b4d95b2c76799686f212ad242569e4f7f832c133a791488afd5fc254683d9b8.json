			"previous": " Another NASA project the engineers were interested in was the supercritical airfoil designed by Richard Whitcomb The supercritical design promised to greatly lower transonic drag as much as a swept wing in some situations This allowed an aircraft with such a wing to have low drag in cruise while also having a wing planform more suitable to lower speed flight swept wings have several undesirable characteristics at low speed Additionally the design has a larger leading edge radius that makes it particularly suitable for low speed high lift applications like a transport Boeing incorporated the concept into their design the first non experimental aircraft to do so ",
