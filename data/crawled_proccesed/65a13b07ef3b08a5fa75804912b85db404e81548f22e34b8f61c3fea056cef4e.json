			"previous": " During his second season in Vienna Mahler acquired a spacious modern apartment on the Auenbruggerstrasse and built a summer villa on land he had acquired next to his new composing studio at Maiernigg 58 In November 1901 he met Alma Schindler the stepdaughter of painter Carl Moll at a social gathering that included the theatre director Max Burckhard 87 Alma was not initially keen to meet Mahler on account of the scandals about him and every young woman who aspired to sing in opera 88 The two engaged in a lively disagreement about a ballet by Alexander von Zemlinsky Alma was one of Zemlinsky s pupils but agreed to meet at the Hofoper the following day 87 This meeting led to a rapid courtship Mahler and Alma were married at a private ceremony on 9 March 1902 Alma was by then pregnant with her first child 89 a daughter Maria Anna who was born on 3 November 1902 A second daughter Anna was born in 1904 67 ",
			"after": " Friends of the couple were surprised by the marriage and dubious of its wisdom Burckhard called Mahler that rachitic degenerate Jew unworthy for such a good looking girl of good family 90 On the other hand Mahler s family considered Alma to be flirtatious unreliable and too fond of seeing young men fall for her charms 91 Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarian Natalie Bauer Lechner his earlier partner said that living with him was like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves 92 Alma soon became resentful that on Mahler s insistence that there could only be one composer in the family she had given up her music studies She wrote in her diary How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of things closest to one s heart 93 Mahler s requirement that their married life be organised around his creative activities imposed strains and precipitated rebellion on Alma s part the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion particularly from Mahler n 7 ",
