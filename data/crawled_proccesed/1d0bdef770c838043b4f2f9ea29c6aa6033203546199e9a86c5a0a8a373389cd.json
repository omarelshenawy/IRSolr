			"previous": " where is the tangent of the Poiseuille parabola intersecting the wall Although L v que s solution was specific to heat transfer into a Poiseuille flow his insight helped lead other scientists to an exact solution of the thermal boundary layer problem 4 Schuh observed that in a boundary layer u is again a linear function of y but that in this case the wall tangent is a function of x 5 He expressed this with a modified version of L v que s profile ",
			"after": " This results in a very good approximation even for low numbers so that only liquid metals with much less than 1 cannot be treated this way 4 In 1962 Kestin and Persen published a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions 6 For the problem of a flat plate with a temperature jump at they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary layer equation to an ordinary differential equation The solution to this equation the temperature at any point in the fluid can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function 3 Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function 7 ",
