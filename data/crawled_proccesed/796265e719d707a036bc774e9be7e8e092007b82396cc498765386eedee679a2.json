			"after": " Some enzymes produce a sigmoid v by S plot which often indicates cooperative binding of substrate to the active site This means that the binding of one substrate molecule affects the binding of subsequent substrate molecules This behavior is most common in multimeric enzymes with several interacting active sites 28 Here the mechanism of cooperation is similar to that of hemoglobin with binding of substrate to one active site altering the affinity of the other active sites for substrate molecules Positive cooperativity occurs when binding of the first substrate molecule increases the affinity of the other active sites for substrate Negative cooperativity occurs when binding of the first substrate decreases the affinity of the enzyme for other substrate molecules ",
