			"previous": " A month later Einstein s works were among those targeted by Nazi book burnings with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming Jewish intellectualism is dead 65 One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase not yet hanged offering a 5 000 bounty on his head 65 67 In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born who had already emigrated from Germany to England Einstein wrote I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise 65 After moving to the U S he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment and more than anything else in the world fear the influence of men of intellectual independence 68 197",
