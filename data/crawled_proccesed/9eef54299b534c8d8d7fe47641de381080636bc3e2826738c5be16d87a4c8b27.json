			"previous": " Statistical mixtures of states are different from a linear combination A statistical mixture of states is a statistical ensemble of independent systems Statistical mixtures represent the degree of knowledge whilst the uncertainty within quantum mechanics is fundamental Mathematically a statistical mixture is not a combination using complex coefficients but rather a combination using real valued positive probabilities of different states A number represents the probability of a randomly selected system being in the state Unlike the linear combination case each system is in a definite eigenstate 5 6 ",
			"after": " There is no state which is simultaneously an eigenstate for all observables For example we cannot prepare a state such that both the position measurement Q t and the momentum measurement P t at the same time t are known exactly at least one of them will have a range of possible values a This is the content of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation ",
