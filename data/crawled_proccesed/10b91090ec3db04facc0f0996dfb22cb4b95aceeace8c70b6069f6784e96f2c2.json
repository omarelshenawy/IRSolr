			"previous": " The source of the Nile is sometimes considered to be Lake Victoria but the lake has feeder rivers of considerable size The Kagera River which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba is the longest feeder although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera and hence the most distant source of the Nile itself 15 It is either the Ruvyironza which emerges in Bururi Province Burundi 16 or the Nyabarongo which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda 17 The two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda Tanzania border ",
