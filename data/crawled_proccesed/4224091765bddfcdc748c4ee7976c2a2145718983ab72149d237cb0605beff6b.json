			"previous": " The term negrito was coined by the Spaniards based on their appearance The word negrito would be misinterpreted and used by future European scholars as an ethnoracial term in and of itself Both Christianized Negritos who lived in the colony and un Christianized Negritos who lived in tribes outside of the colony were classified as negritos Christianized Negritos who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for Indios A person of mixed Negrito and Austronesian ancestry were classified based on patrilineal descent the father s ancestry determined a child s legal classification If the father was negrito and the mother was India Austronesian the child was classified as negrito If the father was indio and the mother was negrita the child was classified as indio Persons of Negrito descent were viewed as being outside of the social order as they usually lived in tribes outside of the colony and resisted conversion to Christianity ",
			"after": " This legal system of racial classification based on patrilineal descent had no parallel anywhere in the Spanish ruled colonies in the Americas In general a son born of a sangley male and an indio or mestizo de sangley female was classified as mestizo de sangley all subsequent male descendants were mestizos de sangley regardless of whether they married an India or a mestiza de sangley A daughter born in such a manner however acquired the legal classification of her husband i e she became an India if she married an indio but remained a mestiza de sangley if she married a mestizo de sangley or a sangley In this way a chino mestizo male descendant of a paternal sangley ancestor never lost his legal status as a mestizo de sangley no matter how little percentage of Chinese blood he had in his veins or how many generations had passed since his first Chinese ancestor he was thus a mestizo de sangley in perpetuity ",
