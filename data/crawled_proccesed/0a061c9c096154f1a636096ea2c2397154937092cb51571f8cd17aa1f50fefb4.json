			"previous": " All known Daspletosaurus fossils have been found in formations dating to the middle to late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period between 77 and 74 million years ago Since the middle of the Cretaceous North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface However the uplift of the Rocky Mountains in the Laramide Orogeny to the west which began during the time of Daspletosaurus forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards Rivers flowed down from the mountains and drained into the seaway carrying sediment along with them that formed the Two Medicine Formation the Judith River Group and other sedimentary formations in the region About 73 million years ago the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale 34 35 36 ",
			"after": " Daspletosaurus lived in a vast floodplain along the western shore of the interior seaway Large rivers watered the land occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment When water was plentiful the region could support a great deal of plant and animal life but periodic droughts also struck the region resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments including the Daspletosaurus bonebed 37 Similar conditions exist today in East Africa 38 Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash also resulting in large scale mortality while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group including offshore and nearshore marine habitats coastal wetlands deltas and lagoons in addition to the inland floodplains 35 The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations 36 ",
