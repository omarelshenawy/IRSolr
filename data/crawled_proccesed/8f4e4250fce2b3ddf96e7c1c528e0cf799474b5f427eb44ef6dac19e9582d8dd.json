			"after": " The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569 It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course known as rhumb lines or loxodromes as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians While the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects which makes the projection conformal the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles where the scale becomes infinite So for example Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger relative to land masses near the equator than they actually are ",
