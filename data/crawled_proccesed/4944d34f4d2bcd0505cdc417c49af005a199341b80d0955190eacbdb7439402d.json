			"previous": " Cassatt admired Degas whose pastels had made a powerful impression on her when she encountered them in an art dealer s window in 1875 I used to go and flatten my nose against that window and absorb all I could of his art she later recalled It changed my life I saw art then as I wanted to see it 30 She accepted Degas invitation with enthusiasm and began preparing paintings for the next Impressionist show planned for 1878 which after a postponement because of the World s Fair took place on April 10 1879 She felt comfortable with the Impressionists and joined their cause enthusiastically declaring we are carrying on a despairing fight need all our forces 31 Unable to attend cafes with them without attracting unfavorable attention she met with them privately and at exhibitions She now hoped for commercial success selling paintings to the sophisticated Parisians who preferred the avant garde Her style had gained a new spontaneity during the intervening two years Previously a studio bound artist she had adopted the practice of carrying a sketchbook with her while out of doors or at the theater and recording the scenes she saw 32 ",
