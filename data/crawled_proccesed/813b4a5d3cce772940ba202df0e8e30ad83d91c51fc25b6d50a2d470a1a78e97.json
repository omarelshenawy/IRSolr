			"after": " In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system Or rather individual statements cannot be validated on their own only coherent systems can be justified A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations As explained above observation is a cognitive act That is it relies on a pre existing understanding a systematic set of beliefs An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs such as those that describe the optics of telescopes the mechanics of the telescope mount and an understanding of celestial mechanics If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system a change in some auxiliary assumption rather than a rejection of the theoretical system ",
