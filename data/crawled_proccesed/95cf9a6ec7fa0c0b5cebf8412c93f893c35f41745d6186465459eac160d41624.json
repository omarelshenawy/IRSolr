			"previous": " Very little is known about Diophantus of Alexandria he probably lived in the third century CE that is about five hundred years after Euclid Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus s Arithmetica survive in the original Greek four more books survive in an Arabic translation The Arithmetica is a collection of worked out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations usually of the form or Thus nowadays we speak of Diophantine equations when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found ",
			"after": " Diophantus also studied the equations of some non rational curves for which no rational parametrisation is possible He managed to find some rational points on these curves elliptic curves as it happens in what seems to be their first known occurrence by means of what amounts to a tangent construction translated into coordinate geometry which did not exist in Diophantus s time his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve that other point is a new rational point Diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction ",
