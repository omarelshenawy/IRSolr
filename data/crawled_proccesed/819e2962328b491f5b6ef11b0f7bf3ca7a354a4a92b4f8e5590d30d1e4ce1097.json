			"previous": " The extant book contains preliminary matter the complete text of the Gospels of Matthew Mark and Luke and the Gospel of John through John 17 13 The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century AD The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels Breves causae Gospel summaries Argumenta short biographies of the Evangelists and Eusebian canon tables It is probable that like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning Novum opus in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation It is also possible though less likely that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus in which he explains the use of the canon tables 27 Of all the insular Gospels only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter ",
			"after": " There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26 which is currently inserted at the end of the prefatory matter for John The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios The second list fragment on folio 26 contains about a fourth of the list for Luke The list for Luke would require an additional three folios The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27 so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John 28 ",
