			"previous": " In 1924 Mir joined the Surrealist group The already symbolic and poetic nature of Mir s work as well as the dualities and contradictions inherent to it fit well within the context of dream like automatism espoused by the group Much of Mir s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Mir referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as x in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris 9 The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Mir s dream paintings ",
