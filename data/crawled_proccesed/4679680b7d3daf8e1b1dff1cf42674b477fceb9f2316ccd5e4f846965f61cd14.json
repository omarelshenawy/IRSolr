			"after": " The earliest breeding of the ancestors of the Cleveland Bay was done in large part by English churches and monasteries to meet a need for pack horses to carry trade goods between abbeys and monasteries in northeast England 2 These medieval horses gained the nickname of Chapman Horses because of their use by travelling merchants known as chapmen 6 What is now the Cleveland Bay was developed from Barb and Andalusian horses crossed with Chapman Horse mares The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their Grand Tour of Europe bought off the docks in Marseilles and transported back to England 14 The Andalusian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in Cordoba and given to English royalty by the King of Spain The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses and the first infusion of Andalusian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses The Spanish horses also made their way to the outlying estates of English nobility and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell s men after the English Civil War Once in the hands of Cromwell s men many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses adding a second infusion of Andalusian bloodlines In the late 17th century a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at Tangier or from the Moors themselves 15 ",
