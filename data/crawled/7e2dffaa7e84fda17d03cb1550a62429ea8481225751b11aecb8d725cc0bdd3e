Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as fisheries or salt evaporation ponds; they might be in effect for a limited time.[189] Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military,[190] and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty.[191] In-kind taxes were accepted from less-monetized areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.[192]"],"after":["The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity.[188] Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile.[193] Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household to appear before the presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.[193]"]}}}
