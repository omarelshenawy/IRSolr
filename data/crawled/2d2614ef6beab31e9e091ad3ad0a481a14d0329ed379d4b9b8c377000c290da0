The very first ballistic missile to reach space was the German V-2 on October 3, 1942 which reached an altitude of 60 miles (97Â km).[5] Then in the 1950s the USA and USSR concurrently developed much longer range Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM)s all of which were based on the V-2 Rocket and the work of the scientists at Peenemunde. There are now many countries who possess ICBMs and even more with shorter range IRBMs (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles)."]}}}
