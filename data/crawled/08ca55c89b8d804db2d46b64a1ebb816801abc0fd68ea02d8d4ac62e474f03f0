The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall,[159] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.[160] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \"S.P.Q.L.\" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose.[161] The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.[162]"],"after":["While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[163] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interior, which was added in the mid-19th century.[164] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.[165] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,[166] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style,[167][168] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren[169] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to larger site in the south of the city). Since 1908 it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.[167]"]}}}
