The old line of locks in Runcorn fell into disuse in the late 1930s, and they were closed under the Ship Canal Act of 1949 and filled in. The Ship Canal Act of 1966 allowed the closure and filling in of the newer line of locks.[115] The gates from this flight of locks were removed and installed at Devizes on the Kennet and Avon Canal.[citation needed] The Duke's warehouse in Manchester was demolished in 1960.[1]"]}}}
