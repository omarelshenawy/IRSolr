He attended church regularly. In 1907, concerning the motto \"In God We Trust\" on money, he wrote, \"It seems to me eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins, just as it would be to cheapen it by use on postage stamps, or in advertisements.\" He was also a member of the Freemasons and Sons of the American Revolution.[191]"]}}}
