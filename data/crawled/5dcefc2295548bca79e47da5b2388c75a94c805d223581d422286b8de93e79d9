At this time, he wrote the poem \"Açların Gözbebekleri\" (\"Pupils of the Hungry\"), which introduced free verse into the Turkish language for, essentially, the first time.[27] Much of Nâzım Hikmet's poetry subsequent to this breakthrough would continue to be written in free verse, though his work exerted little influence for some time due largely to censorship of his work owing to his Communist political stance, which also led to his spending several years in prison. Over time, in such books as Simavne Kadısı Oğlu Şeyh Bedreddin Destanı (\"The Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin, Son of Judge Simavne\", 1936) and Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları (\"Human Landscapes from My Country\", 1939), he developed a voice simultaneously proclamatory and subtle."],"after":["Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the publication of a small volume of verse preceded by an essay and entitled Garip (\"Strange\"). The authors were Orhan Veli Kanık (1914–1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915–2002), and Oktay Rifat (1914–1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, \"to explore the people's tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art\".[28] To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French poets like Jacques Prévert, they employed not only a variant of the free verse introduced by Nâzım Hikmet, but also highly colloquial language, and wrote primarily about mundane daily subjects and the ordinary man on the street. The reaction was immediate and polarized: most of the academic establishment and older poets vilified them, while much of the Turkish population embraced them wholeheartedly. Though the movement itself lasted only ten years—until Orhan Veli's death in 1950, after which Melih Cevdet Anday and Oktay Rifat moved on to other styles—its effect on Turkish poetry continues to be felt today."]}}}
