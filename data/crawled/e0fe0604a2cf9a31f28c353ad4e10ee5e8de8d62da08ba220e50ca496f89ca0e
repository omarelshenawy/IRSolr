An English example of this would be ff in shelf‌ful; a German example would be Schifffahrt (\"boat trip\").[note 2] Some computer programs (such as TeX) provide a setting to disable ligatures for German, while some users have also written macros to identify which ligatures to disable.[6][7]"],"after":["Turkish distinguishes dotted and dotless \"I\". In a ligature with f (in words such as fırın (\"oven\") and fikir (\"idea\")), this contrast would be obscured. The fi ligature is therefore not used in Turkish typography, and neither are other ligatures like that for fl, which would be rare anyway."]}}}
