Reuters has been careful to use the word terrorist only in quotes, whether quotations or scare quotes. Reuters global news editor Stephen Jukes wrote, \"We all know that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and that Reuters upholds the principle that we do not use the word terrorist.\" The Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz responded, \"After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and again after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Reuters allowed the events to be described as acts of terror. But as of last week, even that terminology is banned.\" Reuters later apologised for what they described as \"the insensitive manner\" in which they characterized their policy and said their policy is \"to avoid the use of emotional terms and not make value judgments concerning the facts we attempt to report accurately and fairly\".[11]"]}}}
