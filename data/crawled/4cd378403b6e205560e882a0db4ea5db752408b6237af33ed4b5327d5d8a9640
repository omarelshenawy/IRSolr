In contrast, Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) pointed out that life depends on a \"negative entropy flow\".[25] Ilya Prigogine (1917–2003) stated that other thermodynamic systems which, like life, are also far from equilibrium, can also exhibit stable spatio-temporal structures. Soon afterward, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions[26] were reported, which demonstrate oscillating colors in a chemical solution.[27] These nonequilibrium thermodynamic branches reach a bifurcation point, which is unstable, and another thermodynamic branch becomes stable in its stead.[28]"],"after":["In free space (that is, space not containing electric charges), the equations take the form (using SI units):[29]"]}}}
