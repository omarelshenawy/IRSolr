As the concept of aircraft carriers was still very new, the lessons learned were incorporated in a 1921–23 refit. Her official sea trials were conducted in September 1923, and she was commissioned on 26 February 1924. The new ship was sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in June, and alternated between refits in the United Kingdom (1926, 1929) and the Mediterranean until 1931, when Eagle was sent to show the flag on a South American cruise. Between her major refits in 1931–32 and 1936, Eagle was sent to the China Station before rotating back to the Mediterranean. After 1936, she was sent back to the Far East, and was there when the Second World War broke out in September 1939. For the next seven months, Eagle was used for anti-raider patrols, but when one of her own aircraft bombs exploded on board in March 1940, the carrier was forced to sail to Singapore for repairs. Soon after, Eagle was again moved to the Mediterranean, where she protected convoys until May 1941, when she was sent to Gibraltar. She spent the next several months in the South Atlantic, on guard against German raiders.[60]"]}}}
