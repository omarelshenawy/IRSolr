In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in The Electrical Experimenter: \"As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation!\"[101]"],"after":["During his time at his lab, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded may be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to reporter Julian Hawthorne at the Philadelphia North American on 8 December 1899[103] and in a December 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the Red Cross Society where he referred to messages \"from another world\" that read \"1... 2... 3...\".[104][105] Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars.[106] He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article \"Talking With Planets\" where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets.[107] It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado[108]—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.[109]"]}}}
