This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide,[28] for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.[29] By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.[30] Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle.[28] Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.[31][32] Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased transport electrification and energy efficiency."]}}}
