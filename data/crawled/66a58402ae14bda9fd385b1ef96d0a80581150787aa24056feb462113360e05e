Estate names are still used to write addresses; estates and quarters are used in describing real estate, especially on St. John[11] and St. Croix.[12] More densely populated towns such as Frederiksted and Christiansted on St. Croix were historically referred to as \"districts\", in contrast to the surrounding plantation land."]}}}
