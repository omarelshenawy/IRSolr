Tarn calls a list and description of satrapies of Alexander's Empire written between 324 and 323 BC as an ancient gazetteer.[5] Tarn notes that the document is dated no later than June 323 BC, since it features Babylon as not yet partitioned by Alexander's generals.[6] It was revised by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC.[6] In the 1st century BC, Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentioned the chronicle-type format of the writing of the logographers in the age before the founder of the Greek historiographic tradition, Herodotus (i.e.,Â before the 480s BC), saying \"they did not write connected accounts but instead broke them up according to peoples and cities, treating each separately.\"[7] Historian Truesdell S. Brown asserts that what Dionysius describes in this quote about the logographers should be categorized not as a true \"history\" but rather as a gazetteer.[7] While discussing the Greek conception of the river delta in ancient Greek literature, Francis Celoria notes that both Ptolemy and Pausanias of the 2nd century AD provided gazetteer information on geographical terms.[8]"]}}}
