The chart week runs from Sunday to Saturday, and the top 40 singles are revealed each Sunday on BBC Radio 1. Before the advent of music downloads, it was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets, but since 2005 permanent downloads have been included in the chart compilation.[1][2]"]}}}
