Ayya Vaikundar incarnated from the Sea, and came to Detchanam (Swamithope) and performed Tavam for six years in the place which was now known as Vatakku Vasal in Swamithope. Then he was arrested by Kalineesan after the trial he was carried in a Vahana by his devotees to Swamithope where he incinerated the evil spirits and unified the Seven Virgins with himself. Then after the marriage with the deities in Ambalappathi he returned to Swamithope. According to Akilattirattu Ammanai, Swamithope is the only place Narayana (Vaikundar) slept (in Tamil: Pallikolluthal) after the incarnation. He attained Vaikundam and his ponnmenikkoodu (Sacred Golden Body) was interred in the place which is now the Palliyarai of Swamithope. (more...)"]}}}
