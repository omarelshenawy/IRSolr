This included a McDonald's promotional tie-in and a Warren Beatty interview conducted by Barbara Walters on 20/20. \"I find the media's obsession with promotion and demographics upsetting,\" Beatty said. \"I find all this anti-cultural.\" In attempting to market Dick Tracy to young children, Disney added a new Roger Rabbit cartoon short (Roller Coaster Rabbit) and made two specific television advertisements centered on The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). In total, Disney commissioned 28 TV advertisements.[3] Playmates Toys manufactured a line of 14 Dick Tracy figures.[23]"]}}}
