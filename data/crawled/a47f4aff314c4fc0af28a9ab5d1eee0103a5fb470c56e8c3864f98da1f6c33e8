During this period, millions of Chinese—the majority crying openly or otherwise displaying some kind of sadness—and many foreign dignitaries (including heads of state such as Albania's Enver Hoxha and North Korea's Kim Il-sung) filed past Mao to pay their final respects. At 15:00 Beijing time on September 18, a somber cacophony of guns, sirens, whistles and horns all across China was spontaneously blown in observance of a three-minute silence. Simultaneously, those who heard the sustained noise ceased all activity.[citation needed] After that, a band in Tiananmen Square, packed with and surrounded by millions of people, played \"The Internationale\".[citation needed] The final service on that day was concluded by Hua Guofeng's 20-minute-long eulogy atop Tiananmen Gate.[citation needed] Mao's body was later permanently interred in a mausoleum in Beijing.[220]"],"after":["Mao remains a controversial figure and there is little agreement over his legacy both in China and abroad. Supporters generally credit him with and praise him for having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war. He is also credited for having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education. His policies caused the deaths of tens of millions of people during his 27-year reign, more than any other Twentieth Century leader, however supporters point out that in spite of this, life expectancy improved during his reign. His supporters claim that he rapidly industrialised China; however, others have claimed that his policies such as the \"Great Leap Forward\" and the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\", were impediments to industrialisation and modernisation. His supporters claim that his policies laid the groundwork for China's later rise to become an economic superpower, while others claim that his policies delayed economic development and that China's economy only underwent its rapid growth after Mao's policies had been widely abandoned. Mao's revolutionary tactics continue to be used by insurgents, and his political ideology continues to be embraced by many Communist organizations around the world."]}}}
