On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the Somali people ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960.[35] In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke. Shermarke would be assassinated two years later by one of his own bodyguards. His murder was quickly followed by a military coup d'Ã©tat on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somalian Army seized power without encountering armed opposition. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.[36] The new regime would go on to rule Somalia for the next 21 years."]}}}
