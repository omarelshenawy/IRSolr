Biographers Fraser and Navarro write that the tour had its genesis in an invitation the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Per贸n. For political reasons it was decided that Eva, rather than Juan Per贸n, should make the visit. Fraser and Navarro write that Argentina had only recently emerged from its \"wartime quarantine\", thus taking its place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States. Therefore, a visit to Franco, with Ant贸nio Salazar of Portugal the last remaining west European authoritarian leaders in power, would be diplomatically frowned upon internationally. Fraser and Navarro write that Eva decided that, if Juan Per贸n would not accept Franco's invitation for a state visit to Spain, then she would. Advisors then decided that Eva should visit many European countries in addition to Spain. This would make it seem that Eva's sympathies were not specifically with Franco's fascist Spain but with all of Europe. The tour was billed not as a political tour but as a non-political \"goodwill\" tour.[27]"]}}}
