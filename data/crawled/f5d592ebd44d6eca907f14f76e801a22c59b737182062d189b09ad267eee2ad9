Later, he and his wife, encouraged by Matilda Joslyn Gage, became members of the Theosophical Society in 1892.[49] Baum's beliefs are often reflected in his writing. The only mention of a church in his Oz books is the porcelain one which the Cowardly Lion breaks in the Dainty China Country in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Baums believed in God,[citation needed] but felt that religious decisions should be made by mature minds and not religious authorities. As a result, they sent their older sons to \"Ethical Culture Sunday School\" in Chicago, which taught morality, not religion.[50][51]"],"after":["This list omits those stories that appeared in Our Landlady, American Fairy Tales, Animal Fairy Tales, Little Wizard Stories of Oz, and Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz."]}}}
