They are an active fire protection device. Because smoke rises, most detectors are mounted on the ceiling or high on a wall. To avoid the nuisance of false alarms, most smoke detectors are mounted away from kitchens. To increase the chances of waking sleeping occupants, most homes have at least one smoke detector near any bedrooms."]}}}
