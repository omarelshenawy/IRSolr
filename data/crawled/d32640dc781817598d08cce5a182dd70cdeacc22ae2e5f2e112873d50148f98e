For this reason, she is called the Mother of Miami. In 1891, when her father died and left her his land in Florida she relocated to Biscayne Bay. She then purchased the James Egan grant of 640 acres, where the city of Miami is now located, on the north side of the river, including the old Fort Dallas stone buildings, which she converted into her home and the pride of her life. Tuttle repaired and converted the home into one of the show places in the area with a sweeping view of the river and Biscayne Bay. Under an agreement between the two, Tuttle supplied Flagler with the land for a hotel and a railroad station for free, and they split the remainder of her 640 acres (2.6 km²) north of the Miami River in alternating sections. On April 22, 1896, train service of the Florida East Coast Railway came to the area. On July 28, male residents voted to incorporate a new city, Miami. Thereafter, the city steadily grew from a small town to a sophisticated metropolis."]}}}
