Fossil faunal and floral assemblages, both marine and terrestrial, make for distinctive marker horizons.[11] Tephrochronology is a method for geochemical correlation of unknown volcanic ash (tephra) to geochemically fingerprinted, dated tephra. Tephra is also often used as a dating tool in archaeology, since the dates of some eruptions are well-established."]}}}
