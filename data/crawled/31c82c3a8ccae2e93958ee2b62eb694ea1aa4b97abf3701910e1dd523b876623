Thus the term \"green beans\" means \"green\" in the sense of unripe (many are in fact not green in color). In some cases, the beans inside the pods of \"green beans\" are too small to comprise a significant part of the cooked fruit. Beans have significant amounts of fiber and soluble fiber, with one cup of cooked beans providing between nine and 13Â grams of fiber. Soluble fiber can help lower blood cholesterol. Beans are also high in protein, complex carbohydrates, folate, and iron."]}}}
