In 2004 an Indian parliamentary committee backed up CSE's findings[citation needed] and a government-appointed committee was tasked with developing the world's first pesticide standards for soft drinks. The Coca-Cola Company has responded that its plants filter water to remove potential contaminants and that its products are tested for pesticides and must meet minimum health standards before they are distributed.[136] In the Indian state of Kerala sale and production of Coca-Cola, along with other soft drinks, was initially banned after the allegations, until the High Court in Kerala overturned ruled that only the federal government can ban food products. Coca-Cola has also been accused of excessive water usage in India.[137]"],"after":["Coca-Cola has a high degree of identification with the United States, being considered by some an \"American Brand\" or as an item representing America.
