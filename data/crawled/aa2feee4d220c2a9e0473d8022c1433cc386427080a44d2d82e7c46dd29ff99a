These licenses are designed to address issues specific to hardware designs.[5] In these licenses, many of the fundamental principles expressed in open-source software (OSS) licenses have been \"ported\" to their counterpart hardware projects. Organizations tend to rally around a shared license. For example, Opencores prefers the LGPL or a Modified BSD License,[6] FreeCores insists on the GPL,[7] Open Hardware Foundation promotes \"copyleft\" or other permissive licenses\",[8] the Open Graphics Project uses a variety of licenses, including the MIT license, GPL, and a proprietary license,[9] and the Balloon Project wrote their own license.[10] New hardware licenses are often explained as the \"hardware equivalent\" of a well-known OSS license, such as the GPL, LGPL, or BSD license."]}}}
