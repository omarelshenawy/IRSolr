All queries are logged at Special:CheckUserLog, which is visible only to other CheckUsers through Special:CheckUser. Each entry in the log will show who ran the check, when, the check reason, and what type of data was called (the tool can be used to get IPs, edits from an IP, or users for an IP). The log does not display, nor allow for the retention of, data returned from a check."]}}}
