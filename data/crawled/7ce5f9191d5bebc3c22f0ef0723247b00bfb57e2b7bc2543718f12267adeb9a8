The constant k must be determined to allow a non-trivial v to satisfy the boundary condition on C. Such values of k2 are called the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in D, and the associated solutions are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in D. The Sturmâ€“Liouville theory may be extended to this elliptic eigenvalue problem (Jost, 2002)."]}}}
