In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the Carolingian Empire, which was divided in 843.[20] The Holy Roman Empire comprised the eastern portion of Charlemagne's original kingdom and emerged as the strongest. Its territory stretched from the Eider River in the north to the Mediterranean coast in the south.[20] Under the reign of the Ottonian emperors (919–1024), several major duchies were consolidated, and the German king Otto I was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962. In 996 Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor.[21] The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the reign of the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy.[22]"],"after":["In the 12th century, under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs, encouraging German settlement in these areas and further east (Ostsiedlung). Members of the Hanseatic League, including many north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[23] The edict of the Golden Bull in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.[24] Population declined in the first half of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, then the Black Death of 1348–50.[25]"]}}}
