On the other hand, the integral of n/z along c(r) divided by 2πi is equal to n. But the difference between the two numbers is"],"after":["The numerator of the rational expression being integrated has degree at most n − 1 and the degree of the denominator is n + 1. Therefore, the number above tends to 0 as r → +∞. But the number is also equal to N − n and so N = n."]}}}
