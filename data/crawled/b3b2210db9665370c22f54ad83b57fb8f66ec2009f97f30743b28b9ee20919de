The film of the same name won an Academy Award and grossed more than $80 million in the US.[27]"],"after":["Songs from the film were hits on pop charts around the world, while \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" reached No. 1 and the title track reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. At one point in 1984, Prince simultaneously had the No. 1 album, single, and film in the US; it was the first time a singer had achieved this feat.[28] Prince won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for Purple Rain, and the album is ranked 72nd Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[29] The album is included on the list of Time magazine's All-Time 100 Albums.[30] After Tipper Gore heard her 12-year-old daughter Karenna listening to Prince's song \"Darling Nikki\", she founded the Parents Music Resource Center.[31] The center advocates the mandatory use of a warning label (\"Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics\") on the covers of records that have been judged to contain language or lyrical content unsuitable for minors. The recording industry later voluntarily complied with this request.[32] Of what is considered the Filthy Fifteen Prince's compositions appear no. 1 and no. 2, with the fourth position occupied by his protégée Vanity.[33]"]}}}
