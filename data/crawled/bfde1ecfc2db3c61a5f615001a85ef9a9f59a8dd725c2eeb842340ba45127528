He used paper or white leather treated with silver nitrate. Although he succeeded in capturing the shadows of objects placed on the surface in direct sunlight, and even made shadow-copies of paintings on glass, it was reported in 1802 that \"[t]he images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of silver.\" The shadow images eventually darkened all over because \"[n]o attempts that have been made to prevent the uncoloured part of the copy or profile from being acted upon by light have as yet been successful.\"[8] Wedgwood may have prematurely abandoned his experiments due to frail and failing health; he died aged 34 in 1805."]}}}
