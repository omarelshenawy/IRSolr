Each selection should contain eight historically relevant and interesting did you know selections, that have been through the DYK process; in its current form its elements consist of relevant hooks from the list of most popular hooks, organized by month. Remember to avoid systematic bias; give regional and topical balance by, for instance, limiting the amount of WWII-related hooks to one or two per selection."],"after":[]}}}
