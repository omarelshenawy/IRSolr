In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport.[33] However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.[34]"]}}}
