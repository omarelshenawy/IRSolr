The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their county councils had enough revenue to remain competitive (Cheshire County Council would have ceased to exist).[34] Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the Metropolitan Borough of Bury and the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. Bury and Rochdale were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed \"Botchdale\" by local MP Michael Fidler)[35][36] but were divided into separate boroughs. To re-balance the districts, the borough of Rochdale took Middleton from Oldham.[37] During the passage of the bill, the towns of Whitworth, Wilmslow and Poynton successfully objected to their incorporation in the new county.[34]"],"after":["The Local Government Act 1972 reformed local government in England by creating a system of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country.[38] The act formally established Greater Manchester on 1April 1974,[40] although Greater Manchester County Council (GMCC) had been running since elections in 1973.[41] The leading article in The Times on the day the Local Government Act came into effect noted that the \"new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively\".[42] Frangopulo noted that the creation of Greater Manchester \"was the official unifying of a region which, through history and tradition, had forged for itself over many centuries bondsÂ ... between the communities of town and village, each of which was the embodiment of the character of this region\".[43] The name Greater Manchester was adopted, having been favoured over Selnec by the local population.[44]"]}}}
