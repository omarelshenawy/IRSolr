The most prominent of these roads are part of three different numbered highway systems, two of which are designated at the federal level, and one at the state level. There are other roads in Washington, including city and county maintained roads, and Forest Highways, none of which are maintained by WSDOT. Several ferry routes, such as the Vashon Island – Seattle passenger-only ferry route – Washington State Route 339, have been codified into state law as a state highway, despite not being located on land."],"after":[]}}}
