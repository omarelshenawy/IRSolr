But when he did not, the singer decided to involve herself voluntarily.[2] She pursued the part of Mahoney, but offered to work for minimum wages to avoid favoritism.[3] Principal photography for Dick Tracy began on February 2, 1989 and ended three months later.[4] The filmmakers considered shooting the film on-location in Chicago, Illinois, but production designer Richard Sylbert believed that Dick Tracy would work better using sound stages and backlots at Universal Studios in Universal City, California.[4][5] Other filming took place at Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California.[6] Beatty often encouraged dozens of takes of every scene.[4] The film was released in the United States on June 15, 1990,[7] and was the third-highest opening weekend of 1990.[8] Dick Tracy was the ninth-highest grossing film in the US in 1990, and number twelve globally.[8][9] The film also received positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times praised the matte paintings, art direction and prosthetic makeup design, stating: \"Dick Tracy is one of the most original and visionary fantasies I've seen on a screen\".[10]"]}}}
