Similar to Munzee, a BIT Cache is a laminated card with a QR code, URL and a password needed for logging. More information is available at bitcaching.com.[12] They are listed exclusively on opencaching.us.[13][14][15]"],"after":["Virtual caches are coordinates for a location, which has some other described object. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with information such as a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with GPS receiver in hand.[16] New virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,[17] but they remain fully supported at other sites such as Opencaching.us and the rest of the Opencaching Network.[14] Earthcaches are virtual caches that are organized by the Geological Society of America. The cacher usually has to perform a task which teaches him/her an educational lesson about the earth science of the cache area.[16] Locationless/Reverse caches are similar to a scavenger hunt. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates an example of this object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.[16] Webcam caches are virtual caches whose coordinates have a public webcam. The finder is often required to capture their image from the webcam for verification of the find.[16] New webcam caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,[17] but they remain fully supported at other sites such as Opencaching.us and the rest of the Opencaching Network.[14] Finally, a USB Cache or Dead Drop cache[14] location has a USB drive embedded (with permission) into walls or other structures. The cache is retrieved by connecting a device that has a USB port and that is able to read standard text files."]}}}
