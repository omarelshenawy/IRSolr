This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the Canton Evening Repository, intended to \"raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules\".[8] Another meeting held on September 17, 1920 resulted in the renaming of the league to the American Professional Football Association (APFA).[8] The league hired Jim Thorpe as their first president, and consisted of 14 teams. Only two of these teams, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), remain.[9]"],"after":["Although the league did not maintain official standings for their 1920 inaugural season and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 (8 wins, 0 losses, and 3 ties) record.[10] The following season resulted in the Chicago Staleys controversially winning the title over the Buffalo All-Americans.[11] In 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League (NFL).[12]"]}}}
