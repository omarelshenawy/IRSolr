She performed it while holding a Kalashnikov rifle, a common weapon among many rebels, while one of her dancers held an Israeli Uzi submachine gun.[35] Madonna and four dancers then participated in a faux fight and pretended to shoot their weapons and fire bullets. During the performance Lil Wayne appeared on the backdrop screens to perform his verse. It was noted that during the performance Madonna resembled a gunfighter in the style of Kill Bill.[36] During her concert in Phoenix, Madonna pointed her rifle to their fans, while in Miami, she faked murdering her masked dancers.[37][38] According to Jane Stevenson from Jam!, \"[Madonna] really got our attention as she and her dancers wielded guns\".[39] The wardrobe for the performance consisted of a black outfit fitted with an ample cleavage, gloves of the same color and heeled boots.[40] After the tour was finished, the singer stated she would auction all the outfits she wore on tour to help Hurricane Sandy victims.[41]"]}}}
