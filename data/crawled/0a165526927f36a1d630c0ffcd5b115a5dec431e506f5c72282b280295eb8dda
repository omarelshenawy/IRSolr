Both newspapers were purchased from The McClatchy Company (after buying out Knight Ridder) in 2006 by Philadelphia Media Holdings and operated by the group until the organization declared bankruptcy in 2010.[132] After two years of financial struggle, the two newspapers were sold to Interstate General Media in 2012.[132] The two newspapers have a combined circulation of about 500,000 readers.[130]"]}}}
