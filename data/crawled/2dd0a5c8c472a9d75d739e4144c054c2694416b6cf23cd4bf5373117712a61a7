A British friend of Walt Whitman, Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: \"You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without Leaves of Grass... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him.\"[148] Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman \"America's poet... He is America.\"[149] Andrew Carnegie called him \"the great poet of America so far\".[150] Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry.[151] Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that \"people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ\".[152]"]}}}
