These versions were frequently labeled with the parenthetical designation \"12-inch version\", \"12-inch mix\", \"extended remix\", \"dance mix\", or \"club mix\"."],"after":["Later musical styles took advantage of this new format and recording levels on vinyl 30 cm (12 in) maxis have steadily increased, culminating in the extremely loud (or \"hot\") cuts of drum and bass records of the 1990s and early 2000s (decade)."]}}}
