The committee was founded by four women: Tipper Gore, wife of Senator and later Vice President Al Gore; Susan Baker, wife of Treasury Secretary James Baker; Pam Howar, wife of Washington realtor Raymond Howar; and Sally Nevius, wife of former Washington City Council Chairman John Nevius. They were known as the \"Washington wives\" â€“ a reference to their husbands' connections with government in the Washington, D.C. area. The term was also a play on the title of Ira Levin's book, \"The Stepford Wives\". The Center eventually grew to include 22 participants."]}}}
