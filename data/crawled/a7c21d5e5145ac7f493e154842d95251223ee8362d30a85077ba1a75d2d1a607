When informed that the film was to be shot in Africa, Davis refused the part, telling Jack Warner, \"If you can't shoot the picture in a boat on the back lot, then I'm not interested.\" Katharine Hepburn played the role and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress.[57] Davis was also offered a role in a film version of the Virginia Kellogg prison drama Women Without Men. Originally intended to pair Davis with Joan Crawford, Davis made it clear that she would not appear in any \"dyke movie.\" It was filmed as Caged (1950), and the lead roles were played by Eleanor Parker (who was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress) and Agnes Moorehead.[58] She lobbied Jack Warner to make two films, Ethan Frome and a biography of Mary Todd Lincoln; however, Warner vetoed each proposal."],"after":["In 1948 Davis was cast in the melodrama Winter Meeting; and, although she was initially enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for \"softer\" lighting to be used to disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen the same lighting technique \"on the sets of Ruth Chatterton and Kay Francis, and I knew what they meant.\"[59] She began to regret accepting the role; and, to add to her disappointment, she was not confident in the abilities of her leading man, James Davis in his first major screen role. She disagreed with amendments made to the script because of censorship restrictions and found that many of the aspects of the role that had initially appealed to her had been cut. The film was later described by Bosley Crowther as \"interminable;\" and he noted that \"of all the miserable dilemmas in which Miss Davis has been involved ... this one is probably the worst\". It failed at the box office, and the studio lost nearly one million dollars.[60]"]}}}
