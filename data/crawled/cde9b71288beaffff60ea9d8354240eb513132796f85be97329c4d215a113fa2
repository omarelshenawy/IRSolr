By this method of zig-zagging into the wind, known as beating, it is possible to reach any upwind destination.[13] A yacht beating to a mark directly upwind one mile away will cover a distance through the water of at least 1.4 miles, if it can tack through an angle of 90 degrees including leeway. An old adage describes beating as sailing for twice the distance at half the speed and three times the discomfort.[17]"]}}}
