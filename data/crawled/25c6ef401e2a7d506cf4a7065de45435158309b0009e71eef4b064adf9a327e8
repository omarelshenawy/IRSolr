To each point on the manifold, we may attach a k-blade B that is tangent to the manifold. Locally, B acts as a pseudoscalar of the k-dimensional space. This blade defines a projection of vectors onto the manifold:"],"after":["Just as the geometric derivative is defined over the entire n-dimensional space, we may wish to define an intrinsic derivative , locally defined on the manifold:"]}}}
