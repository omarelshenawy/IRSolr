Personally, this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do.\"[88] Growing creative differences with producer Afanasieff continued, and eventually ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's material.[90] Reviews for Butterfly were generally positive: Rolling Stone wrote, \"It's not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry [...] but the predominant mood of 'Butterfly' is one of coolly erotic reverie. [... Except \"Outside\" the album sounds] very 1997. [...] Carey has spread her wings and she's ready to fly.\"[91] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever\", and heralded Butterfly as one of her \"best records and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\"[92] The album was a commercial success, although not to the degree of her previous three albums.[90]"],"after":["Toward the turn of the millennium, Carey began developing other projects.[93] On April 14, 1998, Carey partook in the VH1 Divas benefit concert, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan, and Carole King.[94] Carey had begun developing a film project All That Glitters, later re-titled to simply Glitter,[95][not in citation given] and intended her songwriting to other projects, such as Men in Black (1997) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000).[93] After Glitter fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project, and began writing material for a new album.[93] The executives at Sony Music, the parent company of Carey's label Columbia, wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the commercially favorable holiday season.[96] However, they disagreed as to what content and singles should constitute the album.[97] Sony wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the United States, and her international chart toppers on the European versions, void of any new material, while Carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs, not just her most commercial.[97] She felt that not including any new material would result in cheating her fans, therefore including four new songs that she had recorded.[97] While compromised, Carey often expressed distaste towards the album's song selection, expressing her disappointment in the omission of her \"favorite songs\".[98] The album, titled #1's (1998), featured a duet with Whitney Houston, \"When You Believe\", which was included on the soundtrack for The Prince of Egypt (1998).[97] During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song \"When You Believe\" for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt.[99] In an interview with Ebony, Houston described working with Carey, as well as their growing friendship: \"Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang together before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's good to know that two ladies of soul and music can still be friends.\"[100] #1's became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, and placing as the only international artist to accomplish this feat.[101] When describing Carey's popularity in Japan throughout the 1990s, author Chris Nickson compared it to Beatlemania in the 1960s.[76] The album sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan after only the first three months, and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist,[101] while amassing global sales of over 17 million copies.[102]"]}}}
