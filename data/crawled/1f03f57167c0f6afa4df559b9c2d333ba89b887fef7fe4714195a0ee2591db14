From there it continued southeast along the edge of Trafford Park, and then east into Manchester. Although a connection with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation was included in the new Act, at Hulme Locks in Castlefield (on land previously occupied by Hulme Hall), this was not completed until 1838. The terminus would be at Castlefield Basin, where the nearby River Medlock was to help supply the canal with water.[13] Boats would unload their cargoes inside the duke's purpose-built warehouse. There were no locks in Brindley's design, demonstrating[clarification needed] his ability as a competent engineer.[10] The Barton Aqueduct was built relatively quickly for the time; work commenced in September 1760 and the first boat crossed on 17Â July 1761.[14]"],"after":[]}}}
