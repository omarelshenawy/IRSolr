Bhangra lyrics were generally kept simple on purpose by the creators of the genre because they knew that the youth did not understand complex lyrics. Many feel this has led to the death of the Punjabi language in the western diaspora especially in the third and fourth generation. Traditional Punjabi folk lyrics are generally more complex and often tell the tales of Punjabi history. Additionally, there are countless Bhangra songs devoted to Punjabi pride themes and Punjabi heroes. The lyrics are tributes to the rich cultural traditions of Punjab. In particular, many Bhangra tracks have been written about Udham Singh and Bhagat Singh. Less serious topics include beautiful ladies with their colourful duppattas. It could also be about crops and the coming of a new season, bhangra is sung fiercely with strong lyrics often yelling: \"balle balle\" or \"chakde phate.\" Which refer to celebration and/or pride."]}}}
