Redstone believed that the failure to acquire MySpace contributed to the 20% drop in Viacom's stock price in 2006 up to the date of Freston's ouster. Freston's successor as CEO, Philippe Dauman, was quoted as saying \"never, ever let another competitor beat us to the trophy\". Redstone told interviewer Charlie Rose that losing MySpace had been \"humiliating\", adding, \"MySpace was sitting there for the taking for $500 million\" (Myspace was sold in 2012 by News Corp for $35 million.)[30]"],"after":["In January 2006, Fox announced plans to launch a UK version of Myspace in a bid to \"tap into the UK music scene\", which they have since done.[31] They released a version in China and have since launched similar versions in other countries."]}}}
