Cyrus sent in a tape auditioning for its best friend role, but received a call asking her to audition for the lead, Chloe Stewart.[25] After sending in a new tape and flying to Hollywood for further auditions, Cyrus was told that she was too young and too small for the part.[26] However, the series' producers invited her for further auditions in light of her persistence and her singing and acting abilities. The following year, Cyrus received the lead position, renamed Miley Stewart after herself.[27] Hannah Montana premiered on March 24, 2006, to the largest audience for a Disney Channel program,[28] and quickly ranked among the highest-rated series on basic cable, elevating Cyrus's wealth and fame.[29] Its instant success helped propel Cyrus to teen idol status.[23] Time magazine reports that Cyrus's \"phenom[enal]\" success is due partially to her talent and partially to \"Disney learning to use its vast, multimedia holdings\" and market Cyrus and Hannah Montana appropriately.[30] Cyrus eventually became the first artist to have deals in television, film, consumer products, and music within The Walt Disney Company. As Cyrus's career flourished, Cyrus's mother made several important decisions regarding her daughter's representation. She signed Cyrus with Mitchell Gossett, director of the youth division at Cunningham Escott Slevin Doherty. He is credited with \"discovering\" her after arranging her auditions for Hannah Montana.[31][32]"]}}}
