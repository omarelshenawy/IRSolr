El Niño effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones, while La Niña effects increase the chances of drought.[175] Typically the islands of Tuvalu receive between 200mm to 400mm of rainfall per month. However, in 2011 a weak La Niña effect caused a drought by cooling the surface of the sea around Tuvalu. A state of emergency was declared on 28 September 2011;[176] with rationing of fresh-water on the islands of Funafuti and Nukulaelae.[177][178][179] Households on Funafuti and Nukulaelae were restricted to two buckets of fresh water per day (40 litres).[180][181]"]}}}
