In the Virgin Tour, Madonna performed the song wearing a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, and a number of crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts of her body.[38] Madonna performed the song in its original version. She appeared from behind a silhouette, and descended the steps, while waving her hands and singing.[39] The performance was not included in the Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour VHS in 1985.[40]"]}}}
