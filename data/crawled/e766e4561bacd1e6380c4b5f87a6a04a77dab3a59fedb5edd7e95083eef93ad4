Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning.[86][88] A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge.[88] Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.[88]"]}}}
