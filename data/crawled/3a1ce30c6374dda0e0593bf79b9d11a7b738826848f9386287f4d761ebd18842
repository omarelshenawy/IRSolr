Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by German and Japanese forces in occupied territories. An estimated 11[317] to 17 million[318] civilians died as a direct or indirect result of Nazi ideological policies, including the systematic genocide of around 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, along with a further 5 to 6 million ethnic Poles and other Slavs (including Ukrainians and Belarusians)[319]—Roma, homosexuals, and other ethnic and minority groups.[318]"],"after":["Roughly 7.5 million civilians died in China under Japanese occupation.[320] Hundreds of thousands (varying estimates) of ethnic Serbs, along with gypsies and Jews, were murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia,[321] with retribution-related killings just after the war ended."]}}}
