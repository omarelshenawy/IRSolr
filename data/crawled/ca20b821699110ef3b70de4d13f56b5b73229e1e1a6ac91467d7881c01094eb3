Since Crouch was the leader of the Los Angeles Church of God choir, he researched the lyrics of the song, as he wanted to \"find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard.\"[11] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, Crouch got his choir together and explained to them what they needed to do during the recording session.[5] He had listened to the demo of \"Like a Prayer\" in his car, and directed his choir according to his own interpretations of the music. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production of the song.[5]"]}}}
