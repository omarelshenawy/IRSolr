Many sand dollars can be found as well. One of the reasons for these large accumulations of shells is the fact that Sanibel is a barrier island which is \"part of a large plateau that extends out into the Gulf of Mexico for miles. It is this plateau that acts like a shelf for seashells to gather.\" Sanibel also has an \"east-west orientation when most islands are north-south. Hence, the island is gifted with great sandy beaches and an abundance of shells.\"[20]"]}}}
