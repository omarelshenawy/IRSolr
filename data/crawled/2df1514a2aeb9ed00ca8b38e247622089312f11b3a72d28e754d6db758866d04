Only 13 of the 56 CAF member associations have ever made it to the FIFA World Cup, and of these 13 only Cameroon, Ghana and Senegal have ever reached the quarter-finals. In 2010, South Africa became the first African nation to host the tournament."],"after":["Currently, the top continental club championship in Africa is the annual CAF Champions League, whose record title-holders are Egyptian giants Al Ahly, who have lifted the trophy 8 times, doing so most recently in 2013. The CAF Confederation Cup is the continent's other annual championship, and has been won a record 3 times by Tunisian club CS Sfaxien, their most recent victory also coming in 2013. The winners of these two competitions face each other at the beginning of every year for the CAF Super Cup."]}}}
