Fabulous Magazine had labelled her a \"Master of Reinvention.\"[217] In November 2006, Minogue posed for Vogue Australia, which Larissa Dubecki from The Age had labelled her the \"Mother of Reinvetion\" by saying \"This unveiling is as cleverly managed as every aspect of her career, and her illness, to date. Like sharks, celebrities cannot remain static; they must keep moving or die. Kylie has beaten her early detractors by inhabiting almost a dozen identities [...]\"[218] Fiona MacDonald from Madison said Kylie was \"an icon, one of the handful of singers recognised around the world by her first name alone.

Her worldwide hit single \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" has been known with great legacy.
