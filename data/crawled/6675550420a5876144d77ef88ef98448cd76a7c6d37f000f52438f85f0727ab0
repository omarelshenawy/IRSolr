They consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band, together with several other solo instruments (such as the piano, harpsichord, and organ). The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music[11] and includes members of the string, woodwind, brass, and percussion families of instruments. The concert band, another ensemble that plays classical music, consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families.

However, many concert bands use a double bass."]}}}
