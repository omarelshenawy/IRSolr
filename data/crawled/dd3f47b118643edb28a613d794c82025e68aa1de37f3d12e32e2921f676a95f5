Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994.[199] Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become GoldenEye, he announced on 12 April 1994 that he would not be returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan.[196] After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material.[190] Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final polish to the script.[200]"]}}}
