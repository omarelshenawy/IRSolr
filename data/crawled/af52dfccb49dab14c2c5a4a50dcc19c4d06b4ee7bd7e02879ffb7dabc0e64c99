Madonna portrays an exotic dancer who befriends a young boy, played by child actor Felix Howard. This video was originally set to be directed by Madonna's then-husband Sean Penn, but in the end the final honors went to Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who went on to work with Madonna on her videos for \"Justify My Love\" (1990), \"Human Nature\" (1995), \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" (1996), \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000) and \"Hollywood\" (2003). The video was shot in October 1986 and was released in December 1986. It was produced by David Naylor.[36] The video was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards in 1987.[37] In the Best Female Video category, \"Open Your Heart\" lost to another Madonna video, when the music video for \"Papa Don't Preach\" won the award. The video has been ranked at numberÂ 35 on VH1's \"50 Sexiest Video Moments\" of all time.[38]"],"after":["The \"Open Your Heart\" music video presents an early version of Madonna's musings about her Italian-American heritage and focus on her feminocentric street theology, which was also explicitly brought out by 1987's Who's That Girl World Tour.[39] The video is structured as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays Madonna as a stripper.[40] It starts with a little boy trying to go inside a peep show where Madonna is the star performer but getting rebuffed by an old man at the ticket booth outside. Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to the gaze of the customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles.[9] Madonna is dressed in a black bustier, spike heels, fishnets, revealing her new slimmed down body at that time.[41] She begins the video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes, revealing her short bleached hair. The lighting is bluish and dark. Her look is a mix of actresses Marlene Dietrich in the movie The Blue Angel[42] as well as Liza Minnelli as the character Sally Bowles in the Bob Fosse-directed musical film Cabaret.[43] The dancing is restrained with a single prop: that of a solitary chair. At one point in the first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles.[44] There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.[43]"]}}}
