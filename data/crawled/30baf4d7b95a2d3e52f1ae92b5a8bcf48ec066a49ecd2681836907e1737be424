Notable archaeological sites of this period have been discovered in Dresden and the villages of Eythra and Zwenkau near Leipzig. The Slavic and Germanic occupation of the territory of today's Saxony is thought to have begun in the 1st century BC. Ptolemy's Geographia, written in the 2nd century, is sometimes considered to contain the first mentioning of the Saxons. Some copies of this text mention a tribe called Saxones in the area to the north of the lower River Elbe.[7] However, other versions refer to the same tribe as Axones. This may be a misspelling of the tribe that Tacitus in his Germania called Aviones. According to this theory, \"Saxones\" was the result of later scribes trying to correct a name that meant nothing to them.[8] On the other hand, Sch√ºtte, in his analysis of such problems in Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe, believed that \"Saxones\" is correct. He notes that the loss of first letters occurs in numerous places in various copies of Ptolemy's work, and also that the manuscripts without \"Saxones\" are generally inferior overall.[9]"]}}}
