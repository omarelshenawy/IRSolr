This generated a flurry of interest in the topic, during which Maxwell's classmate, Edward John Routh, abstracted Maxwell's results for the general class of linear systems.[3] Independently, Adolf Hurwitz analyzed system stability using differential equations in 1877, resulting in what is now known as the Routhâ€“Hurwitz theorem.[4][5]"]}}}
