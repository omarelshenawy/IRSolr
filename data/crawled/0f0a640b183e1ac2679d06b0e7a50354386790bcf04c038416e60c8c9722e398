The IPA maps the vowels according to the position of the tongue.","The vertical axis of the chart is mapped by vowel height. Vowels pronounced with the tongue lowered are at the bottom, and vowels pronounced with the tongue raised are at the top. For example, [É‘] (the first vowel in father) is at the bottom because the tongue is lowered in this position. However, [i] (the vowel in \"meet\") is at the top because the sound is said with the tongue raised to the roof of the mouth."]}}}
