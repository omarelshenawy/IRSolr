A video interlude called \"Turning Up the Hits\" started, where excerpts of \"Holiday\", \"Into the Groove\", \"Lucky Star\", \"Like A Virgin\", \"4 Minutes\", \"Ray of Light\" and \"Music\" were played.[72] Madonna appeared on the stage with a guitar and started singing the song. She was accompanied by two guitarists on the steps, which moved up-and-down. In the middle of the track, she invited the audience to sing-along with her.[73]"]}}}
