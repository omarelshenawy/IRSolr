In elsewhere on Great Britain and on Ireland, high density of population is limited to areas around, or close to, a few large cities. The largest urban area by far is the Greater London Urban Area with 9 million inhabitants. Other major populations centres include Greater Manchester Urban Area (2.4 million), West Midlands conurbation (2.4 million), West Yorkshire Urban Area (1.6 million) in England,[53] Greater Glasgow (1.2 million) in Scotland[54] and Greater Dublin Area (1.1 million) in Ireland.[citation needed]"]}}}
