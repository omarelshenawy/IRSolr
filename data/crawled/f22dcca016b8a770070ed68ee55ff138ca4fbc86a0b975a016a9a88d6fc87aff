This was seen as an \"incredible\" paradox by many at the time, including Torricelli himself, and prompted a fierce controversy about the nature of infinity, also involving the philosopher Hobbes. It is supposed by some to have led to the idea of a \"completed infinity\". Torricelli tried several alternative proofs, attempting to prove that its surface area was also finite - all of which failed.[citation needed]"],"after":[]}}}
