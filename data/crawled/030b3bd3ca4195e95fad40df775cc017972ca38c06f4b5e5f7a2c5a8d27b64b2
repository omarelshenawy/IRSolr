Canoeing, sailing, paddleboating, windsurfing and dragon boating are popular.[78] A rowing course is set up at the western end of the lake.[110] The National Championships were held in the lake in 1964,[61] but high winds have deterred organisers. On one occasion, winds swept a boat into a bridge pylon.[111] While not particularly popular, opportunities for swimming have been limited recently because of increasingly frequent lake closures due to concerns about water quality;[112] another deterrent against swimming is the generally cold water temperature.[110][113] During summer, the lake is used for the swim leg of numerous triathlon and aquathlon events including the Sri Chinmoy Triathlon Festival.[114]"]}}}
