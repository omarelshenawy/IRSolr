Note that advances anticlockwise with respect to the zero hour angle for those dials that are partly south-facing and clockwise for those that are north-facing."],"after":["within the parameter ranges : and .","Here is the sundial's geographical latitude; is the orientation switch integer; t is the time in hours before or after noon; and and are the angles of reclination and declination, respectively. Note that is measured with reference to the vertical. It is positive when the dial leans back towards the horizon behind the dial and negative when the dial leans forward to the horizon on the sun's side. Declination angle is defined as positive when moving east of true south. Dials facing fully or partly south have = +1, while those partly or fully north-facing have an value of -1. Since the above expression gives the hour angle as an arctan function, due consideration must be given to which quadrant of the sundial each hour belongs to before assigning the correct hour angle."]}}}
