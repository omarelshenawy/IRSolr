In July, Johnson sent McNamara, Wheeler and other officials to meet with Westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future. At that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a \"stalemate\". Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction, and that \"we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes\".[186] Though Westmoreland sought many more, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000[187] A Gallup poll in July showed 52% of the country disapproving of the president's handling of the war and only 34% thought progress was being made.[188]"],"after":["In August Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs' support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list.[189] Later that month McNamara told a Senate subcommittee that an expanded air campaign would not bring Hanoi to the peace table – the Joint Chiefs were astounded, and threatened mass resignation – McNamara was summoned to the White House for a three-hour dressing down; nevertheless, Johnson had received reports from the CIA confirming McNamara's analysis at least in part. In the meantime an election establishing a constitutional government in the South was concluded and provided hope for peace talks.[190]"]}}}
