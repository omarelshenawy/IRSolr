He also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. He gave a full treatment of the equation [62] and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss.[63] In his old age, he was the first to prove \"Fermat's last theorem\" for (completing work by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and crediting both him and Sophie Germain).[64]"],"after":["In his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1798), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation (congruences) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests.[65] The last section of the Disquisitiones established a link between roots of unity and number theory:"]}}}
