Winnipeg hockey players used cricket pads to better protect the goaltender's legs; they also introduced the \"scoop\" shot, or what is now known as the wrist shot. Goal nets became a standard feature of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) in 1900. Left and right defence began to replace the point and cover-point positions in the OHA in 1906.[29]"],"after":["Ice hockey was not the only game on ice derived from stick-and-ball games played in Europe; during this period bandie ball was adapted to the ice, evolving into bandy (which remains popular in Sweden, Russia, Finland and Norway). \"Ice polo\", played with a ball rather than a puck, was popular in the United States during this period; however, by 1893 Yale University and Johns Hopkins University held their first ice hockey matches.[30] Ice polo (played in New England) would die out as Americans adopted ice hockey. In 1896, the first ice hockey league in the U.S. was formed. The U.S. Amateur Hockey League was founded in New York City, shortly after the opening of the artificial-ice St. Nicholas Rink."]}}}
