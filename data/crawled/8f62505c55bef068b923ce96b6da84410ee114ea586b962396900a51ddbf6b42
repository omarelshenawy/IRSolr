Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor.[26]","These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units. Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, gendarmes, and police.[26] All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.[7]"]}}}
