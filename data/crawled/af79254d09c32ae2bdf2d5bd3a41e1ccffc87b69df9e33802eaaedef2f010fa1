New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the Afro-Cuban mambo and conga in the late 1940s, and made it its own.[11] New Orleans funk, as it was called, gained international acclaim largely because James Brown's rhythm section used it to great effect.[12]"],"after":["Funk creates an intense groove by using strong guitar riffs and bass lines. Like Motown recordings, funk songs used bass lines as the centerpiece of songs. Slap bass's mixture of thumb-slapped low notes and finger \"popped\" (or plucked) high notes allowed the bass to have a drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk."]}}}
