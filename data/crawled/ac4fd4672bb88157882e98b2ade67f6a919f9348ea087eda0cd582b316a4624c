One very practical result of this theory is the characterization of confounding variables, namely, a sufficient set of variables that, if adjusted for, would yield the correct causal effect between variables of interest. It can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the causal effect of on is any set of non-descendants of that -separate from after removing all arrows emanating from . This criterion, called \"backdoor\", provides a mathematical definition of \"confounding\" and helps researchers identify accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement."]}}}
