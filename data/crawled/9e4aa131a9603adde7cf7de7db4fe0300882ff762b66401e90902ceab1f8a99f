Pinafore has been adapted many times. W. S. Gilbert wrote a 1909 children's book called The Pinafore Picture Book, illustrated by Alice Woodward, which retells the story of Pinafore, in some cases giving considerable backstory that is not found in the libretto.[196][197] Many other children's books have since been written retelling the story of Pinafore or adapting characters or events from Pinafore.[198]"]}}}
