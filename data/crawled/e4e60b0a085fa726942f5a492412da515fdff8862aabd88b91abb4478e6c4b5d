Sullivan's oldest nephew, Herbert, stayed behind in England as his uncle's ward.[107] The next opera, Princess Ida (1884, the duo's only three-act, blank verse work), had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors, although Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera.[108] Sullivan's close friend, the composer Frederic Clay, had suffered a serious stroke in early December 1883 that effectively ended his career at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own longstanding kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, \"[I]t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\"[109]"],"after":["Gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge. The composer wrote, on 1 April 1884 that he had \"come to the end of my tether\" with the operas: \"I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost. ... I should like to set a story of human interest & probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, & where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character.\"[110] In a lengthy exchange of correspondence, Sullivan pronounced Gilbert's plot sketch (particularly the \"lozenge\" element) unacceptably mechanical, and too similar in both its grotesque \"elements of topsyturveydom\" and in actual plot to their earlier work, especially The Sorcerer,[n 16] and repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject.[111] The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device. The result was Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful work, The Mikado (1885).[112] The piece ran for 672 performances, which was the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre, and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece, up to that time.[n 17]"]}}}
