Although these occasions were relatively peaceful, something of the mood of the first night remained; the composer Puccini, who attended the second performance on 2 June,[70][71] described the choreography as ridiculous and the music cacophonous—\"the work of a madman. The public hissed, laughed – and applauded\".[72] Stravinsky, confined to his bed by typhoid fever,[73] did not join the company when it went to London for four performances at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.[74] Reviewing the London production, The Times critic was impressed how different elements of the work came together to form a coherent whole, but was less enthusiastic about the music itself, opining that Stravinsky had entirely sacrificed melody and harmony for rhythm: \"If M. Stravinsky had wished to be really primitive, he would have been wise to ... score his ballet for nothing but drums\".[75] The ballet historian Cyril Beaumont commented on the \"slow, uncouth movements\" of the dancers, finding these \"in complete opposition to the traditions of classical ballet\".[61]"]}}}
