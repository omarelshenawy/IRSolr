Infibulation was banned there in 1946, but the law was unpopular and barely enforced.[174] The Egyptian government banned infibulation in state-run hospitals in 1959, but allowed partial clitoridectomy if parents requested it.[175] The UN asked the WHO to investigate FGM that year, but the latter responded that it was not a medical issue.[176]"]}}}
