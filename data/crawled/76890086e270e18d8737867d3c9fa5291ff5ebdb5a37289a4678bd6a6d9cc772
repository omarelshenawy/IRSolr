In the case of purely time-like paths, geodesics are (locally) the paths of greatest separation (spacetime interval) as measured along the path between two events, whereas in Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds, geodesics are paths of shortest distance between two points.[17][18] The concept of geodesics becomes central in general relativity, since geodesic motion may be thought of as \"pure motion\" (inertial motion) in spacetime, that is, free from any external influences."]}}}
