The newsletter, moreover, reflected the broad agenda of the organization. As Eleanor Flexner elaborates, for instance, The Revolution \"exhorted women to equip themselves to earn their own livelihood, to practice bodily hygiene in the matter of fresh air, dress, and exercise.\"[2] On January 8, 1870 - the anniversary of the founding of The Revolution - the American Association launched its periodical, The Woman's Journal.[2] Faced with rising debts, and the rising popularity of The Woman's Journal, The Revolution succumbed in May 1870.[2]"]}}}
