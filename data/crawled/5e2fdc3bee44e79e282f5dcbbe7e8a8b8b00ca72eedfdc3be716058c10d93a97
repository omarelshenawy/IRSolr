With the assistance of the gods he pacified the region and went on. The facts behind the tradition, if any, remain unknown, as does whether Herculaneum was named after it. An epigram by the poet Martial in 88 AD suggests that both Venus, patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of 79.[8] Whether Hercules was ever considered some sort of patron of the volcano itself is debatable.[citation needed]"],"after":[]}}}
