The follow-up single \"Sexy MF\" fared worse, charting at No. 66 on the Hot 100 and No. 76 on the R&B chart. The label's preferred lead single choice \"7\" would be the album's lone top ten hit, reaching No. 7.[60] 'Love Symbol Album' would go on to sell 2.8Â million copies worldwide.[64]"],"after":["After two failed attempts in 1990 and 1991,[65] Warner Bros. finally released a greatest hits compilation with the three-disc The Hits/The B-Sides in 1993. The first two discs were also sold separately as The Hits 1 and The Hits 2. In addition to featuring the majority of Prince's hit singles (with the exception of \"Batdance\" and other songs that appeared on the Batman soundtrack), The Hits includes an array of previously hard-to-find recordings, notably B-sides spanning the majority of Prince's career, as well as a handful of previously unreleased tracks such as the Revolution-recorded \"Power Fantastic\" and a live recording of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" with Rosie Gaines. Two new songs, \"Pink Cashmere\" and \"Peach\", were chosen as promotional singles to accompany the compilation album."]}}}
