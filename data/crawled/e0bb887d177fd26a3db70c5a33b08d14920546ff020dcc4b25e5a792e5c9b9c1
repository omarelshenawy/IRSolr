She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads, including the idea of gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from \"Captain Reece\" (1868) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from \"General John\" (1867). Dick Deadeye, based on a character in \"Woman's Gratitude\" (1869), represents another of Gilbert's favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding \"face and form\" makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense.[12][141] Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, The Gentleman in Black which includes the device of baby-switching.[142]"],"after":["Historian H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921 that Pinafore \"satirizes the type of nautical drama of which Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing little or nothing to help one's country\".[117] In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, \"they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know damn well they're sending it up, but the music is so military ... that you can't help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire.\"[143] In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: \"H.M.S. Pinafore is basically a satire on ... the British love of the class system .... [A]t this moment, all of the men on board say, 'But of course [Ralph] can marry [the Captain's] daughter, because he's British, and therefore he's great'\".[143][144][145]"]}}}
