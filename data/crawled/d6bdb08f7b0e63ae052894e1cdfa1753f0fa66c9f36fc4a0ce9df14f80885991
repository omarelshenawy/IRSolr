A representative of the NTSB stated that 65 seconds before the crash the train was traveling at 60 mph (97 km/h), 16 seconds before the crash it reached 90 mph (140 km/h), and it eventually reached speeds in excess of 106 mph (171 km/h), at which point the Engineer-induced braking system was activated.[31] The Amtrak Engineer Brandon Bostian, who was in control of the train, is likely to be quizzed by NTSB, though his lawyer claims he doesn't recall much about the accident.[32]"]}}}
