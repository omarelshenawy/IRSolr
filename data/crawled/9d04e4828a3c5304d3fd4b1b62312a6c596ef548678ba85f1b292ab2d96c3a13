It was going to be John making a political statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem.\"[13] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: \"Phil doesn't arrange or anything like thatâ€”[Ono] and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll just find a sound from [there].\"[14]"]}}}
