Returning to New Zealand the Premier, Robert Stout, insisted that all events happening before 1863 were the responsibility of the Imperial Government.[49]"],"after":["By the late 19th century a widespread belief existed amongst both Pākehā and Māori that the Māori population would cease to exist as a separate race or culture and become assimilated into the European population.[51] In 1840, New Zealand had a Māori population of about 50,000 to 70,000 and only about 2,000 Europeans. By 1860 it was estimated at 50,000. The Māori population had declined to 37,520 in the 1871 census, although Te Rangi Hīroa (Sir Peter Buck) believed this figure was too low.[52] The figure was 42,113 in the 1896 census, by which time Europeans numbered more than 700,000.[53] Professor Ian Poole noticed that as late as 1890 40% of all female children were dead before they were one, a much higher rate than for males.[54]"]}}}
