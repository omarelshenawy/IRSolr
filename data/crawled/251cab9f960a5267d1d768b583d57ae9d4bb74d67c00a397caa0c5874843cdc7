Regarding his style, Hopper defined himself as \"an amalgam of many races\" and not a member of any school, particularly the \"Ashcan School\".[57] Once Hopper achieved his mature style, his art remained consistent and self-contained, in spite of the numerous art trends that came and went during his long career.[57]"]}}}
