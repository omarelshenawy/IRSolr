An important property of the geometric product is the existence of elements with multiplicative inverse, also known as units. If a2 ≠ 0 for some vector a, then a−1 exists and is equal to a/(a2). Not every nonzero element of the algebra is necessarily a unit. For example, if u is a vector in V such that u2 = 1, the elements 1 ± u are zero divisors and thus have no inverse: (1 − u)(1 + u) = 1 − uu = 1 − 1 = 0. There may also exist nontrivial idempotent elements such as (1 + u)/2."],"after":["For vectors a and b, we may write the geometric product of any two vectors a and b as the sum of a symmetric product and an antisymmetric product:"]}}}
