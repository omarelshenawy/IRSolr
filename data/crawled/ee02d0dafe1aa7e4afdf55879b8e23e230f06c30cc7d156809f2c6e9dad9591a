However, he felt that the song had modest goals, \"at least by Madonna's standards. Even when it gets a bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus.\" He went on to add that the song \"is an effective look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [Madonna] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter.\"[9] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song \"unapologetically dance-y\" but felt \"disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme for the umpteenth time without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair.\"[11] Chris Williams from Billboard said that \"Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots.\" It further added that \"'Celebration' [is] a score for Madonna's retro-futuristic fan base and a nice bookend to her collection of chart glories.\"[13]"]}}}
