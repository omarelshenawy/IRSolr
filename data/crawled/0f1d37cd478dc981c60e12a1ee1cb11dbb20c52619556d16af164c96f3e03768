When ∑an is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation σ of the set N of indices, with the same sum,"],"after":["Conversely, if every permutation of a series ∑an converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent. When X  is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if X  is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs εn = 1 or &minu: this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->s;1, the series"]}}}
