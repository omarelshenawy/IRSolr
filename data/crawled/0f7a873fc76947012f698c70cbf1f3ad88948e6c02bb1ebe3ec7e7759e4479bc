They share the Virgin Islands Archipelago with the Spanish Virgin Islands (administered by Puerto Rico) and the British Virgin Islands. The territory consists of four main islands: Saint Thomas, Saint John, Saint Croix, and Water Island, as well as several dozen smaller islands. The main islands have nicknames often used by locals: \"Twin City\" (St. Croix), \"Rock City\" (St. Thomas) and \"Love City\" (St. John).[9] The combined land area of the islands is roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C."]}}}
