A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos (\"children born of two Roman citizens\").[85] A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.[86]"],"after":["The archaic form of manus marriage in which the woman had been subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father's legal authority, even though she moved into her husband's home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated.[87] This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:[88] although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life,[89] and her husband had no legal power over her.[90] Although it was a point of pride to be a \"one-man woman\" (univira) who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to divorce, nor to speedy remarriage after the loss of a husband through death or divorce.[91]"]}}}
