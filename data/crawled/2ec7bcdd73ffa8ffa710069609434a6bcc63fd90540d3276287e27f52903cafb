Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades.[17] Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the \"Pre-Tac\" (Pre-Tactical) models.[14] They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades.[17] The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms.[14] Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.[17]"]}}}
