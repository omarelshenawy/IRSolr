There are 3.4Â million users of the internet in Singapore,[245] one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world. The Singapore government does not engage in widespread censoring of the internet,[248] but it maintains a list of one hundred websites (mostly pornographic) that it blocks as a 'symbolic statement of the Singaporean community's stand on harmful and undesirable content on the Internet'.[249] As the block covers only home internet access, users may still visit the blocked websites from their office computers.[250]"],"after":[]}}}
