It is an adaptation of a crossover franchise between the titular extraterrestrials from the Alien and Predator series, a concept which originated in a 1989 comic book. Set in 2004, Alien vs. Predator follows a group of paleontologists, archaeologists, and others assembled by billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) for an expedition near the Antarctic after discovering a mysterious heat signal. Hoping to claim the find for himself, Weyland and the group discover a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station. Hieroglyphics and sculptures reveal that the pyramid is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a rite of passage. The humans are caught in the middle of a battle between the two species and attempt to prevent the Aliens from reaching the surface. Released in North America on August 13, 2004, Alien vs. Predator received mostly negative reviews from film critics. Some praised the special effects and set designs, while others dismissed the film for its \"wooden dialogue\" and \"cardboard characters\". Nevertheless, Alien vs. Predator became the most commercially successful film in the franchises, grossing a total of $172 million. The film's success led to a sequel in 2007 titled Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem."]}}}
