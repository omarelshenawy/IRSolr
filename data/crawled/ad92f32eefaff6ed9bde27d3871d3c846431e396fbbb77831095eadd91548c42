However, once coupled with the fundamental theorem of algebra it says that the disk contains in fact at least one solution. More generally, a bound can be given directly in terms of any p-norm of the n-vector of coefficients , that is |ζ| ≤ Rp, where Rp is precisely the q-norm of the 2-vector , q being the conjugate exponent of p, 1/p + 1/q = 1, for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. Thus, the modulus of any solution is also bounded by"],"after":["for 1 < p < ∞, and in particular"]}}}
