Earth is expected to be effectively habitable for about another 7016157788000000000♠500 myr from that point,[70] although this may be extended up to 7016725824800000000♠2.3 byr if the nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.[72] Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[76]"],"after":["The Sun, as part of its evolution, will become a red giant in about 7017157788000000000♠5 byr. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150,000,000 km), which is about 250 times its present radius.[73][77] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250,000,000 km) from the Sun, when the star reaches its maximum radius. The planet was, therefore, initially expected to escape envelopment by the expanded Sun's sparse outer atmosphere, though most, if not all, remaining life would have been destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).[73] A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the red giant Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[77] After that, the Sun's core will collapse into a white dwarf, as its outer layers are ejected into space as a planetary nebula. The matter that once made up Earth will be released into interstellar space, where it may one day become incorporated into a new generation of planets and other celestial bodies."]}}}
