The result is a solid with extremely low density[1] and low thermal conductivity. Nicknames include frozen smoke,[2] solid smoke, solid air, or blue smoke owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material. It feels like fragile expanded polystyrene to the touch. Aerogels can be made from a variety of chemical compounds.[3]"]}}}
