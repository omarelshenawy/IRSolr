This means that a reliable source must be able to support the material. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged must include an inline citation of a source that directly supports the material. This also means that this is no place for original work, archival findings that have not been published, or evidence from any source that has not been published."]}}}
