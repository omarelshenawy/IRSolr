Top Pops was founded initially as a three-weekly publication by Woodrow Wyatt in May 1967, becoming fortnightly in November 1967 and weekly in June 1968. It was unusual for including colour content from its first issue, but found it hard to compete with its rivals, partly because it was initially based in Abingdon, not London. On 20 September 1969 the paper was rebranded Top Pops & Music Now and subsequently became Music Now in March 1970. In May 1971 the newspaper ceased publication.[1]"],"after":[]}}}
