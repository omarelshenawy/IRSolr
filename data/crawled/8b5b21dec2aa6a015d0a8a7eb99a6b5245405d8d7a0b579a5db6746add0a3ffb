Development work on both Gemini's splashdown parachute and spaceplane paraglider began in 1963.[13] By December 1963, the parachute was already to undergo full-scale deployment testing.[13] On the other hand, by December 1963 the paraglider spaceplane concept was running into technical difficulties[11] and subsequently became replaced by the parachute splashdown concept.[13] Though attempts to revive Gemini's paraglider spaceplane concept persisted within NASA and North American Aviation as late as 1964,[14] NASA Headquarters Gemini Chief William Schneider discontinued development as technical hurdles became too expensive.[14]"],"after":["The Rockwell X-30 National Aero-Space Plane (NASP), begun in the 1980s, was an attempt to build a scramjet vehicle capable of operating like an aircraft and achieving orbit like the shuttle. It was canceled due to increasing technical challenges, growing budgets, and the loss of public interest.[citation needed] In 1994 Mitchell Burnside Clapp proposed a single stage to orbit peroxide/kerosene spaceplane called \"Black Horse\".[15] It was to take off almost empty and undergo mid-air refueling before launching to orbit.[16]"]}}}
