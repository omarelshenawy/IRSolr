At the surface, gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the two energy components change linearly with the depth.[11] Mathematically, it is described by Bernoulli's equation where velocity head is zero and comparisons per unit volume in the vessel are:"],"after":["Terms have the same meaning as in section Fluid pressure."]}}}
