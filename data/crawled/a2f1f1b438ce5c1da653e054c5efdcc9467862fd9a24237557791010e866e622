In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from Attitude magazine praised the track, writing: \"It may sound trite but there's urgency in its simplicity. It transforms into the album's most pounding moment, reaching a climax that threatens to blow the speakers.\" Todd added that although some listeners might find the track \"generic\", the song has characteristic elements of a Madonna release, and would be embraced by fans as a \"dancefloor filler that will shake the clubs and would happily find a slot on the next series of Glee.\"[16] Mitchell called it \"a big, anthemic dance-pop wonder with glittery synths and fun lyrics.\" He also referred to the song as \"the best thing [Madonna has] done since 'Hung Up'\", and the most \"mass accessible\" track on MDNA.[14] Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice shared Mitchell's sentiments, adding that although it has cliche lyric, \"Turn Up the Radio\" was comparable to Madonna's work during her Ray of Light era (1998), and had Daft Punk influenced bits in it.[13] Enio Chiola from PopMatters found the song to be \"complimenting\" the darker and edgier tracks on MDNA, but concluded that such tracks were few on the album.[19] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot found the song to be the one excelling in the first half of MDNA.[20] According to Melinda Newman of HitFix, the song is a \"sweet, Bangles-like, slab of ear pop candy that recalls [Madonna's] earliest singles, 'Holiday' and 'Borderline'.\"[21] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald called it a \"compelling piece of hands-in-the-air dance\" song, but wished Madonna would have included more of such tracks in MDNA.[22] Michael Cragg from The Guardian appreciated the opening composition of the song, describing it as \"a timely breather from the throbbing bass and feels more carefree and instinctive than what has gone before\".[17]"]}}}
