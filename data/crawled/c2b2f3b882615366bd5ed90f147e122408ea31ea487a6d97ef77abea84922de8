He decided to reassess the orthodox Confucian view that the military was an inferior class to the scholar bureaucracy. The Hongwu Emperor kept a powerful army which in 1384 he re-organized using a model known as the Wèisuǒ system (simplified Chinese: 卫所制; traditional Chinese: 衛所制; literally: \"guard battalion\"). Each military unit consisted of 5,600 men divided into five battalions and ten companies.[22] By 1393 the total number of Wèisuǒ troops had reached 1,200,000. Soldiers were also assigned land on which to grow crops whilst their positions were made hereditary. This type of system can be traced back to the Fǔbīng System (Chinese: 府兵制) of the Sui and Tang Dynasties. While the Ming army was initially very effective, it was later affected by lack of preparation, and was defeated by the Mongols in 1449 during the Tumu Crisis.[citation needed]"]}}}
