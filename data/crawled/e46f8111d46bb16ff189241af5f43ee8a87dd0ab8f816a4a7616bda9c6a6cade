The honorific for the President of the Philippines is \"Your Excellency\" or \"His/Her Excellency\", adopted from the title of the Governor-General of the Philippines during Spanish and American occupation. The term \"President of the Republic of the Philippines\" is commonly, but erroneously, used, dating back to when President Jos√© P. Laurel wanted to express the difference between his government and the previous Commonwealth government (then in exile) under President Manuel L. Quezon. The restoration of the Commonwealth in 1945 and the subsequent independence of the Philippines led to the restoration of the constitutionally-sanctioned title \"President of the Philippines\" until President Ferdinand E. Marcos proclaimed martial law and once more wanted to differentiate his government from those that came before. It was then that \"President of the Republic of the Philippines\" was adopted and indeed, specified in the 1973 Constitution of the Philippines. However, that Constitution was superseded by a new one in 1987 which restored the more traditional \"President of the Philippines.\""],"after":[]}}}
