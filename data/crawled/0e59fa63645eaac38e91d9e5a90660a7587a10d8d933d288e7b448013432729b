Cinna exercised absolute power until his death in 84 BC. Sulla after returning from his Eastern campaigns, had a free path to reestablish his own power.

Sulla also held two dictatorships and one more consulship, which established the crisis and decline of Roman Republic.[52]"],"after":["In the 3rd century BC Rome had to face a new and formidable opponent: Carthage.
