But \"Dress You Up\" and \"I'm So Stupid\" were later dropped from the show.[11] Other songs taken out from the initial set list include \"Love Profusion\" Headcleaner Mix (2004), \"Swim\" from Ray of Light (1998), \"Live to Tell\" (1986) and \"Take a Bow\" (1994). \"Nobody Knows Me\" was first rehearsed in Peter Rauhofer's Perfect Private Life Mix. The opening song for the show was decided as \"Vogue\" (1990) for a long time, until Madonna decided to use \"The Beast Within\" as the opener.[11] The finale of the show was decided to be \"Holiday\" (1983) rather than \"Die Another Day\" (2002) with the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" (1971) being added to the setlist. \"Don't Tell Me\" (2001) was rehearsed in two versions â€“ a French video backdrop version for the American leg and Paris shows, and the \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" version for the other tour stops.[11] Two new tracks rehearsed for the show included \"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\", written by Madonna and Joe Henry, and \"I Love New York\". The latter was incorporated as a bonus track of the live Re-Invention Tour CD I'm Going To Tell You A Secret (2005) and remade as a dance track for her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), while the former was included in her eleventh studio album Hard Candy (2008). \"Ray of Light\" was also rehearsed during the initial phases, but Madonna later decided to eliminate it, as performing the song at the beginning of the show would hurt her voice beforehand.[11] Finally twenty-four of the thirty rehearsed songs ended up on being the official setlist for the show."]}}}
