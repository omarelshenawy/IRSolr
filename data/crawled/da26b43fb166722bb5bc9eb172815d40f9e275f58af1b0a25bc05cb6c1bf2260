In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean, claimed the continent for Britain, and named it New South Wales.[71] In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788.[72] Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840.[73] The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold,[74] mainly due to gold rushes in the colony of Victoria, making its capital Melbourne the richest city in the world[75] and the largest city after London in the British Empire.[76]"]}}}
