Ottawa, the capital of Canada, is located in Ontario as well. The Ontario Government projected a population of 13,150,000 people residing in the province of Ontario as of July 2009. The province takes its name from Lake Ontario, which is thought to be derived from Ontar√≠:io, a Huron (Wyandot) word meaning \"great lake\", or possibly skanadario which means \"beautiful water\" in Iroquoian. The province contains over 250,000 freshwater lakes."],"after":[]}}}
