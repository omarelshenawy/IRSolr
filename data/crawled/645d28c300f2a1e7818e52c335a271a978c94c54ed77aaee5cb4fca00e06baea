Solving this, by a process known as completing the square, leads to the quadratic formula","A quadratic equation is one which includes a term with an exponent of 2, for example, ,[35] and no term with higher exponent. The name derives from the Latin quadrus, meaning square.[36] In general, a quadratic equation can be expressed in the form ,[37] where is not zero (if it were zero, then the equation would not be quadratic but linear). Because of this a quadratic equation must contain the term , which is known as the quadratic term. Hence , and so we may divide by and rearrange the equation into the standard form"],"after":["where the symbol \"Â±\" indicates that both","are solutions of the quadratic equation."]}}}
