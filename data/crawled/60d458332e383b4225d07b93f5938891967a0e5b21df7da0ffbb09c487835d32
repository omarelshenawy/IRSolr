Given a plane (2-dimensional subspace) of Rn, one can find an orthonormal basis {b1,b2} spanning the plane, and thus find a unit pseudoscalar I = b1b2 representing this plane. The geometric product of any two vectors in the span of b1 and b2 lies in , that is, it is the sum of a 0-vector and a 2-vector."],"after":["It is sometimes possible to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in the real algebra that square to âˆ’1, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces."]}}}
