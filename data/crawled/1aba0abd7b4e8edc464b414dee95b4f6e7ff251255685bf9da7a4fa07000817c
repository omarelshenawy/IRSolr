There are more people of Lebanese and Portuguese diaspora living in Brazil than in their respective homelands. The German, Polish and more interestingly, the Romani People[citation needed] diaspora, is the second largest. The Syrian ranks, depending on the source, on first or second place. The Spanish diaspora ranks on third or fourth place.[citation needed] Also, Brazil is home to the only still ancient Pomeranian speaking (Pomeranian language) community in the world, the language is now extinct."],"after":["In the 2005 detailed census, for the first time in two decades, the number of White Brazilians did not exceed 50% of the population. On the other side, the number of pardos (multiracial) people increased and all the others remained almost the same. According to the IBGE, this trend is mainly because of the revaluation of the identity of historically discriminated ethnic groups."]}}}
