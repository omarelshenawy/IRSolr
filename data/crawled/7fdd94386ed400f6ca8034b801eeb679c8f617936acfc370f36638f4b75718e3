The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures.[60]"],"after":["Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960.[55] The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after.[60] Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction.[55] Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete,[63] reinforced with rustproof steel cables.[66]"]}}}
