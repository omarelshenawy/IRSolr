His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict.[20] Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918 and later gained a pilot's licence.[21]"],"after":["Throughout the 1920s, Edward, as Prince of Wales, represented his father, King George V, at home and abroad on many occasions. His rank, travels, good looks, and unmarried status gained him much public attention, and at the height of his popularity, he was the most photographed celebrity of his time.[22] He took a particular interest in science and in 1926 was president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when his alma mater, Oxford University, hosted the society's annual general meeting.[23] He also visited the poverty-stricken areas of the country,[24] and undertook 16 tours to various parts of the Empire between 1919 and 1935. On a tour of Canada in 1919 he acquired the Bedingfield ranch, near Pekisko, Alberta,[25] and in 1924 he donated the Prince of Wales Trophy to the National Hockey League.[26] From January to April 1931, he and his brother, Prince George, travelled 18,000 miles on a tour of South America, voyaging out on the ocean liner Oropesa[27] and returning via Paris and an Imperial Airways flight from Parisâ€“Le Bourget Airport that landed specially in Windsor Great Park.[28][29]"]}}}
