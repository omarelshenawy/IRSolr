Such an established event provides a \"tephra horizon\". The premise of the technique is that each volcanic event produces ash with a unique chemical \"fingerprint\" that allows the deposit to be identified across the area affected by fallout. Thus, once the volcanic event has been independently dated, the tephra horizon will act as time marker."]}}}
