He once stated he did not taste \"strong liquor\" until he was thirty[110] and occasionally argued for prohibition.[111] One of his earliest long fiction works, the novel Franklin Evans; or, The Inebriate, first published November 23, 1842, is a temperance novel.[112] Whitman wrote the novel at the height of popularity of the Washingtonian movement though the movement itself was plagued with contradictions, as was Franklin Evans.[113] Years later Whitman claimed he was embarrassed by the book[114] and called it a \"damned rot\".[115] He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was under the influence of alcohol himself.[116] Even so, he wrote other pieces recommending temperance, including The Madman and a short story \"Reuben's Last Wish\".[117] Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol, enjoying local wines and champagne.[118]"]}}}
