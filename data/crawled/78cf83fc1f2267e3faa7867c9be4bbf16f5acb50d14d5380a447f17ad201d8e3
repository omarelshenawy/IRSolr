The poems were probably written over a period of several years. All but two first appeared in a 1609 collection; numbers 138 (\"When my love swears that she is made of truth\") and 144 (\"Two loves have I, of comfort and despair\") had previously been published in a 1599 miscellany entitled The Passionate Pilgrim."]}}}
