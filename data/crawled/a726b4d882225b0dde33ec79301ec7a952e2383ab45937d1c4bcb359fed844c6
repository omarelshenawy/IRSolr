Lacantuniidae is included in the Sullivan scheme based on recent evidence that places it sister to Claroteidae.[54]","According to morphological data, Diplomystidae is usually considered to be the most primitive of catfish and the sister group to the remaining catfish, grouped in a clade called Siluroidei. Recent molecular evidence contrasts the prevailing hypothesis, where the suborder Loricarioidei are the sister group to all catfish, including Diplomystidae (Diplomystoidei) and Siluroidei; though they were not able to reject the past hypothesis, the new hypothesis is not unsupported. Siluroidei was found to be monophyletic without Loricarioid families or Diplomystidae with molecular evidence; morphological evidence is unknown that supports Siluroidei without Loricarioidea.[46]"],"after":[]}}}
