Garrett, who was the first Principal of the Central High School in Bangalore, now known as Central College.[3] The construction of the palace was started in 1862 and completed in 1944. In 1884, it was bought by the Maharaja of Mysore, Chamaraja Wodeyar.[3] Now owned by the current scion of the Mysore royal family, Srikanta Datta Narsimharaja Wadiyar, the palace has recently undergone a renovation. The sprawling grounds surrounding the palace are used for holding public events including music concerts. Some of the well known international music bands and rockstars that have performed here include heavy metal legends Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Sting, Scorpions, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Bryan Adams .[4][1][5][6]"]}}}
