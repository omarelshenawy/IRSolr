Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: \"I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always promoted freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; that would be a tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political.\"[89] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying …My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls – Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria – have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom.\"[90] The response was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel.[91] Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: \"With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts.\"[92] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance.[93] Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date.[93] Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits \"public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors\", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a \"freedom fighter\" and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community.[94] In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout."],"after":["Though her speech was met with much praise from the media, on August 17, it was announced that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting \"homosexual propaganda\" which was against the law, and allegedly \"insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights\" at the concert.[95] According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, \"She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So we will speak in the language of money… maybe someone does not see the link but after Madonna’s concert maybe some boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders — for me it causes moral suffering.\"[96]"]}}}
