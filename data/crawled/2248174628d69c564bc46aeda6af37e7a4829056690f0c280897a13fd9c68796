Las Vegas Weekly wrote that MÜS.I.C. had \"game-changing potential\" because it was the first time hip-hop dance had headlined a show on the Las Vegas Strip.[114] In contrast, the Las Vegas Review-Journal (LVRJ) criticized the show for being repetitious and for having a bare stage for the first 20 minutes.[115] LVRJ also criticized the use of masks as not appealing to a casual viewer because it inhibited the dancers' personality: \"Even if a generational split is in play here, it would be tough to hear the creators argue that the show would suffer if, after 20 minutes or so -- gasp! -- makeup or clown-face replaced the masks to expand the original concept.\"[115] In October 2010, the show moved to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. Changes to the original show included a bigger stage, a new set, and added dance routines.[116] CraveOnline.com called the new show \"amazing\"[117] and Zap2It.com described it as \"a vibrant, frenetic and multi-genre extravaganza of visuals, sound and movement.\"[65]"]}}}
