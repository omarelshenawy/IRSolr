It now has seven designated platforms but once had fourteen. The station lost its original roof in the 1972 Chester General rail crash. In September 2007 extensive renovations took place to improve pedestrian access, and parking.[95] The present station has manned ticket offices and barriers, waiting rooms, toilets, shops and a pedestrian bridge with lifts.
