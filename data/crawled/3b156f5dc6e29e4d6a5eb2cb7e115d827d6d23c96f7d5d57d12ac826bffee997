However, the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free-speech advocates.[298][299] Among the criticisms raised, one suggestion is that Scientology's true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics.[300][301]"],"after":["The Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the World Wide Web, and lobbied for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general. The Church supported the controversial Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act as well as the even more controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
