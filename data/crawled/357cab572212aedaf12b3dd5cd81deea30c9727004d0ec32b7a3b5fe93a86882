The discourse of ethno-nationalist groups such as the Front National (FN), however, advances the concept of Français de souche or \"indigenous\" French."],"after":["The conventional conception of French history starts with Ancient Gaul, and French national identity often views the Gauls as national precursors, either as biological ancestors (hence the refrain nos ancêtres les Gaulois), as emotional/spiritual ancestors, or both.[68][69][70] Vercingetorix, the Gaulish chieftain who tried to unite the various Gallic tribes of the land against Roman encroachment but was ultimately vanquished by Julius Caesar, is often revered as a \"first national hero\".[69][70] In the famously popular French comic Asterix, the main characters are patriotic Gauls fight against Roman invaders[68][70] while in modern days the term Gaulois is used in French to distinguish the \"native\" French from French of immigrant origins. However, despite its occasional nativist usage, the Gaulish identity has also been embraced by French of non-native origins as well: notably, Napoleon III, whose family was ultimately of Corsican and Italian roots, identified France with Gaul and Vercingetorix,[70] and declared that \"New France, ancient France, Gaul are one and the same moral person.\"[69]"]}}}
