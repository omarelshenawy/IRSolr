The addition of a wing to Vale Royal Abbey (1860) was in Elizabethan style while St John's Church at Over (1860–63) was of the Gothic Revival in Early Decorated style.[41][42][43] The Congregational Chapel, also at Over (1865) was again different, being built in polychromic brick in High Victorian style.[43][44] Meanwhile Douglas had designed a shop at 19–21 Sankey Street, Warrington (1864) with Gothic arcades and detailed stone carving which Hubbard considers to be his \"first building of real and outstanding quality...in its way one of the best things he ever did\".[45] Shortly after this came the first commissions for the Grosvenor family, consisting of a lodge and other structures in Grosvenor Park, Chester (1865–67),[46][47] and St John the Baptist's Church, Aldford (1865–66).[48][49] His first commission for a large house was Oakmere Hall (1867) for John & Thomas Johnson, industrialists of Runcorn. It is in High Victorian style and includes a main block and a service wing, a large tower on the south face, a small tower with turrets, a porte-cochère, steep roofs and dormer windows.[22][50][51] Another early church was St Ann's at Warrington (1868–69), again High Victorian in style, which is described as being \"quite startlingly bold\" and \"a prodigy church in Douglas's output\".[52][53] By 1869–70 Douglas had started to design buildings on the Eaton Hall estate.[54] Around this time he also re-modelled St Mary's Church, Dodleston.[55]"]}}}
