In matrix form","For a system of the form , some sources also require that the Jacobian matrix be non-singular in order to call this an implicit ODE [system]; an implicit ODE system satisfying this Jacobian non-singularity condition can be transformed into an explicit ODE system. In the same sources, implicit ODE systems with a singular Jacobian are termed differential algebraic equations (DAEs). This distinction is not merely one of terminology; DAEs have fundamentally different characteristics and are generally more involved to solve than (nonsigular) ODE systems.[14][15] Presumably for additional derivatives, the Hessian matrix and so forth are also assumed non-singular according to this scheme,[citation needed] although note that any ODE of order greater than one can [and usually is] rewritten as system of ODEs of first order,[16] which makes the Jacobian singularity criterion sufficient for this taxonomy to be comprehensive at all orders."]}}}
