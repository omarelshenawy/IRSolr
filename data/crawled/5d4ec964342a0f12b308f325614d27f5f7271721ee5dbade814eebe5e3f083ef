The roof is a glass and steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company,[49] with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there."],"after":["Today, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest museums in the world, covering an area of over 92,000 m2 (990,000 sq. ft).[3][50] In addition to 21,600 m2 (232,000 sq. ft)[51] of on-site storage space, and 9,400 m2 (101,000 sq. ft)[51] of external storage space. Altogether the British Museum showcases on public display less than 1%[51] of its entire collection, approximately 50,000 items.[52] There are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public, representing 2 miles (3.2 km) of exhibition space, although the less popular ones have restricted opening times. However, the lack of a large temporary exhibition space has led to the £135 million World Conservation and Exhibition Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the Museum's conservation facilities into one Conservation Centre. This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners. It was granted planning permission in December 2009 and was completed in time for the Viking exhibition in March 2014.[53][54]"]}}}
