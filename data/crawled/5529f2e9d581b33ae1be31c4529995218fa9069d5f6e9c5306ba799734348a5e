The inner product is an example of a bilinear form, and it gives the vector space a geometric structure by allowing for the definition of length and angles. Formally, an inner product is a map"],"after":["that satisfies the following three axioms for all vectors u, v, w in V and all scalars a in F:[16][17]"]}}}
