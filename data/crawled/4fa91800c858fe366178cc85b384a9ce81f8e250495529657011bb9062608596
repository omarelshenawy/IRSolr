In Chapter 2 of his 1671 work \"Methodus fluxionum et Serierum Infinitarum\",[1] Isaac Newton listed three kinds of differential equations: those involving two derivatives (or fluxions) and only one undifferentiated quantity ; those involving and ; and those involving more than two derivatives. As examples of the three cases, he solves the equations:"],"after":["He solves these examples and others using infinite series and discusses the non-uniqueness of solutions."]}}}
