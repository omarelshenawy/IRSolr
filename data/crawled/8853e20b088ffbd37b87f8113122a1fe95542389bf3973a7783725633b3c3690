This led to the creation of ethnically specific or multiculturalist forms of feminism.[9] Feminism has been criticized by some people who believe that feminists are trying to take away men's rights.[10]"],"after":["Charles Fourier, a Utopian Socialist and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word \"féminisme\" in 1837.[11] The words \"féminisme\" (\"feminisme\") and \"féminist\" (\"feminist\") first appeared in France and the Netherlands in 1872,[12] Great Britain in the 1890s, and the United States in 1910,[13][14] and the Oxford English Dictionary lists 1852 as the year of the first appearance of \"feminist\"[15] and 1895 for \"feminism\".[16] Depending on historical moment, culture and country, feminists around the world have had different causes and goals. Most western feminist historians assert that all movements that work to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves.[17][18][19][20][21][22] Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants. Those historians use the label \"protofeminist\" to describe earlier movements.[23]"]}}}
