Arousal may be broken up into four somewhat arbitrary phases: Excitement, Plateau, Orgasm, and Resolution."],"after":["Vaginal lubrication begins first. This is caused by vasocongestion of the vaginal walls. Increased blood pooling there causes moisture to seep from the walls. These droplets collect together and flow out of the vagina, moistening the vulva. The labia majora flatten and spread apart, and the clitoris and labia minora increase in size."]}}}
