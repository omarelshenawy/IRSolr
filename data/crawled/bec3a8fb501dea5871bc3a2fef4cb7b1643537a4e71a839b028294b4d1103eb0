It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers. Of the 4,200 students enrolled, more than 60% come from abroad.[12] As a business school, SBE is accredited by EQUIS, AACSB and the Association of MBAs. According to the school's website, this Triple Crown accreditation has only been achieved by 1% of business schools worldwide.[13] SBE offers bachelor's programmes (B.Sc.) in International Business, Economics and Business Economics, Fiscal Economics, and Econometrics and Operations, as well as a number of master's programmes, executive master's programmes and MBA's.
