Remains from the Bronze Age period are far more widespread.[5] Early Irish tribes formed the Kingdom of Uí Cheinnsealaig, an area that was slightly larger than the current County Wexford. The county was one of the earliest areas of Ireland to be Christianised, in the early 5th century. Later, from 819 onwards, the Vikings plundered many Christian sites in the county.[8] Wexford town became a Viking settlement near the end of the 9th century.[8]"]}}}
