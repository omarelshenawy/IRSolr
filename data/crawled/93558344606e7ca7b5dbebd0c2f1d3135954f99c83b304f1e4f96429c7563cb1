They were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various British monarchs. Together these four \"foundation collections\" included many of the most treasured books now in the British Library[10] including the Lindisfarne Gospels and the sole surviving copy of Beowulf.[c]"],"after":["The British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum â€“ national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, while including a vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific interests.[11] The addition of the Cotton and Harley manuscripts introduced a literary and antiquarian element and meant that the British Museum now became both national museum and library.[12]"]}}}
