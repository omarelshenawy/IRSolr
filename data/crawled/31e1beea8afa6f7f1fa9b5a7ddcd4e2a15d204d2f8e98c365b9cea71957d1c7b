The appropriate estimator is the sample mean:","A machine fills cups with a liquid, and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of liquid. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250 g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be normally distributed (although this assumption is not necessary for the theory to work) around the desired average of 250 g, with a standard deviation, σ, of 2.5 g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of n = 25 cups of liquid are chosen at random and the cups are weighed. The resulting measured masses of liquid are X1, ..., X25, a random sample from X."],"after":["The sample shows actual weights x1, ..., x25, with mean:"]}}}
