The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.[170] The move was hailed by conservationists for \"its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area\".[171]"],"after":["In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.[172] Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling.[173] However, the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, \"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\"[173] Bush had said in June 2008, \"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\"[174]"]}}}
