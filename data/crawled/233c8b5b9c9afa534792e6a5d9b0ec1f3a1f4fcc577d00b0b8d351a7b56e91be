In the early stages of European (P훮keh훮) settlement of the country, the South Island had the majority of the European population and wealth due to the 1860s gold rushes. The North Island population overtook the South in the early 20th century, with 56% of the population living in the North in 1911, and the drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the century.[2]"],"after":["Charcoal drawings can be found on limestone rock shelters in the centre of the South Island, with over 500 sites[3] stretching from Kaikoura to North Otago. The drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old, and portray animals, people and fantastic creatures, possibly stylised reptiles.[4] Some of the birds pictured are long extinct, including moa and Haast's eagles. They were drawn by early M훮ori, but by the time Europeans arrived, local M훮ori did not know the origins of the drawings.[5]"]}}}
