Trains are frequent, with one or two trains per hour on lesser lines, two to four trains per hour on average, and up to eight trains an hour on the busiest lines."],"after":["Cycling is a ubiquitous mode of transport in the Netherlands. Almost as many kilometres are covered by bicycle as by train.[115] The Dutch are estimated to have at least 18 million bicycles,[119][120] which makes more than one per capita, and twice as many as the ca. 9 million motor vehicles on the road.[121] In 2013, the European Cyclists' Federation ranked both the Netherlands and Denmark as the most bike-friendly countries in Europe,[122] but more of the Dutch (31%) than of the Danes (19%) list the bike as their main mode of transport for daily activities.[123] Cycling infrastructure is comprehensive. Busy roads have received some 35,000 km of dedicated cycle tracks, physically segregated from motorised traffic.[124] Busy junctions are often equipped with bicycle-specific traffic lights. There are large bicycle parking facilities, particularly in city centres and at train stations."]}}}
