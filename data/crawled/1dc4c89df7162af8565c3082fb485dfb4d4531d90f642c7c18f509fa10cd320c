An Aramaic inscription on the side was thought to read \"Joseph son of Caiaphas\" and on the basis of this the bones of an elderly man were considered to belong to the High Priest Caiaphas.[1][8] Since the original discovery this identification has been challenged by some scholars on various grounds, including the spelling of the inscription, the lack of any mention of Caiaphas' status as High Priest, the plainness of the tomb (although the ossuary itself is as ornate as might be expected from someone of his rank and family), and other reasons.[8][9]"]}}}
