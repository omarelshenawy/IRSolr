By many accounts, it was decisive in the selection of Canberra as the site in 1908, as was a result of survey work done by the government surveyor Charles Scrivener.[33] The NSW government ceded the Federal Capital Territory (as it was then known) to the federal government.[29] In an international design competition conducted by the Department of Home Affairs, on 24 May 1911,[34] the design by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was chosen for the city,[35][36] and in 1913 Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began.[37]"],"after":[]}}}
