It began with calliope fanfare as a pierrot - who makes several cameos later - appears from the red curtain near a tall go-go pole on which a topless dancer Carrie Ann Inaba performed. Madonna then makes her entrance striking poses and swinging her whip in dominatrix gear from a spotlit platform to sing \"Erotica\". Next came \"Fever\" where she takes her jacket, mask and glove off and dances suggestively before disappearing among flames. \"Vogue\" is performed in a beaded headdress with a Hindu flavor; she serenaded the audience with a Motown-influenced \"Rain\", complete with a \"Singin' In The Rain\" dance interlude which features the pierrot. Afterwards, she descends from the ceiling on a giant glitter ball, wearing a blond afro wig (inspired by the 1932 film Blonde Venus which stars Marlene Dietrich) to perform a disco-styled \"Express Yourself\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\". Following a simulated orgy, she sings \"Why's It So Hard\" and \"In This Life\"; the pierrot watches Madonna during the latter song."]}}}
