One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House,[46] while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life.[47] Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, \"[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour\".[48]"]}}}
