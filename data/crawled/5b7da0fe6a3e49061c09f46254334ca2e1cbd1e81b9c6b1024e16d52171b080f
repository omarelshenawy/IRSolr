The term \"monkey bars\" was first documented in 1955,[2] though Hinton's initial patent of 1920 appeals to the \"monkey instinct\" in claiming the benefits of climbing as exercise and play for children,[3] and his improvement patents later that year refer to monkeys shaking the bars of a cage, children swinging on a \"monkey runway\", and the game of \"monkey tag\".[4] Hinton's father, a mathematician, had built a similar structure from bamboo when Hinton was a child; his father's goal was to enable children to achieve an intuitive understanding of 3-dimensional space through a game in which numbers for the x, y, and z axes were called out and each child tried to be the first to grasp the indicated junction. Thus the abstraction of Cartesian coordinates could be grasped as a name of a tangible point in space.[5]"]}}}
