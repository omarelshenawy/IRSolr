Through her days, Louise gets distracted by cigarettes, cocktails, and random hook-ups, as lamented in the song's lyrics.[9] Christopher Walken plays her guardian angel, who watches over her self-destructive activities.[9] In one scene Louise wakes up alone in her bed after a one-night stand and discovers a hand-written note laying on the pillow beside her. She is clearly upset after reading the note and she crumples it and throws it to the ground. The next scene shows her guardian angel reading the note which simply reads \"thank you whoever you are.\" In a later scene her guardian angel delivers Louise with a \"kiss of death\" before her final encounter with a man, during which it is suggested she was strangled with pantyhose.[9] After her death, she reappears as a spirit alongside with her guardian angel overseeing the police taking her body away to the morgue.[23] Author Carol Vernallis, in her book Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context, points out that there are several examples of \"iconic imagery\" throughout the music video which helps the viewer predict the final outcome of Madonna's character.[24] According to Vernallis, Madonna's black dress, encased in dry cleaner's plastic symbolizes the body-bag she will eventually be carried out in; her cat hissing at her suggests that she is a ghost or a figure that bears a curse; and a doorway that she passes through during the music video looks like the entrance to Hades.[24]"]}}}
