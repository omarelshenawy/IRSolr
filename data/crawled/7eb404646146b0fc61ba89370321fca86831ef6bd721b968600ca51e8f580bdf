She wore a black top and long black skirt with her hair in knots and a crucifix attached.[42] After an energetic performance of \"Over and Over\", Madonna sat on some steps and sang \"Crazy for You\". Paul Grein, music editor of Billboard, commented that \"She was at her best on 'Crazy for You', making good use of a deeper, huskier vocal quality that mirrors the song's deeper lyrical approach.[43] The performance was included in the VHS release Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour recorded in Detroit, Michigan.[44]"]}}}
