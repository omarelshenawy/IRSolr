The first three identities say that A is a *-algebra. The last identity is called the C* identity and is equivalent to:"],"after":["The C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the spectral radius formula, it implies that the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:"]}}}
