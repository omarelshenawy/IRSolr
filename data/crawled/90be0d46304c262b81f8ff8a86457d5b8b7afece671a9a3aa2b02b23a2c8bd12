For example, all postal code systems are necessarily hierarchical. Using the Canadian postal code system, the top level's binding concept is the \"postal district\", and consists of 18 objects (letters). The next level down is the \"zone\", where the objects are the digits 0â€“9. This is an example of an overlapping hierarchy, because each of these 10 objects has 18 parents. The hierarchy continues downward to generate, in theory, 7,200,000 unique codes of the format A0A 0A0. Most library classification systems are also hierarchical. The Dewey Decimal System is regarded as infinitely hierarchical because there is no finite bound on the number of digits can be used after the decimal point.[18]"],"after":[]}}}
