It began with a dramatic performance of \"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\"; Madonna entered amidst billows of dry ice, dressed in a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, jeans with zips and bondage straps, a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt. She performed the song standing on the middle platform of the stage.[9][16] Afterwards a chaotic cyberpunk-themed performance of \"Impressive Instant\" started, with dancers in gasmasks and headlights. She then played guitar for \"Candy Perfume Girl\", leading to the performance of \"Beautiful Stranger\" featuring a lost stage technician. Backdrops displayed scenes from the movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and psychedelic fluorescent whirls.[20] The first section finished with \"Ray of Light\" where Madonna danced energetically across the stage.[21]"]}}}
