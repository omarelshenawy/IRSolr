During the 1820s both the Boers (original Dutch, Flemish, German, and French settlers) and the British 1820 Settlers claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho and Boer groups who competed to expand their territories."],"after":["In the first two decades of the 19th century, the Zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader, Shaka.[30] Shaka's warfare led indirectly to the Mfecane (\"crushing\") that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early 1820s.[31][32] An offshoot of the Zulu, the Matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king Mzilikazi."]}}}
