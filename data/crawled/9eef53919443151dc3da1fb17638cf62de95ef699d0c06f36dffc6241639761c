This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of Sardinia, the Pontine Marshes, the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber River. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, runoff from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.[125]"],"after":["The term malaria originates from Medieval Italian: mala aria — \"bad air\"; the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland.[126] The term first appeared in the English literature about 1829.[127] Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America,[128] where it is no longer endemic,[129] though imported cases do occur.[130]"]}}}
