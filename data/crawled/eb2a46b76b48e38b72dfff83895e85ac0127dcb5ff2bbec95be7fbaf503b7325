The role of the treaties and the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982.[118] These rights may include provision of services such as health care, and exemption from taxation.[120] The legal and policy framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nationsâ€“Federal Crown Political Accord.[118]"],"after":["Canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since 2000 by the Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (the first female Chief Justice).[121] Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.
