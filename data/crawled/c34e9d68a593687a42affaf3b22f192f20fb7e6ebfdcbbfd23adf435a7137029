Some news sources reported that \"critics were completely divided on their opinions\".[66] When nine reviews of the critics who had seen the film in Venice were tabulated, The Huffington Post gave the film the overall critical score of D.[67] Steve Pond of Reuters theorized that W.E probably would not help in \"turning Madonna's faltering movie career\".[68] Kyle Buchanan of New York wondered whether W.E. would receive any significant film related awards, as predicted by industry prognosticators. He concluded that the film \"still may [receive awards], but to judge from some of the vicious pans coming out of Venice today, it might have longer legs as a Razzie front-runner.\"[69] Daily Mail‍ '​s Baz Bamigboye gave the film a mostly positive review, saying that \"A lot of people will loathe it, simply because it’s been made by Madonna.
