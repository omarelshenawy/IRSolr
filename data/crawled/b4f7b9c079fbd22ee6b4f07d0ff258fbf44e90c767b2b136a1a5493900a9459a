Asked in December 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers demurred, \"It's not a question that's posing itself.\"[29] When The New York Times renewed the question in 2012, Silvers said, \"I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors. Some of them work here, some used to work here, and some are just people we know. I think they would put out a terrific paper, but it would be different.\"[30] In 2008, the Review celebrated its 45th anniversary with a panel discussion at the New York Public Library, moderated by Silvers, discussing \"What Happens Now\" in the United States after the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president. Panelists included Review contributors such as Didion, Wills, novelist and literary critic Darryl Pinckney, political commentator Michael Tomasky, and Columbia University professor and contributor Andrew Delbanco.[31] The 45th anniversary edition of the Review (November 20, 2008) began with a posthumous piece by Edmund Wilson, who wrote for the paper's first issue in 1963.[20]"],"after":["In 2008, the paper moved its headquarters from Midtown Manhattan to 435 Hudson Street, located in the West Village.[29] In 2010, it launched a blog section of its website[32] that The New York Times calls \"lively and opinionated\",[30] and it hosts podcasts.[33][34] Regarding how social media might affect the subject matter of the Review, Silvers commented: \"I might imagine [a] witty, aphoristic, almost Oscar Wildean [anthology of] remarks, drawn from the millions and millions of tweets. Or from comments that follow on blogs. ... Facebook is a medium in which privacy is, or at least is thought to be, in some way crucial. ... And so there seems a resistance to intrusive criticism. We seem at the edge of a vast, expanding ocean of words ... growing without any critical perspective whatever being brought to bear on it. To me, as an editor, that seems an enormous absence.\"[35]"]}}}
