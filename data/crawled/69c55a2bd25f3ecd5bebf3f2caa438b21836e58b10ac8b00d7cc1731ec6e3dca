Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified \"Shinto religion\", but rather to a collection of native beliefs and mythology.[5] Shinto today is a term that applies to the religion of public shrines devoted to the worship of a multitude of gods (kami),[6] suited to various purposes such as war memorials and harvest festivals, and applies as well to various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and ritual, dating from around the time of the Nara and Heian periods.[5]"]}}}
