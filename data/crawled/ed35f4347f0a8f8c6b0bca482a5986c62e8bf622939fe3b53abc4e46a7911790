In many respects they are analogous to fluid inclusions. Melt inclusions are generally small - most are less than 100 micrometres across (a micrometre is one thousandth of a millimeter, or about 0.00004Â inches). Nevertheless they can provide an abundance of useful information. Using microscopic observations and a range of chemical microanalysis techniques geochemists and igneous petrologists can obtain a range of useful information from melt inclusions. Two of the most common uses of melt inclusions are to study the compositions of magmas present early in the history of specific magma systems. This is because inclusions can act like \"fossils\" - trapping and preserving these early melts before they are modified by later igneous processes. In addition, because they are trapped at high pressures many melt inclusions also provide important information about the contents of volatile elements (such as H2O, CO2, S and Cl) that drive explosive volcanic eruptions."]}}}
