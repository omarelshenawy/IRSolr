In modern typography, and where technological limitations make its use difficult (such as in use of typewriters, first telegraphs or ASCII), æ is often eschewed in favour of the digraph ae. Usage experts often consider this incorrect, especially when rendering foreign words where æ is considered a letter (e.g. Æsir, Ærø) or brand names which make use of the ligature (e.g. Æon Flux, Encyclopædia Britannica). In the United States, the problem of the ligature is sidestepped in many cases by use of a simplified spelling with \"e\", as has also happened with œ. Usage however may vary; for example, medieval is now more common than mediaeval (and the now old-fashioned mediæval) even in the UK,[1] while archaeology is preferred over archeology even in the US.[2] Given their long history, ligatures are sometimes used to invoke archaism or in literal quotations of historic sources; for instance, words such as dæmon or æther are often treated in this way. The ligature is seen on gravestones of the 19th century, short for \"ævum\" (age at the time of death), i.e. \"Æ xxYs, yyMs, zzDs.\" It is also common in formal typography (invitations, resolutions, announcements, and some government documents)."]}}}
