Consequently it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as 'the Great', rather than any of Alfred's contemporaries.[130] The epithet was retained by succeeding generations of Parliamentarians and empire-builders who saw Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education and establishment of the rule of law as supporting their own ideals.[130]"],"after":["The Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments HMS King Alfred, and one of the first ships of the American Navy was named USS Alfred in his honor."]}}}
