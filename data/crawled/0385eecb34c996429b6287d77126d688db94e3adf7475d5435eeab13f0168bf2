It draws upon industrial organization (IO) economics to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and therefore attractiveness of an Industry. Attractiveness in this context refers to the overall industry profitability. An \"unattractive\" industry is one in which the combination of these five forces acts to drive down overall profitability. A very unattractive industry would be one approaching \"pure competition\", in which available profits for all firms are driven to normal profit. This analysis is associated with its principal innovator Michael E. Porter of Harvard University."]}}}
