In some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to deficiency diseases; however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to use nutritionally balanced food sources.[108] The human diet is prominently reflected in human culture, and has led to the development of food science."]}}}
