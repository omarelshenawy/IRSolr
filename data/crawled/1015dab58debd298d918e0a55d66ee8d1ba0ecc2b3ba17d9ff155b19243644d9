According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed.[14][15][16][17] This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture."],"after":[]}}}
