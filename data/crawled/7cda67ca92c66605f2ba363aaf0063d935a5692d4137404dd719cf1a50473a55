Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\"[142] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend at the time to visit him.[143] Lennon, jealous by nature, eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence.[144] Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude to women. The Beatles song \"Getting Better\", he said, told his own story, \"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace\".[126]"]}}}
