He himself presented a well-attended lecture series at the Union, with lively debates at the end, on psychological experiments.[22] Over this time he also published three papers on his study with inverting lenses and how people adapt over time to such a view of the world: \"Upright vision and the retinal image\", \"Vision without inversion of the retinal image\", and \"A mirror pseudoscope and the limit of visible depth\", all in Psychological Review.[23] He also presented a report of experiments with inverted vision to the Science Association of the university.[24]"]}}}
