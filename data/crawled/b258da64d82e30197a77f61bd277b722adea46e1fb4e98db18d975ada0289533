In its first three years (2001â€“2004), Susning.nu ran as an open wiki that anyone could edit. Susning didn't have a pronounced ambition and could perhaps be compared in scope to Everything2; Aronsson's stated original aim for Susning was \"to make it into whatever the users want it to be\".[citation needed] As such, Susning was an encyclopedia, a dictionary, and a discussion forum about any concept of interest to its users. Because of this, Susning grew and became Sweden's biggest and the world's next biggest wiki. In April 2004, Susning had over 60,000 articles on various topics, which was more than any Swedish wiki at that time. During its first few years it was in direct competition with the Swedish Wikipedia. However, because of the website's popularity, Susning was highly affected by vandals. In attempt at preventing vandalism, many efforts were made by Susning's founder Lars Aronsson, which were mostly unsuccessful. Users who regularly edited at Susning were called susare."]}}}
