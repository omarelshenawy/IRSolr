(This is one of two different meanings of the term \"n-torus\".) Recalling that the torus is the product space of two circles, the n-dimensional torus is the product of n circles. That is:"],"after":["The 1-torus is just the circle: T1 = S1. The torus discussed above is the 2-torus, T2. And similar to the 2-torus, the n-torus, Tn can be described as a quotient of Rn under integral shifts in any coordinate. That is, the n-torus is Rn modulo the action of the integer lattice Zn (with the action being taken as vector addition). Equivalently, the n-torus is obtained from the n-dimensional hypercube by gluing the opposite faces together."]}}}
