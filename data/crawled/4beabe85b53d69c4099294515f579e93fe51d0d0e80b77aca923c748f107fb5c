She had previously modeled for their 2006 campaign which involved herself and crew from the 2006 Confessions Tour and had designed a tracksuit which was worn in the advertisements.[1] The collection consisted of leather trench coats, sequined shift dresses, cream-colored calf-length pants and matching cropped jackets. H&M said the collection reflected Madonna's \"timeless, unique and always glamorous style.\" Madonna also directed the television commercial to advertise the collection.[4] The collaboration involved H&M's head of design, Margareta Van Den Bosch and Madonna commented \"I've made no secret of my love for fashion and trends. Working with Margareta and H&M was an exciting and new creative challenge for me. I'm really happy with the results and look forward to wearing M by Madonna along with the rest of the world.\"[5]"]}}}
