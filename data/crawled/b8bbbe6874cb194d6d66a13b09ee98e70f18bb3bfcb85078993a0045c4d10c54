Ignoring the orders of the Wuhan-based KMT government, he marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by Communist militias. Although the Communists welcomed Chiang's arrival, he turned on them, massacring 5000 with the aid of the Green Gang.[86][89] Chiang's army then marched on Wuhan, but was prevented from taking the city by Communist General Ye Ting and his troops.[90] Chiang's allies also attacked Communists; in Beijing, 19 leading Communists were killed by Zhang Zuolin, while in Changsha, He Jian's forces machine gunned hundreds of peasant militiamen.[91][92] That May, tens of thousands of Communists and their sympathisers were killed by nationalists, with the CPC losing approximately 15,000 of its 25,000 members.[92]"]}}}
