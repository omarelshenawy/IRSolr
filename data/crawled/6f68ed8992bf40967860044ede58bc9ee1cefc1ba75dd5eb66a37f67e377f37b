Only 7.57% of Pakistanis have Urdu as their mother language,[32] but Urdu is understood all over Pakistan. It is used in education, literature, office and court business.[33] It holds in itself a repository of the cultural and social heritage of the country.[34] Although English is used in most elite circles, and Punjabi has a plurality of native speakers, Urdu is the lingua franca and national language of Pakistan. In practice English is used instead of Urdu in the higher echelons of government.[35]"]}}}
