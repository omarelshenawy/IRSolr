We may divide this volume into a sum of simplices. Let be the coordinates of the vertices. At each vertex we assign a measure as the average measure of the simplices sharing the vertex. Then the integral of F(x) with respect to U(x) over this volume is obtained in the limit of finer partitioning of the volume into smaller simplices:"],"after":["As an example, let for a vector-valued function F(x) and a (n-1)-grade multivector A.
