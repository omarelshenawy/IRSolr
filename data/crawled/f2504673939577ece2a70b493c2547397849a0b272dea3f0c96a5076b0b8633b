His thinking influenced Roger Bacon, who spread Grosseteste's ideas from Oxford to the University of Paris during a visit there in the 1240s. From the prestigious universities in Oxford and Paris, the new experimental science spread rapidly throughout the medieval universities: \"And so it went to Galileo, William Gilbert, Francis Bacon, William Harvey, Descartes, Robert Hooke, Newton, Leibniz, and the world of the seventeenth century\" (Crombie 1962:15). So it went to us as well.| Hugh G. Gauch, 2003.[128]"],"after":["Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.[130] He was viewed as \"a lone genius proclaiming the truth about time,\" having correctly calculated the calendar[130] His work in optics provided the platform on which Newton, Descartes, Huygens and others later transformed the science of light. Bacon's groundbreaking advances were due largely to his discovery that experimental science must be based on mathematics. (186–187) His works Opus Majus and De Speculis Comburentibus contain many \"carefully drawn diagrams showing Bacon's meticulous investigations into the behavior of light.\"[130] He gives detailed descriptions of systematic studies using prisms and measurements by which he shows how a rainbow functions.[130]"]}}}
