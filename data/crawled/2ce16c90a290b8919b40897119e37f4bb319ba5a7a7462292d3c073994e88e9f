The Indus Valley Civilization was based in regions of Punjab and Sindh. This was followed by Vedic Civilization, Indo-Greek kingdoms and other native civilizations like the Mauryan Empire and the Gupta Empire. For much of Punjab's middle ages, it was conquered by Muslim invaders as part of Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent. The Mughal Empire, which established itself in India, tried to conquer Punjab many times, but it defended itself under the rule of the Sikh Confederacy. It was the last region to fall into British hands when they established the British Raj in British India."]}}}
