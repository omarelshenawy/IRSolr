Early analog examples of additive synthesizers are the Teleharmonium and Hammond organ. To implement real-time additive synthesis, wavetable synthesis is useful for reducing required hardware/processing power,[63] and is commonly used in low-end MIDI instruments (such as educational keyboards) and low-end sound cards."],"after":["Subtractive synthesis is based on filtering harmonically rich waveforms. Due to its simplicity, it is the basis of early synthesizers such as the Moog synthesizer. Subtractive synthesizers use a simple acoustic model that assumes an instrument can be approximated by a simple signal generator (producing sawtooth waves, square waves, etc.) followed by a filter. The combination of simple modulation routings (such as pulse width modulation and oscillator sync), along with the physically unrealistic lowpass filters, is responsible for the \"classic synthesizer\" sound commonly associated with \"analog synthesis\"â€”a term which is often mistakenly used when referring to software synthesizers using subtractive synthesis."]}}}
