Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 109 million travelers used these three airports in 2012, and the city's airspace is the busiest in the nation.[435] JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively in 2012.
