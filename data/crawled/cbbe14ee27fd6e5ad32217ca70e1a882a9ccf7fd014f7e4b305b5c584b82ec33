The notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book Brittle Power: Energy Strategy for National Security.[165] The authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of the United States. Key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are centralized and easily susceptible to disruption. They conclude that a \"resilient energy supply\" is necessary for both national security and the environment. They recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized.[166]"]}}}
