Amnesty International USA, failed for lack of standing, but Wikimedia and the ACLU believe their new lawsuit will succeed in the light of Snowden's disclosures, citing a classified NSA slide that specifically referred to Wikipedia.[9] Since Clapper, the government itself has confirmed many of the key facts about NSA's upstream surveillance, including that it conducts suspicionless searches.[5] ACLU attorney Patrick Toomey noted the lawsuit is particularly relevant as the plaintiffs engage in \"hundreds of billions of international communications each year\". Any program of upstream surveillance must necessarily sweep up a substantial part of these communications.[5][10]"]}}}
