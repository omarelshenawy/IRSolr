However, only two Africa-born artists, one black and one white, were signed to perform at the main concertsâ€”respectively Youssou N'Dour (Senegal) and Dave Matthews (South Africa), the leader of Dave Matthews Band. Bob Geldof originally said that this was because he had aimed for the biggest-selling, most popular artists to ensure a large television audience; but critics noted that even if this was acceptable as the sole criterion for inclusion, some of the minor white artists signed up were substantially less well-known than some major African artists. Geldof has been accused of compounding the original error by announcing an entirely African line-up (\"Africa Calling\") at a concert to be held at the Eden Project near St. Austell, Cornwall, on the same day as the main Live 8 concerts.[14]"]}}}
