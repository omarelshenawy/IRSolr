It essentially deals with the engineering of chemicals, energy and the processes that create and/or convert them. Modern chemical engineers are concerned with processes that convert raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms. They are also concerned with pioneering valuable materials and related techniques â€“ which are often essential to related fields such as nanotechnology, fuel cells and bioengineering."]}}}
