What makes this notable is not that light shines in the passageway, but that it does not do so through the main entrance. Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly.[140] It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind.
