These interior posts typically carry more structural load than the posts in the exterior walls. This is the same concept of the aisle in church buildings, sometimes called a hall church, where the center aisle is technically called a nave. However a nave is often called an aisle, and three-aisled barns are common in the U.S., Netherlands, and Germany. Aisled buildings are wider than the simpler box framed or cruck framed buildings, and typically have purlins supporting the rafters. In northern Germany this construction is known as variations of a St√§nderhaus."]}}}
