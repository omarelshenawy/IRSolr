This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras,[37] Plato,[38] Galileo,[39] and Newton.","Physics theories use mathematics[40] to obtain order and provide precise formulas, precise or estimated solutions, quantitative results and predictions. Experiment results in physics are numerical measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like computation have made computational physics an active area of research."]}}}
