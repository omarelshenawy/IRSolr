The album received favourable reviews from critics and it debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom, exactly twenty two years after her first number one hit in the United Kingdom.[109] The album's lead single, \"All the Lovers,\" was a success and it became her thirty-third top ten single in the United Kingdom, though subsequent singles from the album, \"Get Outta My Way\", \"Better than Today\", and \"Put Your Hands Up\", failed to reach the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. However, all the singles released from the album have topped the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.[110]"]}}}
