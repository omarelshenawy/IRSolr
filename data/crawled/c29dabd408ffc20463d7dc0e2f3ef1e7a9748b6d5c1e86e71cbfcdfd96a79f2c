Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry.[325] The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed divinity,[326] and predicts that at the Last Judgment, Jesus will deny having ever made such a claim (Quran 5:116).[327] Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.[328]"]}}}
