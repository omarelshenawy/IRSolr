Jackson initially worked with various producers, including The Neptunes,[141] Dr. Dre,[142] Kwamé,[143] and Polow Da Don,[144] but the concept was changed when Jermaine Dupri was selected to manage the project after becoming a division president at Virgin Records. Jackson then recorded with Dupri and Jam and Lewis for several months during the following year. The album's title was a reference to the two decades since the release of her breakthrough album Control, representing the album's \"celebration of the joyful liberation and history-making musical style.\"[145] To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the Today Show and Billboard Awards. Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history.[146] 20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.[11] The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri.[147] Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying \"If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison.\"[147] Following the album's release, a producer who worked on the original 20 Y.O. concept prior to Dupri's involvement stated, \"the finished project we had before Jermaine took everything over is crazy. Ask Jimmy & Terry how they felt when Jermaine came in and changed almost everything.\"[141]"]}}}
