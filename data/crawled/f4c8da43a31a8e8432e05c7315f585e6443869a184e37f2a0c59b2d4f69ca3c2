It is located near the town of Lod, 15Â kilometers southeast of Tel Aviv, and operated by the Israel Airports Authority, a government-owned corporation that manages all public airports and border crossings in the State of Israel. The airport, named after the first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, is the hub of El Al Israel Airlines, Israir Airlines, Arkia Israel Airlines, and Sun D'Or. During the 1980s and 1990s, it was a focus city of the now-defunct Tower Air. Today, Terminal 3 is used for international flights and Terminal 1, for domestic flights. The airport has three runways and is jointly used by commercial, private, and military aircraft. The airport is located on the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv Highway, Highway 1, and can be easily reached by car, public bus, or Israel Railways. Ben Gurion Airport is known as one of the most secure airports in the world. The security force includes IDF and police. Security guards operate both undercover and in uniform, allowing for the detection of a wide range of threats. The airport has been targeted for several terrorist attacks, but no successful hijacking of a plane departing from Ben Gurion has ever taken place."]}}}
