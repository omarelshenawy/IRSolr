While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song \"sucked\". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to \"get in her world\", as Magnet explained, it was easier to \"actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is\". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics.[1] American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, \"I was just getting into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] I hung up and just screamed out joyous sounds.\"[2] During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears \"didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason.\"[3]"]}}}
