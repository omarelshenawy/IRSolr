Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.\"[166]"],"after":["E=MC² debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.[167] With six number one albums, Carey was tied with Britney Spears and Janet Jackson in the United States for the third most number one albums for a female artist, behind Madonna with eight and Barbra Streisand's ten chart toppers.[not in citation given][37] In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked her at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making Carey the second most successful female artist in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[168][not in citation given] That year, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in Tennessee[169] and had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler's film You Don't Mess with the Zohan, playing herself.[170] Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC².[171] However the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.[172] Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage, hence she cancelled the tour.[173][174] On January 20, 2009, Carey performed \"Hero\" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.[175] On July 7, 2009, Carey – alongside Trey Lorenz – performed her version of The Jackson 5 song \"I'll Be There\" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.[176]"]}}}
