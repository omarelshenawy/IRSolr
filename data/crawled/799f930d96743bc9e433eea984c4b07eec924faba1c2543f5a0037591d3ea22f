Ratatoskr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the squirrel. According to Vigfússon, Ratatoskr means \"tusk the traveller\" or \"the climber tusk.\""]}}}
