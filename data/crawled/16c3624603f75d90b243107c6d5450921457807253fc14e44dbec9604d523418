Ruskin’s widely admired lecture, Traffic, on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at Bradford Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.[106] \"I do not care about this Exchange,\" Ruskin told his audience, \"because you don’t!\"[107] These last three lectures were published in The Crown of Wild Olive (1866).[108]"],"after":["The lectures that comprised Sesame and Lilies (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at Rusholme and Manchester, are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. \"Of King's Treasuries\" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. \"Of Queens' Gardens\" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin’s most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a Sunday School prize.[109]"]}}}
