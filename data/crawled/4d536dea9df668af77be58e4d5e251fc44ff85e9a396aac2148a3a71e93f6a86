Most half-timbered houses have been built in regions that before World War II used to belong to Germany or had had a lot of German immigrants. As these regions were parts of Prussia, half-timbered walls are called \"mur pruski\". The Slovincians, an autochthone Slavic group in the Prussian province of Pomorania also built half-timbered houses. A distinctive type of house associated with mostly Mennonite immigrant groups from Frisia and the Netherlands, known as the OlÄ™drzy, is called an arcade house (dom podcieniowy)."]}}}
