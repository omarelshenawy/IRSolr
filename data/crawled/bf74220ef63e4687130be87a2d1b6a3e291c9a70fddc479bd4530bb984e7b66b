At its core was Television, described by critic John Walker as \"the ultimate garage band with pretensions\".[100] Their influences ranged from the Velvet Underground to the staccato guitar work of Dr. Feelgood's Wilko Johnson.[101] The band's bassist/singer, Richard Hell, created a look with cropped, ragged hair, ripped T-shirts, and black leather jackets credited as the basis for punk rock visual style.[102] In April 1974, Patti Smith, a member of the Mercer Arts Center crowd and a friend of Hell's, came to CBGB for the first time to see the band perform.[103] A veteran of independent theater and performance poetry, Smith was developing an intellectual, feminist take on rock 'n' roll. On June 5, she recorded the single \"Hey Joe\"/\"Piss Factory\", featuring Television guitarist Tom Verlaine; released on her own Mer Records label, it heralded the scene's do it yourself (DIY) ethic and has often been cited as the first punk rock record.[104] By August, Smith and Television were gigging together at another downtown New York club, Max's Kansas City.[102]"],"after":["Out in Forest Hills, Queens, several miles from lower Manhattan, the members of a newly formed band adopted a common surname. Drawing on sources ranging from the Stooges to The Beatles and The Beach Boys to Herman's Hermits and 1960s girl groups, the Ramones condensed rock 'n' roll to its primal level: \"'1-2-3-4!' bass-player Dee Dee Ramone shouted at the start of every song, as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm.\"[105] The band played its first gig at CBGB on August 16, 1974, on the same bill as another new act, Angel and the Snake, soon to be renamed Blondie.[106] By the end of the year, the Ramones had performed seventy-four shows, each about seventeen minutes long.[107] \"When I first saw the Ramones\", critic Mary Harron later remembered, \"I couldn't believe people were doing this. The dumb brattiness.\"[108] The Dictators, with a similar \"playing dumb\" concept, were recording their debut album. The Dictators' Go Girl Crazy! came out in March 1975, mixing absurdist originals such as \"Master Race Rock\" and loud, straight-faced covers of cheese pop like Sonny & Cher's \"I Got You Babe\".[109]"]}}}
