Most tribal groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet, hunting native game and fish and collecting native plants and fruit. The general term for native Australian flora and fauna used as a source of food is bush tucker.[331][332] The first settlers introduced British food to the continent, and much of that is now considered typical Australian food; the Sunday roast has become an enduring tradition for many Australians.[333][334] Multicultural immigration transformed Australian cuisine. Following World War II, European migrants, particularly from the Mediterranean, helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture. The influence of Asian cultures has led to Australian variants of their favourite foods, such as the Chinese-inspired dim sim and Chiko Roll.[335] Vegemite, pavlova, lamingtons and meat pies are regarded as iconic Australian foods.[336] Australian wine is produced in 60 distinct production areas totalling about 160,000 hectares, mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country. The wine regions in each of these states produce different wine varieties and styles that take advantage of local climates and soil types. In 1995, an Australian red wine, Penfolds Grange, won the Wine Spectator award for Wine of the Year, the first time a wine from outside France or California achieved this distinction.[337]"]}}}
