Based on the words holy and day, holidays originally represented special religious days. The word has evolved in general usage to mean any special day of rest (as opposed to regular days of rest, such as the weekend). When translated from/to other languages, the meanings of the word \"holiday\" may be conflated with those of \"observance\" and \"celebration\".

Almost all involve traditions of music, dance, art, and/or food, facilitating social engagement and relaxation."]}}}
