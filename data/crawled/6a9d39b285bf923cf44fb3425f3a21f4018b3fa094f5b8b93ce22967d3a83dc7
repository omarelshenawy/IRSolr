The time of proto-globalization was one filled with “mutual influence, hybridization, and cross-cultural entanglement”.[60] Many historians blame this web of national entanglements and agreements as the cause for the intensity and vast involvement during World War I. Between 1750-1880, the expansion of worldwide integration was influenced by the new capacities in production, transportation, and communication.[52] The end of proto-globalization also marked the final phase of \"great domestication\".[55] After the 1650s, the process of regular and intensive agrarian exploitation was complete.[55] Human population began to increase almost exponentially with the end of the great pandemics.[55] At the end of the proto-globalization and the cusp of modern globalization, population began to \"recover in Central and South America,\" where at the beginning of proto-globalization, European-imported illnesses had savagely decreased indigenous populations.[55] The importation of nutritious varieties from Central and South America created a more fertile and resilient population to forge ahead into modern globalization.[55] The greater population pushed individuals in high populated areas to \"spill into less populous forested and grazing lands, and bring them under cultivation\".[55] This development lead to an influx in produce production and exported trade."],"after":["Another development that lead to the shift to modern globalization was the development of a more politicized system.[61] Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava.[62] The settlement of these individuals made it easier for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy.[62] The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of globalization.[62] The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominately in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.[63]"]}}}
