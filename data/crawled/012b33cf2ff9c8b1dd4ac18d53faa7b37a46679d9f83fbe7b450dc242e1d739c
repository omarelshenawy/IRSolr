The real-name policy stems from the position \"that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.\"[313][314] Facebook's real-name system does not allow adopted names or pseudonyms, and in its enforcement has suspended accounts of legitimate users, until the user provides identification indicating the name. Facebook representatives have described these incidents as very rare.[315] A user claimed responsibility via the anonymous Android and iOS app Secret for reporting \"fake names\" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the stage names of drag queens.[316] On October 1, 2014, Chris Cox, Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology: \"In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.\"[317]"],"after":["In April 2011, Facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on Facebook.[318] The company began its push by inviting a select group of British advertising leaders to meet Facebook's top executives at an \"influencers' summit\" in February 2010. Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for True Blood, American Idol, and Top Gear.[319] News and media outlets such as the Washington Post,[320] Financial Times[321] and ABC News[322] have used aggregated Facebook fan data to create various infographics and charts to accompany their articles. In 2012, the beauty pageant Miss Sri Lanka Online was run exclusively using Facebook.[323]"]}}}
