American Samoa became one of three places in the world (others being New Caledonia and Maraj√≥ Island in Brazil) to have prevented any deaths during the pandemic through the quick response from Governor John Martin Poyer after hearing news reports of the outbreak on the radio and requesting quarantine ships from the U.S. mainland. The result of Poyer's quick actions earned him the Navy Cross from the US Navy. With this distinction, American Samoans regarded Poyer as their hero for what he had done to prevent the deadly disease. The neighboring New Zealand territory at the time Western Samoa suffered the most of all Pacific islands with 90% of the population infected, 62% died. Poyer offered assistance to help his New Zealand counterparts, but was refused by the administrator of Western Samoa Robert Logan who became outraged after witnessing the amount of quarantine ships surrounding American Samoa. Angered by this, Logan had cut off communications with his American counterparts."]}}}
