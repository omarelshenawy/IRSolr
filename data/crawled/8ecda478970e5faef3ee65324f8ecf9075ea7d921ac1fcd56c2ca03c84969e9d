Pinafore, the whispered plans for elopement in \"This very night\" parody the conspirators' choruses in Verdi's Il trovatore and Rigoletto,[247] and the octet, \"Farewell, my own,\" evokes the ensemble \"Mag der Himmel euch vergeben\" in Flotow's Martha and such concerted numbers as the sextet in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.[247] The mock-jingoistic \"He is an Englishman\" in H.M.S. Pinafore and choral passages in The Zoo satirise patriotic British tunes such as Arne's \"Rule, Britannia!\".[247] The chorus \"With catlike tread\" from Pirates is an imitation of Verdi's \"Anvil Chorus\" from Il trovatore.[249]"]}}}
