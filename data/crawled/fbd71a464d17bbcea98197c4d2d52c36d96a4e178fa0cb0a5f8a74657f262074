BGSU first announced plans for the Stroh Center, a 5,000-seat arena to replace the aging Anderson Arena.[49] The $36 million arena opened in September 2011, hosting basketball and volleyball; in addition to graduation ceremonies, concerts and other events.[49] The arena was named for Kermit Stroh and Mary Lu Stroh, who donated $7.7 million for the project, the largest single private gift in BGSU's history.[49] In 2009 the university began construction on the Wolfe Center for the Arts.[50] The 93,000-square-foot (8,600 m2) facility opened in 2011 with performance space, as well as work and classroom areas for art studies of the School of Art, the Department of Theatre and Film, and the School of Musical Arts.[51] The facility was designed by Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta, the firm's first American project.[50] That same year, BGSU built a $40 million residence hall project that included two new residence halls,[52] one a traditional-style dorm and a second suite-style for upperclassmen.[52] The residence hall project added more than 800 beds.[53] In the fall of 2011, BGSU opened The Oaks dining hall.[54][55] The Oaks was constructed with sustainable designs that included a hybrid solar and wind power system to fulfill Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an electric-powered truck to distribute food on campus, and a rooftop garden. The building used sustainable and recycled construction materials.[56]"]}}}
