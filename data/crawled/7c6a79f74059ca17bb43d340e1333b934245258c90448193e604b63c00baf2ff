The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU,[149] and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union.[61] Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.[157]"]}}}
