Therefore it is customarily replaced by a modified form of the function (s, in this case), such as or S, and functional notation often replaces subscripting:"],"after":["In engineering, particularly when the variable x represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a frequency domain representation. Square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies."]}}}
