Particularly important in this regard were the Gilan and Mazandaran provinces, which produced Persia's single most important export, silk. With the substantial new revenue, Abbas was able to build up a central, standing army, loyal only to him. This freed him of his dependence on Qizilbash warriors loyal to local tribal chiefs.[122]"],"after":["What effectively fully severed Abbas's dependence on the Qizilbash, however, was how he constituted this new army. In order not to favor favor one Turkic tribe over another and to avoid inflaming the Turkmen-Tajik enmity, he recruited his army from the \"third force\", a policy that had been implemented in its baby-steps since the reign of Tahmasp I—the Circassian, Georgian and to a lesser extent Armenian ghulāms (غلام) (slaves) which (after conversion to Islam) were trained for the military or some branch of the civil administration. The standing army created by Abbas consisted of: (1) 10,000-15,000 cavalry ghulãm regiments, armed with muskets in addition to the usual weapons; (2) a corps of musketeers, tufangchiyān (تفگنچى), mainly Iranians, originally foot soldiers but eventually mounted, and (3) a corps of artillerymen, tūpchiyān (توپچى). Both corps of musketeers and artillerymen totaled 12,000 men. In addition the shah's personal bodyguard, made up exclusively from ghulāms, was increased to 3,000.[123] This force of well-trained Caucasian ghulams under Abbas amounted to a total of near 40,000 soldiers paid for and beholden to the Shah.[124][125][126]"]}}}
