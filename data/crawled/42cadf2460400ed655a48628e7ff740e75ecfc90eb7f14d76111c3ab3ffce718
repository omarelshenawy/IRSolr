During the song, aeroplanes are shown dropping bombs shaped like Latin crosses, hammer and sickles, dollar signs, star and crescents, Stars of David, the Shell logo, and the Mercedes-Benz logo, with the addition of the McDonald's logo in later shows. The plane dropping dollar signs appeared directly after the plane dropping the Star of David. Although Waters said in Rolling Stone that there was no relevance to the order of the bombs, he changed the order after Abraham Foxman, president of the Anti-Defamation League, complained.[27] Waters stated, \"Contrary to Mr Foxman's assertion, there are no hidden meanings in the order or juxtaposition of these symbols.\"[28] These visuals were changed at Waters' request for all future shows, to avoid any sensitive juxtapositions of the symbols used in the video. At the first show of the tour, while these symbols dropped from the plane they also dropped from the ceiling of the Air Canada Centre in little cut-out shapes of confetti that looked like the symbols from the plane. During the song \"Don't Leave Me Now\" the production features a giant wife puppet similar in design and execution as the Schoolmaster. During the first half on the show, The Wall is slowly built up brick by brick and as with the eighties tour, an instrumental called \"The Last Few Bricks\" that doesn't appear on the original album is played to give the stage hands extra time to build the wall. At the end of \"Goodbye Cruel World\", the last brick is put in place and the wall is completed across the stage. An intermission follows with photos and short bios of people lost in conflicts are projected on the wall."],"after":["The second act begins with \"Hey You\" and is played with minimal visuals on the wall. The band performs, now hidden from the audience's view, from behind the wall. For the acoustic guitar solo piece \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" a brick is removed so that guitarists Dave Kilminster and G.E. Smith are visible. As \"Nobody Home\" begins, a section folds out of the wall revealing a small mock hotel room complete with a television, chair, lamp and unmade bed. Waters, in character as \"Pink\", sings the song while seated on a comfy chair that is on a platform extending from the wall. During \"Vera\" images of Vera Lynn are displayed on the wall, along with videos of young children being reunited with their veteran fathers. \"Bring the Boys Back Home\" features Dwight D. Eisenhower's American Society of Newspaper Editors speech. During \"Comfortably Numb\", Robbie Wyckoff and Dave Kilminster stand on top of the wall as David Gilmour did in the original tour â€“ a performance reprised by Gilmour himself during a one-off appearance at the London O2 show on 12 May 2011. At the end of the song, the projection of the wall explodes and cinematic pillars rise."]}}}
