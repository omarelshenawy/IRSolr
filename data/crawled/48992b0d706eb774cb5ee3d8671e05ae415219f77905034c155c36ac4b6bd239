It is by most historical linguists considered to be an East Danish dialect group,[3] but due to the modern era influence from Standard Swedish in the region and because traditional dialectology in the Scandinavian countries normally have not considered isoglosses that cut across state borders,[4] the Scanian dialects have normally been treated as a South Swedish dialect group in Swedish dialect research. However, many of the early Scandinavian linguists, including Adolf Noreen[5] and G. Sjöstedt,[6] classified it as \"South-Scandinavian\", and some linguists, such as Elias Wessén, also considered Old Scanian a separate language, classified apart from both Old Danish and Old Swedish.[7]"]}}}
