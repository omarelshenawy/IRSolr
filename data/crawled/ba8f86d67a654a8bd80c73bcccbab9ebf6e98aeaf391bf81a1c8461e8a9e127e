Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game, although the Harvardâ€“Yale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[116]"]}}}
