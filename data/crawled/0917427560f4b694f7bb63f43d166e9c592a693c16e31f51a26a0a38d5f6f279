The team remained in existence for over 48 years from 1917 to 1965 playing 828 games, winning 758, drawing 46, and losing 24. During its early years, matches attracted anywhere from 4,000 to over 50,000 spectators per match. In 1920, Dick, Kerr's Ladies defeated a French side 2-0 in front of 25,000 people that went down in history as the first women's international football (soccer) game. The team faced strong opposition by England's Football Association (FA) who banned the women from using fields and stadiums controlled by FA-affiliated clubs for 50 years (the rule was finally repealed in 1971)."]}}}
