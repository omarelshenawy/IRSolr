Daily maximum temperatures usually range between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F). The average annual rainfall increases from east to west, and it ranges from 700 to 1600 annual millimetres (27.6–63 in) on average, reaching 6,300 millimetres (250 in) on Mount Pico,[31] the highest Portuguese mountain at 2,351 m (7,713 ft). The Azores high, an area of high atmospheric pressure, is named after the islands. Under the Köppen climate classification, the local climate is \"dry-summer subtropical\", often referred to as \"Mediterranean\". The Köppen subtype for this climate is \"Csb\".[32]"]}}}
