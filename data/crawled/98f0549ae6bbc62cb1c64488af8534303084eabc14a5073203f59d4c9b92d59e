The West Pennine Moors and several coalfields (mainly sandstones and shales) lie in the northwest and west respectively, and the Cheshire Plain fringes the south.[14] The rivers Mersey, Irwell and Tame run through Greater Manchester, all of which rise in the Pennines.[14] Other rivers traverse the region as tributaries to the major rivers, including the Douglas, the Irk, and the Roch.[14] Black Chew Head is the highest point in Greater Manchester which forms part of the Peak District National Park, rising 1,778 feet (542 m) above sea-level, within the parish of Saddleworth.[78]"]}}}
