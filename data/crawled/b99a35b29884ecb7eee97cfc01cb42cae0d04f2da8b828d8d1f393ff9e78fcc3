For example, COBOL is still strong in corporate data centers[17] often on large mainframes, FORTRAN in engineering applications, scripting languages in Web development, and C in embedded applications. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use. New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a previous language with new functionality added, (for example C++ adds object-orientedness to C, and Java adds memory management and bytecode to C++, but as a consequence looses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation)."],"after":["Debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a static code analysis tool can help detect some possible problems."]}}}
