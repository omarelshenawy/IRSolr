Guests on Release the Stars include Richard Thompson, longtime friend and fellow singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson, family members Martha Wainwright and Kate McGarrigle, Neil Tennant, Joan Wasser, and actress Si√¢n Phillips.[1] The world tour supporting the album lasted from May 2007 to February 2008, and included tour stops in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. For Release the Stars, Wainwright received two nominations for the Juno Awards of 2008, including Adult Alternative Album of the Year and Songwriter of the Year, and won the Outstanding Music Artist award at the 19th GLAAD Media Awards."]}}}
