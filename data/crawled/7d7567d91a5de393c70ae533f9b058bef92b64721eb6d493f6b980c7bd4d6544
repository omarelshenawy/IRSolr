His mother was of Alsatian origin, and was the grand niece of German Nobel prize laureate Albert Schweitzer.[4] When Sartre was 15 months old, his father died of a fever. Anne-Marie raised him with help from her father, Charles Schweitzer, a high school professor of German, who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to classical literature at a very early age.[5]"]}}}
