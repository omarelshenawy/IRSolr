In some tribes such as the Agta, Philippines, stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age.[119] Upon puberty, the young male is then paired off with a \"wise elder\" or \"witch doctor\" who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children. In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size."],"after":["Masturbation marathons are global events that provide a supportive, encouraging environment where masturbation can be performed openly among young and old without embarrassment. Participants may speak openly with onlookers while masturbating to share techniques and describe the pleasure and benefits.[120] Masturbate-a-thons are often charity events that are \"intended to encourage people to explore safer sex, talk about masturbation and lift the taboos that still surround the subject.\" May is considered \"Masturbation Month\" by sex-positive organizations and activists, including Betty Dodson, Joani Blank, Susan Block, and Carol Queen."]}}}
