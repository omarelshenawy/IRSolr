However, this legacy is a popular misconception. To the contrary, the globular shape of the earth had been known to scholars since antiquity, and was common knowledge among sailors. Coincidentally, the oldest surviving globe of the earth, the Erdapfel, was made in 1492 just before Columbus' return to Europe. As such it contains no sign of the Americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical Earth."],"after":[]}}}
