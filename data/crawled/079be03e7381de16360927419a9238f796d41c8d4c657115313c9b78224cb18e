Cluny Abbey, founded in the MÃ¢con region of France in 909, was established as part of the Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear.[247] Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.[248]"]}}}
