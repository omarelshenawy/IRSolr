These are not permutations except in special cases, but are natural generalizations of the ordered arrangement concept. Indeed, this use often involves considering arrangements of a fixed lengthÂ k of elements taken from a given set of size n, in other words, these k-permutations of n are the different ordered arrangements of a k-element subset of an n-set (sometimes called variations in the older literature.[13]) These objects are also known as partial permutations or as sequences without repetition, terms that avoid confusion with the other, more common, meaning of \"permutation\". The number of such -permutations of is denoted variously by such symbols as , , , , or , and its value is given by the product[14]"],"after":["which is 0 when k > n, and otherwise is equal to"]}}}
