The country produced heavy-grade oil from fields located in the northeast since the late 1960s. In the early 1980s, light-grade, low-sulphur oil was discovered near Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria. Syria's rate of oil production has decreased dramatically from a peak close to 600,000 barrels per day (95,000 m3/d) (bpd) in 1995 down to less than 140,000 bbl/d (22,000 m3/d) in 2012.[148] Prior to the uprising, more than 90% of Syrian oil exports were to EU countries, with the remainder going to Turkey.[147] Oil and gas revenues constituted around 20% of total GDP and 25% of total government revenue.[147] In the third year of the Syrian Civil War, the deputy economy minister Salman Hayan stated that Syria's two main oil refineries were operating at less than 10% capacity.[149]"],"after":[]}}}
