And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve.\"[2] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she had, in her own words, \"been distracted by having children and filming movies\". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.[3][4]"]}}}
