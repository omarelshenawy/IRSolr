He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it to create a new groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks.[17] Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing.[8] They had an instrumental breakdown in \"American Life\", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. \"Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like'. So I went and it was just total improv [sic] and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous,\" she added.[8]"],"after":["For \"Hollywood\", he used a drum kit and percussion from an E-mu Emulator and also added extra drum sounds to give the song an old, disco vibe.[17] Wanting to have a loud bass synth sound,, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer with lot of filtering manipulations. But he faced problems with it, so he used a Yamaha O2R mixer.[17] He did not want \"Hollywood\" to sound like the music being played at the nightclubs, so he recorded Madonna's vocals with heavy compression in her headphones.[17] Two machines were used for the vocal editing in \"Hollywood\". Madonna preferred the Antares Auto-Tune plug in, while Ahmadzaï chose an AMS pitch shifter.[17] Madonna wanted Auto-Tune because she wanted \"Hollywood\" to have a more dance-like feel to it, although Ahmadzaï was against it.[17] The track \"I'm So Stupid\" had gentle vocals, then the singing was frozen using a Roland VP-9000. When Madonna sings \"Aaaaaahhhhhh\", the vocals freeze and the process sounds natural, but in reality is not.[17] When it came to adding the beats, he experimented by programming the drums in Logic Pro and changing the timing of the beats. The producer combines different samples of songs from his own collections and keeps on trying until something new is developed.[17] The mixing for the tracks was done by Mark \"Spike\" Stent at the Westlake Recording Studios at West Hollywood, California, while Tim Young did the mastering of the songs at Metropolis Studios in London.[15] Michael Colombier did the string arrangement with Geoff Foster acting as the strings engineer, conducting at AIR Studios.[15]"]}}}
