His Morse code dispatch was printed by the Daily Express newspaper in London on September 5, 1945, entitled \"The Atomic Plague\", the first public report to mention the effects of radiation and nuclear fallout.[227] Burchett's reporting was unpopular with the U.S. military. The U.S. censors suppressed a supporting story submitted by George Weller of the Chicago Daily News, and accused Burchett of being under the sway of Japanese propaganda. Laurence dismissed the reports on radiation sickness as Japanese efforts to undermine American morale, ignoring his own account of Hiroshima's radiation sickness published one week earlier.[228]"],"after":["A member of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, Lieutenant Daniel McGovern, used a film crew to document the results in early 1946.[229] The film crew's work resulted in a three-hour documentary entitled The Effects of the Atomic Bombs Against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The documentary included images from hospitals showing the human effects of the bomb; it showed burned out buildings and cars, and rows of skulls and bones on the ground. It was classified \"secret\" for the next 22 years.[230] During this time in America, it was a common practice for editors to keep graphic images of death out of films, magazines, and newspapers.[231] The total of 90,000 ft (27,000 m) of film shot by McGovern's cameramen had not been fully aired as of 2009. According to Greg Mitchell, with the 2004 documentary film Original Child Bomb, a small part of that footage managed to reach part of the American public \"in the unflinching and powerful form its creators intended\".[229]"]}}}
