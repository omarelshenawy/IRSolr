Since the 1970s, \"Dreaming\" and \"Dream time\" has also returned from academic usage via popular culture and tourism, and is now ubiquitous in the English vocabulary of indigenous Australians in a kind of \"self-fulfilling academic prophecy\".[3]"],"after":["The term \"Dreaming\" is directly based on the term Altjira (Alchera), the name of a spirit or entity in the mythology of the Aranda. Related entities are known as Mura-mura by the Dieri, and as Tjukurpa in Pitjantjatjara."]}}}
