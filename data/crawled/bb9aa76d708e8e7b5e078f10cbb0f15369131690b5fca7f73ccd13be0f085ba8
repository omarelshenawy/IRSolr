Two notable DRM critics are John Walker, as expressed for instance, in his article \"The Digital Imprimatur: How Big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle\",[85] and Richard Stallman in his article The Right to Read[86] and in other public statements: \"DRM is an example of a malicious feature â€“ a feature designed to hurt the user of the software, and therefore, it's something for which there can never be toleration\".[87] Stallman also believes that using the word \"rights\" is misleading and suggests that the word \"restrictions\", as in \"Digital Restrictions Management\", is used instead.[88][89][90][91][92] Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge University heads a British organization which opposes DRM and similar efforts in the UK and elsewhere. Cory Doctorow, a prominent writer and technology blogger, spoke on the Microsoft campus criticizing the technology, the morality, and the marketing of DRM.[93]"]}}}
