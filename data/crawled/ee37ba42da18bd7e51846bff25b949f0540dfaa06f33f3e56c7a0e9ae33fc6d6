The building faces Catherine Street (earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street) and backs onto Drury Lane. The building standing today is the most recent in a line of four theatres at the same location dating back to 1663, making it the oldest London theatre.[1] For its first two centuries, Drury Lane could \"reasonably have claimed to be London's leading theatre\"[2] and thus one of the most important theatres in the English-speaking world. Through most of that time, it was one of a small handful of patent theatres that were granted monopoly rights to the production of \"legitimate\" (meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music)[3] drama in London."]}}}
