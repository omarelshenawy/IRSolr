Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, despite the common opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built.[8] He took a correspondence course in civil engineering, and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938.[9] After five years of work, the first section of the road, from Fort Bay to The Bottom, was completed. It was not until 1947 however, that the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951, the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened, and in 1958, the road was completed. Driving \"The Road\" is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side.
