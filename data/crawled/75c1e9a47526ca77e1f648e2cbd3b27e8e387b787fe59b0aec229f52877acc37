The tour visits the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album, I Am… Sasha Fierce. The tour dates for the European leg were released in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles stated: \"I've been working on this tour for eight months [...] I've been rehearsing and trying to make sure I put my set list together. Right now I'm anxious and I can't sleep -- I'll be wanting to be at rehearsal. That's the only thing I can think about. But I can't wait.\" The tour kicked off in late-March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. The tour officially commenced in late April 2009, at Arena Zagreb in Croatia. Due to the phenomenal demand, Sony Music announced Knowles will add additional dates in England, Asia and South America. In 2009, the tour was nominated for \"Eventful Fans' Choice Award\" at the 6th Annual Billboard Touring Awards."]}}}
