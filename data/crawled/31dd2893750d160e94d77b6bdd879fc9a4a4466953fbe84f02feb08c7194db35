Moshoeshoe died on 11 March 1870, marking the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the colonial era, and was buried at Thaba Bosiu. During their rule between 1871 and 1884, Basutoland was treated similarly to territories that had been forcefully annexed, much to the chagrin of the Basotho.[7] This led to the Gun War in 1881.[8] In 1884, Basutoland was restored its status as a protectorate, with Maseru again its capital, but remained under direct rule by a governor, though effective internal power was wielded by traditional chiefs."],"after":["Basutoland gained its independence from Britain and became the Kingdom of Lesotho in 1966.[9]"]}}}
