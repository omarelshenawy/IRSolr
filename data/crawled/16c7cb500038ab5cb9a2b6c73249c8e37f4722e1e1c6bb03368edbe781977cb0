When Madonna appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman on March 31, 1994 to promote the single, her coarse language and behavior—which was provocative, seemingly random at times, full of double entendres (at one point asking Letterman to sniff her panties), profanities, and ended with a refusal to leave the set—caused yet another large public controversy.[3] Following this, Madonna decided to tone down her image and move her career into a new direction. Musically, she explored new-jack R&B styles with a generally mainstream, radio-friendly sound.[4] This new R&B sound was reflected in Bedtime Stories, released in October, 1994.[4] For \"Take a Bow\", the second single released off of the album, Madonna wanted a more \"romantic vein\" so she worked with Babyface on the track because he had proved himself to be very successful in his previous works with smooth R&B, working with other artists such as Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton.[5] Although not listed in the credits as a performer, Babyface sings background vocals on the track.[6] The maxi-single release of \"Take a Bow\" includes two remixes of the song.[7] According to Jose F. Promis of Allmusic, the first remix, known as the \"In Da Soul\" mix, gives the ballad a funkier, more urban feel while the second remix, known as the \"Silky Soul Mix\", is a little more \"quiet storm\" and \"melancholy\" than the first.[7]"]}}}
