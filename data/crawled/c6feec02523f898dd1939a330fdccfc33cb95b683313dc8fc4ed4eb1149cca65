It is a broader term than \"art\", which as a description of a field usually means only the visual arts. The arts encompass the visual arts, the literary arts and the performing arts â€“ music, theatre, dance and film, among others. This list is by no means comprehensive, but only meant to introduce the concept of the arts. For all intents and purposes, the history of the arts begins with the history of art. The arts might have origins in early human evolutionary prehistory."]}}}
