Pairs lifts differ from dance lifts most notably in that dancers are not allowed to lift their partners above their shoulders. In pair skating, the lifting partner must be the man and the lifted parter must be the woman. In ice dancing, the lifting partner is usually the man and the lifted partner is usually the woman. However, the rules allow for the woman to lift the man in competition. Such lifts are commonly known as \"reverse lifts\" or \"genderbending lifts\"."]}}}
