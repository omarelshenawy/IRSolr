He wanted to establish his control over both the Norman warlords and the Irish. Henry apparently feared that Strongbow would set up an independent kingdom in Ireland, but Strongbow's actions were merely a catalyst for Henry's invasion.[5] Historian Peter Crooks writes that, \"No less than his predecessors, Henry II was happy to add Ireland to his empire\".[27] Henry, as William of Newburgh put it, wanted to have \"the glory of such a famous conquest\" and its proceeds for himself.[5]"]}}}
