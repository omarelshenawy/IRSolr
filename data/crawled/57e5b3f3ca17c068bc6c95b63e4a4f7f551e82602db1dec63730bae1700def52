It is intuitively clear how to translate such formulas into mathematical meaning. In the σsmr-structure of the natural numbers, for example, an element n satisfies the formula φ if and only if n is a prime number. The formula ψ similarly defines irreducibility. Tarski gave a rigorous definition, sometimes called \"Tarski's definition of truth\", for the satisfaction relation , so that one easily proves:"],"after":["A set T of sentences is called a (first-order) theory. A theory is satisfiable if it has a model , i.e. a structure (of the appropriate signature) which satisfies all the sentences in the set T. Consistency of a theory is usually defined in a syntactical way, but in first-order logic by the completeness theorem there is no need to distinguish between satisfiability and consistency. Therefore model theorists often use \"consistent\" as a synonym for \"satisfiable\"."]}}}
