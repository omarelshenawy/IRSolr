Like most Canadian dialects and innovative General American, /ɑ/ allophones remain back and may be either rounded or unrounded due to a merger between /ɒ/ and /ɔː/ (commonly represented in conservative General American, respectively, as [ɑ] ( listen) and [ɒ] ( listen)), so that words like cot and caught are perfect homophones (except in San Francisco). In the West, there is less Canadian raising of the /aʊ/ diphthong than in Canada, but, like Canadian, northern General American, and New England English, widespread raising of the /aɪ/ diphthong. A minority of Western speakers have the pin–pen merger, commonly recognized in the U.S. as a Southern characteristic."]}}}
