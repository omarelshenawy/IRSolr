Donaldson and James Hennegan.[1][2] Originally titled Billboard Advertising it was a trade paper for the bill posting industry, hence the magazine's name.[1] Within a few years of its founding, it began to carry news of outdoor amusements, a major consumer of billboard space. Eventually, Billboard became the paper of record for circuses, carnivals, amusement parks, fairs, vaudeville, minstrels, whale shows[3] and other live entertainment. The magazine began coverage of motion pictures in 1909 and of radio in the 1920s. The first music connections were the Billboard sheet music best sellers and top songs in vaudeville theaters charts, published in 1913, but they were not yet regular charts.[4]"],"after":["With the development of the jukebox industry during the 1930s, The Billboard began publishing music charts. Originally, there were only three genre-specific charts: Pop, Rhythm & Blues, and Country & Western. In the 1950s, it introduced a section covering the television industry, including ratings charts for programs. It continued to carry news of fairs, carnivals, theme parks, and other outdoor entertainments until 1961 when these departments were spun off into a new weekly magazine called Amusement Business. By this time, the television coverage had also been moved to a separate publication."]}}}
