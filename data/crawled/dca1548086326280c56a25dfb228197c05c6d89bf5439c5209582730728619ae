The areas to the north and northeast of the city grew rapidly without urban planning, resulting in the regions of Karachi today comprising Lyari Town. To the north of the colonial center grew fashionable neighborhoods for Karachi's wealthy natives in places such as Garden. The British also developed the neighborhoods of Clifton and Bath Island around this time as wealthy sea-side suburbs. Wealthy natives bestowed the city with some of its finest architecture after 1900. Examples of this include the Karachi Gymkhana, the Hindu Gymkhana, and the Mohatta Palace. Public works were also commissioned by natives, one such example being the Jehangir Kothari Parade - built in 1921 by a wealthy Zoroastrian (Parsi) Karachiite."],"after":["On the Eve of the independence, the town was clearly delineated between three portions. The first was the \"Native Town\" centered on Mithadar, Kharadar, Manora Island, and Lyari town where much of the local population lived in cramped quarters. The second area was almost exclusively for European residents, and was centered on Saddar, the Cantonment, and Clifton. The third area was for wealthy and educated natives who were centered in the Garden districts north of the city. Karachi's grand civic monuments were located primarily in the Native Town and in the European quarters, while the commercial heart of the city was centered on Saddar and the Bandar Road."]}}}
