A faithful effort has been made in the World Book to avoid this common defect.\" Since the encyclopedia first appeared in print, it has grown from 8 volumes to 22 volumes, from a set with limited color plates to one with color throughout. Over the years, the World Book has been characterized by its design. Unlike most other encyclopedias, it is traditionally published in variously sized volumes, depending on the letter of the alphabet. Although most volumes cover exactly one letter completely, the letters with exceptionally numerous entries (\"C\" and \"S\") are divided between two volumes, while adjacent letters with relatively few entries (\"J\"–\"K\", \"N\"–\"O\", \"Q\"–\"R\", \"U\"–\"V\", and \"W\"–\"Z\") share a volume. World Book editors lay out major articles distinctly, often starting them on a page of their own, perhaps with a two-column heading. Materials are reviewed and authored by experts. It recognizes that one of the primary uses of general-purpose encyclopedias is students' work on school reports. For instance, every article for a U.S. state has a box giving information about such things as the official state bird and tree and each President of the United States gets a very distinctive look with an oversized portrait, a timeline and significant historial events that occurred during that president's administration."]}}}
