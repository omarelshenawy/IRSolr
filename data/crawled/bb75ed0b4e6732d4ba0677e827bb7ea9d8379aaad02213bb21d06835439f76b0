Saba refers to the Biblical queen of Sheba.[citation needed] Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493, but he did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba; they stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued. However, there has been some evidence found indicating that Carib or Arawak Indians may have been on the island."]}}}
