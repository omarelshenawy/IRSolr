Edwin Hawkins Singers' \"Oh Happy Day\", Robin Gibb's \"Saved by the Bell\", Bee Gees' \"Don't Forget to Remember\", and The Tremeloes' \"(Call Me) Number One\" all peaked at number two in both charts, Herman's Hermits' \"My Sentimental Friend\" and Don Fardon's \"Indian Reservation\" placed with one number two and one number three in each chart, and Stevie Wonder's \"My Cherie Amour\" reached fourth and third spot in the two charts.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]"],"after":[]}}}
