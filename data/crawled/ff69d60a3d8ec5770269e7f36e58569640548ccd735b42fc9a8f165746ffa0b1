It shares a border with every South American country except for Ecuador and Chile. It also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.[13] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[141] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes 6째N and 34째S, and longitudes 28째 and 74째W."]}}}
