Inland Northern /æ/ comes to be articulated so that the tongue starts from a position that is higher and fronter than it used to be, and then often glides back toward the center of the mouth, thus producing a centering diphthong of the type [ɛə] or [eə] or at its most extreme [ɪə], which is the vowel heard in England in words like pier and beer.[citation needed] Thus cat and that as pronounced by a Rochesterian may sound like \"kyet\" and \"thyet\" to a visitor."]}}}
