These latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway[29] from polymerisation of flavan-4-ols[30] by the expression of maize pericarp color1 (p1) gene[31] which encodes an R2R3 myb-like transcriptional activator[32] of the A1 gene encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols)[33] while another gene (Suppressor of Pericarp Pigmentation 1 or SPP1) acts as a suppressor.[34] The p1 gene encodes an Myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments, while the P1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs, and unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1) modifies P1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp, as well as vegetative tissues, which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments.[31] The maize P gene encodes a Myb homolog that recognizes the sequence CCT/AACC, in sharp contrast with the C/TAACGG bound by vertebrate Myb proteins.[35]"]}}}
