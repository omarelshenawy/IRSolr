Though most survived only briefly, perhaps recording a small-label single or two, others set off new trends. Crass, from Essex, merged a vehement, straight-ahead punk rock style with a committed anarchist mission, and played a major role in the emerging anarcho-punk movement.[215] Sham 69, London's Menace, and the Angelic Upstarts from South Shields in the Northeast combined a similarly stripped-down sound with populist lyrics, a style that became known as street punk. These expressly working-class bands contrasted with others in the second wave that presaged the post-punk phenomenon. Liverpool's first punk group, Big in Japan, moved in a glam, theatrical direction.[216] The band didn't survive long, but it spun off several well-known post-punk acts.[217] The songs of London's Wire were characterized by sophisticated lyrics, minimalist arrangements, and extreme brevity.[218] By the end of 1977, according to music historian Clinton Heylin, they were \"England's arch-exponents of New Musick, and the true heralds of what came next.\"[219]"],"after":["Alongside thirteen original songs that would define classic punk rock, The Clash's debut had included a cover of the recent Jamaican reggae hit \"Police and Thieves\".[221] Other first wave bands such as The Slits and new entrants to the scene like The Ruts and The Police interacted with the reggae and ska subcultures, incorporating their rhythms and production styles. The punk rock phenomenon helped spark a full-fledged ska revival movement known as 2 Tone, centered on bands such as The Specials, The Beat, Madness, and The Selecter.[222]"]}}}
