In 1997, Latin America's largest miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) was privatized. These and other developments such as the Philippines 1995 Mining Act led the bank to publish a third report (Assistance for Minerals Sector Development and Reform in Member Countries) which endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments and attention to the concerns of the local population. The codes based on this report are influential in the legislation of developing nations. The new codes are intended to encourage development through tax holidays, zero custom duties, reduced income taxes, and related measures.[32]:22 The results of these codes were analyzed by a group from the University of Quebec, which concluded that the codes promote foreign investment but \"fall very short of permitting sustainable development\".[58] The observed negative correlation between natural resources and economic development is known as the resource curse."],"after":[]}}}
