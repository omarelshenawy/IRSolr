In 2006, estimated visitor expenditure reached $1.6 million making tourism a major export industry for Niue. Niue will continue to receive direct support from the government and overseas donor agencies. The only airport is Niue International Airport. Air New Zealand is the sole airline, flying twice a week from Auckland.[45] Hanan International Airport was served by a local airline in the early 1990s, Niue Airlines, however it closed in 1992.
