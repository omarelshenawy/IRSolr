As the ship was \"widely advertised as the fastest and most powerful warship then afloat,\"[19] the United States and United Kingdom felt her presence might give German companies an advantage in potential armament contracts, so they sent ships of their own. The United States sent the new battleship Delaware on a ten-week excursion to Brazil and Chile, carrying the body of the recently deceased Chilean minister to the United States; the British responded with an armored cruiser squadron. Delaware‍ '​s captain was ordered to give the Chileans full access to the vessel—the only exception being that he should not give full particulars of the new fire-control system[20]—in an attempt by the Navy Department \"to aid the shipbuilding interests of the country [United States] to make contracts for the building of men-of-war for foreign countries.\"[21] As a further incentive the U.S. indicated its willingness to provide a $25 million loan to support the purchase of the ship.[22]"],"after":["In the event, the efforts made by the United States came to little. The final decision came down to a choice between the American and British tenders,[23] and with a loan from the Rothchilds, Chile awarded one battleship contract to the latter's Armstrong Whitworth on 25 July 1911.[22] The design was drawn up by J.R. Perret, who had also designed Brazil's Rio de Janeiro.[24][D] The United States still hoped that Chile would order American 14-inch/50 caliber guns for the battleship's main battery armament, but orders came only for coastal artillery. The second dreadnought was awarded to Armstrong in June 1912.[27] Six Almirante Lynch-class destroyers were ordered in 1911 from J. Samuel White to accompany the new dreadnoughts.[28] Before construction began, the Almirante Latorre design was enlarged to mount sixteen 6-inch (152 mm) rather than twenty-two 4.7-inch (119 mm) guns. This increased the displacement by 600 long tons (610 t), to 28,000 long tons (28,449 t), the draft by 6.5 inches (170 mm), to 33 feet (10 m), and made the ship a quarter-knot slower, to 22.75 knots.[29]"]}}}
