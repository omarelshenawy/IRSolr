The parish church (Maltese: \"il-parroċċa\", or \"il-knisja parrokkjali\") is the architectural and geographic focal point of every Maltese town and village, and its main source of civic pride. This civic pride manifests itself in spectacular fashion during the local village festas, which mark the day of the patron saint of each parish with marching bands, religious processions, special Masses, fireworks (especially petards), and other festivities."],"after":["Malta is an Apostolic See; the Acts of the Apostles tells of how St. Paul, on his way from Jerusalem to Rome to face trial, was shipwrecked on the island of \"Melite\", which many Bible scholars identify with Malta, an episode dated around AD 60.[17] As recorded in The Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul spent three months on the island on his way to Rome, curing the sick including the father of Publius, the \"chief man of the island\". Various traditions are associated with this account. The shipwreck is said to have occurred in the place today known as St Paul's Bay. The Maltese saint, Saint Publius is said to have been made Malta's first bishop and a grotto in Rabat, now known as \"St Paul's Grotto\" (and in the vicinity of which evidence of Christian burials and rituals from the 3rd century AD has been found), is among the earliest known places of Christian worship on the island."]}}}
