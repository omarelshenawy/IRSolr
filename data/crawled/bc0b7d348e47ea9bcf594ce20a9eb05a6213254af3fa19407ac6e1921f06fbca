The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for the group; the shift was one of their most dramatic since The Unforgettable Fire.[79] Sonically, the record incorporated influences from alternative rock, dance, and industrial music of the time, and the band referred to its musical departure as \"four men chopping down the Joshua Tree\".[80] Thematically, it was a more introspective and personal record; it was darker, yet at times more flippant than the band's previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band's most successful albums. It produced five hit singles, including \"The Fly\", \"Mysterious Ways\", and \"One\", and it was a crucial part of the band's early 1990s reinvention.[81] Like The Joshua Tree, many publications have cited the record as one of rock's greatest.[66]"],"after":["Like Achtung Baby, the 1992â€“1993 Zoo TV Tour was an unequivocal break with the band's past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping by attempting to instill \"sensory overload\" in its audience.[80][82][83] The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases.[84] Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, the group's Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating;[80] on stage, Bono performed as several over-the-top characters, including \"The Fly\",[85] \"Mirror Ball Man\", and \"MacPhisto\".[86] Prank phone calls were made to President Bush, the United Nations, and others. Live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo caused controversy.[87]"]}}}
