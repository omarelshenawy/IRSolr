Most of them spoke Rhine Franconian, especially Palatinan and to a lesser degree Alemannic dialects, and in the first generations after the settlers arrived it is believed that these dialects merged.[citation needed] The result of that dialect levelling was a dialect very close to the eastern dialects of Palatinian, especially the rural dialects around Mannheim/Ludwigshafen."]}}}
