However, historian Stephen H. West asserts that the Northern Song era capital Kaifeng was the first real center where the performing arts became \"an industry, a conglomerate involving theatre, gambling, prostitution, and food.\"[30] The rise in consumption by merchants and scholar-officials, he states, \"accelerated the growth of both the performance and the food industries,\" asserting a direct link between the two due to their close proximity within the cities.[31] Of the fifty some theatres located in the 'pleasure districts' of Kaifeng, four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon.[32] The chief crowd that gathered was composed of those from the merchant class, while government officials only went to restaurants and attended theatre performances during holidays.[33]"]}}}
