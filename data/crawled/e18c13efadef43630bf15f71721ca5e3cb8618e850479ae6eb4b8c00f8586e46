It assumes the expectation of the random field to be known, and relies on a covariance function. However, in most applications neither the expectation nor the covariance are known beforehand."],"after":["The Kriging weights of simple Kriging have no unbiasedness condition and are given by the simple Kriging equation system:"]}}}
