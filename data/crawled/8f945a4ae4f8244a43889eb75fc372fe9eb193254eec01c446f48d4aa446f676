The Nahuatl words aztecatl /asˈtekat͡ɬ/ (singular) and aztecah /asˈtekaʔ/ (plural) mean \"people from Aztlan\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \"Aztec\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as Mēxihcah Tenochcah /meːˈʃiʔkaʔ teˈnot͡ʃkaʔ/ or Cōlhuah Mexihcah /ˈkoːlwaʔ meːˈʃiʔkaʔ/."]}}}
