The term carries various meanings, depending on the religious context in which it is used. For Jews, the term \"Bible\" refers to the Tanakh (Heb., תָּנָ״ךְ), an acronym formed from the Hebrew names of the three divisions of the Jewish Scriptures: Law (Torah), Prophets (Nevi'im), and Writings (Ketuvim). To Christians, the term incorporates both the Tanakh, or \"Old Testament,\" and the New Testament. Not all Christians have the same number of books in the Bible, i.e Roman Catholics have 73 books to the Bible, while Protestants have 66. The 7 extra books are usually referred to by the Roman Catholic Church as \"Deuterocanonicals\" since they were added in a second phase to the original Bible Canon."]}}}
