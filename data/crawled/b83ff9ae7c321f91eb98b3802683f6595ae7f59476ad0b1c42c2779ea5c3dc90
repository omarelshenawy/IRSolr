In most English-language usage, there is no singular form, making the word a plurale tantum;[1] out of various major dictionaries, only one enters variation from plural agreement.[2] The word is used more in biology and medicine than in other fields (reflecting science's tradition of classical Latin and New Latin); for example, in hunting and tracking, terms such as dung, scat, spoor, and droppings normally are used to refer to non-human animal feces, and in husbandry and farming, manure is common."]}}}
