Referendums were held in four of the colonies in June 1898. There were majority votes in all four of them. However, it failed because the \"yes\" vote total of 80,000 had not been not reached in New South Wales. In June 1899, the referendum was held again in all the colonies except for Western Australia, where the vote was not held until the following year. The majority vote was \"yes\" in all the colonies."],"after":["The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (UK) was passed on 5 July 1900 and given Royal Assent by Queen Victoria on 9 July 1900.
