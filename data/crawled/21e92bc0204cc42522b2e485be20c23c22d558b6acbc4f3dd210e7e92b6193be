Doublespeak and groupthink are both deliberate elaborations of doublethink, while the adjective \"Orwellian\" denotes \"characteristic and reminiscent of George Orwell's writings\" especially Nineteen Eighty-Four. The practice of ending words with \"-speak\" (e.g. mediaspeak) is drawn from the novel.[61] Orwell is perpetually associated with the year 1984; in July 1984 an asteroid discovered by Anton√≠n Mrkos was named after Orwell."]}}}
