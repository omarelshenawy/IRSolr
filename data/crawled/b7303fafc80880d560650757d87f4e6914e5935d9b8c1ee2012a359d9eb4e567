Social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis.\"[136] However, the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins.[137] At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact. This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between, on the one hand, economic growth and on the other, environmental damage and resource depletion.[138]"]}}}
