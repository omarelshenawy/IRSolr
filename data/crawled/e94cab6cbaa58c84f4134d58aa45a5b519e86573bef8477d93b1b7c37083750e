It includes fifty-one elected members: ten senators (elected on an island-wide basis), twelve Connétables (often called 'constables', heads of parishes) and twenty-nine deputies (representing constituencies), all elected for four-year terms as from the October 2011 elections.[35] There are also five non-voting members appointed by the Crown: the Bailiff, the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey, the Dean of Jersey, the Attorney General and Solicitor General.[36] Jersey has one of the lowest voter turn outs internationally, in 2005 with just 33% of the electorate voting – putting it well below the 77% European average for that year [37]"]}}}
