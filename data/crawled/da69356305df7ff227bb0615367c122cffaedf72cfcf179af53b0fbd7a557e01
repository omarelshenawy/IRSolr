Seminars\" who traps time-traveler Heinz-57 (played by Geoff Hoyle) in one of his seminars and continually refers to him as \"Heinz Asshole.\"[29] In the DVD commentary for the 2003 release of the film, director Lucas Reiner stated that the \"Absentee, oblivious, self-involved parents who don't notice their kids have a spaceship\" was a reference to the self-involved nature of adults during the 1970s and their propensity for self-improvement.[28] Lucas Reiner stated that these scenes were meant to symbolize the \"'70s hunger for self-improvement,\" and the extreme ends that people would go to in order to improve themselves. Lucas Reiner had never personally attended one of Werner Erhard's seminars, but had heard that attendants were not allowed to leave, often peed in their pants, and were called \"assholes\" and insulted publicly. Reiner noted that once his brother Carl put on the \"Dr. Cash\" costume, he played his character perfectly.[28] Heavyweights is a 1995 comedy film about a fat camp for kids that is taken over by fitness guru Tony Perkis, played by Ben Stiller. In a review of the film in The Washington Post, Hal Hinson described Stiller's portrayal of the Perkis character to Erhard, and called him \"the Werner Erhard of slide aerobics\".[30]"]}}}
