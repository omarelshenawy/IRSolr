Unlike Bennett's other early hits, this was an up-tempo big band number with a bold, brassy sound and a double tango in the instrumental break; it topped the charts for eight weeks.[30] Later that year, the producers of the upcoming Broadway musical Kismet had Bennett record \"Stranger in Paradise\" as a way of promoting the show during a New York newspaper strike.[35] The song reached the top, the show was a hit, and Bennett began a long practice of recording show tunes.[35] \"Stranger in Paradise\" was also a number-one hit in the United Kingdom a year and a half later[36] and started Bennett's career as an international artist."]}}}
