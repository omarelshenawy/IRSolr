During these \"Boston Tech\" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School.[33] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.[34] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni.[34] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.[34]"],"after":["In 1916, MIT moved to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a mile-long tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River.[35][36] The neoclassical \"New Technology\" campus was designed by William W. Bosworth[37] and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious \"Mr. Smith,\" starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.[38]"]}}}
