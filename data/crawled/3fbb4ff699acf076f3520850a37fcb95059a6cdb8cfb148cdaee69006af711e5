Trade is regulated, as all species are listed by CITES in Appendix II, except 50 species and subspecies listed in Appendix I, which gain full protection from trade.[166][167] Common threats to primate species include deforestation, forest fragmentation, monkey drives (resulting from primate crop raiding),[168] and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropical forest clearing is widely regarded as the process that most threatens primates.[169][170][171] More than 90% of primate species occur in tropical forests.[170][172] The main cause of forest loss is clearing for agriculture, although commercial logging, subsistence harvesting of timber, mining, and dam construction also contribute to tropical forest destruction.[172] In Indonesia large areas of lowland forest have been cleared to increase palm oil production, and one analysis of satellite imagery concluded that during 1998 and 1999 there was a loss of 1,000 Sumatran orangutans per year in the Leuser Ecosystem alone.[173]"],"after":["Primates with a large body size (over 5Â kg) are at increased extinction risk due to their greater profitability to poachers compared to smaller primates.[172] They reach sexual maturity later and have a longer period between births. Populations therefore recover more slowly after being depleted by poaching or the pet trade.[174] Data for some African cities show that half of all protein consumed in urban areas comes from the bushmeat trade.[175] Endangered primates such as guenons and the drill are hunted at levels that far exceed sustainable levels.[175] This is due to their large body size, ease of transport and profitability per animal.[175] As farming encroaches on forest habitats, primates feed on the crops, causing the farmers large economic losses.[176] Primate crop raiding gives locals a negative impression of primates, hindering conservation efforts.[177]"]}}}
