These first inhabitants may have been ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians.[47] At the time of European settlement in the late 18th century, most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers, with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime. The Torres Strait Islanders, ethnically Melanesian, were originally horticulturalists and hunter-gatherers.[48] The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by fishermen from Maritime Southeast Asia.[49]"]}}}
