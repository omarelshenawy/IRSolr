An estimated 83% of the dwellings on the island were damaged including 4% requiring complete reconstruction. A reported 70% of all dwellings suffered severe damage from flooding or wind. Another 26% sustained minor damage from partial roof removal, low levels of flooding, or impact with floating or wind driven hurricane debris.[12] Power, water and communications were disrupted for months in some areas, as Ivan was the worst hurricane to hit the islands in 86 years.[13] Grand Cayman began a major rebuilding process and within two years, its infrastructure was nearly returned to pre-hurricane status. Due to the tropical location of the islands, more hurricane or tropical systems have affected the Cayman Islands than any other region in the Atlantic basin; it has been brushed or directly hit, on average, every 2.23 years.[14]"],"after":["The Cayman Islands are in the western Caribbean Sea and are the peaks of a massive underwater ridge, known as the Cayman Ridge (or Cayman Rise). This ridge flanks the Cayman Trough, 6,000 m (20,000 ft) deep[15] which lies 6 km (3.7 mi) to the south.[16] The islands lie in the northwest of the Caribbean Sea, east of Quintana Roo, Mexico and the Yucatan Mexico, south of Cuba and west of Jamaica. They are situated about 700 km (430 mi) south of Miami,[17] 750 km (470 mi) east of Mexico,[18] 366 km (227 mi) south of Cuba,[19] and about 500 km (310 mi) northwest of Jamaica.[20] Grand Cayman is by far the biggest, with an area of 197 km2 (76 sq mi).[21] Grand Cayman's two \"Sister Islands\", Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, are about 120 km (75 mi) east north-east of Grand Cayman and have areas of 38 and 28.5 km2 (14.7 and 11.0 sq mi)[22] respectively."]}}}
