Family housing is located on North Campus and mainly serves graduate students. The largest residence hall has a capacity of 1,240 students,[120] while the smallest accommodates 25 residents.[121] A majority of upper-division and graduate students live in off-campus apartments, houses, and cooperatives, with the largest concentrations in the Central and South Campus areas."]}}}
