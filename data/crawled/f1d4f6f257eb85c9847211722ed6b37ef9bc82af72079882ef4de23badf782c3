In the Perfect 10 case the interests were more evenly balanced, for the first time in a derivative work case involving new information technology. Both Google and Perfect 10 had legitimate interests at stake and support for their respective positions. Thus, there was a finding that \"Google’s wide-ranging use of thumbnails is highly transformative: their creation and display is designed to, and does, display visual search results quickly and efficiently to users of Google Image Search.\" But Google's use had some commercial aspects and was claimed to impair P10's commercial interests. Yet, on balance the Ninth Circuit found that the transformativeness outweighed the other fair use factors because \"Google has provided a significant benefit to the public\" in facilitating image searches by means of thumbnail images. This opinion provided a second instance of the \"beneficial=transformative\" equation described in the preceding paragraph (from the Arriba Soft case)."],"after":["The use of pop-up advertising, in which third-party advertisements pop up on a competitor’s Web page and change its appearance to allegedly create a derivative work,[22] may present transformativeness issues. The proponents of such pop-ups (the defendants in infringement litigation) argue that they provide the public with additional information about making buying decisions (particularly in the form of price comparisons), but the opponents (the plaintiffs in these cases) argue that the defendants' conduct adversely affects the Web page proprietor's interest in the \"integrity\" of its Web page and its investment interest in creating and maintaining the page.[23] No court has yet addressed derivative work copyright considerations in terms of balancing the interests at stake,[24] although several courts have found no copyright infringement for one reason or another. An example of promotional advertising for a pop-up company, illustrating various pop-up techniques for changing the appearance of another firm's Web page is shown in this Flash.[25]"]}}}
