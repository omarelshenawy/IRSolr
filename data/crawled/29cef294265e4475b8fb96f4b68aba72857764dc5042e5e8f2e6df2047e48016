Musically incorporating R&B infused beats, \"Everybody\" portrayed the image of Madonna as a black artist, since her picture did not appear on the single cover.[16] However this misconception was cleared later when Madonna convinced Sire executives to allow her to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget music video directed by Ed Steinberg portrayed Madonna and her friends singing and dancing in a club to the song. The video helped to promote the song and Madonna as an artist further.[32] Critically the song did not receive any acclaim and failed to enter the official Billboard Hot 100 chart, but charted on its dance charts.[33][34]"]}}}
