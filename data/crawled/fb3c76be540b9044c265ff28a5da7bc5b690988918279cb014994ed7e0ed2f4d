In Tests, he took 127 wickets and scored 2,325 runs. He holds the world records for the most appearances made in first-class cricket (1,110 matches) and for the most wickets taken (4,204). He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season a record 16 times. Rhodes played for Yorkshire and England into his fifties, and in his final Test in 1930 was, at 52 years and 165 days, the oldest player who has appeared in a Test match. Beginning his career for Yorkshire in 1898 as a slow left arm bowler, Rhodes quickly established a reputation as one of the best slow bowlers in the world. His batting steadily improved until, by the First World War, he was also regarded as one of the leading batsmen in England and had established an effective opening partnership with Jack Hobbs. As a bowler, Rhodes was noted for his great accuracy, variations in flight and, in his early days, sharp spin. Following his retirement from playing cricket, he briefly coached at Harrow School and was given honorary membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1949. (Full article...)"]}}}
