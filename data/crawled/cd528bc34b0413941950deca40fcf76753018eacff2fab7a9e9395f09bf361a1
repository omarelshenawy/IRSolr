This is a basic tutorial, not an extensive manual. If you want more details about any information in the tutorial, there are links to other resource pages throughout the tutorial. To read them as you go along, you can open them in a separate browser window or tab."],"after":["As a new contributor, you may feel a little overwhelmed by the sheer size and scope of this project called Wikipedia. Don't worry too much if you don't understand everything at first, as it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Wikipedia not only allows you to create, revise, and edit articles, but it wants you to do it...be bold! You just need to remember that you can't break Wikipedia and although there are many protocols, perfection is not required, as Wikipedia is a work in progress. Collaborative editing means that incomplete or poorly written first drafts can evolve over time into excellent articles."]}}}
