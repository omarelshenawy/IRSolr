He started with an energy term, L, named the Lagrangian in his honor, and formulated Lagrange's equations:"],"after":["The dotted quantities, denote a function which corresponds to a Newtonian fluxion, whereas denote a function which corresponds to a Newtonian fluent. But linear time is the parameter for the relationship between the and the of the physical system under consideration. Some decades later, it was found that the second order equation of Lagrange or Newton can be more easily solved or visualized by suitable transformation to sets of first order differential equations."]}}}
