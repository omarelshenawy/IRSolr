Nynorsk is the smallest of the four written standards in Scandinavia.","Nynorsk is nevertheless found in all the same types of places (newspapers, commercial products, computer programs etc.) as the other Scandinavian standard languages. Bokmål has a much larger basis in urban speech, especially that found in the eastern part of Southern Norway.[3] However, most Norwegians do not speak the so-called standard østnorsk, \"standard eastern Norwegian\", but rather other Norwegian dialects. As such, Nynorsk is not a minority language[citation needed], though it shares many of the problems that minority languages face."]}}}
