He decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language as a writer.[38] Early exposure by Anderson to public perception of the word \"fuck\" came from Class Clown by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\".[38][40]"]}}}
