In the context of proof theory the analogous statement is trivial, since every proof can have only a finite number of antecedents used in the proof. In the context of model theory, however, this proof is somewhat more difficult. There are two well known proofs, one by GÃ¶del (which goes via proofs) and one by Malcev (which is more direct and allows us to restrict the cardinality of the resulting model)."],"after":[]}}}
