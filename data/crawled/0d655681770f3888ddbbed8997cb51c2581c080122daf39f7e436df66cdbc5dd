This system of religious philosophy and expression has been traditionally known as the Gurmat (literally the teachings of the Gurus) or the Sikh Dharma. Sikhism comes from the word Sikh, which in turn comes from the Punjabi word sikkh. Sikkh comes from its Sanskrit root śiṣya meaning \"disciple\" or \"learner\", or śikṣa meaning \"instruction\", via the equivalent Pāli word sikkhā."]}}}
