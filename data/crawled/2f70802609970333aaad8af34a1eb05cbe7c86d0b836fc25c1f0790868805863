(The renovation was unrelated to the Lincoln Center renovations which commenced shortly after 2001.) During this time, the research collections were serviced from the NYPL's Annex (at 10th avenue and 43rd street), and the circulating collections were housed at the Mid-Manhattan Library at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue. LPA reopened to the public on October 29, 2001 with its building newly named Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center after a gift from the Cullmans (Dorothy was a trustee until she died; Lewis is still a trustee).[12]"],"after":["During the renovation, the library was wired to enable installation of numerous computers on each floor. There are nearly 200 publicly accessible computers in the building.[13] Most are restricted to use of the library catalog and electronic databases or viewing the library's audiovisual material, but a few provide full Internet use. The renovation also created a Technology Training Room, with twelve desktop computers for users and one for a teacher, as well as a projection screen."]}}}
