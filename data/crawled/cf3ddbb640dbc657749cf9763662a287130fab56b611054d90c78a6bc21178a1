Little Buttercup offers sympathy. He tells her that, if it were not for the difference in their social standing, he would have returned her affection. She prophesies that things are not all as they seem and that \"a change\" is in store for him, but he does not understand her cryptic warning."],"after":["Sir Joseph enters and complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him. The Captain speculates that she is probably dazzled by his \"exalted rank\" and that if Sir Joseph can persuade her that \"love levels all ranks\", she will accept his proposal. They withdraw, and Josephine enters, still feeling guilty about her planned elopement with Ralph and fearful of giving up a life of luxury. When Sir Joseph makes the argument that \"love levels all ranks\", a delighted Josephine says that she \"will hesitate no longer\". The Captain and Sir Joseph rejoice, but Josephine is now more determined than ever to marry Ralph."]}}}
