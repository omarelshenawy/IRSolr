She wrote to her mother, \"The world is splitting open at my feet like a ripe, juicy watermelon.\"[11] She edited The Smith Review and during the summer after her third year of college was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City.[3] The experience was not what she had hoped it would be, and it began a downward spiral. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomasâ€”a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, \"more than life itself.\" She hung around the White Horse bar and the Chelsea Hotel for two days hoping to meet Thomas, but he was already on his way home. A few weeks later she was to slash her legs to see if she had enough courage to commit suicide.[12] Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar.[13] During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar.[11] Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt in late August 1953 by crawling under her house and taking her mother's sleeping pills.[14]"],"after":["She survived this first suicide attempt after lying unfound in a crawl space for three days, later writing that she \"blissfully succumbed to the whirling blackness that I honestly believed was eternal oblivion.\"[3] She spent the next six months in psychiatric care, receiving more electric and insulin shock treatment under the care of Dr. Ruth Beuscher.[3] Her stay at McLean Hospital and her Smith scholarship were paid for by Olive Higgins Prouty, who had successfully recovered from a mental breakdown herself. Plath seemed to make a good recovery and returned to college. In January 1955, she submitted her thesis The Magic Mirror: A Study of the Double in Two of Dostoyevsky's Novels and in June, graduated from Smith with highest honors.[15]"]}}}
