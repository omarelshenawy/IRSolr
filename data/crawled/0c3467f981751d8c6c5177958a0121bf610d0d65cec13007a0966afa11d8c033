Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\"[381] Al Green agreed: \"He broke the ice for all of us.\"[382] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: \"His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country.\"[278] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was one of the most famous people in the world.[383]"],"after":[]}}}
