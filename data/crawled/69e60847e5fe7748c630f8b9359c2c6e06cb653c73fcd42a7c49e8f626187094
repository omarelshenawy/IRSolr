In population, it is the first most populous city in the country. Originally controlled by the Hausa, the city, along with the other Hausa states, was seized by Fulani radicals during the early nineteenth-century Fulani War and captured by the British in 1903. The city's traditional ruler is the Emir of Kano, and the current Emir, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, has been on the throne since July 2014. Kano's history is detailed in the Kano Chronicle."]}}}
