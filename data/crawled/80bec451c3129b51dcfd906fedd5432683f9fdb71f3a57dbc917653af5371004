Elected MPs are voted into the Parliament on a \"first-past-the-post\" (plurality) basis and represent either single-member or group representation constituencies.[37] The People's Action Party has won control of Parliament with large majorities in every election since self-governance was secured in 1959.[34] Although the elections are clean, there is no independent electoral authority and the political process is dominated by the PAP, which has strong influence on the media and the courts hampering opposition campaigning. This has led Freedom House to regard Singapore as not a proper electoral democracy.[38] Despite this, in the most recent Parliamentary elections in 2011, the opposition, led by the Workers' Party, increased its representation to six elected MPs.[39]"],"after":["The legal system of Singapore is based on English common law, but with substantial local differences. Trial by jury was abolished in 1970 so that judicial decisions would rest entirely in the hands of appointed judges.[40] Singapore has penalties that include judicial corporal punishment in the form of caning, which may be imposed for such offenses as rape, rioting, vandalism, and certain immigration offenses.[41][42] There is a mandatory death penalty for murder, as well as certain aggravated drug-trafficking and firearms offenses.[43] Amnesty International has said that some legal provisions of the Singapore system conflict with the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and that Singapore has \"... possibly the highest execution rate in the world relative to its population\".[44] The government has disputed Amnesty's claims.[45] In a 2008 survey of international business executives, Singapore and Hong Kong received the top ranking with regard to judicial system quality in Asia.[46] Singapore has been consistently rated among the least corrupt countries in the world by Transparency International.[47]"]}}}
