The Games are recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and are described as the second largest multi-sport event after the Olympic Games. During the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, a conversation between sportsmen from China and the Philippines raised the idea of restoring the Far Eastern Games. However, the Indian IOC representative Guru Dutt Sondhi thought that the restoration of the Games would not be sufficient to show the spirit of unity and level of achievement in Asian sports, so proposed to sports leaders the idea of having discussions about holding a wholly new competition â€” the Asian Games. First Asian Games held in Delhi in 1951, since then Games have been held every fourth year."]}}}
