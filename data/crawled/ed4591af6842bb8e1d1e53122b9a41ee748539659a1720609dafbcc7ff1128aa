Gases involved in ozone depletion, CFCs, chlorocarbons, and bromocarbons, were measured in firn and levels were almost zero at around 1880 except for CH3Br, which is known to have natural sources.[16] Similar study of Greenland firn found that CFCs vanished at a depth of 69 m (CO2 age of 1929).[17]"]}}}
