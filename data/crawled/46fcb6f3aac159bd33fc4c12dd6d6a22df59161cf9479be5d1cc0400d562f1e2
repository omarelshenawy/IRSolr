Polish cuisine shares many similarities with other Central European cuisines, especially German and Austrian[229] as well as Jewish,[230] Belarussian, Ukrainian, Russian,[231] French and Italian culinary traditions.[232] It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region) and winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish bigos), and spices.[233] It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are kluski as well as cereals such as kasha (from the Polish word kasza).[234] Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs. Festive meals such as the meatless Christmas eve dinner (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast could take days to prepare in their entirety.[235]"]}}}
