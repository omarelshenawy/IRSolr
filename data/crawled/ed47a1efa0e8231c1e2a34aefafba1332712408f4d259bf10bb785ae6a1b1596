Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory.[238] In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography.[235][239] At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.[240][241]"]}}}
