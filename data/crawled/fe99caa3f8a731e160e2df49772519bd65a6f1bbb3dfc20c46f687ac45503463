The percentage of trips taken by car has increased from 13% in 1947 to 50% in 1960 and to 70% in 1971.[240] The most important roads in Sydney are the nine Metroads, including the 110-kilometre (68-mile) Sydney Orbital Network. There can be up to 350,000 cars using Sydney's roads simultaneously during rush hour, leading to significant traffic congestion.[240] 84.9% of Sydney households own a motor vehicle and 46.5% own two or more.[19] Of people in Sydney that travel to work, 58.4% use a car, 9.1% catch a train, 5.2% take a bus, and 4.1% walk.[19] In contrast, only 25.2% of working residents in the City of Sydney use a car, whilst 15.8% take a train, 13.3% use a bus, and 25.3% walk.[241] With a rate of 26.3%, Sydney has the highest utilisation of public transport for travel to work of any Australian capital city.[242]"]}}}
