After months on St. Eustatius, capturing additional merchants and treasure, Rodney was prevailed upon to send part of his fleet north to aid General Cornwallis and British armed forces fighting the Americans. He did not dispatch the bulk of his fleet from St. Eustatius until July/August of 1781. He was too late to affect the events that were taking place in North America."],"after":["Outside of the Chesapeake Bay, the weakened British fleet was defeated by a much stronger combined French fleet under Rear Admiral Francois Joseph Paul, the Comte de Grasse. The battle between de Grasse and Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves was known as the Battle of the Chesapeake. Also known as the Battle of the Capes it was one of the most pivotal battles in history.[19]"]}}}
