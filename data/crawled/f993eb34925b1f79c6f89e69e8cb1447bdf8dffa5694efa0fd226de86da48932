She ended The Virgin Tour (1985) with a self-parodying performance of the song. She wore a white tube top and a tight white skirt and carried a bunch of notes in her left hand.[48] At the end of the performance she asked the audience \"Do you really think I'm a material girl?...I'm not...Take it [Throwing fake money]... I don't need money... I need love.\"[49] As she began to strip off more clothes, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, Tony Ciccone himself did the honors.[48] The performance was included in the VHS release Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour.[50] In the Who's That Girl World Tour of 1987, Madonna performed it as a medley with \"Dress You Up\" and \"Like a Virgin\". She wore an elaborate costume, inspired by Dame Edna Everage. It consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy, black frames, a ruffled skirt, a bodice covered with objects like watches and dolls and fishnets. Author Carol Clrek stated that the dress was more \"ludicrous for Madonna, than humorous.\"[51] Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987,[52] and Ciao Italia: Live from Italy, filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.[53]"]}}}
