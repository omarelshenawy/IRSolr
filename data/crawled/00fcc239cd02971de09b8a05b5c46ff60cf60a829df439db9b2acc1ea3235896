In parameterized complexity, this difference is made explicit by considering pairs of decision problems and parameters k. SUBEPT is the class of all parameterized problems that run in time sub-exponential in k and polynomial in the input size n:[20]"],"after":["More precisely, SUBEPT is the class of all parameterized problems for which there is a computable function with and an algorithm that decides L in time ."]}}}
