After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: \"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\"[80] He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March 1843.[81] Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him \"hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain\", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor.[82] Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.[83]"]}}}
