Early European researchers, such as Julius von Haast, a geologist, incorrectly interpreted archaeological remains as belonging to a pre-Māori Paleolithic people; later researchers, notably Percy Smith, magnified such theories into an elaborate scenario with a series of sharply-defined cultural stages which had Māori arriving in a Great Fleet in 1350 CE and replacing the so-called \"moa-hunter\" culture with a \"classical Māori\" culture based on horticulture.[66] The development of Māori material culture has been similarly delineated by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa into \"cultural periods\", from the earlier \"Ngā Kakano\" stage to the later \"Te Tipunga\" period, before the \"Classic\" period of Māori history.[25][iv][67]"]}}}
