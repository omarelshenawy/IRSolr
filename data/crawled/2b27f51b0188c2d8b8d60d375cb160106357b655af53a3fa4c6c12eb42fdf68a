For example, one might have done a review of a Wikipedia article and want to indicate which particular version was reviewed."],"after":["A permanent link to the current version of an article is normally available from the sidebar, under Toolbox -> Permanent link. For other namespaces, or if the version to be linked to is not the current version, use the page's History tab to navigate to the specific version required.
