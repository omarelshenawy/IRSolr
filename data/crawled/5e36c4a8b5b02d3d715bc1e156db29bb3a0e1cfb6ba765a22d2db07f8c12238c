H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover and comedian George Carlin's seven dirty words monologue.[2][17][26] Recent censorship issues detailed in the book include Howard Stern and the Columbine High School massacre,[24] and the author critiques A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue by Wendy Shalit and Mothers Organized for Moral Stability (MOMS).[23] The author discusses censorship aimed at youth in recent U.S. legislation, including the Children's Internet Protection Act and Communications Decency Act.[2]"]}}}
