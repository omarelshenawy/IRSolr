As science itself has developed, knowledge has developed a broader usage which has been developing within biology/psychology—discussed elsewhere as meta-epistemology, or genetic epistemology, and to some extent related to \"theory of cognitive development\".    "],"after":["Note that \"epistemology\" is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is \"the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.\" Sir Francis Bacon was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, \"knowledge is power\", is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597).[19]"]}}}
