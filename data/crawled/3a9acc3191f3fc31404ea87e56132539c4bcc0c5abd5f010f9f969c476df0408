In some instances in addition to the Persian vocabulary, the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used. For example, in Iranian colloquial Persian (not in Afghanistan or Tajikistan), the phrase \"thank you\" may be expressed using the French word merci (stressed however on the first syllable), the hybrid Persian-Arabic phrase motešakker am (motešakker being \"merciful\" in Arabic, commonly pronounced motčakker in Persian, and the verb am meaning \"I am\" in Persian), or by the pure Persian phrase sepās-gozār am."],"after":[]}}}
