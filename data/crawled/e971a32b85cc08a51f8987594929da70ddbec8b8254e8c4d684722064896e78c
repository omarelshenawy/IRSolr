She cavorted on stage with three scantily clad women in a brothel-style setting, dressed in tuxedos and top hats, in a choreographed, highly sexual routine.[23][24][25] According to choreographer Alex Magno, he wanted to do \"Justify My Love\" or \"The Beast Within\" on MTV, but Madonna decided that they might be too controversial for live television and abandoned the idea. Nevertheless, \"Bye Bye Baby\" was chosen and performed with the choreography they had been practicing for The Girlie Show World Tour, since it represented the whole idea behind the tour.[26] Louis Virtel from The Backlot ranked the performance at number eight on a list for \"Madonna's 11 Greatest VMA Moments\". He praised Madonna's rendition of the song at the Video Music Awards, calling it \"a hell of a VMA performance\" and a \"killer cinematic throwback\".[8][27]"]}}}
