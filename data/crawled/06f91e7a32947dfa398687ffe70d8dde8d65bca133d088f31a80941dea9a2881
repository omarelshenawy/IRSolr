In June 2007, Larry Burns, vice president of research and development, said he's not yet willing to say exactly when hydrogen vehicles will be mass-produced, but he said it should happen before 2020, the year many experts have predicted. He said \"I sure would be disappointed if we weren't there\" before 2020.[112]"]}}}
