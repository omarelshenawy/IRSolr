Ever since classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy. In the West during the early modern period the words \"science\" and \"philosophy of nature\" were sometimes used interchangeably,[3]:p.3 and until the 19th century natural philosophy (which is today called \"natural science\") was considered a branch of philosophy.[4]"]}}}
