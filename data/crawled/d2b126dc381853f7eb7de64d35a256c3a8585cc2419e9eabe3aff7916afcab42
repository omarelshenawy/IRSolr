In some cases, groups have sought out the sound of the pipe organ, such as Tangerine Dream, and Arrogant Worms, which combined the distinctive sounds of electronic synthesizers and pipe organs when it recorded both music albums and videos in several cathedrals in Europe. Rick Wakeman of British progressive rock group Yes also used pipe organ to excellent effect in a number of the group's albums (including Close to the Edge and Going for the One). Wakeman has also used pipe organ in his solo pieces such as \"Jane Seymour\" from The Six Wives Of Henry VIII and \"Judas Iscariot\" from Criminal Record. Even more recently, he has recorded an entire album of organ pieces – Rick Wakeman at Lincoln Cathedral. Likewise, Keith Emerson used a pipe organ with The Nice and progressive rock group Emerson, Lake and Palmer on their earlier albums on the songs \"The Three Fates,\" \"The Only Way\" and \"Promenade.\" George Duke employed the pipe organ in a flamboyant manner in the piece \"50/50\" on the Frank Zappa album Over-Nite Sensation. Dennis DeYoung of American rock group Styx used the pipe organ at Chicago's St. James Cathedral on the song \"I'm O.K.\" on the group's 1978 album Pieces of Eight. In 2000 Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke played the organ on the Kid A album to great effect, most notably in \"Motion Picture Soundtrack\". More recently, Arcade Fire have used a church organ on the songs \"Intervention\" and \"My Body Is a Cage\" on their second album Neon Bible. Muse have also used a church organ on their album Origin of Symmetry in the form of \"Megalomania\", and also briefly in \"Unnatural Selection\", found on The Resistance, played by their frontman Matt Bellamy on both occasions. It has been performed live only once on a pipe organ, at the Royal Albert Hall. Roger Hodgson (formerly of Supertramp) used a pipe organ for the songs Say Goodbye, Open the Door and Danielle in 2000 for the album Open the Door."]}}}
