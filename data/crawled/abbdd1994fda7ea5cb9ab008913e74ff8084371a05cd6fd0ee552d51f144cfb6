On the other hand, as the demand for cotton grew, the price of slaves who picked it soared. Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the economic determinism of historian Charles A. Beard in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. While socially different, the sections economically benefited each other.[53][54]"],"after":["Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to abolitionism.[55][56] Southerners complained that it was the North that was changing, and was prone to new \"isms\", while the South remained true to historic republican values of the Founding Fathers (many of whom owned slaves, including Washington, Jefferson, and Madison). Lincoln said that Republicans were following the tradition of the framers of the Constitution (including the Northwest Ordinance and the Missouri Compromise) by preventing expansion of slavery.[57]"]}}}
