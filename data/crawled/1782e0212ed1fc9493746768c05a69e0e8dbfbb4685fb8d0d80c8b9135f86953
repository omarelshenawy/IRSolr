Smith. His parents had met and married in New York in 1854, and settled back in Clinton, now East Oakland, California. James Stratton had been to California once before during the gold rush of 1850, sailing around North America and crossing by land the Panama stretch, but finding little gold. The senior Stratton traced his ancestry to the early settlers of the British settlements of America, and Cornelia Smith had Dutch and English forebears. James Stratton would live the rest of his life in California, pursuing a civil engineering career as County Surveyor for Alameda County in 1858–59 and later as the U.S. Surveyor-General of the state, and finally as Chief Deputy State Surveyor. An expert on the big Mexican land grants, he split up several of the Spanish deeds.[2] One of his sons, Frederick, went to the University of California, today's Berkeley, and became a lawyer, state senator, and Collector of the Port of San Francisco, before killing himself on November 30, 1915.[3] Another, Robert Thomas, became a doctor in Oakland and died after a long illness on May 6, 1924.[4] The couple also had a daughter, Jeanne,[5] the later Mrs. Walter Good.[6] George was their youngest child who lived past toddlerhood.[7]"],"after":["Stratton's early education was at the Oakland public schools and undergraduate education at the University of California.[7] At the university he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.[8] He was also the editor of the student news publication, The Berkeleyan in 1886.[9] Stratton graduated in 1888 with an A.B. degree from the University of California,[10] in a total graduating class of 34 students.[11] He learned Latin and English and taught in Buenaventura High School in 1888–89, and was its principal in 1889–90. At the school he met and courted San Francisco-born Alice Elenore Miller.[7]"]}}}
