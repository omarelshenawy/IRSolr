Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.[143]"],"after":["One of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.[144] It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[145] Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed \"No Child Left Behind\" into law.[146] Critics argue that it is underfunded[147] and that NCLBA's focus on \"high-stakes testing\" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[148]"]}}}
