In addition, the various natural operations on generating functions such as addition, multiplication, differentiation, etc., have a combinatorial significance; this allows one to extend results from one combinatorial problem in order to solve others."],"after":["For two combinatorial families as above the Cartesian product (pair) of the two families () has generating function F(x)G(x)."]}}}
