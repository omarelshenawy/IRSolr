While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below 212 °F (100 °C) creates \"negligible amounts\" of HCAs. Also, microwaving meat before cooking may substantially reduce HCAs.[71]"],"after":["Although microwave cooking may lead to reduced HCA levels in cooked meat products, Raw Foodists do not consider it any more favorable than other forms of cooking. Microwaving has been shown to cause a great decrease in all studied antioxidants in broccoli, compared to other cooking methods.[72] Microwaving has also been shown to reduce vitamin B12 levels in beef, pork, and milk by 30-40%.[73] Breast milk is commonly stored cold, and reheated before use. Using the microwave for this purpose has been shown to significantly reduce the anti-infective factors in human milk.[74][75]"]}}}
