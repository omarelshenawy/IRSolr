The x, y, and z components of satellite position and the time sent are designated as [xi, yi, zi, si] where the subscript i denotes the satellite and has the value 1, 2, ..., n, where n ≥ 4. When the time of message reception indicated by the on-board receiver clock is t̃i, the true reception time is ti = t̃i + b, where b is the receiver's clock offset from the much more accurate GPS system clocks employed by the satellites. The receiver clock offset is the same for all received satellite signals (assuming the satellite clocks are all perfectly synchronized). The message's transit time is t̃i + b - si, where si is the satellite time. Assuming the message traveled at the speed of light, c, the distance traveled is (t̃i + b - si) c."],"after":["or in terms of pseudoranges, , as"]}}}
