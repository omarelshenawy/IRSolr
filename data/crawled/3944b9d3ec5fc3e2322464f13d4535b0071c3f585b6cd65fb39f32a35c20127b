Destruction of the SCN results in the complete absence of a regular sleepâ€“wake rhythm. The SCN receives information about illumination through the eyes. The retina of the eye contains \"classical\" photoreceptors (\"rods\" and \"cones\"), which are used for conventional vision. But the retina also contains specialized ganglion cells that are directly photosensitive, and project directly to the SCN, where they help in the entrainment (synchronization) of this master circadian clock.[38]"]}}}
