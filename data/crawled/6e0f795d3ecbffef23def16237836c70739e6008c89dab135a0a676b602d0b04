In addition, stunt director Richard Talmadge was uncredited as co-director of the final sequence.[301] Ben Hecht was originally commissioned by Feldman as writer, and he provided a serious interpretation of Fleming's source novel, before it was decided to turn the film into a comedy.[299] Three main screenwriters then worked on the project—Wolf Mankowitz, John Law and Michael Sayers—and a further nine people provided uncredited additional material.[302] Problems arose on set between Peter Sellers and director Joseph McGrath[303] and between Sellers and Orson Welles. Sellers eventually demanded that he and Welles should not share the same set.[304] Sellers left the film before his part was complete. A further agent's part was then written for Terence Cooper, to cover Sellers' departure,[305][c] while re-writes, additional filming and post-production cutting compensated for the missing actor.[308] Principal photography started on 11 January 1966 and was scheduled to take up to 26 weeks.[309] Because of the delays and chaotic nature of the filming process, it finally finished ten months later in November.[310]"]}}}
