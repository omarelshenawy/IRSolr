However, Italy's \"Hunters of the Alps\" led by Garibaldi defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Bezzecca on July 21, conquered the lower part of Trentino, and moved towards Trento. The Prussian peace with Austria forced the Italian government to seek an armistice with Austria on August 12. According to the Treaty of Vienna, signed on October 12, Austria ceded Venetia to France, which, in turn, ceded it to Italy (for details of operations in Italy, see Third Italian War of Independence)."],"after":[]}}}
