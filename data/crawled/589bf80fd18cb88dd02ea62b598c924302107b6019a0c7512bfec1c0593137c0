The succeeding variety of Early northern Middle English spoken in southeastern Scotland, also known as Early Scots, began to diverge from that of Northumbria due to twelfth and thirteenth century immigration of Scandinavian-influenced Middle English-speakers from the North and Midlands of England.[26] Later influences on the development of Scots were from Romance languages via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman French[27] and later Parisian French due to the Auld Alliance as well as Dutch and Middle Low German influences due to trade and immigration from the Low Countries.[28] Scots also includes loan words resulting from contact with Gaelic. Early medieval legal documents include a body of Gaelic legal and administrative loans.[29] Contemporary Gaelic loans are mainly for geographical and cultural features, such as ceilidh, loch and clan."]}}}
