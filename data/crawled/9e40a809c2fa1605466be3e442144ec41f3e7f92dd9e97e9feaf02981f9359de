The eight-week bombing campaign became known as Operation Rolling Thunder. Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear â€“ there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded.[150] Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Vietcong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Vietcong into an intensification of the war. But the short-term expectations were consistent - that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered. By limiting the information given out to the public and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.[151]"]}}}
