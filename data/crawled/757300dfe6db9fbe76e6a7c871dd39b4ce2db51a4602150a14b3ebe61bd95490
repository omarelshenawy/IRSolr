It was pioneered by I-F with their track \"Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass\" (1998),[353] and pursued by artists including Felix da Housecat,[354] Peaches, Chicks on Speed,[355] and Ladytron.[356] It gained international attention at the beginning of the new millennium and spread to scenes in London and Berlin, but rapidly faded as a recognisable genre.[357] Dance-punk, mixing post-punk sounds with disco and funk, had developed in the 1980s, but it was revived among some bands of the garage rock/post-punk revival in the early years of the new millennium, particularly among New York acts such as Liars, The Rapture and Radio 4, joined by dance-oriented acts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud.[358] In Britain the combination of indie with dance-punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands[359] including Trash Fashion,[360] New Young Pony Club,[361] Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles[362] and Shitdisco,[359] forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier rave music.[359][363]"]}}}
