The tool allows its users to query the Wikimedia servers in order to ascertain the IP addresses used by a Wikipedia user account, as well as other technical data stored by the server about a user account or IP address. Wikipedia's Checkuser team uses the tool in order to establish whether two or more accounts are being operated by one individual or group of people, and then to protect Wikipedia against disruptive or abusive behaviour. CheckUser data cannot be correctly interpreted without technical knowledge and experience with the tool. CheckUser data is never accessed or released, except in accordance with the Wikimedia Foundation's Privacy policy and the additional restrictions placed by this policy. After completing an investigation with the checkuser tool, most checkuser operators release their findings in generalised form (such as with a statement that \"account A is, is not, or may be the same as accounts B or C\"); on the English Wikipedia, the release of actual private data (like \"account D is connecting through IP address 0.1.2.3\") is exceptionally rare. Conclusions derived from checkuser data have limited usefulness, and a negative finding by a checkuser rarely precludes obvious sock-puppetry."]}}}
