Briefly, the n-sphere can be described as , which is n-dimensional Euclidean space plus a single point representing infinity in all directions. In particular, if a single point is removed from an n-sphere, it becomes homeomorphic to . This forms the basis for stereographic projection.[1]"],"after":["The 0-ball consists of a single point. The 0-dimensional Hausdorff measure is the number of points in a set, so","The unit 1-ball is the interval of length 2. So,"]}}}
