Later on, at the insistence of the Polish government-in-exile[citation needed], they were joined by the Liberators of 2 Wing â€“No.31 and No. 34 Squadrons of the South African Air Force based at Foggia in Southern Italy, and Halifaxes, flown by No. 148 and No. 178 RAF Squadrons. The drops by British, Polish and South African forces continued until 21 September. The total weight of allied drops varies according to source (104 tons,[100] 230 tons[99] or 239 tons[16]), over 200 flights were made.[101]"]}}}
