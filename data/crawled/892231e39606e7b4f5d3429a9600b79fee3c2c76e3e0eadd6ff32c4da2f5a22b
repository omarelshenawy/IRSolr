Afterwards, Madonna descended from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants.[87] Then her two back-up dancers appeared on the stage and the three women started singing the song together. The end of the performance was connected to the next song, \"Deeper and Deeper\".[89] According to Guilbert, Madonna was inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1932 film Blonde Venus for the performance.[90] It was included on The Girlie Show â€“ Live Down Under home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993, at Sydney, Australia.[91] \"Express Yourself\" was included in the military segment of the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, with the opening line altered to \"Come on boys!\". She and her dancers were dressed in military gear and performed a rifle choreography, with Madonna acting as a sergeant. As Drew Sterwald from News Press noted, the song in its military version was talking about both personal love, as well as patriotic love.[92] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the song was contravened as cynical, when Madonna sang the line, \"What you need is a big, strong hand/To lift you to your higher ground\", and raised a rifle above her head.[93] Author Dirk Timmerman pointed out that \"in the context of the show, with [war-induced] performances like 'American Life' and 'Imagine', it added to the anti-war message of the tour.\"[94] In 2008, during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, she performed \"Express Yourself\" as the request song in some of her shows, including the show at Madison Square Garden in New York.[95]"],"after":["In 2012, she performed an excerpt of the song at the Super Bowl XLVI Halftime Show with Cee Lo Green and a large marching band.[96] That same year, \"Express Yourself\" was included on the MDNA Tour where it was given a majorette theme and was the opening song of the show's second segment titled Prophecy, where a mix of joyful songs that \"bring people together\" were performed.[97] Madonna appeared onstage and sang the song dressed in a white majorette uniform with ruby-red stripes and knee-high white boots designed by Miu Miu, while her female back-up dancers wore similar costumes in red.[98][99] During the performance she also twirled a baton and walked around the stage leading a group of back-up dancers who played the drums and acted the role of a marching band.[100] Halfway through the song, Madonna sang the chorus of Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\", as the chord progression and melody of \"Born This Way\" was heavily compared to that of \"Express Yourself\" upon its release, many speculated that Madonna was \"dissing\" Gaga and the song. Towards the end of the performance Madonna also sang the chorus of her own song \"She's Not Me\" from her eleventh studio album Hard Candy (2008).[101] Critics were positive towards the performance, Melissa Ruggieri from Access Atlanta felt that by singing the chorus of Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" while performing \"Express Yoruself\", Madonna was \"proving how it swipes the same melody line, then twisted the knife in that perfectly Madonna way by adding the chorus of her own 'She's Not Me'\".[102] The performance was included in the live album MDNA World Tour released on September 6, 2013[103] but the \"Born This Way\" sample was not credited in the album's liner notes.[104]"]}}}
