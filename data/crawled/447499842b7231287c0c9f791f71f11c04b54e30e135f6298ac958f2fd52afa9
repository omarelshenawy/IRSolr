J. Widlar, an engineer who worked for National Semiconductor.[266] In 2008, Google faced accusations in Harper's Magazine of being an \"energy glutton\". The company was accused of employing its \"Don't be evil\" motto and its public energy-saving campaigns to cover up or make up for the massive amounts of energy its servers require.[267]"]}}}
