The show was divided into four sections: Transgression, Prophecy, Masculine/Feminine and Redemption. It began with a cathedral setting, with the Kalakan trio doing religious chanting that morphs into Madonna's name. The dancers dressed in red robes are seen pulling a rope that rings a bell and are seen pushing a giant thurible. The middle screen splits into two, revealing a silhouette of Madonna in a \"glass confession box\" praying. She stands up holding a rifle and \"breaks\" the glass, revealing herself dressed in a tight black suit and starts singing Girl Gone Wild. She is accompanied by her dancers who are wearing outfits similar to that in the music video. The show continues with \"Revolver\" with Madonna's female dancers accompanying her with automatic rifles and Lil' Wayne being featured in the video backdrops.[25] After the song, \"Gang Bang\" is performed in a motel setting where Madonna is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrops. A minimal version of \"Papa Don't Preach\" follows in which her dancers dressed in army pants, boots and masks tie her up, leading into \"Hung Up\" where Madonna utilizes slacklining while her dancers slide under the ropes. Madonna closes the first section performing \"I Don't Give A\" on guitar while Nicki Minaj is seen in the backdrops sitting on a throne. The first video interlude features various tombstones and a man walking through a cemetery while a mashup of \"Best Friend\" and \"Heartbeat\" is performed. The next section kicks off with Madonna dressed as a majorette while performing \"Express Yourself\" with a baton. The song, which features lyrical interpolations from Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" and \"She's Not Me\" from Madonna's 2008 album Hard Candy,[26] breaks down with the Just Blaze Remix of \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" with a marching band that is suspended from the air while Madonna and her female dancers dance with pompoms are dressed as cheerleaders. A short video interlude follows featuring Madonna's previous hits which then leads into \"Turn Up the Radio\" with Madonna on guitar wearing a leather dress and a black beret. \"Open Your Heart\" is performed next with the Kalakan trio being formally introduced to the audience with \"Sagarra Jo\" intertwined with the song. The segment ends with \"Masterpiece\" with clips from W.E. displayed on the screens."]}}}
