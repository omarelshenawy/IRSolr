The mathematical theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between conditional probabilities, as in , and interventional probabilities, as in . The former reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke\" while the latter reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person forced to smoke\". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated directly in observational studies, while the latter is a causal notion (also called \"causal effect\") which is what we estimate in a controlled randomized experiment."],"after":[]}}}
