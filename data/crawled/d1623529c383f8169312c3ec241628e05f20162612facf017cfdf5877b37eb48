He wrote about Walter Scott, Byron and Wordsworth in Fiction, Fair and Foul (1880)[144] and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century (1884),[145] describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin’s Storm-Cloud has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.[146] Ruskin’s prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy."]}}}
