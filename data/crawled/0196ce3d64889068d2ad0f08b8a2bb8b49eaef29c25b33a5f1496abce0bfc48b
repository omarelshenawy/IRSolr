The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector.[334] During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and The Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity.[335] In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés The Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \"college rock\".[336]"]}}}
