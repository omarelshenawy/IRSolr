European integration led to the formation of the Council of Europe and the European Union in Western Europe, both of which have been expanding eastward since the revolutions of 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The European Union nowadays has growing influence over its member countries. Many European countries are members of the Schengen Area, which abolishes border and immigration controls among its members."],"after":["","The use of the term \"Europe\" has developed gradually throughout history.[10][11] In antiquity, the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the River Phasis forming their boundariesâ€”though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[12] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[13] The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[14]"]}}}
