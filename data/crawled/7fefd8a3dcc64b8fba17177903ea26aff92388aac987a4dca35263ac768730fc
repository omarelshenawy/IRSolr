Using geometry, Ibn al-Haytham mathematically demonstrated that place (al-makan) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[30] According to Ahmad Dallal, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī also states that \"there is no observable evidence that rules out the possibility of vacuum\".[31] The suction pump later appeared in Europe from the 15th century.[32][33][34]"],"after":["Medieval thought experiments into the idea of a vacuum considered whether a vacuum was present, if only for an instant, between two flat plates when they were rapidly separated.[35] There was much discussion of whether the air moved in quickly enough as the plates were separated, or, as Walter Burley postulated, whether a 'celestial agent' prevented the vacuum arising. The commonly held view that nature abhorred a vacuum was called horror vacui. Speculation that even God could not create a vacuum if he wanted to was shut down[clarification needed] by the 1277 Paris condemnations of Bishop Etienne Tempier, which required there to be no restrictions on the powers of God, which led to the conclusion that God could create a vacuum if he so wished.[20] Jean Buridan reported in the 14th century that teams of ten horses could not pull open bellows when the port was sealed.[24]"]}}}
