Atkins also mentions that \"around 1980 I had a tape of nothing but Kraftwerk, Telex, Devo, Giorgio Moroder and Gary Numan, and I'd ride around in my car playing it.\"[24] Atkins has also claimed he was unaware of Kraftwerk's music prior to his collaboration with Richard \"3070\" Davis as Cybotron, which was two years after he had first started experimenting with electronic instruments.[25] Regarding his initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins notes that they were \"clean and precise\" relative to the \"weird UFO sounds\" featured in his seemingly \"psychedelic\" music.[26]"]}}}
