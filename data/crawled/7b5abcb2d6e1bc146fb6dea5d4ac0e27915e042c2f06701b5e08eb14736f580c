Historically, the private school system began largely as a result of Christian mission efforts during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In schools, a student may initially receive two levels of education; basic education (years 1 to 9), and upper secondary (years 10 to 12). Some schools provide a \"basic\" education covering years 1 to 9, as year 9 is considered to be a decent level of education for the majority of children. UNESCO estimated that 80% of children of primary school age in 2002 were enrolled.[62]"]}}}
