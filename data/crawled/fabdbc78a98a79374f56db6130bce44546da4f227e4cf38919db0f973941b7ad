For example, both the range and kernel of a linear mapping are subspaces, and are thus often called the range space and the nullspace; these are important examples of subspaces. Another important way of forming a subspace is to take a linear combination of a set of vectors v1, v2, …, vk:"],"after":["where a1, a2, …, ak are scalars. The set of all linear combinations of vectors v1, v2, …, vk is called their span, which forms a subspace."]}}}
