However, many of the settlers were not from Scandinavia, but descendants of Norse settlers in the Irish Sea. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, Orkney, or Shetland often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. As a result, the Irish language has had some influence on both Faroese and Icelandic. There is some debatable evidence of Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of Mykines, Stóra Dímun and Lítla Dímun have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: \"blak/blaðak\" (buttermilk), cf. Middle Irish bláthach; \"drunnur\" (tail-piece of an animal), cf. Middle Irish dronn; \"grúkur\" (head, headhair), cf. Middle Irish gruaig; \"lámur\" (hand, paw), cf. Middle Irish lámh; \"tarvur\" (bull), cf. Middle Irish tarbh; and \"ærgi\" (pasture in the outfield), cf. Middle Irish áirge.[5]"],"after":["Between the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was probably still mutually intelligible with Old West Norse, and remained similar to the Norn language of Orkney and Shetland during Norn's earlier phase."]}}}
