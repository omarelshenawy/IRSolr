In the first decades of the XX century there was even a huge struggle (inside Malta's society and politics) because of the \"language problem\", that culminated in WWII: in 1933 the Constitution was withdrawn over the Government's budgetary vote for the teaching of Italian in elementary schools.[4] Although only the rich could speak Italian (it was however understood by nearly all the population) and with Maltese being generally spoken by those less well off, Italian was regarded as the official language."]}}}
