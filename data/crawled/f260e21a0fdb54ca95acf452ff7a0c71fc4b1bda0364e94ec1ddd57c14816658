The periodic table is arranged in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows. The periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends.[42]"],"after":["A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.[43] The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system.[44] Inorganic compounds are named according to the inorganic nomenclature system.[45] In addition the Chemical Abstracts Service has devised a method to index chemical substances. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its CAS registry number."]}}}
