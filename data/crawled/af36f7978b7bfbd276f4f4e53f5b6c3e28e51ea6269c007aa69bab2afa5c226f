Davis addressed the issue in an interview, pointing out that many Hollywood wives earned more than their husbands, but the situation proved difficult for Nelson, who refused to allow Davis to purchase a house until he could afford to pay for it himself.[14] Davis had several abortions during the marriage.[15]"],"after":["After more than 20Â film roles, the role of the vicious and slatternly Mildred Rogers in the RKO Radio production of Of Human Bondage (1934), a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel, earned Davis her first major critical acclaim. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her co-star, Leslie Howard, was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed his attitude changed and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. The director, John Cromwell, allowed her relative freedom, and commented, \"I let Bette have her head. I trusted her instincts.\" She insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, \"the last stages of consumption, poverty and neglect are not pretty and I intended to be convincing-looking.\"[16]"]}}}
