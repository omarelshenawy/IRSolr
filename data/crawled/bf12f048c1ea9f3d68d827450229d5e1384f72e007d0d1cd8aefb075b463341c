Still in other films that did not directly intend to parody the subject matter, other reviewers have found elements of the est movement as applied to the genre of fictional self-help films. The 1977 movie Semi-Tough, starring Burt Reynolds, parodied the est training.[25] Bert Convy played \"Frederick Bismark,\" a caricature of Werner Erhard. Bismark's organization and its training went by the name \"B.E.A.T.\", which stands for: \"Bismark Earthwalk Action Training.\" A form of Rolfing was also parodied in the film, and Lotte Lenya's character \"Clara Pelf\" was described as: \"a Rolf like masseuse.\"[24] The press caught on to this satire of Erhard in the film, and gave these sections of the film positive reviews. The Wall Street Journal did not give an overall positive review, but did appreciate the portions where Werner Erhard was parodied: \"The movie isn't much - an erratic ramble - But it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of The self-improvement guru Werner Erhard.\"[26] The Charlotte Observer praised Bert Convy's portrayal of the self-help guru Frederick Bismark, writing: \"Bert Convy is a hilariously smug consciousness-raiser with a more than passing resemblance to EST's Werner Erhard.\"[27] After the film's release, Bert Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences when he attended an est training seminar in preparation for his role as Frederick Bismark. During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. She related to Convy that Erhard was \"pleased\" with the role, and she wished him success in the film. However, Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to go easy on his parody of Erhard in the film.[24]"],"after":["The Grove Book of Hollywood wrote that the 1978 film, The Wiz was influenced by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were \"very enamored of Werner Erhard.\"[24] The film's producer Rob Cohen noted that: \"before I knew it, the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing who you are and sharing and all that. I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with Diana because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars.\"[24] Schumacher spoke positively of the results of the est training, saying: \"I will be eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life,\" however he also complained that: \"Everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bullshit.\"[24] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was \"a litany of est-like platitudes,\" and the book also makes est comparisons to the song \"Believe in Yourself.\"[24]"]}}}
