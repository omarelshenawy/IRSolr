This investigation followed the work on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898.[50] Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 \"Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society\", under Professor William Sollas and lead the expedition in 1897.[51] Photographers on these trips recorded people, communities, and scenes at Funafuti.[52]"]}}}
