Much of this was accomplished at the behest of Motown chief Berry Gordy and Maxine Powell, who ran Motown's in-house finishing school and Artist Development department.[34] Unlike many of her contemporaries, Ross sang in a thin, calm voice, and her vocal styling was matched by having all three women embellish their femininity instead of imitate the qualities of male groups. Eschewing plain appearances and basic dance routines, the Supremes appeared onstage in detailed make-up and high-fashion gowns and wigs, and performed graceful choreography created by Motown choreographer Cholly Atkins. Powell told the group to \"be prepared to perform before kings and queens.\"[34] Gordy wanted the Supremes, like all of his performers, to be equally appealing to black and white audiences,[35] and he sought to erase the image of black performers as being unrefined or lacking class."]}}}
