The network's 24-hour cable network, MSNBC, joined the network in New York on that day as well. The new studios/headquarters for NBC News and MSNBC are now located in one area.[citation needed]"],"after":["On March 27, 2012, NBC News broadcast an edited segment from a 911 call placed by George Zimmerman before he shot Trayvon Martin. The editing made it appear that Zimmerman volunteered that Martin was black, rather than merely responding to the dispatcher's inquiry, which would support a view that the shooting was racially motivated. A media watchdog organization accused NBC News of engaging in \"an all-out falsehood.\" While NBC News initially declined to comment,[20] the news agency did issue an apology to viewers.[21] The Washington Post called the statement \"skimpy on the details on just how the mistake unfolded.\"[21]"]}}}
