Liberia is one of the world's poorest countries, with a formal employment rate of 15%.[50] GDP per capita peaked in 1980 at US$496, when it was comparable to Egypt's (at the time).[61] In 2011, the country's nominal GDP was US$1.154 billion, while nominal GDP per capita stood at US$297, the third-lowest in the world.[3] Historically, the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid, foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore, rubber and timber.[39]"]}}}
