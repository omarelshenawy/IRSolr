He performed often as a pianist, notably in a competition before the Emperor with Muzio Clementi on 24 December 1781,[48] and he soon \"had established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna\".[48] He also prospered as a composer, and in 1782 completed the opera Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\"), which premiered on 16 July 1782 and achieved a huge success. The work was soon being performed \"throughout German-speaking Europe\",[48] and fully established Mozart's reputation as a composer."],"after":["Near the height of his quarrels with Colloredo, Mozart moved in with the Weber family, who had moved to Vienna from Mannheim. The father, Fridolin, had died, and the Webers were now taking in lodgers to make ends meet.[50] Aloysia, who had earlier rejected Mozart's suit, was now married to the actor and artist Joseph Lange. Mozart's interest shifted to the third Weber daughter, Constanze. The courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly separated in April 1782.[51] Mozart faced a very difficult task in getting his father's permission for the marriage.[52] The couple were finally married on 4 August 1782 in St. Stephen's Cathedral, the day before his father's consent arrived in the mail.[52]"]}}}
