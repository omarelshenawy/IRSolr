Well traveled and clever, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was typically dressed elegantly. Many, however, remarked that Willis was effeminate, Europeanized, and guilty of \"Miss Nancyism\". One editor called him \"an impersonal passive verb—a pronoun of the feminine gender\".[43] A contemporary caricature depicted him wearing a fashionable beaver hat and tightly closed coat and carrying a cane, reflecting Willis's wide reputation as a \"dandy\".[97] Willis put considerable effort into his appearance and his fashion sense, presenting himself as a member of an upcoming American aristocracy.[98] As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. once said, Willis was \"something between a remembrance of Count D'Orsay and an anticipation of Oscar Wilde\".[99] Publisher Charles Frederick Briggs once wrote that \"Willis was too Willisy\".[100] He described his writings as the \"novelty and gossip of the hour\" and was not necessarily concerned about facts but with the \"material of conversation and speculation, which may be mere rumor, may be the truth\".[101] Willis's behavior in social groups annoyed fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. \"He is too artificial\", Longfellow wrote to his friend George Washington Greene. \"And his poetry has now lost one of its greatest charms for me—its sincerity\".[102] E. Burke Fisher, a journalist in Pittsburgh, wrote that \"Willis is a kind of national pet and we must regard his faults as we do those of a spoiled stripling, in the hope that he will amend\".[103]"]}}}
