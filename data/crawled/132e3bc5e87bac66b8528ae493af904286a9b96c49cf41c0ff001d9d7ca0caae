On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery, and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.[87] Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.[88] As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.[89] Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.[89]"]}}}
