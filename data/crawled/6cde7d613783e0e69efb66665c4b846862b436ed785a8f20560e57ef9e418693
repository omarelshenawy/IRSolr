After performing in Europe, she travelled to Melbourne, where she was diagnosed with breast cancer and was forced to cancel the tour.[88] She resumed the tour in November 2006 with a performance in Sydney. Her dance routines had been reworked to accommodate her medical condition, and slower costume changes and longer breaks were introduced between sections of the show to conserve her strength.[89] The media reported that Minogue performed energetically, with the Sydney Morning Herald describing the show as an \"extravaganza\" and \"nothing less than a triumph\".[90]"],"after":["In November 2007, Minogue released her tenth studio album and much-discussed \"comeback\" album, X.[91] The electro-styled album included contributions from Guy Chambers, Cathy Dennis, Bloodshy & Avant and Calvin Harris.[91] The album received some criticism for the triviality of its subject matter in light of Minogue's experiences with breast cancer. X and the lead single, \"2 Hearts\" entered at number one on the Australian albums and singles charts respectively.[92][93] In the United Kingdom, X initially attracted lukewarm sales,[91] although its commercial performance eventually improved.[94] Follow-up singles from the album, \"In My Arms\" and \"Wow\" both peaked inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. In the US, the album was nominated at the 2009 Grammy Awards for Best Electronic/Dance Album.[95]"]}}}
