Branching off the Main Line at Polgahawela Junction the line heads north through North Western, North Central and Northern provinces before terminating at the northern port of Kankesanthurai. The line is 339 kilometres (211Â mi) long and has 55 stations between Polgahawela Junction and Vavuniya.[1] It is the longest railway line in Sri Lanka.[1] The line opened in 1894. Major cities served by the line include Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Vavuniya and Jaffna. The popular Yarl Devi service operates on the line. The line was severely affected by the civil war and no services operated north of Vavuniya between 1990 and 2009. In a 2012 article, Zee News referred to the line as part of a \"vanished railway network.\"[2] Reconstruction of this section of the line commenced following the end of the civil war in 2009.
