Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.[14] The The New York Times article reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\"[14] The New York Times reports that Mr. Moller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile,\" out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[14]"]}}}
