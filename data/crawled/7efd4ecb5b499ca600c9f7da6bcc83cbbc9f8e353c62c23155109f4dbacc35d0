Use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses () in a conductor are a product of the square of the current (I) and the resistance (R) of the conductor, described by the formula"],"after":["This means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire, if the current is doubled, the power loss will be four times greater."]}}}
