Dually, a similar idea can be applied to maps","More generally, given a set S, specifying the set of continuous functions"],"after":["This is an instance of a universal property.","Various other mathematical domains use the concept of continuity in different, but related meanings. For example, in order theory, an order-preserving function f: X â†’ Y between two complete lattices X and Y (particular types of partially ordered sets) is continuous if for each subset A of X, we have sup(f(A)) = f(sup(A)). Here sup is the supremum with respect to the orderings in X and Y, respectively. Applying this to the complete lattice consisting of the open subsets of a topological space, this gives back the notion of continuity for maps between topological spaces."]}}}
