If we assume by contradiction that a := p(z0) ≠ 0, then, expanding p(z) in powers of z − z0 we can write"],"after":["Here, the cj are simply the coefficients of the polynomial z → p(z + z0), and we let k be the index of the first coefficient following the constant term that is non-zero. But now we see that for z sufficiently close to z0 this has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial , in the sense that (as is easy to check) the function is bounded by some positive constant M in some neighborhood of z0. Therefore if we define and let , then for any sufficiently small positive number r (so that the bound M mentioned above holds), using the triangle inequality we see that"]}}}
