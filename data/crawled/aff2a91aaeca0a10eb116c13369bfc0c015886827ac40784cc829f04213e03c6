Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict.[22] In 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis;[16] however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country's revolution.[23]"]}}}
