A conductor labeled \"political boss\" leads a lone female soloist surrounded by a male chorus with various labels including \"procurer\", \"child labor employer\", and \"sweat shop owner\". Arguments in favor of granting women the right to vote included the contention that female voters would support laws that reduced prostitution, labor abuses, and other perceived social evils. The fight for women's suffrage in the United States began in the 1830s, and concluded with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on August 18, 1920."]}}}
