Other names given to the activity of breaking ship into smaller pieces to recycle various materials include ship dismantling, ship recycling, ship disposal, ship de-commissioning etc. Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair become uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be recycled. Equipment on board the vessel can also be reused."]}}}
