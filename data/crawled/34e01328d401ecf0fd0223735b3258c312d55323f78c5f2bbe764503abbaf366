This technique is referred to a \"sampling\". Most samplers designate a part of the sample for each component of the ADSR envelope, repeating that section while changing the volume according to the envelope. This allows samplers to vary the envelope while playing the same note. See also Wavetable synthesis, Vector synthesis."]}}}
