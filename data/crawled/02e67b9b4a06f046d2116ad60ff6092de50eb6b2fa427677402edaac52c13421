Their unique style, rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also come to incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, glam, and R&B, which has inspired legions of rock artists that came after them. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with singer Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. By 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston."]}}}
