Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences, including Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, and Jewish.[239] Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World with the introduction of items such as potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.[240][241] Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,[242][243][244] abundance of difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world,[245] wielding strong influence abroad.[246]"]}}}
