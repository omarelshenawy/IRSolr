The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City.[194] The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movie–inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.[195]"],"after":["Leave Home, the Ramones' second album, had come out in January.[196] The Dead Boys' debut LP, Young, Loud and Snotty, was released at the end of August.[197] October saw two more debut albums from the scene: Richard Hell and The Voidoids' first full-length, Blank Generation, and the Heartbreakers' L.A.M.F.[198] One track on the latter exemplified both the scene's close-knit character and the popularity of heroin within it: \"Chinese Rocks\"—the title refers to a strong form of the drug—was written by Dee Dee Ramone and Hell, both users, as were the Heartbreakers' Thunders and Nolan.[199] (During the Heartbreakers' 1976 and 1977 tours of Britain, Thunders played a central role in popularizing heroin among the punk crowd there, as well.)[200] The Ramones' third album, Rocket to Russia, appeared in November 1977.[201]"]}}}
