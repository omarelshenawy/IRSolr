Johnston became involved in the development of the Fat Man plutonium bomb. Because of the high level of spontaneous fission in reactor plutonium, it was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of the metal and compress it quickly into a much smaller and denser core using explosives, a technical challenge at the time.[10]"]}}}
