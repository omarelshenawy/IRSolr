They were published anonymously and heavily edited, with conventionalized punctuation and formal titles.[117] The first poem, \"Nobody knows this little rose\", may have been published without Dickinson's permission.[118] The Republican also published \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\" as \"The Snake\", \"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers –\" as \"The Sleeping\", and \"Blazing in the Gold and quenching in Purple\" as \"Sunset\".[119][120] The poem \"I taste a liquor never brewed –\" is an example of the edited versions; the last two lines in the first stanza were completely rewritten.[119]"]}}}
