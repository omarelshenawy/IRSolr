Fire-signals, for example, or smoke-signals, are known from the pre-exilic Lachish ostraca.[53] Furthermore, the Mishnah contains laws that reflect the uncertainties of an empirical calendar. Mishnah Sanhedrin, for example, holds that when one witness holds that an event took place on a certain day of the month, and another that the same event took place on the following day, their testimony can be held to agree, since the length of the preceding month was uncertain.[54] Another Mishnah takes it for granted that it cannot be known in advance whether a year's lease is for twelve or thirteen months.[55] Hence it is a reasonable conclusion that the Mishnaic calendar was actually used in the Mishnaic period."]}}}
