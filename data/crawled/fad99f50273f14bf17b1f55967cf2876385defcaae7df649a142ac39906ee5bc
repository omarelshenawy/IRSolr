I am currently an elected member of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees (related ideas). To reach me: talk page messages will receive the fastest response. If you have suggestions about how to improve aspects of the Projects or Wikimedia as a whole, please share them on the Meta wiki. You can also send me email (meta.sj@gmail), or in a pinch, reach me by phone: +1 (617) 529 4266."],"after":["I am a Wikipedian, a one laptop per child director and community organizer, a Crimson mathematics and physics geek, a compulsive proofreader, and a long-time Bostonian. I think Wikipedia Zero is the best thing since Wikipedia One. In 2008 I edited How Wikipedia Works (published with no starch[1]), a GFDL book aimed at reducing community barriers to entry for new Wikipedians. I love curiositate. My brother Sebastian Gray is my inspiration.Â :-) See my blog, SJ's Longest Now, for more. My current favorite page is the Wikipedia:Backlog. I am currently working on Matchery to help groups improving the open Internet find legal help in all jurisdictions. I have been a Wikipedian since early 2004, when WP officially became more interesting and instructive than Universities and coursebooks. I am an administrator here and on the Nahuatl and Swahili Wikipedias, and was a steward for the other Wikimedia projects for some years; if you need assistance with a small project that does not currently have active administrators, you can ask me for help or find a steward or global sysop."]}}}
