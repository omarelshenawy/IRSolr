Following the secret Treaty of Bucharest, according to which Romania would acquire territories with a majority of Romanian population from Austria-Hungary, it joined the Entente Powers and declared war on 27 August 1916.[72] The Romanian military campaign began disastrously for Romania as the Central Powers occupied two-thirds of the country within months, before reaching a stalemate in 1917. Total military and civilian losses from 1916 to 1918, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.[73] After the war, the transfer of Bukovina from Austria was acknowledged by the 1919 Treaty of Saint Germain,[74] of Banat and Transylvania from Hungary by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon,[75] and of Bessarabia from Russian rule by the 1920 Treaty of Paris.[76]"]}}}
