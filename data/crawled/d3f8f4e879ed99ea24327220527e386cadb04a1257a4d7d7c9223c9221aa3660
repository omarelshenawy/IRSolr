The expression comes from line 284 of book 3 of Virgil's Georgics,[1] where it appears as FUGIT INREPARABILE TEMPUS: \"it escapes, irretrievable time\". The phrase is used in both its Latin and English forms as a proverb that \"time's a-wasting\". Tempus fugit, however, is typically employed as an admonition against sloth and procrastination (cf. carpe diem) rather than a motto in favor of licentiousness (cf. \"gather ye rosebuds while ye may\"); the English form is often merely descriptive: \"time flies like the wind\", \"time flies when you're having fun\"."]}}}
