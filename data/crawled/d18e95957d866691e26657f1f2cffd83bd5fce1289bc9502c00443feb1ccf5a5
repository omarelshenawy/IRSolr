But now we see that for z sufficiently close to z0 this has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial , in the sense that (as is easy to check) the function is bounded by some positive constant M in some neighborhood of z0. Therefore if we define and let , then for any sufficiently small positive number r (so that the bound M mentioned above holds), using the triangle inequality we see that"],"after":["When r is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for |p(z)| is strictly smaller than |a|, in contradiction to the definition of z0. (Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction θ0 such that if one approaches z0 from that direction one can obtain values p(z) smaller in absolute value than |p(z0)|.)"]}}}
