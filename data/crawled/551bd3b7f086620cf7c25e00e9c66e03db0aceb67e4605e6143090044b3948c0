All educated Bavarians and Austrians, however, can read, write and understand Standard German, but may have very little opportunity to speak it, especially in rural areas. In those regions, Standard German is restricted to use as the language of writing and the media. It is therefore often referred to as Schriftdeutsch (\"written German\") rather than the usual term Hochdeutsch (\"High German\" or \"Standard German\")."]}}}
