Following their 1882 invasion and occupation of Egypt, the British began construction in 1898. The project was designed by Sir William Willcocks and involved several eminent engineers of the time, including Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Aird, whose firm, John Aird & Co., was the main contractor.[32][33] Capital and financing were furnished by Ernest Cassel.[34] When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted;[35] on completion, it was the largest masonry dam in the world.[36]"]}}}
