Beat! Drums!\" as a patriotic rally call for the North.[63] Whitman's brother George had joined the Union army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front.[64] On December 16, 1862, a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the New York Tribune included \"First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore\", which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George.[65] He made his way south immediately to find him, though his wallet was stolen on the way.[66] \"Walking all day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying to get access to big people\", Whitman later wrote,[67] he eventually found George alive, with only a superficial wound on his cheek.[65] Whitman, profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs, left for Washington on December 28, 1862 with the intention of never returning to New York.[66]"]}}}
