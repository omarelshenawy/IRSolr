The classical Greek writers, like Herodotus, called it 'the Red Sea'. In Babylonian texts it was known as 'the sea above Akkad'."],"after":["The name of the gulf, historically and internationally known as the Persian Gulf after the land of Persia (Iran), has been disputed by some Arab countries since the 1960s.[12] Rivalry between Iran and some Arab states, along with the emergence of pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism, has seen the name Arabian Gulf become predominant in most Arab countries.[13][14] Names beyond these two have also been applied to or proposed for this body of water."]}}}
