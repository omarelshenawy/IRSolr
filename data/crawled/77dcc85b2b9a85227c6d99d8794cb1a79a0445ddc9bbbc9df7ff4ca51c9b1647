Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published occasionally such as for business travel trends and the Olympics; other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA Basketball Tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but now use the sports red in their bonus sections. On days featuring bonus sections or business holidays, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. The stock tables were discontinued after the last redesign in 2012 due to the myriad electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers. Gannett's television stations also now mainly use the USA Today coloring scheme in the company's newest graphics package, which was introduced in late 2012."],"after":["In many ways, USA Today is set up to break the typical newspaper layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages[10]), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside. As a national newspaper, USA Today cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps and temperature lists for the entire United States and many cities throughout the world, with data provided by The Weather Channel meteorologists. In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is a graphic called \"Weather Focus\", which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event. On Mondays, the Money section uses its back page to present an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly, monthly, and weekly movements against the S&P 500. Like most national papers, USA Today does not carry comic strips."]}}}
