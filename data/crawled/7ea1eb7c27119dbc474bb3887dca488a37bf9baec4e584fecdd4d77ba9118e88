[of] the best band in the world\".[104] The group's tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, was released in October 2000 and was produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. The record signaled a return to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound for the group mixed with the influences of their 1990s musical explorations.[105] For many of those not won over by the band's 1990s music, it was considered a return to grace;[106] Rolling Stone called it U2's \"third masterpiece\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.[107] The album debuted at number one in 32 countries,[108] and its worldwide hit single, \"Beautiful Day\", earned three Grammy Awards. The album's other three singles, \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\", \"Elevation\" and \"Walk On\", also won Grammy Awards."]}}}
