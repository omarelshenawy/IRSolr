Due to their large markets, growing military strength, economic potential, and influence in international affairs, China,[47][48][49] the European Union,[50][51] and India[52][53][54] are among the countries (or political entities) most cited as having the potential of achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Many historians, writers, and critics have expressed doubts, however, whether any of these countries would ever emerge as a new superpower.[55][56] Some political scientists and other commentators have even suggested that such countries might simply be emerging powers, as opposed to potential superpowers.[57] More to the point, a country would need to achieve great power status first, before they could develop superpower status, and it could be disputed whether some of the countries listed above (e.g., India) are presently even great powers, emerging or not.[citation needed]"]}}}
