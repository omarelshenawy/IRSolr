Imaginary time is not imaginary in the sense that it is unreal or made-up â€” it simply runs in a direction different from the type of time we experience. In essence, imaginary time is a way of looking at the time dimension as if it were a dimension of space: you can move forward and backward along imaginary time, just like you can move right and left in space."]}}}
