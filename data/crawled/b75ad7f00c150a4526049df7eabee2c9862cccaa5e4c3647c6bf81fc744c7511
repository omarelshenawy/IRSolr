When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed sometimes is uplifted enough to cause a tsunami. The shaking in earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally volcanic activity.

The field also includes studies of earthquake effects, such as tsunamis as well as diverse seismic sources such as volcanic, tectonic, and artificial processes (explosions). A related field that uses geology to infer information regarding past earthquakes is paleoseismology."]}}}
