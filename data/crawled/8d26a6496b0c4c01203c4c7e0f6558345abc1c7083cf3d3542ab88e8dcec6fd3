Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading Financial Centre of the world.[32] In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares.[33]"]}}}
