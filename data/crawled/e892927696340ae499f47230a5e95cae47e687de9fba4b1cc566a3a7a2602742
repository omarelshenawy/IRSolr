He played in New Orleans around 1895â€“1906, before developing a mental illness; there are no recordings of him playing. Bolden's band is credited with creating the big four, the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march.[72] As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm."],"after":[]}}}
