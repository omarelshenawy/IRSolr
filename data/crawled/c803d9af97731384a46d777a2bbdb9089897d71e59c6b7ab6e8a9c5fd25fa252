The predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a strong military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes.[130] 22 EU members are members of NATO[131] while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.[132] The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the EU.[133]"]}}}
