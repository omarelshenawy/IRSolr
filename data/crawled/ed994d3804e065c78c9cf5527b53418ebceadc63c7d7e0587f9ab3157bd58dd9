Sandwich bread may be formulated to slice easily,[8] cleanly or uniformly, and may have a fine crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a light texture.[4] Sandwich bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness.[3][4] Some may be designed to not become crumbly, hardened, dried or have too squishy of a texture.[2][9] Sandwich bread can refer to cross-sectionally square, sliced white and wheat bread, which has been described as \"perfectly designed for holding square luncheon meat\".[10] The bread used for preparing finger sandwiches is sometimes referred to as sandwich bread.[10] Pan de molde is a sandwich loaf.[11][12] Some sandwich breads are designed for use in the creation of specific types of sandwiches, such as the submarine sandwich.[13] For barbecuing, use of a high-quality white sandwich bread has been described as suitable for toasting over a fire.[14] Gluten-free sandwich bread may be prepared using gluten-free flour, teff flour.[15][16] and other ingredients."]}}}
