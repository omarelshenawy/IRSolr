Fraser and Navarro write that it is doubtful that Evita ever expressed a wish to be embalmed, and suggest that it was most likely Juan Perón's decision. Dr. Ara was a professor of anatomy who had studied in Vienna and maintained an academic career in Madrid. His work was occasionally referred to as \"the art of death.\" His highly advanced embalming technique consisted of replacing the corpse's blood with glycerine, which preserved all organs including the brain and created a lifelike appearance, giving the body the appearance of \"artistically rendered sleep.\" Dr. Ara was known in Buenos Aires society for his work. Among the people he had embalmed was Spanish composer Manuel de Falla.[53] Dr. Ara claims that his embalming of Evita's corpse began on the night of her death and that by the next morning, \"the body of Eva Perón was completely and infinitely incorruptible\" and suitable for display to the public.[54]"]}}}
