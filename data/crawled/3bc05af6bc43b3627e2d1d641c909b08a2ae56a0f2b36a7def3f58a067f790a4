The musical style began in 1970s New York City with the innovations of such pioneers as Kool DJ Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Grandwizard Theodore, Afrika Bambaataa, and DJ Hollywood. The notable elements of the culture are rapping, DJing/production, graffiti, breakdancing, and beatboxing. It originates in the African American, Afro-Caribbean and Latino American communities of New York City (with the South Bronx as the center) in the late 1970s. It was DJ Afrika Bambaataa that outlined the five pillars of hip-hop culture: MCing, DJing, breaking, graffiti writing, and knowledge. Other elements include beatboxing, hip hop fashion, and slang. Since first emerging in the Bronx, the lifestyle of hip hop culture has spread around the world. When hip hop music began to emerge, it was based around disc jockeys who created rhythmic beats by looping breaks (small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern) on two turntables, which is now more commonly referred to as sampling. This was later accompanied by \"rapping\" (a rhythmic style of chanting or poetry more formally in 16 bar measures or time frames) and beatboxing, a vocal technique mainly used to imitate percussive elements of the music and various technical effects of hip hop DJs. An original form of dancing and particular styles of dress arose among followers of this new music. These elements experienced considerable refinement and development over the course of the history of the culture."]}}}
