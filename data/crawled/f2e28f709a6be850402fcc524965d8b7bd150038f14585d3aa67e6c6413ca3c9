Actress Alice Krige portrays \"Alma\" the seminar leader of \"The Plan\" - who uses jargon related to the \"blueprint\" for building a house in order to convey concepts about self-improvement. She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for \"tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up.\" Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do \"homework\" from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for \"all the terrible things she did to me\", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will \"renovate\" her life. During the following day of \"The Plan\", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to \"renovate their homes\" together. In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for \"knocking down her old house\", and proceeds to tell her that now she can rebuild a new house.[46]"]}}}
