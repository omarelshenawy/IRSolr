The widespread use of red brick characterises the city, much of the architecture of which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade.[22] Just outside the immediate city centre is a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in England.[100]"]}}}
