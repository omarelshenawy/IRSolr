The first two lines list the standard 29 runes, i.e. the 24 derived from Elder Futhark, and the five standard additional ones (á, æ, ý, io, ea). The listing order of the final two of the \"elder\" 24 runes is dæg, éðel. A peculiarity is the \"asterisk\" shape of eolh. The third line lists gar and kalc(?) before a doodling repetition of other runes."]}}}
