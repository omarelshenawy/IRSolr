A typical dish is based on cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu (cous-cous). This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients.[143] Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions.[144] Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper, and Maggi.[145][146][147]"]}}}
