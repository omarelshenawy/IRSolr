The example generalizes and one may compute ζ(2n), for any positive integer n."],"after":["In engineering, particularly when the variable x represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a frequency domain representation. Square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies."]}}}
