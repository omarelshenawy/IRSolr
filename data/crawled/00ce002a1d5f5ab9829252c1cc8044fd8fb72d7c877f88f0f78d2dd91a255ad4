Although the origins of music videos date back much further, they came into prominence in the 1980s, when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including \"illustrated song\", \"filmed insert\", \"promotional (promo) film\", \"promotional clip\", \"promotional video\", \"song video\", \"song clip\" or \"film clip\"."]}}}
