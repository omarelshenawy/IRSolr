In 1980, Isaac Asimov wrote a short story called \"The Year of the Action\", concerning whether the action of Pirates took place on 1 March 1873, or 1 March 1877 (depending on whether Gilbert took into account the fact that 1900 was not a leap year).[148] The plot of Laurie R. King's 2011 novel Pirate King centers on a 1924 silent movie adaption of The Pirates of Penzance.[149]"]}}}
