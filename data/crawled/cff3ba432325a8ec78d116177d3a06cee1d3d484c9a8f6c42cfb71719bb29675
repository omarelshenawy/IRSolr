The three institutions and their lists are the UN list (shown above), the CIA[14] list and the FTSE Group's list, whose list is not included because its association of developed countries with countries with both high incomes and developed markets is not deemed as directly relevant here.[Note 3] However many institutions have created lists which are sometimes referred to when people are discussing developed countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) identifies 37 \"advanced economies\",[15][16] The OECD, also widely known as the \"developed countries club\"[17][18][19] has 34 members. The World Bank identifies 74 \"high income countries\". The EIU's Quality-of-life survey and a list of countries with welfare states are also included here. The criteria for using all these lists and for countries' inclusion on these lists are often not properly spelt out, and several of these lists are based on old data."],"after":["According to the International Monetary Fund the following 37 economies are classified as \"advanced economies\":[15]"]}}}
