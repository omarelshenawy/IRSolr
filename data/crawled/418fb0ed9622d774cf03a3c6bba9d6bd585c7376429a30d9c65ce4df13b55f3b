If this necessary condition is satisfied, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes. The picture below illustrates this with q = 9: the numbers are \"wrapped around\" as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed. Primes are highlighted in red. The rows (=progressions) starting with a = 3, 6, or 9 contain at most one prime number. In all other rows (a = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) there are infinitely many prime numbers. What is more, the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run—the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6."],"after":["The Green–Tao theorem shows that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions consisting of primes.[28] An odd prime p is expressible as the sum of two squares, p = x2 + y2, exactly if p is congruent 1 modulo 4 (Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares)."]}}}
