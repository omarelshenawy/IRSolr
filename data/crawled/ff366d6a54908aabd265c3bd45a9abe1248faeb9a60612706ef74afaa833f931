Currently, these are estimated at about 50,000 people.[88] After the failed liberal revolution of 1848 in the German states,[85][89] a noticeable German immigration took place, laying the foundation for the German-Chilean community. Sponsored by the Chilean government to \"unbarbarize\" and colonize the southern region,[85] these Germans (including German-speaking Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians) settled mainly in Valdivia, Chiloé and Los Ángeles.[90]"]}}}
