Records announced Madonna as one of the seventeen headliners performing at Wembley Stadium for the London stop of the Live Earth concerts. It is still the only venue where Madonna has performed the song.[5] Madonna's set list was the last performance of the London leg before the concert moved to New York City. \"Hey You\" was the first of the set list which consisted of a total of four songs.[20] It was also used as the bridging music between the bands performing at Wembley. The performance started with the symbolic turning-off of lights of the stadium which plunged it into darkness except for the lights on the stage and that from the cameras. Actor Terence Stamp who compered the show, declared \"Let’s not be endarkened by this, let's be enlighteened by this. Let it be the beginning of an adventure!\"[21] Madonna came out on the stage wearing a black satin leotard[22] accompanied by a long line of children in school uniform.[23] The children were compared to the Hogwarts school choir from the Harry Potter series by The New York Times.[12] Madonna started singing the song while holding the amplifier in her hand. The backdrop imitated the song's message by displaying a procession of images of environmental devastations like fires, nuclear power plants, suffering animals—which altered with images of visionary leaders like Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Mahatma Gandhi, and current political leaders like George W. Bush, Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy.[7] The video progressed to display the image of underdressed but nonetheless festive African children tossing a globe into the air, where it resolved into an image of the Earth as seen from space.[7] The idea of the video was to transpose the images of the world leaders with natural disasters.[21] The lyrics of the song were also projected as supertitles.[8] Backing vocals were provided by the children. The performance ended with Madonna and the kids coming in front of the stage and saluting the crowd.[24] This backdrop was created by Johan Söderberg and Marcus Lindkvist to support Live Earth. The performance saw an increase in Madonna's digital and album sales. HMV reported that sales of Madonna's 1990 greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection doubled up than that from the previous week of the performance. Also, there was an increase in the downloads of \"Hey You\" from the retailers.[25]"]}}}
