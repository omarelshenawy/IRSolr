The first step concerns the calculation of a 3rd order fitting polynomial of the SIMS profile (eq.1). The second stage regards the determination of the saturation layer, i.e. its depth and concentration. The whole computing processing is embedded in stand-alone software created in Matlab (version 7.0.1) software package with a graphical user interface and executable under Windows XP. Thus, the SIMS-SS age equation in years before present is given in eq.2:"],"after":["Eq.2 The SIMS-SS age equation in years before present"]}}}
