In 2013, the public University of Rwanda (UR) was created out of a merger of the former National University of Rwanda and the country's other public higher education institutions.[258][259][260] In 2011, the gross enrolment ratio for tertiary education in Rwanda was 7%, from 4% in 2008.[261] The country's literacy rate, defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write, was 71% in 2009, up from 38% in 1978 and 58% in 1991.[262] Since 2010, Rwanda is participating in the Open Source and Open Hardware educational project One Laptop Per Child. By 2013, 400,000 XO-XS laptops have been distributed. The breakthrough came from a funding from the Clinton Foundation for a first 20,000 XO-XS laptops. It is not clear who funded the next batch of 100,000 XO-XS laptops nor the additional laptops leading to the 400,000 XO-XS laptops.[263]"]}}}
