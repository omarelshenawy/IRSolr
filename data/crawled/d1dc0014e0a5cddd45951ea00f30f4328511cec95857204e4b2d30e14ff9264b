This typically happens in the context of a library hosting Wikipedians for a presentation to the general public. At these events, the resources of the library are compared and contrasted with Wikipedia, and attendees are encouraged to use each for their respective strengths and as they complement each other. There is an annual tradition to host wiki-workshops and edit-a-thons at libraries around Open Access Week in October/November."]}}}
