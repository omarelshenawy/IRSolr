Three principal designs are used for air wells: high mass, radiative and active. High-mass air wells were used in the early 20th century, but the approach failed.[2] From the late 20th century onwards, low-mass, radiative collectors proved to be much more successful.[2] Active collectors collect water in the same way as a dehumidifier; although the designs work well, they require an energy source, making them uneconomical except in special circumstances."]}}}
