Specifically, the set of embeddings can be split up into two disjoint subsets, those whose image is contained in R, and the rest. To each embedding σ : K → R, there corresponds a unique prime of K coming from the absolute value obtained by composing σ with the usual absolute value on R; a prime arising in this fashion is called a real prime (or real place). To an embedding τ : K → C whose image is not contained in R, one can construct a distinct embedding τ, called the conjugate embedding, by composing τ with the complex conjugation map C → C. Given such a pair of embeddings τ and τ, there corresponds a unique prime of K again obtained by composing τ with the usual absolute value (composing τ instead gives the same absolute value function since |z| = |z| for any complex number z, where z denotes the complex conjugate of z). Such a prime is called a complex prime (or complex place). The description of the set of infinite primes is then as follows: each infinite prime corresponds either to a unique embedding σ : K → R, or a pair of conjugate embeddings τ, τ : K → C. The number of real (respectively, complex) primes is often denoted r1 (respectively, r2). Then, the total number of embeddings K → C is r1+2r2 (which, in fact, equals the degree of the extension K/Q)."]}}}
