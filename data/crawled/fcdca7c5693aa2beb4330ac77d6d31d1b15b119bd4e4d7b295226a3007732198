On March 14, 1958, the RIAA certified its first gold record, Perry Como's hit single \"Catch a Falling Star\". The Oklahoma! soundtrack was certified as the first gold album four months later. In 1976, RIAA introduced the platinum certification, first awarded to Johnnie Taylor's single, \"Disco Lady\", and to the Eagles album, Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975). As music sales increased with the introduction of compact discs, the RIAA created the Multi-Platinum award in 1984. Diamond awards, honoring those artists whose sales of singles or albums reached 10,000,000 copies, were introduced in 1999.[3]"]}}}
