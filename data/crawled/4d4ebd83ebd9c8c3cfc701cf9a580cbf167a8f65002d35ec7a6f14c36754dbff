So:","There is another way to estimate the area of this same sliver. As shown in the accompanying figure, h is multiplied by f(x) to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this sliver. So:"],"after":["Rearranging terms:","As h approaches 0 in the limit, the last fraction can be shown to go to zero.[5] This is true because the area of the red portion of excess region is less than or equal to the area of the tiny black-bordered rectangle; the area of that tiny rectangle, divided by h, is simply the height of the tiny rectangle, which can be seen to go to zero as h goes to zero."]}}}
