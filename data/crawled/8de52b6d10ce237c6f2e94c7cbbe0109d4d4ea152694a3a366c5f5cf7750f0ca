Here, y>x means x ≤ y and x ≠ y.","A lattice (L,≤) is called graded, sometimes ranked (but see this article for an alternative meaning), if it can be equipped with a rank function r from L to ℕ, sometimes to ℤ, compatible with the ordering (so r(x)<r(y) whenever x<y) such that whenever y covers x, then r(y)=r(x)+1. The value of the rank function for a lattice element is called its rank."]}}}
