Garcia Padilla). Assisted by Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the women filed the appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals after the case was dismissed in October 2014.[183] In the brief, the governor of Puerto Rico and several other cabinet members write \"Because Puerto Ricoâ€™s marriage ban impermissibly burdens Plaintiffs' rights to the equal protection of the laws and the fundamental right to marry, we have decided to cease defending its constitutionality.\"[184]"]}}}
