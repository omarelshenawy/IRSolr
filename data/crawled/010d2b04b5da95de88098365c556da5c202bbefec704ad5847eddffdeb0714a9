Longhair's rhythmic approach became a basic template of funk. According to Dr. John (Malcolm John \"Mac\" Rebennack, Jr.), the Professor \"put funk into musicÂ ... Longhair's thing had a direct bearing I'd say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.\"[16] In his \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans,\" the pianist employs the 2-3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba-boogie \"guajeo\" (below).[17] The 2-3 clave time-line is written above the piano excerpt for reference."],"after":["The syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&B during this time. Stewart states: \"Eventually, musicians from outside of New Orleans began to learn some of the rhythmic practices [of the Crescent City]. Most important of these were James Brown and the drummers and arrangers he employed. Brown's early repertoire had used mostly shuffle rhythms, and some of his most successful songs were 12/8 ballads (e.g. 'Please, Please, Please' (1956), 'Bewildered' (1961), 'I Don't Mind' (1961)). Brown's change to a funkier brand of soul required 4/4 metre and a different style of drumming.\"[18] Stewart makes the point: \"The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.\"[19]"]}}}
