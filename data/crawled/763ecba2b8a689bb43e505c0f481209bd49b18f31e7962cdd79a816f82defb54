The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as, \"a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day\".[87] He performed at California's Coachella Festival in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists performing at Live Earth 2008 in Mumbai, India in December 2008,[88] but that concert was cancelled in light of the 26 November terrorist attacks in Mumbai.[89]"],"after":["Waters confirmed the possibility of an upcoming solo album which \"might be called\" Heartland, and has said he has numerous songs written (some already recorded) that he intends to release when they are a complete album.[90] In June 2010, Waters released a cover of \"We Shall Overcome\", a protest song rewritten and arranged by Guy Carawan and Pete Seeger at the Highlander Folk School possibly derived either from the refrain of a gospel hymn published by Charles Albert Tindley in 1901, but more likely from Louise Shropshire's hymn, \"If My Jesus Wills.\" He performed with David Gilmour at the Hoping Foundation Benefit Evening in July 2010.[91] The four-song set included: \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\", which was played in early Pink Floyd sound checks, followed by \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Comfortably Numb\", and \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part Two)\".[92]"]}}}
