Originally The Roman military consisted entirely of the Roman army, but a small navy was first added during the Samnite Wars and later significantly expanded. The Roman military was intertwined with the Roman state much more closely than in a modern Western nation. Josephus describes the Roman people as \"as if born ready armed.\" and the Romans were for long periods prepared to engage in almost continuous warfare."]}}}
