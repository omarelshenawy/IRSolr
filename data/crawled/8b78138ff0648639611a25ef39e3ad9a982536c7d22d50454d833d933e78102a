On December 6, 1990, after a two year public campaign by Bruce Firestone, the NHL awarded a new franchise, which began play in the 1992â€“93 season. The club played most of four seasons in the small 10,000 seat Ottawa Civic Centre and finished last in the league in all four seasons. Since then, the team has had some success, qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in twelve of the past thirteen seasons, four division titles, the Presidents' Trophy in 2003 and appeared in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals."]}}}
