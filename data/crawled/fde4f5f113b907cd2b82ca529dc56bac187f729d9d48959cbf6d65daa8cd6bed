She performed the song dressed in a green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer, standing in front of a microphone. Near the end of the performance, Madonna joked: \"You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?\".[43][44] Regarding the \"shameless promotion\" of Dick Tracy in this segment, O'Brien said that \"along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... [But] the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show\".[45] Two different performances were released on video, the first was included in Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped from the performance at Yokohama Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990,[46] and the other once included on Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped at the Stade de l'Ouest in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.[47]"]}}}
