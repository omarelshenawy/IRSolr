Like the real number system, the complex number system is a field and is complete, but unlike the real numbers, it is not ordered. That is, there is no meaning in saying that i is greater than 1, nor is there any meaning in saying that i is less than 1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack the trichotomy property."]}}}
