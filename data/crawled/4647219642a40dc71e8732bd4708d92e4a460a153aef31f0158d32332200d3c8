A partial listing is given below:","The classical core of the subject of combinatorial designs is built around balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs), Hadamard matrices and Hadamard designs, symmetric BIBDs, Latin squares, resolvable BIBDs, difference sets, and pairwise balanced designs (PBDs).[2] Other combinatorial designs are related to or have been developed from the study of these fundamental ones."],"after":[]}}}
