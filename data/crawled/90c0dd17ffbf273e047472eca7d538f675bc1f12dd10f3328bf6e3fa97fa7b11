His sardonic sense of humour is evident throughout, as when, during his description of the Athenian plague, he remarks that old Athenians seemed to remember a rhyme which said that with the Dorian War would come a \"great death\". Some claimed that the rhyme was actually about a [death by] \"famine\" or \"starvation\" (limos – Greek λιμός[18]), and was only remembered as [death by] \"pestilence\" (loimos – Greek λοιμός[19]) due to the current plague. Thucydides then remarks that should another Dorian War come, this time attended with a great dearth, the rhyme will be remembered as \"dearth,\" and any mention of \"death\" forgotten.[20]"]}}}
