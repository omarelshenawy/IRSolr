The film earned good reviews, with one critic writing, \"Bette crawls across the screen like a testy old hornet on a windowpane, snarling, staggering, twitchingâ€”a symphony of misfired synapses.\"[85] Her last performance was the title role in Larry Cohen's Wicked Stepmother (1989). By this time her health was failing, and after disagreements with Cohen she walked off the set. The script was rewritten to place more emphasis on Barbara Carrera's character, and the reworked version was released after Davis' death."],"after":["After abandoning Wicked Stepmother and with no further film offers (though she was keen to play the centenarian in Craig Calman's The Turn Of The Century and worked with him on adapting the stage play to a feature-length screenplay), Davis appeared on several talk shows and was interviewed by Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers, Larry King and David Letterman, discussing her career but refusing to discuss her daughter. Her appearances were popular; Lindsay Anderson observed that the public enjoyed seeing her behaving \"so bitchy.\" He commented, \"I always disliked that because she was encouraged to behave badly. And I'd always hear her described by that awful word, feisty.\"[86]"]}}}
