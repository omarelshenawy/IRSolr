The glass acts as a dielectric in a capacitor formed between the ionized gas and the hand."],"after":["The globe is prepared by pumping out as much air as is practical. The globe is then back-filled with neon to a pressure similar to one atmosphere. If the radio-frequency power is turned on, if the globe is \"struck\" or \"lit\", now, the whole globe will glow a diffuse red. If a little argon is added, the filaments will form. If a very little xenon is added, the \"flowers\" will bloom at the ends of the filaments.[citation needed]"]}}}
