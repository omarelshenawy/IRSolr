There was no outcry over this.[citation needed]"],"after":["In 2006, the controversial American animated television comedy program South Park, which had previously depicted Muhammad as a superhero character in the July 4, 2001 episode \"Super Best Friends\"[66] and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode,[67] attempted to satirize the Danish newspaper incident. In the episode, \"Cartoon Wars Part II\", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to Peter Griffin, a character from the Fox animated series Family Guy. However, Comedy Central, who airs South Park, rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the Islamic world. The creators of South Park reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's double standard for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of the episode \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" in which American president George W. Bush and Jesus defecate on the flag of the United States."]}}}
