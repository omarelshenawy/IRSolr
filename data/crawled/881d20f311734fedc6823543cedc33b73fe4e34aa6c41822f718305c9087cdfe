It is also known as Starstreak HVM where HVM stands for \"High Velocity Missile\". After launch the missile accelerates to approximately Mach 3.5, at which point it launches three laser beam riding submunitions. The use of three submunitions increases the likelihood of a successful hit on the target. Starstreak has been in service with the British Army since 1997."]}}}
