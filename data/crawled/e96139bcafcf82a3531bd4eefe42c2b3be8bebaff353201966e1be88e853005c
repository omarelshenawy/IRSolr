Every county council corresponds to a county (l√§n) with a number of municipalities per county with the exception of Gotland. County councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by county councils. Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities. The only exception is Gotland Municipality which also has the responsibilities of a county council.[108]"]}}}
