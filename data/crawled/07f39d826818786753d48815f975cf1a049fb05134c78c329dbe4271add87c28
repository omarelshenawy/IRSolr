Jackson had been delinquent on his repayments of a $270Â million loan secured against his music publishing holdings, even though those holdings were reportedly making him as much as $75 million a year.[230] Bank of America sold the debt to Fortress Investments. Sony reportedly proposed a restructuring deal which would give them a future option to buy half of Jackson's stake in their jointly owned publishing company (leaving Jackson with a 25% stake).[196] Jackson agreed to a Sony-backed refinancing deal in April 2006, although the exact details were not made public.[231] Jackson did not have a recording contract in place with Sony or any other major record label at the time."]}}}
