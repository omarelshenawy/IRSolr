The ceiling collapsed under the weight of hail. The damage exposed power cables and left two centimetres of water on the floor.[15] The water also damaged several paintings by a Sydney artist which were associated with an exhibition about Australian lifesavers.[16][17] However, the main part of the building was unaffected and nothing from the Museum's collection was damaged. The building was re-opened to the public a day later. The damage was expected to cost at least A$500,000 to repair."]}}}
