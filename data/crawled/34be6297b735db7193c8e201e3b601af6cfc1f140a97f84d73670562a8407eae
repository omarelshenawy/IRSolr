The percentage of the population of Indo-Fijian descent has declined significantly over the last two decades due to migration for various reasons.[58] Indo-Fijians suffered reprisals for a period after the Fiji coup of 2000.[59][60] There is also a small but significant group of descendants of indentured labourers from the Solomon Islands.[citation needed]"]}}}
