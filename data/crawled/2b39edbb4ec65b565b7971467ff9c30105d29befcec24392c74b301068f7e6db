Including all the autocephalous churches under its supervision, its adherents number more than 150 million worldwide â€” about half of the 300 million estimated adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Among Christian churches, the Russian Orthodox Church is second only to the Roman Catholic Church in terms of numbers of followers. Within Russia the results of a 2007 VTsIOM poll indicated that about 75% of the population considered themselves Orthodox Christians.[3] Up to 65% of ethnic Russians[75][76] as well as Russian-speakers belonging to other ethnic groups from Russia (Ossetians, Caucasus Greeks etc.) and a similar percentage of Belarusians and Ukrainians identify themselves as \"Orthodox\".[3][75][77] However, according to a poll published by the highly respected church related journal Pravmir in December 2012, only 41% of the Russian population identifies itself with the Russian Orthodox Church.[78] Pravmir also published a 2012 poll by the respected Levada organization VTsIOM indicating that 74% of Russians consider themselves Orthodox.[79] According to figures released on March 2, 2011, the Church had 164 dioceses, 217 bishops, and 30,675 parishes served by 28,934 priests and 3,625 deacons. There were 805 monasteries and 30 theological schools.[80]"],"after":[]}}}
