Dance-pop borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producer, artist and period. Such include contemporary R&B, house, techno and synthpop. Being mostly a mainstream pop-influenced genre, dance-pop's sound was often influenced by the period. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the Spice Girls, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. By the late 1990s, electronic influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album Ray of Light (1998) incorporated techno, trance and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing electronica into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, Cher released a dance-pop song called \"Believe\" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, Auto-Tune. Celine Dion also released a dance-pop song \"That's the Way It Is\" by the end of 1999. It has a moderately slow tempo but an up-beat song. An audio processor and a form of pitch modification software, it became commonly used as a way to correct pitch, as well as to create a special effect. Ever since the 1990s, Auto-Tune became a common feature of dance-pop music."]}}}
