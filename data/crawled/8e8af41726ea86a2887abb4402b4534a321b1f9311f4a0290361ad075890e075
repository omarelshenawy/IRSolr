By age five, he was a prodigy troublemaker, playing pranks that were mature beyond his years. Seven years later, he began carving in cement. At the age of fifteen Doré began his career working as a caricaturist for the French paper Le Journal pour rire,[1] and subsequently went on to win commissions to depict scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante."],"after":["In 1853, Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron.[2] This commission was followed by additional work for British publishers, including a new illustrated English Bible. In 1856 he produced twelve folio-size illustrations of The Legend of The Wandering Jew for a short poem which Pierre-Jean de Ranger had derived from a novel of Eugène Sue of 1845.[3][4][5]"]}}}
