In 2010 Spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the United States with a massive power station plant called La Florida, near Alvarado, Badajoz.[117][118] Spain is also Europe's main producer of wind energy. In 2010 its wind turbines generated 42,976 GWh, which accounted for 16.4% of all electrical energy produced in Spain.[119][120][121] On 9 November 2010, wind energy reached an instantaneous historic peak covering 53% of mainland electricity demand[122] and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors.[123] Other renewable energies used in Spain are hydroelectric, biomass and marine (2 power plants under construction).[124]"]}}}
