Suppose we had a linear initial value problem of the nth order:","For first order initial value problems, it is easy to tell whether a unique solution exists. Given any point in the xy-plane, define some rectangular region , such that and is in . If we are given a differential equation and an initial condition , then there is a unique solution to this initial value problem if and are both continuous on . This unique solution exists on some interval with its center at ."],"after":["[11]"]}}}
