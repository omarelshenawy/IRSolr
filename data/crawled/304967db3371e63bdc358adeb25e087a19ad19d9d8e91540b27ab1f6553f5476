His first attempt in the \"Virgin Atlantic Challenger\" led to the boat capsizing in British waters and a rescue by RAF helicopter, which received wide media coverage. Some newspapers called for Branson to reimburse the government for the rescue cost. In 1986, in his \"Virgin Atlantic Challenger II\", with sailing expert Daniel McCarthy, he beat the record by two hours.[4] A year later his hot air balloon \"Virgin Atlantic Flyer\" crossed the Atlantic.[48]"]}}}
