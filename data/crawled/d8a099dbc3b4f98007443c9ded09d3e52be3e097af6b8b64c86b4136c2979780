Cory Moss from MTV wrote that \"music might make the world go round, but costumes and theatrics make it more fun. Nobody knows this better than the Material Girl.\"[16] Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH commented that \"you'd struggle to find a better show than Drowned World and you'd find it difficult to find a mainstream artist who can command near-universal respect for anything like as long as this fine lady. One could almost judge the artist by what was left out [...] she displayed that temptress quality which has beguiled us for nearly two decades and that, combined with her exquisite music, is why Madonna is so special.\"[20] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote: \"Though her Cowgirl image is easily her least significant incarnation to date, Drowned World proves that Madonna is still unmatched in her ability to lift cultural iconography into the mainstream. [...] Those who thought Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should look again closely. With its themes of chaos, dominance, and, ultimately, celebration, Madonna's Drowned World explores her ever-fervid intrigue with both imposed and pious restraint.\"[21]"]}}}
