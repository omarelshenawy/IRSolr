The numbers in the tables are in terms of \"units\", where a unit represents one sale or one shipment of a given medium. Certification is often awarded cumulatively, and it is possible for a single album to be certified silver, gold, and platinum in turn. An album that becomes platinum twice over, for example, an album which has sold 2,000,000 copies in the United States, is said to be \"double-platinum\", or sometimes \"multi-platinum\". Since 2013 in the U.S., and 2014 in the U.K. and Germany, streaming of songs counts towards certification of singles with 100 streams being the equivalent of 1 unit sold.[6]"]}}}
