The theatre's manager, Gabriel Astruc, was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year.[52] Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs.[53] The programme for 29 May 1913 also included Les Sylphides, Weber's Le Spectre de la Rose and Borodin's Polovtsian Dances.[54]"]}}}
