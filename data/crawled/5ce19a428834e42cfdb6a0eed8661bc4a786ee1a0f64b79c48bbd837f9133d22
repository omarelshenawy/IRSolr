It has not survived, but in Natural History he seems to reveal at least part of its content: using the movements of the horse to assist the javelin-man in throwing missiles while astride its back.[19] During this period he also dreamed that the spirit of Drusus Nero begged him to save his memory from oblivion.[16] The dream prompted Pliny to begin forthwith a history of all the wars between the Romans and the Germans, which he was not to complete for some years."],"after":[]}}}
