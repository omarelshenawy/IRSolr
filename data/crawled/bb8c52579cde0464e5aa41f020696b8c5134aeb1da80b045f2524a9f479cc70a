The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[245] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[245] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai.[246][247] In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that \"our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade\" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.[248]"]}}}
