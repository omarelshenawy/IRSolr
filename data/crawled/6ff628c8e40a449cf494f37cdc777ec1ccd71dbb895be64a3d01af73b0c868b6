The idea dates to Léon Theremin's 1922 first concept[68] and his 1932 Fingerboard Theremin and Keyboard Theremin,[69][70]  Maurice Martenot's 1928 Ondes Martenot (sliding a metal ring),[71]  Friedrich Trautwein's 1929 Trautonium (finger pressure), and was also later utilized by Robert Moog.[72][73][74] The ribbon controller has no moving parts. Instead, a finger pressed down and moved along it creates an electrical contact at some point along a pair of thin, flexible longitudinal strips whose electric potential varies from one end to the other. Older fingerboards used a long wire pressed to a resistive plate. A ribbon controller is similar to a touchpad, but a ribbon controller only registers linear motion. Although it may be used to operate any parameter that is affected by control voltages, a ribbon controller is most commonly associated with pitch bending."]}}}
