There is a hot and rainy season, normally from June until November, but from then until May there are cooler temperatures with less precipitation.[13] The climate in the Gambia closely resembles that of neighbouring Senegal, of southern Mali, and of the northern part of Benin.[15]"],"after":["Following independence in 1965, the Gambia conducted freely contested elections every five years. Each election was won by The People's Progressive Party (PPP), headed by Dawda Jawara. The PPP dominated Gambian politics for nearly 30 years. After spearheading the movement toward complete independence from Britain, the PPP was voted into power and was never seriously challenged by any opposition party. The last elections under the PPP regime were held in April 1992.[17]"]}}}
