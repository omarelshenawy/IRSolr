The rod-shaped virus particle is around 300 nm long and 18 nm in diameter, and consists of a helical capsid made from 2130 copies of a single coat protein, which is wrapped around a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 6400 bases. The coat protein and RNA can self-assemble to produce infectious virus."]}}}
