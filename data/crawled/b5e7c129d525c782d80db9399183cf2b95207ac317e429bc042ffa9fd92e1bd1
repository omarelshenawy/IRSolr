A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in The New York Times Book Review (Sundays) as a supplement to the regular city lists (Monday edition).[4] The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists.[4] A few years later, the city lists were eliminated entirely leaving only the national ranking list, it was compiled according to \"reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities\".[4] This methodology of ranking by bookseller sales figures remains to this day although the exact data compilation process is a trade secret and has evolved over time.[5]"]}}}
