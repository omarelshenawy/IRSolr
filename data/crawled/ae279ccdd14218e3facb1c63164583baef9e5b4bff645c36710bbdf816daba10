By the 1750s, Philadelphia had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British America, and second in the British Empire, behind London.[26][27] The city hosted the First Continental Congress before the war; the Second Continental Congress,[28] which signed the United States Declaration of Independence, during the war; and the Constitutional Convention (1787) after the war. Several battles were fought in and near Philadelphia as well."],"after":["Philadelphia served as the temporary capital of the United States, 1790â€“1800, while the Federal City was under construction in the District of Columbia.[29] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemics in U.S. history killed at least 4,000 and up to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, roughly 10% of the city's population.[30][31]"]}}}
