By July 2014, as the US stopped importing light sweet crude, more crude oil became available to refineries in China, India, Japan and South Korea. They collectively purchased 42% more Nigerian crude in 2014 compared with 2013. Starting in June 2014 Saudi Aramco—Saudi Arabia's national oil and gas company and the world's largest oil company in terms of production—discounted the price of its crude to Asian refineries[17] to compete with oil from Nigerian and other African suppliers.[13]"]}}}
