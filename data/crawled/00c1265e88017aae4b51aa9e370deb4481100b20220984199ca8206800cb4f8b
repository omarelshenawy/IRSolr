This is what ecologists call the first trophic level.[69] The modern forms of the major staple foods, such as bananas, plantains,[70] maize and other cereal grasses, and pulses, as well as flax and cotton grown for their fibres, are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among wild ancestral pants with the most desirable characteristics.[71] Botanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations.[72] Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems.[73] Ethnobotany is the study of the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plantâ€“people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany.[74]"]}}}
