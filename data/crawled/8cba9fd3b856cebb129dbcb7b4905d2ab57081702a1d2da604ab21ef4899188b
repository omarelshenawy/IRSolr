For example, one can tell from looking at the graph that the point at −0.1 should have been at about −0.28. The way to do this in the algorithm is to use a single round of Newton's method. Since one knows the first and second derivatives of P(x)−f(x), one can calculate approximately how far a test point has to be moved so that the derivative will be zero."]}}}
