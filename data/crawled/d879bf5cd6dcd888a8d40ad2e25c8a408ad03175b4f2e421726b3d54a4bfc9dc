The species has two forms distinguishable by hair length and coloration, both with a prominent white diamond pattern on the forehead. It weighs between 565 and 687 g (1.246 and 1.515 lb) and has a head-body length of about 293 mm (11.5 in). Like all lorises it is arboreal, and moves slowly across vines and lianas instead of jumping from tree to tree. It is usually found in primary and secondary forests, and sometimes in bamboo and mangrove forests or chocolate plantations. Its diet typically consists of fruit, tree gum, lizards and eggs. It is usually seen alone or in pairs, and sleeps on exposed branches, sometimes in groups. Its population is in sharp decline through habitat loss and poaching, for the exotic pet trade and sometimes for traditional medicine. Listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered, it is protected by Indonesian law, but the wildlife protection laws are rarely enforced at the local level.
