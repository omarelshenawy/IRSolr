Matrices containing just two different values (1 and 0 meaning for example \"yes\" and \"no\", respectively) are called logical matrices. The distance (or cost) matrix contains information about distances of the edges.[76] These concepts can be applied to websites connected by hyperlinks or cities connected by roads etc., in which case (unless the connection network is extremely dense) the matrices tend to be sparse, i.e., contain few nonzero entries. Therefore, specifically tailored matrix algorithms can be used in network theory."]}}}
