Scripts using two separate cases are also called bicameral scripts. Many other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules â€“ a system called unicameral script or unicase. This includes most syllabic and other non-alphabetic scripts. The Georgian alphabet is special since it used to be bicameral, but today is mostly used in a unicameral way."]}}}
