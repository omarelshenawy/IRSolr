In a BBC World Service documentary on Wikipedia in 2011, Keen recommends vigilance when reading Wikipedia, “Wikipedia should be the place you go to familiarize yourself with a product, or a subject, or an individual. But you should always go with a deep degree of skepticism assuming that the information is by definition unreliable, or incoherent, or badly written or simply wrong.”[citation needed] He prominently featured in the 2008 Dutch documentary The Truth According to Wikipedia and was also featured in the 2010 American documentary Truth in Numbers."],"after":["Keen stresses the importance of media literacy and claims that user generated blogs, wikis and other \"democratized\" media, cannot match the resources of mainstream media outlets.[11] Pointing to examples like being able to gather teams together, travel to dangerous locations (sometimes spending years in the region) and having skilled and experienced editors oversee the process,[9] Keen forecasts that if the current Web 2.0 mentality—where content is either given away or stolen—continues, in 25 years there will not exist a professional music business, newspaper industry or publishing business and challenges his audience to question whether we value these or not.[12]"]}}}
