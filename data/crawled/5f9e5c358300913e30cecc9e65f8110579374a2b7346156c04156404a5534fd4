John the Baptist, for example, states in John 3:34: \"He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.\" In John 7:16 Jesus says, \"My teaching is not mine but his who sent me.\" He asserts the same thing in John 14:10: \"Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.\"[141][142]"],"after":["In the gospels, the approximately thirty parables form about one third of Jesus' recorded teachings.[141][143] The parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the narrative.[144] They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the spiritual.[145][146] Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression.[147] Some of his parables, such as the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11–32), are relatively simple, while others, such as the Growing Seed (Mark 4:26–29), are more abstruse.[148]"]}}}
