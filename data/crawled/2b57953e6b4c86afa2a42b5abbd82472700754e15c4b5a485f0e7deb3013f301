No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers[64] that represented executive and legislative branches of the government. The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed. Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin[65] and Joseph Stalin,[66] as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal,[67] itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee.[68] All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office, except Georgy Malenkov[69] and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party.[68]"]}}}
