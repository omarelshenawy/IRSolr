One common practice (not discussed above) is to handle that divergence via Dirac delta and Dirac comb functions. But the same spectral information can be discerned from just one cycle of the periodic function, since all the other cycles are identical. Similarly, finite-duration functions can be represented as a Fourier series, with no actual loss of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform is a mere artifact. We also note that none of the formulas here require the duration of to be limited to the period, P or N.  But that is a common situation, in practice."],"after":["In the table below, associating the   scale factor with function   results in some notational simplification without loss of generality."]}}}
