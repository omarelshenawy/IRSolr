Each singer has a gift-wrapped box attached to his waist. The lyrics include step-by-step instructions on how to create the \"gift\" (1: \"Cut a hole in a box\", 2: \"Put your junk in that box\", 3: \"Make her open the box... and that's the way you do it!\"). They also sing about how a \"dick in a box\" is better than other gifts and is suitable for any holiday or occasion. At the end of the film, they are both arrested and taken away by the NYPD, presumably for indecent exposure, after they bring their boxes \"backstage at the CMAs\"."]}}}
