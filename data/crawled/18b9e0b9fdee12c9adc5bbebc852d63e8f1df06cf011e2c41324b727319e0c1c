Mendelssohn's influence, conspicuous in early works, appears intermittently in later ones. As a contemporary writer observed, Sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself.[218] Yet, in the field of harmony, Hughes writes, Sullivan remained an eclectic: \"He had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality\".[217]"]}}}
