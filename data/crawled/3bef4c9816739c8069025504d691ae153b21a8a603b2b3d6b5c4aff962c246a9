The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission.[26] A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged.
