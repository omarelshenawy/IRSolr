Primary education usually lasts for four to six years and public schools are not stratified by academic ability at this stage.[183] Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years and the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education.[184] The Gesamtschule (comprehensive school) unifies all secondary education."]}}}
