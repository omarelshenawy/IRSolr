Mayawati, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, chooses to use only a single name. Several Indian film personalities, such as Pran, Sridevi, Rekha, Kajol, Dharmendra, and Rajnikanth, are also known only by their mononyms. Surnames are common in northern India, but less so in the south. In the southern State of Tamil Nadu, for instance, social-reform movements resulted in people discarding surnames which are synonymous with caste names."],"after":["Mononyms are also common in Indonesia, especially in Javanese names. In some cases, such as those of former Presidents Sukarno and Suharto, the mononym is the full legal name, as often among Javanese people of common birth. Other mononyms, such as Rossa, Chrisye and Tohpati, are stage names taken from a nickname or are part of the full name."]}}}
