In it, she faces the camera, while in the background a car and a gas station are seen. The country was a constant theme throughout the design, as the album's title, which was a logo that simulated a buckle, showing the silhouette of a cowboy while riding a horse and a yellow background; the bright colors give a sharp contrast compared to the photograph.[18] Photo sessions were conducted by Jean Baptiste Mondino, who had worked with the singer previously on other photo sessions and music videos.[19] According to Fouz-Hern√°ndez, the artwork is \"a complete celebration to the field\" western United States.[20] He also added that it \"is camp, notably Madonna's combination of Western clothing with expensive shoes and bright red high heels. In particular, there is a clear evocation of Judy Garland - a major gay icon - in the artwork\".[21] The photographs were shot in Los Angeles, between April 10 and 13, 2000. In an interview, Mondino said that he was the one who had the idea of the western themes for the album, and also stated: \"[Madonna] wasn't sure at first, but I told her that if she didn't like it I won't charge her. But she loved the final result!\".[22] The art direction and designs for the album were done by Kevin Reagan.[23]"]}}}
