Madonna collaborated with Cirque du Soleil in producing the show, and was chosen in lieu of American recording artist Lady Gaga.[60] Rehearsal for the halftime performance accumulated to an estimated 320 hours; it consisted of twenty dancing dolls, seventeen main dancers, a two hundred membered church choir, and a drumline consisting of a hundred percussionists.[61] Thirty-six image projectors were utilized to create a spectacle of lights, while Madonna wore 120 individual prosthetic eyelashes.[61] Madonna performed the song with Minaj and M.I.A., during a medley of her past hits: \"Vogue\", \"Music\" (performed with LMFAO along with excerpts from \"Party Rock Anthem\" and \"Sexy and I Know It\") then an \"Open Your Heart\"/\"Express Yourself\" interlude followed by \"Like a Prayer\" (performed with Cee Lo Green).[62][63] Madonna was carried into the stadium by 150 bearers, who wore pairs of black underwear designed by Calvin Klein.[61] She arrived atop of a golden throne, which weighted over 1,200 pounds,[61] and sported a long golden cape designed by Givenchy. Completion of the cape commenced over an approximate period of 750 hours.[61] Once the show concluded, a group of 250 volunteers assembled and dismantled the stage in six minutes.[61] The performance gained widespread attention from the media, after M.I.A. extended the middle finger to the camera near the end of her verse of the song instead of singing the lyric \"shit\".[64][65] The incident prompted broadcaster NBC and the National Football League to issue apologies.[66][67]"]}}}
