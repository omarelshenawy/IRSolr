A performance on Tower's Fourth Street in Manhattan was presented to around 400 people and featured acoustic performances of \"American Life\", \"Mother and Father\", and \"Hollywood\".[65] On August 27, 2003, Madonna opened the MTV Video Music Awards performing a medley of \"Like a Virgin/Hollywood\" with Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott.[66] The performance started with Madonna's daughter Lourdes walking on stage with another girl, dressed as flower girls at a wedding.[67] Spears appeared on stage atop of a giant wedding cake, wearing a wedding gown and veil; she sang the first few lines of \"Like a Virgin\" before Aguilera appeared from behind the cake and joined her.[68] Madonna then emerged from the cake wearing a black coat and hat and started singing \"Hollywood\" before proceeding to kiss Spears and Aguilera on the lips.[69] Missy Elliott came out from a wedding chapel to sing her song \"Work It\" halfway through the performance.[69] The whole performance was a tribute to Madonna and an homage to her performance of \"Like a Virgin\" at the awards' inaugural show in 1984.[70]"]}}}
