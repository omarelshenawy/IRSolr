Founded in 1908, ANAK's purpose is \"to honor outstanding juniors and seniors who have shown both exemplary leadership and a true love for Georgia Tech\". The society's name refers to Anak, a biblical figure said to be the forefather of a race of giants. Although not originally founded as a secret society, ANAK has kept its activities and membership rosters confidential since 1961. Membership is made public upon a student's graduation or a faculty member's retirement. The ANAK Society's membership comprises at least 1,100Â Georgia Tech graduates, faculty members, and honorary members. Notable members include Jimmy Carter, Bobby Dodd, Ivan Allen Jr., and most of Georgia Tech's presidents. Membership in the ANAK Society has long been considered the highest honor a Georgia Tech student can receive, although the society's activities have been the object of suspicion and controversy in recent years."]}}}
