He considered racism America's \"worst disease,\"[67] seeing it as \"handed down from one generation to the next.\"[91] As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951.[92]:565 When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.[93]"],"after":["In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to blacks, including Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. To its students, Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\"[93] A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student,[93] and black physicist Sylvester James Gates states that Einstein had been one of his early science heroes, later finding out about Einstein's support for civil rights.[93]"]}}}
