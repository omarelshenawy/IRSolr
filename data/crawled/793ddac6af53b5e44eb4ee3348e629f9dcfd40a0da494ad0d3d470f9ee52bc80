The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line. See Kepler orbit."],"after":["where is the gravitational constant.","The acceleration of solar system body number i is, according to Newton's laws:"]}}}
