She continued living there, even after Gilbert's death, until Lady Gilbert's death in 1936.[79] A statue of Charles II, carved by Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber in 1681, was moved in 1875 from Soho Square to an island in the lake at Grim's Dyke, where it remained when Gilbert purchased the property.[80] On Lady Gilbert's direction, it was restored to Soho Square in 1938.[81]"]}}}
