Some songs were conceptualized within a relatively shorter time, while others took longer because Timberlake had wanted to incorporate variation. For instance, the lyrics to \"Losing My Way\" were in a narrative style which took Timberlake longer to write.[16] The only song that Timberlake wrote down on paper was the Rubin-produced \"(Another Song) All Over Again\". Rubin felt it was unusual for Timberlake because he requested the latter to write the lyrics first instead of recording it directly in the vocal booth.[16]"]}}}
