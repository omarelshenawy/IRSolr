The Nyabarongo-Kagera eventually drains into Lake Victoria, and its source in Nyungwe Forest is a contender for the as-yet undetermined overall source of the Nile.[114] Rwanda has many lakes, the largest being Lake Kivu. This lake occupies the floor of the Albertine Rift along most of the length of Rwanda's western border, and with a maximum depth of 480 metres (1,575 ft),[115] it is one of the twenty deepest lakes in the world.[116] Other sizeable lakes include Burera, Ruhondo, Muhazi, Rweru, and Ihema, the last being the largest of a string of lakes in the eastern plains of Akagera National Park.[117]"],"after":["Mountains dominate central and western Rwanda. They are part of the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the Albertine branch of the East African Rift, which runs from north to south along Rwanda's western border.[118] The highest peaks are found in the Virunga volcano chain in the northwest; this includes Mount Karisimbi, Rwanda's highest point, at 4,507 metres (14,787 ft).[119] This western section of the country lies within the Albertine Rift montane forests ecoregion.[118] It has an elevation of 1,500 to 2,500 metres (4,921 to 8,202 ft).[120] The centre of the country is predominantly rolling hills, while the eastern border region consists of savanna, plains and swamps.[121]"]}}}
