Economy (in some form) always had good demand anywhere, but its definition in the U.S. was long considered different from that in other markets. In this view, \"economy\" in the U.S. did not mean \"small\" in the sense of what qualified as \"small\" outside the U.S. The policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in non-U.S. markets than in the U.S., and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country, either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing.[87] GM's acquisitions of Vauxhall Motors Ltd (UK, 1925)[87] and Adam Opel AG (Germany, 1929),[87] rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them, were based on analyses that convinced GM managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision.[87]"]}}}
