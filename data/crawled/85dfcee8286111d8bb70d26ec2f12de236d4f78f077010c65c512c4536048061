In 1865, William Stanley Jevons published The Coal Question in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement. In 1914, U.S. Bureau of Mines stated that the total production was 5.7 billion barrels (910,000,000Â m3). In 1956, Geophysicist M. King Hubbert deduces that U.S. oil production will peak between 1965 and 1970 (peaked in 1971) and that oil production will peak \"within half a century\" on the basis of 1956 data.[note 23] In 1989, predicted peak by Colin Campbell[161] In 2004, OPEC estimated, with substantial investments, it would nearly double oil output by 2025[162]"],"after":["The environmental movement has emphasized sustainability of energy use and development.[163] Renewable energy is sustainable in its production; the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years. \"Sustainability\" also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products, especially air pollution. Sources which have no direct waste products (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) are brought up on this point. With global demand for energy growing, the need to adopt various energy sources is growing. Energy conservation is an alternative or complementary process to energy development. It reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently."]}}}
