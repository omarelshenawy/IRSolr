This has generating function x. Let P(x) denote the generating function Putting the above description in words: A plane tree consists of a node to which is attached an arbitrary number of subtrees, each of which is also a plane tree. Using the operation on families of combinatorial structures developed earlier this translates to a recursive generating function:"],"after":["After solving for P(x):"]}}}
