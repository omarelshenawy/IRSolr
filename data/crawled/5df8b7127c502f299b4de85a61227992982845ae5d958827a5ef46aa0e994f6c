The monument, located at 3701 W. 119th Street, Hawthorne, California, stands on the site of their childhood home, which was demolished in the mid-1980s during construction of the Century Freeway. Music industry notables such as Dick Clark and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame were among the letter-writers who supported the BBHL's landmark application process. Its status as a California State Historic Landmark No. 1041 was granted by the California State Historic Resources Commission in a unanimous vote on August 6, 2004, in Ontario, California, and the monument was dedicated on May 20, 2005."]}}}
