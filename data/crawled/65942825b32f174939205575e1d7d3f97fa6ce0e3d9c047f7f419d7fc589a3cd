While these new instruments were expensive, these characteristics meant musicians were quick to adopt them, especially in the United Kingdom[48] and the United States. This encouraged a trend towards producing music using digital sounds,[note 2] and laid the foundations for the development of the inexpensive digital instruments popular in the next decade (see below). Relatively successful instruments with each selling more than several hundred units per series, included the NED Synclavier (1977), Fairlight CMI (1979), E-mu Emulator (1981), and PPG Wave (1981).[note 1][48][49][50][51]"]}}}
