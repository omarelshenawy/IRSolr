The Economist generally supports free trade, globalisation,[30] and free immigration. It has been described as neo-liberal although occasionally accepting the propositions of Keynesian economics where deemed more \"reasonable\".[31] The news magazine favours a carbon tax to fight global warming.[32] According to former editor Bill Emmott, \"the Economist's philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative\".[33] Individual contributors take diverse views. The Economist favours the support, via central banks, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can (in a much more limited form) be traced back to Walter Bagehot, the third editor of The Economist, who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties. Karl Marx deemed The Economist the \"European organ\" of \"the aristocracy of finance\".[34]"]}}}
