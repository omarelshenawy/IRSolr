In Greek, the adjective \"holy\" or \"sacred\" (ἱερά transliterated as hiera) is constantly applied to all such sees as a matter of course. In the West, the adjective is not commonly added, but it does form part of an official title of two sees: as well as Rome, the Bishopric of Mainz (the former Archbishopric of Mainz), which was also of electoral and primatial rank, bears the title of \"the Holy See of Mainz\" (Latin: Sancta Sedes Moguntina)."]}}}
