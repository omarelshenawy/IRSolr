The CD booklet consisted of an essay by David Nick Ybarra, editor and founder of Daeida magazine. In the essay, Ybarra noted that \"Sidewalk Talk\" was never promoted in the press kits for the release of Wotupski!?! Instead another song, \"The Mexican\", was noted in the album cover's advertising sticker. Nevertheless, Ybarra said that it was the inclusion of \"Sidewalk Talk\" which became the most critical aspect of the public's interest in the release.[12] In September 2014, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 71 on their list of the \"100 Best Singles of 1984\". Maura Johnston from the magazine noted that the song was similar in composition to other production work of Benitez, like Madonna's \"Holiday\" (1984), and described it as distilling \"the essence of New Yorkâ€”full of fast-moving possibility and flash, but to be handled with caution in order to be survived.\"[13]"]}}}
