Many different kinds of vessels are used in commercial, artisanal and recreational fishing.","According to the FAO, in 2004 there were four million commercial fishing vessels.[26] About 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and 40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the undecked boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars.[26] These boats are used by artisan fishers."]}}}
