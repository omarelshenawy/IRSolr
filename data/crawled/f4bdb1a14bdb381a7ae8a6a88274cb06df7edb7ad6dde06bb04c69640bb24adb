Ron Hubbard as a successor to his earlier counselling system, Dianetics. Dianetics uses a counseling technique known as auditing, in which an \"auditor\" assists a subject in conscious recall of traumatic events in the individual's past.[48] It was originally intended to be a new psychotherapy and was not expected to become the foundation for a new religion.[49][50] Hubbard variously defined Dianetics as a spiritual healing technology and an organized science of thought.[51] The stated intent of Dianetics is to free individuals of the influence of past traumas by systematic exposure and removal of the engrams these events have left behind, in a process called clearing.[51]"]}}}
