For a similar reason it adopted the international vehicle and internet code CH, which stands for Confoederatio Helvetica, the country's full Latin name."],"after":["Many organizations today have Latin mottos, such as \"Semper paratus\" (always ready), the motto of the United States Coast Guard, and \"Semper fidelis\" (always faithful), the motto of the United States Marine Corps. Several of the states of the United States also have Latin mottos, such as \"Montani semper liberi\" (Mountaineers are always free), the state motto of West Virginia; \"Sic semper tyrannis\" (Thus always for tyrants), that of Virginia; \"Qui transtulit sustinet\" (\"He who transplanted still sustains\"), that of Connecticut; \"Esse quam videri\" (To be rather than to seem), that of North Carolina; \"Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam, circumspice\" (\"If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you\") that of Michigan. Another Latin motto is \"Per ardua ad astra\" (Through adversity/struggle to the stars), the motto of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Some schools adopt Latin mottos such as \"Disce aut discede\" of the Royal College, Colombo. Harvard University's motto is \"Veritas\" meaning (truth). Veritas was the goddess of truth, a daughter of Saturn, and the mother of Virtue."]}}}
