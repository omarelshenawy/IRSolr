Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, Music, instead of embarking on a tour.[2] Buoyed up by the commercial success of 1998's Ray of Light album, she was keen on getting back to the studio and start recording. Madonna was well disposed towards William Orbit, producer of Ray of Light, but by 2000, his production and sound had become ubiquitous. Also, the music scene was being dominated by younger generation of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, prompting Madonna to look for a distinctive sound in this market.[2] It was then that she was introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadza√Ø, through some common friends. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs.[3]"]}}}
