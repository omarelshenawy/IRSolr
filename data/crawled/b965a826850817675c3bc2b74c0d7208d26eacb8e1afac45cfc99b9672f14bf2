Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, and a screening of The Frighteners was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson.[221] Michael Apted was then selected to lead the film.[222] Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired after their work in Plunkett & Macleane,[223] before Michael Apted and his wife, screenwriter Dana Stevens, undertook an uncredited rewrite.[224] Pierce Brosnan was unhappy with some of Stevens' changes to his character, so Michael G Wilson—who was also uncredited as screenwriter—and Bruce Feirstein undertook further revisions.[225]"]}}}
