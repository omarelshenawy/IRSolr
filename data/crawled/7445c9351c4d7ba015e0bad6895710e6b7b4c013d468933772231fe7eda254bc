Examples of algebraic integers are 5 + 13√2, 2 − 6i, and 1⁄2(1 + i√3). Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper superset of the integers, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials x − k for all k ∈ Z. In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what integers are to rational numbers."]}}}
