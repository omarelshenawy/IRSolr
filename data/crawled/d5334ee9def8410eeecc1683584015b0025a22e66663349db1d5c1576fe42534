It was in this room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95.[5][22] He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts.[23] He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000 florins.[24]"],"after":["With the departure of the Drury Lane company in 1794, the theatre returned to opera, hosting the first London performances of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito in 1806, Così fan tutte and Die Zauberflöte in 1811, and Don Giovanni in 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, John Nash and George Repton made alterations to the façade and increased the capacity of the auditorium to 2,500. They also added a shopping arcade, called the Royal Opera Arcade, which has survived fires and renovations and still exists. It runs along the rear of the theatre.[25] In 1818–20, the British premières of Gioachino Rossini's operas Il barbiere di Siviglia, Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra, L'italiana in Algeri, La Cenerentola and Tancredi took place,[26] and the theatre became known as the Italian Opera House, Haymarket by the 1820s.[27]"]}}}
