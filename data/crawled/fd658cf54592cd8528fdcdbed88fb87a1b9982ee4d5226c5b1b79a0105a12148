Its follow-up single, \"With Me Part 1\" failed to reproduce the success of \"No, No, No\". Meanwhile, the group featured on a song from the soundtrack album of the romantic drama Why Do Fools Fall in Love and \"Get on the Bus\" had a limited release in Europe and other markets. In 1998, Destiny's Child garnered three Soul Train Lady of Soul awards[6] including Best New Artist for \"No, No, No\". Knowles considered their debut successful but not huge, claiming as a neo soul record it was too mature for the group at the time.[16]"]}}}
