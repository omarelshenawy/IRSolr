The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a \"liberal\" or \"anti-American\" bias."],"after":["CNN President Walter Isaacson met with Republican Party leaders in Washington, DC in 2001 saying afterwards \"I was trying to reach out to a lot of Republicans who feel that CNN has not been as open covering Republicans, and I wanted to hear their concerns,\"[63] As said by CNN founder Ted Turner, \"There really isn't much of a point getting some Tom, Dick or Harry off the streets to report on when we can snag a big name whom everyone identifies with. After all, it's all part of the business.\" However, in April 2008, Turner criticized the direction that CNN has taken.[64] Others have echoed that criticism, especially in light of CNN's ratings declines since the late 2000s."]}}}
