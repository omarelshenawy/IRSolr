Hollywood's most important stars volunteered to entertain servicemen. Davis ensured that every night there would be a few important \"names\" for the visiting soldiers to meet.[40] She appeared as herself in the film Hollywood Canteen (1944), which used the canteen as the setting for a fictional story. Davis later commented, \"There are few accomplishments in my life that I am sincerely proud of. The Hollywood Canteen is one of them.\" In 1980, she was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Medal, the United States Department of Defense's highest civilian award, for her work with the Hollywood Canteen.[41]"],"after":["Davis showed little interest in the film Now, Voyager (1942) until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the best known of her \"women's pictures.\" In one of the film's most imitated scenes, Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes as he stares into Davis' eyes and passes one to her. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the National Board of Review commenting that she gave the film \"a dignity not fully warranted by the script.\"[42]"]}}}
