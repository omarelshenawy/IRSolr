It remained that way for 125 years, until the \"Precinct of Cape Cod\" was incorporated as the Town of Provincetown. No longer in \"official\" use over the ensuing decades, the name came to mean all of the land east of the Manomet and Scusset rivers – essentially along the line that became the Cape Cod Canal. The creation of the canal separated the majority of the peninsula from the mainland, effectively turning it into an island.[1][4] Indeed, most agencies, including the Cape Cod Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), treat the Cape as an island with regards to disaster preparedness, groundwater management, and the like.[5] Most \"Cape Codders\" – residents of \"The Cape\" – refer to all land on the mainland side of the canal as \"off-Cape.\" However, the legal delineation of Cape Cod, coincident to the boundaries of Barnstable County, extends to the northwest boundaries of the towns of Bourne and Sandwich – and small portions of each are located west of the canal."]}}}
