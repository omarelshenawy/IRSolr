The first step in geostatistical modulation is the creation of a random process that best describes the set of experimental observed data.[3]"],"after":["The set of random variables, constitutes a random function of which only one realization is known - the set of experimental data. With only one realization of each random variable it's theoretically impossible to determine any statistical parameter of the individual variables or the function."]}}}
