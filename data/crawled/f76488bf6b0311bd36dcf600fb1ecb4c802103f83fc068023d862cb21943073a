After that time, the term \"Middle East\" gained broader usage in Europe and the United States, with the Middle East Institute founded in Washington, D.C. in 1946, among other usage.[13]"],"after":["The term Middle East has been criticized as implicitly Eurocentric.[14][15] In contemporary English-language academic and media venues, the term is used by both Europeans and non-Europeans.","The description Middle has also led to some confusion over changing definitions. Before the First World War, \"Near East\" was used in English to refer to the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire, while \"Middle East\" referred to Iran, the Caucasus, Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Turkestan.
