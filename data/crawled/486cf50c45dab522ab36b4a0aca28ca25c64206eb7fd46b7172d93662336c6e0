Aware of this general impression, he claimed that \"If you give me your attention\",[98] the misanthrope's song from Princess Ida, was a satiric self-reference, saying: \"I thought it my duty to live up to my reputation.\"[99] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. Actress May Fortescue recalled, \"His kindness was extraordinary. On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they were pretty or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. For money as money he cared less than nothing. Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend.\"[100] Journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote:"],"after":["Jessie Bond wrote that Gilbert \"was quick-tempered, often unreasonable, and he could not bear to be thwarted, but how anyone could call him unamiable I cannot understand.\"[102] George Grossmith wrote to The Daily Telegraph that, although Gilbert had been described as an autocrat at rehearsals, \"That was really only his manner when he was playing the part of stage director at rehearsals. As a matter of fact, he was a generous, kind true gentleman, and I use the word in the purest and original sense.\"[103]"]}}}
