Small explosive detonators or torpedoes are placed on the track, and detonated by the pressure of the wheels of the oncoming train. The loud report of the explosion provides the indication to the driver, that in most cases requires the train to be stopped immediately. During World War II, these devices were modified to detonate demolition charges during railroad sabotage operations."],"after":[]}}}
