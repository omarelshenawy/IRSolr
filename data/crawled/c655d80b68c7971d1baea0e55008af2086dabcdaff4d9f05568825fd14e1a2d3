Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.[41] Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores.[37] Other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate.[37]"],"after":["With the advent of space exploration in the twentieth century, geologists have begun to look at other planetary bodies in the same ways that have been developed to study the Earth. This new field of study is called planetary geology (sometimes known as astrogeology) and relies on known geologic principles to study other bodies of the solar system."]}}}
