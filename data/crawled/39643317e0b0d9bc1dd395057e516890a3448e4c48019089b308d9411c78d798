If s were prime then it would factor uniquely as itself, so there must be at least two primes in each factorization of s:"],"after":["If any pi = qj then, by cancellation, s/pi = s/qj would be a positive integer greater than 1 with two distinct factorizations. But s/pi is smaller than s, meaning s would not actually be the smallest such integer. Therefore every pi must be distinct from every qj."]}}}
