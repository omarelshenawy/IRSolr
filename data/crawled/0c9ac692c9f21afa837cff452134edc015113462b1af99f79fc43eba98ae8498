Engineering already addresses all these issues, hence the same principles used in engineering can be applied to software. The widespread lack of best practices for software at the time was perceived as a \"software crisis\".[13][14][15]"],"after":["The book analyzes sixty-three software projects and concludes the cost of fixing errors escalates as we move the project toward field use. The book also asserts that the key driver of software cost is the capability of the software development team."]}}}
