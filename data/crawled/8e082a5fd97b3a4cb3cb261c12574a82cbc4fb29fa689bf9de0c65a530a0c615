Born in Staten Island, New York and raised in Wexford, Pennsylvania, she made appearances on the television series Star Search and The Mickey Mouse Club in her childhood. Aguilera came to prominence with her number-one debut album, Christina Aguilera (1999); its singles \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" each peaked atop the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Her follow-up records, Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas (2000), experienced moderate success worldwide. Displeased with her lack of input in her image and music, Aguilera assumed creative control for her fourth album, Stripped (2002), which yielded the international chart-topping hits \"Dirrty\" and \"Beautiful\"."]}}}
