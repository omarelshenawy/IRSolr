However, this is not in common use. The most complex character that can be input using the Microsoft New Phonetic IME 2002a for traditional Chinese is 龘 (dá, \"the appearance of a dragon flying\"). It is composed of the dragon radical represented three times, for a total of 16 × 3 = 48 strokes. Among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in frequent modern use are 籲 (yù, \"to implore\"), with 32 strokes; 鬱 (yù, \"luxuriant, lush; gloomy\"), with 29 strokes, as in 憂鬱 (yōuyù, \"depressed\"); 豔 (yàn, \"colorful\"), with 28 strokes; and 釁 (xìn, \"quarrel\"), with 25 strokes, as in 挑釁 (tiǎoxìn, \"to pick a fight\"). Also in occasional modern use is 鱻 (xiān \"fresh\"; variant of 鮮 xiān) with 33 strokes."],"after":["The most complex Chinese character still in use may be[according to whom?] biáng (pictured right, bottom), with 57 strokes, which refers to Biang biang noodles, a type of noodle from China's Shaanxi province. This character along with the syllable biang cannot be found in dictionaries. The fact that it represents a syllable that does not exist in any Standard Chinese word means that it could be classified as a dialectal character."]}}}
