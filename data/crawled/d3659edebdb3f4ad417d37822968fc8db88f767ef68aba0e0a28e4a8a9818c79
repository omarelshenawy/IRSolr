His opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans. Bush lost the election by 6,000 votes (6Â percent) of the 103,000 votes cast.[57] He returned to the oil industry and began a series of small, independent oil exploration companies.[58] He created Arbusto Energy,[59] and later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman.[58] The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc.[58][60] Bush served on the board of directors for HKN.[58] Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[58][61]"]}}}
