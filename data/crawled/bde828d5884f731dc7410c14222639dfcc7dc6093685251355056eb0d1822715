In a ligature with f (in words such as fırın (\"oven\") and fikir (\"idea\")), this contrast would be obscured. The fi ligature is therefore not used in Turkish typography, and neither are other ligatures like that for fl, which would be rare anyway."],"after":["Remnants of the ligatures ſʒ/ſz (\"sharp s\"/\"esszett\") and tʒ/tz (\"sharp t\"/\"tezett\") from Fraktur, a family of German blackletter typefaces, originally mandatory in Fraktur but now employed only stylistically, can be seen to this day on street signs for city squares whose name contains Platz or ends in -platz. Instead, the \"sz\" ligature has merged into a single character, the German ß – see below."]}}}
