The art of speaking (ars dicendi) was highly prized as a marker of social and intellectual superiority, and eloquentia (\"speaking ability, eloquence\") was considered the \"glue\" of a civilized society.[506] Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge (though it required a command of references to the literary canon[507]) as it was a mode of expression and decorum that distinguished those who held social power.[508] The ancient model of rhetorical training—\"restraint, coolness under pressure, modesty, and good humour\"[509]—endured into the 18th century as a Western educational ideal.[510]"]}}}
