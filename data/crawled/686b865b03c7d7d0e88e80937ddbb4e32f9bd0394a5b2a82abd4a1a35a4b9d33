They all failed, but he learned from his mistakes. Macy moved to New York City in 1858 and established a new store named \"R. H. Macy & Co.\" on Sixth Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets, which was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time.[5]:1102 On the company's first day of business on October 28, 1858 sales totaled US$11.08, equal to $301.47 today. From the very beginning, Macy's logo has included a star in one form or another, which comes from a tattoo that Macy got as a teenager when he worked on a Nantucket whaling ship, the Emily Morgan.[6][7]"]}}}
