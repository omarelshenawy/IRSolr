In 1925, at Sam's urging, Warner's agreed to add this feature to their productions.[HBTN 10] By February 1926, the studio reported a net loss of $333,413.[12]"],"after":["After a long period denying Sam's request for sound, Harry agreed to change, as long as the studio's use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only.[HBTN 10] The Warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company Western Electric and established Vitaphone.[HBTN 11] In 1926, Vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks, most notably, in the feature Don Juan starring John Barrymore. The film was silent, but it featured a large number of Vitaphone shorts at the beginning. To hype Don Juan's release, Harry acquired the large Piccadilly Theater in Manhattan, New York City, and renamed it WarnersÂ´ Theatre.[cph 2]"]}}}
