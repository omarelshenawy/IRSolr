The Apple I kits were computers single handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak[12][13] and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club.[14] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which is less than what is now considered a complete personal computer.[15] The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,763 in 2015 dollars, adjusted for inflation).[16][17][18][19][20][21]"]}}}
