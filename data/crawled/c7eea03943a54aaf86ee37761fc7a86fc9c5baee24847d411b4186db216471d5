Other research suggests that it does not relate to the heartbeat directly, but rather the speed of emotional affect, which also influences heartbeat. Yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread, it is reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots (Patel 2014,[page needed]). Justin London writes that musical metre \"involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time\" (London 2004, 4). The \"perception\" and \"abstraction\" of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into \"tick-tock-tick-tock\" (Scholes 1977b; Scholes 1977c)."]}}}
