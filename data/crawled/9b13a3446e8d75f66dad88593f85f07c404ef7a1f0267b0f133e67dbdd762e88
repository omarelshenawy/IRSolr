While boating on international waters does not require any license, a license may be required to operate a vessel on coastal waters or inland waters. Some jurisdictions require a license when a certain size is exceeded (e.g., a length of 20 meters), others only require licenses to pilot passenger ships, ferries or tugboats. For example, the European Union issues the International Certificate of Competence, which is required to operate pleasure craft in most inland waterways within the union. The United States in contrast has no licensing, but instead has voluntary certification organizations such as the American Sailing Association.[36] These US certificates are often required to charter a boat, but are not required by any federal or state law."],"after":["Sailboat racing generally fits into one of two categories:","Class racing can be further subdivided. Each class has its own set of class rules, and some classes are more restrictive than others.","In a strict one-design class the boats are essentially identical. Examples include the 29er, J/24, Laser, and RS Feva."]}}}
