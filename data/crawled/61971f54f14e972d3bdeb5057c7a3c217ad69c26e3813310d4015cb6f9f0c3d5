He argued that the process of observation and evaluation take place within a paradigm. By \"paradigm\" he meant, essentially, a logically consistent \"portrait\" of the world, one that involves no logical contradictions and that is consistent with observations that are made from its point of view. He described the process of observation and \"puzzle solving\" which takes place within a paradigm, which he called \"normal science.\" He also explained how one paradigm can overtake another, which process he termed a paradigm shift."]}}}
