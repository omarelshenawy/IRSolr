He worked 18–20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. \"There was no more powerful majority leader in American history,\" biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, \"He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them.\" At 6 feet 3.5 inches (1.918 m) tall,[235][236][237] Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as \"The Johnson Treatment\".[238] A contemporary writes, \"It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of a sudden, you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you.\"[238]"]}}}
