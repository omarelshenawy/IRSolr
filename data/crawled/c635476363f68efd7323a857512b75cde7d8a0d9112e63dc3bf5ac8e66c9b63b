These scrolls are of great significance in the study of Biblical texts because many of them contain the earliest known version of books of the Hebrew bible.[14] A sample of the linen wrapping from one of these scrolls, the Great Isaiah Scroll, was included in an 1955 analysis by Libby, with an estimated age of 1,917 ± 200 years.[14][83] Based on an analysis of the writing style, palaeographic estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls, and samples from most of these, along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated, were tested by two AMS laboratories in the 1990s. The results ranged in age from the early 4th century BC to the mid 4th century AD. In many cases the scrolls were determined to be older than the palaeographically determined age. The Isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2σ confidence level, because of the shape of the calibration curve at that point: there is a 15% chance that it dates from 355−295 BC, and an 84% chance that it dates from 210−45 BC. Subsequently these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested, they had been treated with modern castor oil in order to make the writing easier to read; it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young. Multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism.[14]"]}}}
