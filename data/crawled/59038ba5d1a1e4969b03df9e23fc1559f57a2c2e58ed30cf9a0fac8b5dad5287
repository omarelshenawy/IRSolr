Among other things, the bill stipulates the creation and country-wide enforcement of blacklists, which would block access to forbidden sites on the territory of Russia.

In particular, the blacklist inclusion criteria were characterized as \"too vague\" and \"paving the way for Internet censorship\".[14]"]}}}
