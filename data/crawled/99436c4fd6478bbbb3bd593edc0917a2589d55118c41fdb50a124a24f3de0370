The only inter-provincial systems are the Trans-Canada Highway and the National Highway System. Numbered highways in Canada are split by province, and a majority are maintained by their province or territory transportation department. All highways in Canada are numbered except for three in the Northwest Territories, and all in Nunavut; one highway in Alberta, one highway in Ontario, two highways in Quebec, and Ontario's 7000 Series, are not marked with their highway number, but have been assigned one by the transportation department. A number of highways in all provinces are better known by locals by their name rather than their number. Some highways have additional letters added to their number, A is typically an alternate route, B is typically a business route, and other letters are used for bypass (truck) routes, connector routes, scenic routes, and spur routes."],"after":[]}}}
