In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection.[1] However, in the majority of cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms.[1] These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.[12]"]}}}
