It had a total budget of $5 million ($9.51 million in 2015 dollars[2]), which made it the most expensive music video in history at the time it was made, and currently the third most expensive of all time.[57][58] \"Express Yourself\" had its world-premiere on May 17, 1989, on MTV and was an MTV exclusive for three weeks, being aired every hour on the music channel.[58] The concept of the video was to portray Madonna as a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them—played by model Cameron Alborzian—as her date.[58][59] When Fincher explained this concept to Madonna, she was intrigued and decided to portray a masculine persona.[60] She was dating actor Warren Beatty at that time, and asked him to play the part of a slave working at a factory; Beatty politely refused, saying later that \"Madonna wanted the video as a show case of her sexual prowess, I never wanted to be a part of it.\"[60] She then thought about Metropolis and of its scenes displaying factory workers and a city with tall skyscrapers. Fincher liked the concept and it became the main backdrop for the video. In Madonna 'Talking': Madonna in Her Own Words, she commented about the development of the video."]}}}
