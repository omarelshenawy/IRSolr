A wall painting, which may depict the ancient Anatolian city of Çatalhöyük (previously known as Catal Huyuk or Çatal Hüyük), has been dated to the late 7th millennium BCE.[1][2] Among the prehistoric alpine rock carvings of Mount Bego (F) and Valcamonica (I), geometric patterns (dotted rectangles and lines) are widely interpreted[3][4] in archaeological literature as a plan depiction of cultivated plots.[5] Defined as \"topographic representations\" and well dated to the 4th millennium BC, they witness the introduction of the agriculture in the alpine territory.[6] Other known maps of the ancient world include the Minoan \"House of the Admiral\" wall painting from c. 1600 BCE, showing a seaside community in an oblique perspective and an engraved map of the holy Babylonian city of Nippur, from the Kassite period (14th – 12th centuries BCE).[7] The oldest surviving world maps are the Babylonian world maps from the 9th century BCE.[8] One shows Babylon on the Euphrates, surrounded by a circular landmass showing Assyria, Urartu[9] and several cities, in turn surrounded by a \"bitter river\" (Oceanus), with seven islands arranged around it.[10] Another depicts Babylon as being further north from the center of the world.[8]"]}}}
