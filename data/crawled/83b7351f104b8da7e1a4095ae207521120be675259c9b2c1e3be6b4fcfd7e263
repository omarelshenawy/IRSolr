The elements of S may appear in any order in the first row. This permutation could also be written as:"],"after":["Under this assumption, one may omit the first row and write the permutation in one-line notation as , that is, an ordered arrangement of S.[10][11] Care must be taken to distinguish one-line notation from the cycle notation described later. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the word representation of a permutation.[12] The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for the first row. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary combinatorics and computer science. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of S or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller."]}}}
