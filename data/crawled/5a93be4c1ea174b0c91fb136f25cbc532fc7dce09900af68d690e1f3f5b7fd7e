Winner of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2002, Lat has published more than 20 volumes of cartoons since he was 13 years old. His works mostly illustrate Malaysia's social and political scenes, portraying them in a comedic light without bias. Lat's best known work is The Kampung Boy (1979), which is published in several countries across the world. In 1998, Kampung Boy was made into a 26-episode TV series as a cooperative effort between ASTRO (Malaysia) Philippines Animated Studios Inc. (Philippines) and Matinee Entertainment (United States). A year later, an episode from the series entitled “Oh, Tok!” won a prestigious award for “Best TV series” for the 13-minutes and above category at the International Animation Film Festival in Annecy, France. Lat’s Kampung Boy cartoons were immortalised on Malaysian 30sen and 50sen stamps from 1 December 2008."]}}}
