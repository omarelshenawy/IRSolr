They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer and later criticized Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, after he negotiated Brin and Page down to $750,000. On June 7, 1999, a $25 million round of funding was announced,[54] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital.[53]"]}}}
