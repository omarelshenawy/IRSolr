Every Muslim proclaims in Shahadah that \"I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God\". The Shahadah is the basic creed or tenet of Islam. Islamic belief believes ideally the Shahadah is the first words a newborn will hear; children are taught it immediately and it will be recited upon death. Muslims repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer (adhan) and the prayer itself. Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.[253]"]}}}
