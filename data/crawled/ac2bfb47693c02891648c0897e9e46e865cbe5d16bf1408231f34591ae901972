Most importantly, he became a senator and later chancellor of the University of Alberta, whose earlier founding had been a personal project. As chancellor, he oversaw the graduation of more than five thousand students and welcome students into his home both for convocation day tea and to consult his enormous personal library of Canadiana (which found its way into the University's collection after his death). He died of a heart attack June 11, 1941, less than a year later than his wife. A University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and Jasper National Park's Mount Rutherford are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, Rutherford House, was opened as a museum in 1973."]}}}
