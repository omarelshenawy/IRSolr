Originally, it was an Arabic language abstract noun meaning \"strength\", \"authority\", \"rulership\" derived from the verbal noun سلطة sulṭah, meaning \"authority\" or \"power\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate."]}}}
