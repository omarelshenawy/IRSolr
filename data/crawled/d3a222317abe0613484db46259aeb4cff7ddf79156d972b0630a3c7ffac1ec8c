At first, puppies spend ninety percent of their time sleeping and the rest feeding. Puppies develop very quickly during their first three months, particularly after their eyes and ears open and they are no longer completely dependent on their mother. Puppies are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with either their mother or littermates. It is important that the puppy receive regular positive socialisation with other dogs and humans during the first sensitive period (eight to twelve weeks)."]}}}
