The Germans reasoned that a prolonged Uprising would damage their ability to hold Warsaw as the frontline; the Poles were concerned that continued resistance would result in further massive casualties. On 7 September, General Rohr proposed negotiations, which Bór-Komorowski agreed to pursue the following day.[137] Over 8, 9 and 10 September about 20,000 civilians were evacuated by agreement of both sides, and Rohr recognized the right of Home Army soldiers to be treated as military combatants.[138] The Poles suspended talks on the 11th, as they received news that the Soviets were advancing slowly through Praga.[139] A few days later, the arrival of the 1st Polish army breathed new life into the resistance and the talks collapsed.[140]"],"after":["However, by the morning of 27 September, the Germans had retaken Mokotów.[141] Talks restarted on 28 September.[142] In the evening of 30 September, Żoliborz fell to the Germans.[143] The Poles were being pushed back into fewer and fewer streets, and their situation was ever more desperate.[144] On the 30th, Hitler decorated von dem Bach, Dirlewanger and Reinefarth, while in London General Sosnkowski was dismissed as Polish commander-in-chief. Bór-Komorowski was promoted in his place, even though he was trapped in Warsaw.[145] Bór-Komorowski and Prime Minister Mikołajczyk again appealed directly to Rokossovsky and Stalin for a Soviet intervention.[146] None came. According to Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who was by this time at the Vistula front, both he and Rokossovsky advised Stalin against an offensive because of heavy Soviet losses.[147]"]}}}
