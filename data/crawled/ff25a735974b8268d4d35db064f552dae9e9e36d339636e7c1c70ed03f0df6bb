The region is home to the nations of Nepal, Bhutan, the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and the regions of Tibet, Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. The name is from Sanskrit himālaya, a tatpurusa compound meaning \"the abode of snow\" (from hima \"snow\", and ālaya \"abode\"; see also Himavat). Together, the Himalaya mountain system is the planet's highest and home to all fourteen of the world's highest peaks: the Eight-thousanders, including Mount Everest. The mountain ranges are the source of three of the world's major river systems, the Indus Basin, the Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin and the Yangtze Basin. The people of the Himalayan region are largely of Indo-Tibetan descent and distinctive religions include Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism."]}}}
