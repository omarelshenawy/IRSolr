He also thought the nickname fit with the school's colors.[19] Prior to Lake's creation of the nickname, sports writers used various others, including: “B.G. Normals,” “Teachers,” and the “B.G. Pedagogues\".[19] The school achieved the status of college in 1929 when the Emmons-Hanna Bill changed renamed it to Bowling Green State College (BGSC).[10][20] At the same time, the college expanded its curriculum through the addition of the College of Liberal Arts, now known as the College of Arts and Sciences.[9][21]"],"after":["Enrollment levels held steady into the Great Depression;[10] but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission proposed a plan to convert the school into a mental health institution.[22] Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal.[10] The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote.[10] A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and changed its name to Bowling Green State University. The university added the College of Business Administration to the existing College of Education and College of Liberal Arts.[23] Within a year BGSU added master’s degree programs in Education, English, History, Social Science and Mathematics.[10][23] In 1939, the university established The Committee for Gifts, Endowments, and Memorials, its first private endowment fund.[24]"]}}}
