The half-life of 14 C (the time it takes for half of a given amount of 14 C to decay) is about 5,730 years, so its concentration in the atmosphere might be expected to reduce over thousands of years, but 14 C is constantly being produced in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere by cosmic rays, which generate neutrons that in turn create 14 C when they strike nitrogen-14 (14 N) atoms.[5] The following nuclear reaction creates 14 C:"],"after":["where n represents a neutron and p represents a proton.[10]"]}}}
