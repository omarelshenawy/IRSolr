Almost every game in the franchise has had albums of music related to just that game. There has additionally been a set of Final Fantasy compilation albums of music from the series produced by Square Enix, as well as several albums produced by outside groups, both officially and unofficially licensed. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles, such as orchestral, piano, vocal, and techno. Nobuo Uematsu, the primary composer of the music for the first ten games of the main series, was heavily involved in the arrangement of many of the albums prior to his departure from the company in 2004."]}}}
