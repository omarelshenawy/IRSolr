Hence it was released as the fourth single from the album.[3] Music executive Jeff Ayeroff, who was instrumental in green-lighting Madonna's career, recalled how Madonna initially didn't want to release \"Lucky Star\" as a single. He says that around that time Madonna was getting sued and needed money, so he told her \"Let me release 'Lucky Star', and I guarantee that you'll sell enough records to pay that off.\" According to Ayeroff, he was right because \"Lucky star broke the first album wide open.\"[6][7]"],"after":["Author J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his biography of Madonna, called the song as \"fluffy, dance-able, but forgettable.\"[4] However he noted the song's ingenuity which he credited to come from its simplicity and dance-music nature.[5] Author Rikky Rooksby noted that Madonna had a \"cutesy\" voice in the song and compared her vocals with those of singer Cyndi Lauper's.[8] Author Simon Gage of the book Queer noted that the song was a \"happy disco number\".[10] The song was appreciated by authors Santiago Fouz-Hern√°ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens, who complimented it in their book Madonna's Drowned Worlds. They noted that with songs like \"Lucky Star\" and \"Burning Up\" (1983), Madonna introduced a \"style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences.\"[11] English tenor and academic John Potter, in his book The Cambridge companion to singing, commented that \"Lucky Star\" is a soft-soul, disco-influenced style song but criticized the song's reverb and double tracking which he believed made the song \"de-personalized\".[12] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the track had \"unknowingly prefaced her recent foray into the glittery halls of electronic-pop.\"[13] Bill Lamb from About.com described the song, along with \"Holiday\" and \"Borderline,\" as \"state of the art dance-pop.\"[14] While reviewing Madonna's 1990 compilation The Immaculate Collection, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly complimented the remixed version of the song.[15] Rock critique Robert Christgau, while reviewing The Immaculate Collection, called the song \"blessed\".[16] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic described the song as effervescent.[17]"]}}}
