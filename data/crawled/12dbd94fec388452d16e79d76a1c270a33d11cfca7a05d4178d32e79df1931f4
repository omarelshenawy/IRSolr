Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit and felt vindicated, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.[71]"],"after":["In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair, Tom Chappell, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded.[72] Two more operas resulted: Utopia, Limited (1893) and The Grand Duke (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (His Excellency, 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his proteg√©e from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal.[73] Utopia, concerning an attempt to \"anglicise\" a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and The Grand Duke, in which a theatrical troupe, by means of a \"statutory duel\" and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good.[74] Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, \"...Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one with whom I felt that I could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write libretti.\"[75]"]}}}
