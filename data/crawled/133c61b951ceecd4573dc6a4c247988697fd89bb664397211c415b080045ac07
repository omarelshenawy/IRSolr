When reporters asked Monroe if she felt guilty about Gable's death, she refused to answer,[135] but the journalist Sidney Skolsky recalled that privately she expressed regret for her poor treatment of Gable during filming and described her as being in \"a dark pit of despair\".[136] Monroe later attended the christening of the Gables' son, at the invitation of Kay Gable.[136]"],"after":["The Misfits received mixed reviews, and was not a commercial success, though some praised the performances of Monroe and Gable.[136] Despite on-set difficulties, Gable, Monroe, and Clift delivered performances that modern movie critics consider superb.[137] Many critics regard Gable's performance to be his finest, and Gable, after seeing the rough cuts, agreed.[138] Monroe received the 1961 Golden Globe Award as \"World Film Favorite\" in March 1962, five months before her death. Directors Guild of America nominated Huston as best director. The film is now regarded as a classic.

It was all the truth. It was only Marilyn.\"[136]"]}}}
