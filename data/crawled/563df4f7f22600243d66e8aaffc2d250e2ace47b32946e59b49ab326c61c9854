Originally released in 2001 for Sony's PlayStation 2, the game is currently scheduled for a high-definition re-release for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013. The game marks the Final Fantasy series transition from entirely pre-rendered backdrops to fully three-dimensional areas, and is also the first in the series to feature voice acting. Final Fantasy X replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the \"Sphere Grid\". The game's visual aesthetic is reminiscent of south-east Asia, a departure from previous games which had more elements of medieval Europe."]}}}
