In the late 19th century terminology, a non-magical item used to help create a more attractive appearance gradually became known as 'a glamour'.[1] Today, glamour is the impression of attraction or fascination that a particularly luxurious or elegant appearance creates, an impression which is better than the reality. Typically, a person, event, location, technology, or product such as a piece of clothing can be glamorous or add glamour."]}}}
