According to Crystal Bell of The Huffington Post, Madonna was able to portray a rich life like that in the 1960 film, La Dolce Vita.[56] Amanda Dobbins of New York gave props to Madonna for looking good in a leotard and for giving break to the young actors accompanying her in the video.[57] Brett Warner of the website Ology appreciated the vintage feel of the video writing: \"Heavy sigh. Remember a time when pop videos didn't have to shimmer and sparkle, when you didn't need choreographed dance routines or outlandish costumes? Remember when cars and cleavage was enough? Madonna clearly does.\"[58] Robbie Daw of Idolator agreed, writing that the video is \"the most fun visual [Madonna has] offered up in years... All in all, a fantastic video for one of the more mediocre tracks off MDNA.\"[59] Mark Hogan from Spin noted that the video appeared a literal take on the song's lyrics but the change of scenery to the Italian countryside and the party scenes made it endearing.[60] Melinda Newman from HitFix said that although the video did not live up to Madonna's other endeavors, it fit the \"carefree\" theme of the song. She found influences of Italian film director Federico Fellini's works, especially his 1957 release Nights of Cabiria, in the scene showing Madonna picking up prostitutes in her car.[61]"]}}}
