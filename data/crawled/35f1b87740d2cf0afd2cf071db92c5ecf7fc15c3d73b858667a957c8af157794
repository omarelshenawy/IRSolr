However, prior to that time artists as varied as the Beastie Boys, Kool Keith, Deltron 3030, MC 900 Ft. Jesus, MC Paul Barman, Company Flow, and MF Doom began exploring topics far outside of the traditional hip hop culture, including stereotypically \"nerdy\" topics like space and science fiction. Though these underground artists were generally outside of geek culture and are not considered nerdcore, they can be said to have set the stage for artists like Frontalot, who has listed several of them as influences. The Beastie Boys outer-space sci-fi themed album Hello Nasty in 1998; including, among other potentially influencing tracks, the spacey robotic Intergalactic and the distinctively video game sound themed song UNITE; garnered mainstream recognition years ahead of the popular movement. Nerdcore had clear influences from geek culture as well, including geek rockers like They Might Be Giants, parodists like \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (who released a rap called \"I Can't Watch This\" in 1992, as well as \"It's All About The Pentiums\" in 1999 and \"White & Nerdy\" in 2006), and others. Despite these influences, nerdcore has separated itself from other types of nerdy music thanks to an unofficial list of criteria that has evolved among fans and artists. Aside from making hip hop about geeky things, nerdcore is considered to be an \"opt-in\" genre. Only artists who consider themselves to be \"nerdcore\" should have the label attached to their music.[citation needed]"],"after":["In the summer of 2004 the fledgling genre took a large step forward when the popular web comic Penny Arcade held its first convention, The Penny Arcade Expo, in Bellevue, WA. Though the expo was primarily devoted to video and table top gaming, geek-friendly musicians also performed including Penny Arcade's \"official rapper\" MC Frontalot and Optimus Rhyme.[4]"]}}}
