A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a \"wiki page\", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well interconnected by hyperlinks, is \"the wiki\". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows non-linear, evolving, complex and networked text, argument and interaction.[9]"]}}}
