At least one of them was a member of a minority religious group! Some of the other listed victims appear to have been attacked for their political rather than their religious views. The list of victims itself therefore appears to be an example of WP:SYNTH. Consequently, I am struggling to see how this article can be promoted. Gatoclass (talk) 03:40, 10 May 2015 (UTC)"]}}}
