All texts collected are either free of copyright or released under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.[1] Texts in all languages are welcome, as are translations. In addition to texts, Wikisource hosts material such as comics, films, recordings and spoken-word works.[1] All texts held by Wikisource must have been previously published; the project does not host \"vanity press\" books or documents produced by its contributors.[1][14][15][16][17]"]}}}
