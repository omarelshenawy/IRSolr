In John, Jesus seems to confirm the fact of his kingship, although immediately explaining, that his \"kingdom\" was \"not of this world\"; of far greater importance for the followers of Christ is his own definition of the goal of his ministry on earth at the time. According to Jesus, as we find it written in John 18:37, Jesus thus describes his mission: \"[I] came into the world...to bear witness to the truth; and all who are on the side of truth listen to my voice\", to which Pilate famously replied, \"What is truth?\" (\"Quid est veritas?\") (John 18:38)..."],"after":["Whatever it be that some modern critics want to deduce from those differences, the end result was the same for Jesus and Pilate, as it was in all the other three Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke). In the same chapter of John 18 verse 38 (King James Version, compare with other versions) the conclusion Pilate made from this interrogation was: \"I find in him no fault at all\"."]}}}
