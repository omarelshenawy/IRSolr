Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the chakravala, or \"cyclic method\") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in Bhāskara II's Bīja-gaṇita (twelfth century).[26]"]}}}
