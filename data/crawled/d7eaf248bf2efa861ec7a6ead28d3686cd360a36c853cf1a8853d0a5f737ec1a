It took place on the evening and early morning of August 1 and August 2, 1798. French losses have been estimated to have been as high as 1,700 dead (including Brueys) and 3,000 captured. British losses were 218 dead. Although decisive, the victory did not prevent the French from conquering most of Egypt and parts of Syria."]}}}
