When one saves, that will display in the text as a footnote (e.g.[1][2]), and the source you keyed in will appear on the page in a collated, numbered list corresponding to the footnote numbers in the text, wherever a {{Reflist}} template or <references /> tag is present, usually in a section titled \"References\" or \"Notes\". If you are creating a new page, or adding references to a page that didn't previously have any, don't forget to add a references section with this display markup."],"after":["There are a number of tools available to help with citation placement and formatting, some of which are internal tools and scripts while others are available from external sites. For an example of the former, RefToolbar is a JavaScript toolbar displayed above the edit box that provides the ability to automatically fill out various citation templates and insert them in the text already formatting inside <ref> ... </ref> tags. For an example of the latter, the Wikipedia citation tool for Google Books converts a Google Books URL into a filled-out {{cite book}} template ready to be pasted into an article. See Help:Citation tools for many others."]}}}
