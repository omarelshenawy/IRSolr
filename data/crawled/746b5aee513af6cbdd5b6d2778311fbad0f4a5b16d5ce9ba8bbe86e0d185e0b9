He expressed the solution to the problem as an infinite geometric series with the common ratio 1⁄4:"],"after":["If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller secant lines, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · · which sums to 1⁄3."]}}}
