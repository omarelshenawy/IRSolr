These strongholds became known as the Five Boroughs. Borough derives from the Old English word burh (cognate with German Burg, meaning castle), meaning a fortified and walled enclosure containing several householdsâ€”anything from a large stockade to a fortified town. The meaning has since developed further."]}}}
