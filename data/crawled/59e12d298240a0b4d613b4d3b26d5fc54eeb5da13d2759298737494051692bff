Mount Augustus, claimed to be the world's largest monolith,[139] is located in Western Australia. At 2,228 metres (7,310 ft), Mount Kosciuszko on the Great Dividing Range is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland. Even taller are Mawson Peak (at 2,745 metres or 9,006 feet), on the remote Australian territory of Heard Island, and, in the Australian Antarctic Territory, Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies, at 3,492 metres (11,457 ft) and 3,355 metres (11,007 ft) respectively.[140]"],"after":["Australia's size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre.[141] It is the flattest continent,[142] with the oldest and least fertile soils;[143][144] desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land.[145] The driest inhabited continent, its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500 mm.[146] The population density, 2.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, is among the lowest in the world,[147] although a large proportion of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline.[148]"]}}}
