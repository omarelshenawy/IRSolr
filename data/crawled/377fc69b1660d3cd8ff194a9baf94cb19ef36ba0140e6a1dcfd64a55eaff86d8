In August 2012, ARENA[254] estimated that about 46.8% of Russians are Christians (including Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, and non-denominational), which is slightly less than an absolute 50%+ majority. However, later that year, the Levada Center estimated that 76% of Russians are Christians,[255] and in June 2013, the Public Opinion Foundation[256] estimated that 65% of Russians are Christians. These findings are in line with Pew Research Center's 2011 survey,[257] which estimated that 73.6% of Russians are Christians, with Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM)'s 2010 survey (~77% Christian),[258] and with Ipsos MORI's 2011 survey (69%).[259] Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism are Russia's traditional religions, and are all legally a part of Russia's \"historical heritage\".[260]"]}}}
