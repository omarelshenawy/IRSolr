This form of t-glottalization (especially the /tən/ form) is found commonly in other parts of the country as well (including General American), like in the word \"button\" or \"Clinton\" ; however, the characteristic is most prevalent in New England. Nevertheless, even in New England the extent of this varies. Some may have it in \"button\" or \"fountain\", but not in \"Clinton\" or \"Downton.\" In the end, it has significant idiolectal variation."],"after":[]}}}
