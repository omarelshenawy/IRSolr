Honorific nicknames were used in classical music in Europe as early as the early nineteenth century, with figures like Mozart being called \"The father of modern music\" and Bach \"The father of modern piano music\".[1] They were also particularly prominent in African American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery,[2] and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.[3]"]}}}
