It features the new 3D rendering of the puzzle globe, with corrected characters (and the Klingon character replaced by a Geʿez character). The wordmark has been modified from the Hoefler Text font to the open-source Linux Libertine font, and the subtitle is no longer italicized. The \"W\" character, which was used in various other places in Wikipedia (such as the favicon) and was a \"distinctive part of the Wikipedia brand\", was stylized as crossed V's in the original logo, ⟨W⟩, while the W in Linux Libertine is rendered with a single line. To provide the traditional appearance of the Wikipedia \"W\", a \"crossed\" W was added as an OpenType variant to the Linux Libertine font.[1]"],"after":[]}}}
