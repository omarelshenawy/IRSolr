This altitude, known as the Kármán line, was chosen by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale because it is roughly the point where a vehicle flying fast enough to support itself with aerodynamic lift from the Earth's atmosphere would be flying faster than orbital speed.[2] The US military and NASA award astronaut wings to those flying above 50 miles[3] (80.47 km), although the US State Department appears to not support a distinct boundary between atmospheric flight and space flight.[4]"]}}}
