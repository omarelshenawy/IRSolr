In current usage it typically denotes a criminal organization or else a criminal affiliation. In early usage, the word gang referred to a group of workmen. In the United Kingdom the word is still often used in this sense, but it later underwent pejoration. The word gang often carries a negative connotation; however, within a gang which defines itself in opposition to mainstream norms, members may adopt the phrase as a statement of identity or defiance. Reports of gang-related homicides are concentrated mostly in the largest cities in the United States, where there are long-standing and persistent gang problems and a greater number of documented gang membersâ€”most of whom are identified by law enforcement. Gang is from the past participle of Old English gan \"to go\". It is cognate with Old Norse gangr \"a group of men\", and it is in this sense that the word is used today."]}}}
