Survival without water is usually limited to three or four days. About 36 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to hunger.[114] Childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the global burden of disease.[115] However global food distribution is not even, and obesity among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and increased mortality in some developed, and a few developing countries. Worldwide over one billion people are obese,[116] while in the United States 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an \"obesity epidemic\".[117] Obesity is caused by consuming more calories than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by a combination of an energy-dense high fat diet and insufficient exercise.[116]"],"after":["No two humans – not even monozygotic twins – are genetically identical. Genes and environment influence human biological variation from visible characteristics to physiology to disease susceptibly to mental abilities. The exact influence of genes and environment on certain traits is not well understood.[118][119]"]}}}
