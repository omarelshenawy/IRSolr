The devices can be separated by a few meters and connected wirelessly (e.g. via Bluetooth) or thousands of kilometers and connected ultimately by terabit backbone networks (on the global Internet). Computer networking is considered a sub-discipline of telecommunications, and often also of computer science, information technology and computer engineering especially where these are concerned with parallel processing."]}}}
