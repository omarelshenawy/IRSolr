Immediately after the blast, the two lead-lined Sherman tanks made their way to the crater. Radiochemical analysis of soil samples that they collected indicated that the yield had been around 18.6 kilotons of TNT (78 TJ).[102] Fifty beryllium-copper diaphragm microphones were used to record the pressure of the shock wave. These were supplemented by mechanical pressure gauges.[103] These indicated a yield of 9.9 kilotons of TNT (41 TJ) ± 0.1 kilotons of TNT (0.42 TJ). Only one of the mechanical pressure gauges worked correctly; it indicated 10 kilotons of TNT (42 TJ). [104] There were several gamma ray and neutron detectors, although few survived the blast, with all the gauges within 200 feet (61 m) of ground zero being destroyed,[105] but enough data was recovered to measure the gamma ray component of the ionizing radiation.[106]"]}}}
