In some schools they practice asceticism in the mountains and alchemy, with the aim of becoming xian, \"mountain men\" or \"holy men\".","The activities of the daoshi tend to be informed by materials which may be found in the Daozang, or Daoist canon; however, daoshi generally choose, or inherit, specific texts which have been passed down for generations from teacher to student, rather than consulting published versions of these works.
