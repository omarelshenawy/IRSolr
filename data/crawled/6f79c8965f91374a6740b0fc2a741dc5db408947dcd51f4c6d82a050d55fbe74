These areas of mathematics related directly to the development of Newtonian physics, and in fact, the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century. This history left a pedagogical legacy in the United States: until the early 20th century, subjects such as classical mechanics were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities rather than in physics departments, and fluid mechanics may still be taught in applied mathematics departments.[1] Quantitative finance is now taught in mathematics departments across universities and mathematical finance is considered a full branch of applied mathematics.[2] Engineering and computer science departments have traditionally made use of applied mathematics."]}}}
