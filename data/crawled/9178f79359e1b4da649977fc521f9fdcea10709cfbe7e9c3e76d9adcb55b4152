In the upper classes, slaves and servants were also part of the household.[168] The power of the head of the household was supreme (patria potestas, \"father's power\") over those living with him: He could force marriage (usually for money) and divorce, sell his children into slavery, claim his dependents' property as his own, and even had the right to punish or kill family members (though this last right apparently ceased to be exercised after the 1st century BC).[169]"]}}}
