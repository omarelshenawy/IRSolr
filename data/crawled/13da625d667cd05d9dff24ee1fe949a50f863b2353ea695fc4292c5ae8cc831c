The inductees in this category are selected by the same committee that chooses the early influences. The full process is not transparent and it is unclear who comprises this selection committee.[2] This category has been criticized for inducting those that have \"been coming to the dinner for years and paying for their tickets\" and not revealing their full criteria.[121] In 2008, this category was renamed the \"Ahmet Erteg√ºn Award\".[122]"]}}}
