George \"didn't think it worth reading\".[43]"],"after":["Whitman paid for the publication of the first edition of Leaves of Grass himself[43] and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs.[44] A total of 795 copies were printed.[45] No name is given as author; instead, facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer,[46] but 500 lines into the body of the text he calls himself \"Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest\".[47] The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines. The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 linesâ€”1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem, later called \"Song of Myself\". The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote a flattering five-page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends.[48] The first edition of Leaves of Grass was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest,[49] in part due to Emerson's approval,[50] but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly \"obscene\" nature of the poetry.[51] Geologist John Peter Lesley wrote to Emerson, calling the book \"trashy, profane & obscene\" and the author \"a pretentious ass\".[52] On July 11, 1855, a few days after Leaves of Grass was published, Whitman's father died at the age of 65.[53]"]}}}
