Recognition by historians of these older states as superpowers may focus on various superlative traits exhibited by them. Examples of these ancient or historic superpowers include; Ancient Egypt,[12] the Persian Empire,[13] the Greek Empire of Alexander the Great,[14] the Roman Empire,[15] the Mongol Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Portuguese Empire, the Spanish Empire,[16] and the First French Empire of Napoleon.[17]"]}}}
