However, when the monarch dies, the successor to the crown does not automatically become Head of the Commonwealth.[24] The position is symbolic, representing the free association of independent members,[23] the majority of which (32) are republics, and five have monarchs of different royal houses (Brunei, Lesotho, Malaysia, Swaziland, and Tonga)."]}}}
