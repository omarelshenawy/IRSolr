Waffen-SS Gebirgsdivision der SS Skanderbeg (albanische Nr.1)[24][25] on 1 May 1944[26] as part of the XXI Mountain Corps. Most or all of the division's officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and specialists were German,[16][21] and were mainly provided by the 7th and 13th SS Divisions, which noticeably weakened those formations.[27] The divisional artillery regiment was formed from the 1st Albanian Artillery Regiment.[26] The division was placed under the command of SS-Standartenführer (Colonel) August Schmidhuber,[28] who was promoted to SS-Oberführer (senior colonel) in June. Estimates of the size of the division range from 6,000[25] to 6,500[29][30] men. Members took a religious oath using the Quran, pledging \"jihad against unbelievers.\"[31] The division was originally equipped with captured Italian Carro Armato M15/42 tanks, which proved to be unreliable.[32] Its garrison was located in the town of Prizren.[33]"],"after":["Early on, it became clear that most of the division's Muslim Albanian members seemed to be interested only in settling scores with their Christian Serb adversaries, who became the target of numerous atrocities.[11] In order to put a stop to the crimes, the Germans had to disarm battalions of the division in the towns of Peć and Prizren and arrest the Albanian officers, with one commanding officer even being sent to prison in Germany.[16] On 14 May 1944,[34] members of the division raided Jewish homes in Pristina, arrested 281 Jews and handed them over to the Germans, who sent them to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed.[33][35][36][37][38] Historian Noel Malcolm describes this event as \"the most shameful episode in Kosovo's wartime history.\"[39] The division was later involved in a massacre of Albanian partisans.[40] It was generally better known for murdering, raping, and looting, mainly in ethnic Serb areas,[16] and for arresting Jews, than for participating in combat operations on behalf of the German war effort.[41] In addition to indiscriminately killing Serbs and Montenegrins, the division was responsible for the expulsion of up to 10,000 Slavic families from Kosovo as new Albanian settlers arrived from the poor areas of northern Albania.[42] The arrival of these Albanians was encouraged by Italian authorities, and it is estimated that as many as 72,000 Albanians were settled or re-settled in Kosovo during the war.[7] Between 28 May and 5 July 1944, the division apprehended a total of 510 Jews, communists and other anti-fascists and turned them over to the Germans. It also carried out retaliatory hangings of suspected saboteurs.[22]"]}}}
