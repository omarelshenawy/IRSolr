O'Brien noted how the film revealed a \"strange isolation at the cost of stardom\" from Madonna.[34] She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her \"fat Italian thighs\" and also the performance in rain at Dublin.[4] O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was \"affected\" by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals.[4] Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she \"revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years\".[35] Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as \"Fascinating, [it has] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with [Ritchie], which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us.\"[36] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director \"squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance\", but commented that \"she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour\". However, he complimented saying \"Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's more to life than fame and fortune – something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' is a bad thing. But it's good to see an entertainer who, 20 years into her career, is still trying to change the world\".[37]"],"after":["Barry Walters from Rolling Stone mentioned that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret \"lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles to become a less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person.\"[38] Darryl Sterdan from Jam! gave it three out of five stars, saying that \"it still sucks to sit through all that video and see almost as much of her limo as her show... For a start, how about giving us a [movie] that isn't derivative and self-indulgent?\"[39] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. \"Fans like me will be able to essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse behind the curtain at Madonna on the road,\" he added.[40] This view was shared by a reviewer from Lexington Herald-Leader who confessed that he did not enjoy the documentary except the live performances, since he saw Madonna only as an \"entertainer\" and not as a \"preacher\".[41]"]}}}
