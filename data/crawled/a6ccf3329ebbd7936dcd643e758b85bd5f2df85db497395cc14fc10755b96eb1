Sexual reproduction may be a prerequisite for specialization of cells, as an asexual multicellular organism might be at risk of being taken over by rogue cells that retain the ability to reproduce.[56][57]"],"after":["The earliest known animals are cnidarians from about 580 million years ago, but these are so modern-looking that the earliest animals must have appeared before then.[58] Early fossils of animals are rare because they did not develop mineralized hard parts that fossilize easily until about 548 million years ago.[59] The earliest modern-looking bilaterian animals appear in the Early Cambrian, along with several \"weird wonders\" that bear little obvious resemblance to any modern animals. There is a long-running debate about whether this Cambrian explosion was truly a very rapid period of evolutionary experimentation; alternative views are that modern-looking animals began evolving earlier but fossils of their precursors have not yet been found, or that the \"weird wonders\" are evolutionary \"aunts\" and \"cousins\" of modern groups.[60] Vertebrates remained an obscure group until the first fish with jaws appeared in the Late Ordovician.[61][62]"]}}}
