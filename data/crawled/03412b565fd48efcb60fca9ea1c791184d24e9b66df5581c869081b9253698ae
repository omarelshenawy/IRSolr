Geometry is one of the two fields of pre-modern mathematics, the other being the study of numbers.","In modern times, geometric concepts have been extended. They sometimes show a high level of abstraction and complexity. Geometry now uses methods of calculus and abstract algebra, so that many modern branches of the field are not easily recognizable as the descendants of early geometry. (See areas of mathematics.) A geometer is one who works or is specialized in geometry."]}}}
