The length of the SI second was calibrated on the basis of the second of ephemeris time[33][37] and can now be seen to have a relationship with the mean solar day observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by Simon Newcomb. As a result, the SI second is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day in the mid‑19th century.[42] In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter than 86,400 SI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds. Near the end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known simply as \"length of day\" or \"LOD\") was approximately 86,400.0013 s.[43] For this reason, UT is now \"slower\" than TAI by the difference (or \"excess\" LOD) of 1.3 ms/day."]}}}
