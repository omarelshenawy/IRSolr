They cease to function as accessible genetic material (transcription stops) and become a compact transportable form. This compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four arm structure, a pair of sister chromatids attached to each other at the centromere. The shorter arms are called p arms (from the French petit, small) and the longer arms are called q arms (q follows p in the Latin alphabet; q-g \"grande\"; alternatively it is sometimes said q is short for queue meaning tail in French[17]). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical microscope."]}}}
