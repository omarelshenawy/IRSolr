Estimates of the number of lacto vegetarians in India (includes adherents of all religions) vary between 20% and 42%.[148] The food habits vary with the community and region: for example, some castes having fewer vegetarians and coastal populations relying on seafood.[149][web 8] Some avoid meat only on specific holy days. Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef. The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure,[150] and Hindu society honours the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving.[151]"]}}}
