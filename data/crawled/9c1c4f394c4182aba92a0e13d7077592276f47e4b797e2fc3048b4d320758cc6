The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the Vinča culture (5500–4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Starčevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vinča-Belo Brdo). The Vinča culture is known for its very large settlements, some of the largest in prehistoric Europe;[21] anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vinča; the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe;[22] and the Vinča symbols."],"after":[]}}}
