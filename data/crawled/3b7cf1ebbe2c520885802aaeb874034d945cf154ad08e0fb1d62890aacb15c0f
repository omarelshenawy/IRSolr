Li encompasses not a definitive object but rather a somewhat abstract idea; as such, it is translated in a number of different ways. Most often, li is described using some form of the word \"rite\" or \"reason\", \"ratio\" in the pure sense of Vedic ṛta, but it has also been translated as \"custom\", \"mores\", and \"rules of proper behavior\", among other terms."]}}}
