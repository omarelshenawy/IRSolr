In an interview with CNN, she said, \"Guy Oseary, my partner at Maverick [Records], was given a demo by a French artist called Mirwais,\" she said. \"[He] slipped it to me and said, 'What do you think [of him] as an artist to sign at Maverick?' [...] I just said 'Oh my God, this is what I want.' I just flipped over it and said, 'Please find out if he wants to work with me.'\"[8] Madonna said that the producer is a \"genius\".[9] She also commented about working with Ahmadzaï and the other producers of the album: \"I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound.\"[10] In an interview with MTV's Total Request Live, she said Ahmadzaï was \"really influenced by 1970s funk and R&B\" and said that the album was \"more electronic than her last record, but it is edgier and a bit funkier.\"[11] Talking about the inspiration behind Music, Madonna said that the album was \"To join the coldness or the remoteness of living in the machine age in the world of high technology with warmth and compassion and a sense of humor. [...] Music is supposed to be a reflection of what's going on in society, and as far as I'm concerned, we've become too complacent.\"[12]"]}}}
