It is formed by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp in a process known as dentinogenesis. Dentin has a complex structure, with microscopic channels, called dentinal \"tubules,\" radiating outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. These tubules have different configurations in different species and ranges between 0.8 and 2.2 micrometers."]}}}
