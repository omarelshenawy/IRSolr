It was first used in the early 17th century, borrowed via the French culte, from Latin cultus (worship). This, in turn, was derived from the adjective cultus (inhabited, cultivated, worshiped), based on the verb colere (care, cultivate).[9] The word \"culture\" is also derived from the Latin words cultura and cultus, which in general terms refers to the customary beliefs, social forms and material traits of a racial, religious or social group.[10] Most of the Romance languages currently use various spellings of the word \"cult\" (such as \"culto\") to refer to worship or sometimes to a ritual without any pejorative meaning at all, resulting in a class of false friends.[citation needed]"]}}}
