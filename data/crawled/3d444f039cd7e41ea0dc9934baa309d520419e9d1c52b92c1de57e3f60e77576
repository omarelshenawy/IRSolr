The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's surrogate father, and had a profound influence on him, especially in developing a love for musical theatre. It was at the opening of South Pacific, the musical Hammerstein wrote with Richard Rodgers, that Sondheim met Harold Prince, who would later direct many of Sondheim's shows. While at George School, Sondheim wrote a comic musical based on the goings-on of his school, entitled By George. It was a major success among his peers, and it considerably buoyed the young songwriter's ego; he took it to Hammerstein, and asked him to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author. Hammerstein said it was the worst thing he had ever seen. \"But if you want to know why it's terrible,\" Hammerstein offered, \"I'll tell you.\" The rest of the day was spent going over the musical, and Sondheim would later say that \"in that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime.\"[12]"]}}}
