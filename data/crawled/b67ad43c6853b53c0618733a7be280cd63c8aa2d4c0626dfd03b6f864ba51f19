It was located on the Via Nova, below the Porta Mugonia, ancient entrance to the Palatine.[48] Legend has attributed its founding to Romulus.[49] There may have been an earlier shrine (fanum), since the Jupiter's cult is attested epigraphically.[50] Ovid places the temple's dedication on June 27, but it is unclear whether this was the original date,[51] or the rededication after the restoration by Augustus.[52]"],"after":["A second temple of Iuppiter Stator was built and dedicated by Quintus Caecilus Metellus Macedonicus after his triumph in 146 BC near the Circus Flaminius. It was connected to the restored temple of Iuno Regina with a portico (porticus Metelli).[53]"]}}}
