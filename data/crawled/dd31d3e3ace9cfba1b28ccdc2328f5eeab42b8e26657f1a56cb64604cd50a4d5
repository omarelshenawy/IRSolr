Occasionally videos were made in a non-representational form, in which the musical artist was not shown. Because music videos are mainly intended to promote the artist, such videos are comparatively rare; three early 1980s examples are Bruce Springsteen's \"Atlantic City\", directed by Arnold Levine, David Mallet's video for David Bowie and Queen's \"Under Pressure\", and Ian Emes' video for Duran Duran's \"The Chauffeur\". One notable later example of the non-representational style is Bill Konersman's innovative 1987 video for Prince's \"Sign o' the Times\"[31] â€“ influenced by Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" clip, it featured only the text of the song's lyrics."],"after":["In 1983, the most successful, influential and iconic music video of all time was released: the nearly 14-minute-long video for Michael Jackson's song \"Thriller\", directed by John Landis. The video set new standards for production, having cost US$800,000 to film.[32][33] The video for \"Thriller\", along with earlier videos by Jackson for his songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\", were instrumental in getting music videos by African American artists played on MTV. Prior to Jackson's success, videos by African-American artists were rarely played on MTV: according to MTV, this was because it initially conceived itself as a rock-music-oriented channel, although musician Rick James was outspoken in his criticism of the cable channel, claiming in 1983 that MTV's refusal to air the music video for his song \"Super Freak\" and clips by other African-American performers was \"blatant racism\".[34]"]}}}
