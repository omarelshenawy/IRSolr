Successive gifts by record companies and individuals led to the formal creation of a separate division with the opening of the building at Lincoln Center in 1965. It was named in honor of a generous gift from the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization.[26] Radio station WQXR donated 11,000 78 rpm recordings in 1966.[27] Carleton Sprague Smith envisioned the purpose of the sound archive as \"stimulating interest among recording and broadcasting executives, as well as other arts institutions that had potential for playing a cooperative role.\"[28]"]}}}
