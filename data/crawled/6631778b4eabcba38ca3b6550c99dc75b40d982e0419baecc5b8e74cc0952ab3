It spans 403.80 miles (649.85 km) across the state of Washington, and is the only numbered highway to span the entire state from west to east, starting near the Pacific Ocean, and crossing the Idaho state line near Clarkston. It crosses the Cascade Range over White Pass, south of Mount Rainier National Park. Portions of it are concurrent with Interstate 5 (I-5) and Interstate 82 (I-82), although the majority of the route does not parallel any Interstate Highway. Although US 12 was not extended into Washington until 1967, portions of it have been part of Washington's state highway system since as early as 1905."]}}}
