These placed the active, rational human subject at the center of the cognitive and moral worlds. With regard to knowledge, Kant argued against David Hume and other philosophers in his Critique of Pure Reason [2] that the rational order of the world as known by science could never be accounted for merely by the fortuitous accumulation of sense perceptions. It was instead the product of the rule-based activity of \"synthesis\" , to which he asserted the concept of synthetic a priori knowledge[3]."]}}}
