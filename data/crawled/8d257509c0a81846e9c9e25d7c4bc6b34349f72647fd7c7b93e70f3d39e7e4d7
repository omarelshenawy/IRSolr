Edward denied this to his father, despite his staff seeing them in bed together as well as \"evidence of a physical sexual act\".[42] Wallis soon ousted Lady Furness, and the Prince distanced himself from a former lover and confidante, the Anglo-American textile heiress Freda Dudley Ward.[43]"],"after":["By the end of 1934, Edward was irretrievably besotted with Wallis, finding her domineering manner and abrasive irreverence toward his position appealing; in the words of his official biographer, he became \"slavishly dependent\" on her.[18] According to Wallis, it was during a cruise on Lord Moyne's private yacht Rosaura in August 1934 that she fell in love with Edward.[44] At an evening party in Buckingham Palace, he introduced her to his motherâ€”his father was outraged,[45] primarily on account of her marital history, as divorced people were generally excluded from court.[46] Edward showered Wallis with money and jewels,[47] and in February 1935, and again later in the year, he holidayed with her in Europe.[48] His courtiers became increasingly alarmed as the affair began to interfere with his official duties.[49]"]}}}
