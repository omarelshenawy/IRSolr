Characters have been shown attending seminars, and having negative outcomes as a result. Mork & Mindy dealt with this in a lighter fashion, dealing with a small introduction of individuals to the training in a home environment, in season one, episode seventeen: \"Mork Goes Erk.\"[41] In the episode, David Letterman portrayed an Erhard-like character by the name of \"Ellsworth\" offering ERK or Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning.[40] In a 1982 article in the journal Theory & Society, Lewis & Clark College sociology professor Robert Goldman compared and contrasted Letterman's \"Ellsworth\" character and his training program to that of Werner Erhard. Goldman noted that the episode spent time: \"lampooning Werner Erhard and est-like commercial pop psychologies.\" However, Goldman went on to note that the inherent problem with \"Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning\" was not the training - but Ellsworth himself. Ellsworth is seen not just as a parody of Werner Erhard, but also of consumerism: \"As the self-help entrepreneur, Ellsworth is portrayed as a walking collection of lifestyle-status points and sign-values (\"I've got my Rolls-Royce!\"). Conspicuous consumption and commodity fetishism define his personality.\" Goldman explained that the Mork and Mindy episode succeeded in distinguishing between criticism of the Ellsworth training, and criticism of Ellsworth, citing Ellsworth's character traits of: \"tyranny, selfishness, open greed, and flaunting of the accoutrements of his vulgar money-making.\" In the end of the segment of the episode parodying est, Mork wins out over the Ellsworth philosophy by instead calling to mind universal humanistic moral values.[40] David Letterman received positive praise for his portrayal of \"Ellsworth\" in the episode.[42][43][44]"]}}}
