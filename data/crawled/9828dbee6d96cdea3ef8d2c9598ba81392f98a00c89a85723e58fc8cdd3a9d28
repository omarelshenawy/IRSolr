Technically, the refrain may be considered anything that's not the verse....a song part that contains the hook or title and appears more than once in a song is usually called 'a chorus.'\"[7] \"The chorus contains the main idea, or big picture, of what is being expressed lyrically and musically. It is repeated throughout the song, and the melody and lyric rarely vary.\"[1] A refrain is, \"a repeated line or musical phrase that ties a song together...A refrain is only a phrase, or a word, while a chorus contains many more words.\"[8] A refrain may be defined as a repetitive phrase or phrases that serve the function of a chorus lyrically but are not placed in a separate section and/or long enough so as to be considered a chorus.[4] For example, refrains are found in AC/DC's \"You Shook Me All Night Long\", Paul Simon's \"The Sound of Silence\", and \"Deck the Halls\" (\"fa la la la la\").[8]"]}}}
