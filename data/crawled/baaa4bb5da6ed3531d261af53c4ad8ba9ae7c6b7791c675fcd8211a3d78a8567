They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies, often tumultuous interpersonal relationships, political activism, and lasting influence on music and culture. With Graham Nash's 2010 induction as a member of the Hollies, all four members of CSNY have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. Initially formed by the trio of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, the genesis of the group lies in two 1960s rock bands, The Byrds and The Hollies, and the demise of a third, Buffalo Springfield."]}}}
