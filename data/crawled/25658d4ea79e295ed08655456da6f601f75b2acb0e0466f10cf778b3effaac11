Although it was not known how devastating the explosions and the aftermath would be, Truman, like most Americans, was not inclined to be merciful toward the Japanese in the wake of the long years of war. Truman always said that his decision to attack Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties. He also knew that such an invasion program could cost $2 billion, and so he was not inclined to forgo an alternative that might quickly end the war. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later. When the Japanese were still slow to surrender, Truman ordered a massive conventional air raid on Tokyo for August 13; Japan agreed to surrender the following day.[67][68]"],"after":["Supporters[a] of Truman's decision argue that, given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands, the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives that would have been lost invading mainland Japan. Others have argued that the use of nuclear weapons was unnecessary and inherently immoral.[69] Years after the bombings, Truman strongly defended them in his memoirs in 1955-56, stating that many lives could have been lost had the U.S. invaded mainland Japan. In 1963 he stood by his decision, telling a journalist \"it was done to save 125,000 youngsters on the American side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life.\"[70]"]}}}
