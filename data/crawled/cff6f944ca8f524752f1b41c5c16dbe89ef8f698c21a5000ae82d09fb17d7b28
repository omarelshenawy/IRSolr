Two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.[1] For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a point that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not."]}}}
