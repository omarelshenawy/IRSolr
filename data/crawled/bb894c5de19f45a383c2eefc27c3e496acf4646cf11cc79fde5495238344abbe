In spite of the recent global economic crisis, Italian per capita GDP at purchasing power parity remains approximately equal to the EU 27 average,[108] while the unemployment rate (12.6%) stands slightly above the Eurozone average.[109] The country is well known for its creative and innovative business,[110] a large and competitive agricultural sector[111] (Italy is the world's largest wine producer),[112] and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, food, design and fashion industry.[113][114][115]"],"after":["Italy is the world's sixth largest manufacturing country,[116] characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and a large number of dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises, notoriously clustered in several industrial districts, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products.[117]"]}}}
