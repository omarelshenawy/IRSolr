It was originally referred to as \"emocore\", an abbreviation of \"emotive hardcore\".[343] Jimmy Eat World took emo in a radio-ready pop punk direction,[344] and had top ten albums in 2004 and 2007."],"after":["In the 1990s, the queercore movement developed around a number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, or bisexual members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, The Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, gender identity, and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.[345]"]}}}
