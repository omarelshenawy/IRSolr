Much of the month of February was devoted to purifications, propitiation, and veneration of the dead, especially at the nine-day festival of the Parentalia during which a family honored its ancestors. The family visited the cemetery and shared cake and wine, both in the form of offerings to the dead and as a meal among themselves. The Parentalia drew to a close on February 21 with the more somber Feralia, a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the Manes, the potentially malevolent spirits of the dead who required propitiation.[2] One of the most common inscriptional phrases on Latin epitaphs is Dis Manibus, abbreviated D.M, \"for the Manes gods,\" which appears even on some Christian tombstones. The Caristia on February 22 was a celebration of the family line as it continued into the present.[3]"]}}}
