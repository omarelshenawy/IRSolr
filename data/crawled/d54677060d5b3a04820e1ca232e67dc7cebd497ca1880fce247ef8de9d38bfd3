An expression (word, phrase) that by implication suggests the likeness of one entity to another entity gives style to an item of speech or writing, whether the entities consist of objects, events, ideas, activities, attributes, or almost anything expressible in language. For example, in the first sentence of this paragraph, the word \"viewed\" serves as a metaphor for \"thought of\", implying analogy of the process of seeing and the thought process. The phrase, \"viewed as an aspect of\", projects the properties of seeing (vision) something from a particular perspective onto thinking about something from a particular perspective, that \"something\" in this case referring to \"metaphor\" and that \"perspective\" in this case referring to the characteristics of speech and writing."]}}}
