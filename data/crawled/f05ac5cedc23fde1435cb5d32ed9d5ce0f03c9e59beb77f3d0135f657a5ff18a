Mathematical probability theory arose from the study of games of chance, although the concept of probability was already examined in medieval law and by philosophers such as Juan Caramuel.[26] The method of least squares was first described by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805."],"after":["The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.[27] The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of Sir Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions to the field included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics â€“ height, weight, eyelash length among others.[28] Pearson developed the Correlation coefficient, defined as a product-moment,[29] the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson's system of continuous curves, among many other things.[30] Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biometry, and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.[31]"]}}}
