His conscience is tortured by the lie that he told the pirates, and the girls attempt to console him (\"Oh dry the glist'ning tear\"). The Sergeant of Police and his corps arrive to announce their readiness to arrest the pirates (\"When the foeman bares his steel\"). The girls loudly express their admiration of the police for facing likely slaughter at the hands of fierce and merciless foes. The police are unnerved by this but finally leave."],"after":["Left alone, Frederic, who is to lead the police, reflects on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy (\"Now for the pirate's lair\"), at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King. They have realised that Frederic's apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty-first birthday â€“ and, because that birthday happens to be on 29 February (in a leap year), it means that technically only five birthdays have passed (\"When you had left our pirate fold\"), and he will not reach his twenty-first birthday until he is in his eighties. Frederic is convinced by this logic and agrees to rejoin the pirates. He then sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major-General's deception. The outraged outlaw declares that the pirates' \"revenge will be swift and terrible\" (\"Away, away, my heart's on fire\")."]}}}
