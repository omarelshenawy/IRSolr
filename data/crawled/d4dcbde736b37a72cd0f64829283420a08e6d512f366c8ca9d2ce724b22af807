Recent studies involve comparing DNA to examine both the variation in the expression of the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes of sexual dimorphism. Primates usually have dimorphism in body mass[76][77] and canine tooth size[78][79] along with pelage and skin color.[80] The dimorphism can be attributed to and affected by different factors, including mating system,[81] size,[81] habitat and diet.[82]"]}}}
