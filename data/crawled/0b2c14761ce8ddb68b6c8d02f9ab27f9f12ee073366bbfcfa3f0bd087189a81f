She is joined by Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo, who remind her of the limited nature of her impending union. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up (\"Brightly dawns our wedding-day\"), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting (the only crime so punished), his wife must be buried alive (\"Here's a how-de-do\"). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that Ko-Ko has never executed anyone, not even a Blue bottle, and cannot execute Nanki-Poo, because the ex-tailor is too soft-hearted. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising to present to the Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution."],"after":["The Mikado and Katisha arrive in Titipu accompanied by a large procession (\"Mi-ya Sa-Ma\", \"From Every Kind of Man\"). The Mikado describes his system of justice (\"A more humane Mikado\"). Ko-Ko assumes that he has come to see whether an execution has been carried out. Aided by Pitti-Sing and Pooh-Bah, he gives a graphic description of the supposed execution (\"The criminal cried\") and hands the Mikado the certificate of death—signed and sworn to by Pooh-Bah as coroner and noting, slyly, that most of the town's important officers (that is, Pooh-Bah) were present at the \"ceremony\". However, the Mikado has come about an entirely different matter—he is searching for his son. When they hear that the Mikado's son \"goes by the name of Nanki-Poo\", the three panic, and Ko-Ko says that Nanki-Poo \"has gone abroad\". Meanwhile, Katisha is reading the death certificate and notes with horror that the person \"executed\" was Nanki-Poo. The Mikado, though expressing understanding and sympathy (\"See How the Fates\"), discusses with Katisha the statutory punishment \"for compassing the death of the heir apparent\" to the Imperial throne—something lingering, \"with boiling oil... or melted lead\". With the three conspirators facing painful execution, Ko-Ko pleads with Nanki-Poo to return. Nanki-Poo fears that Katisha will order his execution if she finds he is alive, but notes that if Katisha could be persuaded to marry Ko-Ko, then Nanki-Poo could safely \"come to life again\" as Katisha would have no claim on him (\"The flowers that bloom in the spring\"). Though Katisha is \"something appalling\", Ko-Ko has no choice: it is marriage to Katisha, or a painful death for all three."]}}}
