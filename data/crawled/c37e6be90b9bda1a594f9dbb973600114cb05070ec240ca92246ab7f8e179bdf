By the same reasoning, it should import commodities in which it has an absolute disadvantage.[56] While there are possible gains from trade with absolute advantage, comparative advantage – that is, the ability to offer goods and services at a lower marginal and opportunity cost – extends the range of possible mutually beneficial exchanges.
