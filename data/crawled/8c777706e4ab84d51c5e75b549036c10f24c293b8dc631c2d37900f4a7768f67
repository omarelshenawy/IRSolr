She had been drawn to him because he claimed he had never heard of her and was, therefore, not intimidated by her.[45] The same year, Davis refused the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945),[46] a role for which Joan Crawford won an Academy Award, and instead made The Corn Is Green (1945) based on a play by Emlyn Williams. Davis played Miss Moffat, an English teacher who saves a young Welsh miner (John Dall) from a life in the coal pits, by offering him education. The part had been played in the theatre by Ethel Barrymore, but Warner Bros. felt that the film version should depict the character as a younger woman. Davis disagreed and insisted on playing the part as written and wore a gray wig and padding under her clothes, to create a dowdy appearance.[47] The film was well received by critics and made a profit of $2.2 million.[48] The critic E. Arnot Robertson observed that \"only Bette Davis . . . could have combated so successfully the obvious intention of the adaptors of the play to make frustrated sex the mainspring of the chief character's interest in the young miner.\" She concluded that \"the subtle interpretation she insisted on giving\" kept the focus on the teacher's \"sheer joy in imparting knowledge.\"[49]"]}}}
