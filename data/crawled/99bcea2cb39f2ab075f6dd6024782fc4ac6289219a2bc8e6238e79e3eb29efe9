Its principal routes carry passengers across Victoria Harbour, between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon.","The fleet of twelve ferries operates four routes across the harbour, carrying over 70,000 passengers a day, or 26 million a year. Even though there are now other ways to cross the harbour (by MTR and road tunnels), the Star Ferry continues to provide an efficient, popular and inexpensive mode of crossing the harbour. The company's main route runs between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, which is what most people mean by \"the Star Ferry\" in common parlance."]}}}
