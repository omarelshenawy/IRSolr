The case of a generic polynomial of degree n, , is of course reduced to the case of a monic, dividing all coefficients by an ≠ 0. Also, in case that 0 is not a root, i.e. a0 ≠ 0., bounds from below on the roots ζ follow immediately as bounds from above on , that is, the roots of . Finally, the distance from the roots ζ to any point can be estimated from below and above, seeing as zeros of the polynomial , whose coefficients are the Taylor expansion of P(z) at"],"after":[]}}}
