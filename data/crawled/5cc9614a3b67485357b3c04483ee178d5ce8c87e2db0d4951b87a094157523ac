Some of the largest cities in the world were found in China during this period (Kaifeng and Hangzhou had populations of over a million).[1][50] People enjoyed various social clubs and entertainment in the cities, and there were many schools and temples to provide the people with education and religious services.[1] The Song government supported multiple forms of social welfare programs, including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and pauper's graveyards.[1] The Song dynasty supported a widespread postal service that was modeled on the earlier Han dynasty (202 BCE â€“ CE 220) postal system to provide swift communication throughout the empire.[51] The central government employed thousands of postal workers of various ranks and responsibilities to provide service for post offices and larger postal stations.[52] In rural areas, farming peasants either owned their own plots of land, paid rents as tenant farmers, or were serfs on large estates.[53]"]}}}
