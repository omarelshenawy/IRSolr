Bush to end a cycle of violence. It was written as an open letter and referred to the planned attack on Iraq and the War on Terror.[31] In the letter, Penn also criticized the Bush administration for its \"deconstruction of civil liberties\" and its \"simplistic and inflammatory view of good and evil.\"[32] Penn visited Iraq briefly in December 2002.[31] \"Sean is one of the few,\" remarked his ex-wife Madonna. \"Good for him. Most celebrities are keeping their heads down. Nobody wants to be unpopular. But then Americans, by and large, are pretty ignorant of what's going on in the world.\"[33] The Post advertisement was cited as a primary reason for the development of his relationship with Venezuelan president Hugo Ch치vez. In one of his televised speeches, Ch치vez used and read aloud an open letter Penn wrote to Bush.[34] The letter condemned the Iraq War, called for Bush to be impeached, and also called Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \"villainously and criminally obscene people.\".[35] In August 2007, Penn met with Ch치vez in Caracas for two hours, after which Ch치vez praised him for urging Americans to impeach Bush. Penn also visited a new film studio on the outskirts of Caracas, though he did not speak publicly.[35]"]}}}
