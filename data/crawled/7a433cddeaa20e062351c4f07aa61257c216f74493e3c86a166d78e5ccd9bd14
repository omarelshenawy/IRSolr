B. Wilson traditionally held potluck parties at his house in Los Angeles on the night of the Academy Awards.[1] In 1981, after the 53rd Academy Awards had completed for the evening, Wilson invited friends to give random award presentations in his living room.[1][2] Wilson decided to formalize the event, after watching a double feature of Can't Stop the Music and Xanadu.[3] He gave them ballots to vote on worst in film.[3] Wilson stood at a podium made of cardboard in a tacky tuxedo, with a foam ball attached to a broomstick as a fake microphone, and announced Can't Stop the Music as the first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.[3][4] The impromptu ceremony was a success and the following week a press release about his event released by Wilson was picked up by a few local newspapers, including a mention in the Los Angeles Daily News with the headline: \"Take These Envelopes, Please\".[1][2][4]"]}}}
