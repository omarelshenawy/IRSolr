The senate appointed Arruntius as well as the great jurist Ateius Capito to a committee of two to devise a means of better confining the river.[19] The question was subsequently put to the senate as to whether some of the tributaries of the Tiber could be diverted in order to mitigate the effects of flood. Several entreaties from neighbouring colonies (Florentia, Reate and Interamna) were heard who begged that such work not be undertaken as it would render their lands flood prone. Mention was made of sacred rites, groves and alters which, they argued, should be taken into account and respected. In the end it was decided not to make any change to the watercourses, due to \"either the entreaties of the colonies, the difficulty of the work or superstitious motives\".[20] Tiberius must have wanted the problem addressed as he instituted a new commission of five senators whose chairman was probably Arruntius. The appointment of Arruntius to this committee may have been an effort on Tiberius' part to win his support.[8]"]}}}
