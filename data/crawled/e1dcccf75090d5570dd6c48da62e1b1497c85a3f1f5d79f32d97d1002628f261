First a gel is created in solution and then the liquid is carefully removed to leave the aerogel intact.","The first step is the creation of a colloidal suspension of solid particles known as a “sol”. Silica aerogel is made by the creation of colloidal silica. The process starts with a liquid alcohol such as ethanol which is mixed with a silicon alkoxide precursor, for example tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) or tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). A hydrolysis reaction forms particles of silicon dioxide forming a sol solution.[42] The oxide suspension begins to undergo condensation reactions which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges (either M–O–M, “oxo” bridges or M–OH–M, “ol” bridges) linking the dispersed colloidal particles.[43]"]}}}
