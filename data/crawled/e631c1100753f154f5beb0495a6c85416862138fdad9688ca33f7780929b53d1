(TSR). The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast since 1997. It was derived from miniature wargames with a variation of the Chainmail game serving as the initial rule system. D&D‍‍ '​‍s publication is widely regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry. Dungeons & Dragons has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions."]}}}
