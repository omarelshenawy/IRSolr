Highland English is slightly different from the variety spoken in the Lowlands in that it is more phonologically, grammatically, and lexically influenced by a Gaelic substratum. Similarly the English spoken in the North-East of Scotland tends to follow the phonology and grammar of Doric."],"after":[]}}}
