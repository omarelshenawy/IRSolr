Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation. (Because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether Pascal or Schickard should be credited as the \"inventor\" of the adding machine (or calculating machine) is probably pointless.[8]) Schickard and Pascal were followed by Gottfried Leibniz who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, inventing in the process his leibniz wheel, but who couldn't design a fully operational machine.[9] There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century.[10]"]}}}
