To this end, it sorts documents of a result list by relevance, producing an ideal DCG at position p (), which normalizes the score:"],"after":["The nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a ranking algorithm. Note that in a perfect ranking algorithm, the will be the same as the producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable."]}}}
