Wired was in a tricky position, as the error message appeared to be related to the Adobe development suite they were using to put together the digital edition, and because individual issues are purchased through Apple's App Store, Wired was unable to issue refunds directly to affected customers. As of mid-November 2010, the issue had not been resolved, and Wired released the December issue prior to fixing the issue with the November edition. The impact on sales (if any) of later issues related to the negative feedback from disgruntled Wired customers is unknown.[citation needed]"],"after":["From 2004 to 2008, Wired organized an annual \"festival of innovative products and technologies\".[27] A NextFest had also been planned for 2009, but it was later canceled.[28]"]}}}
