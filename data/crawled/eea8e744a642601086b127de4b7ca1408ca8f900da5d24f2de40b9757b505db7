The letter for the voiceless retroflex lateral fricative was included in Unicode 6.0 as U+A78E ꞎ latin small letter l with retroflex hook and belt (HTML &#42894;), with the annotation, voiceless lateral retroflex fricative, used to transcribe Toda.[4][5] Everson Mono has a glyph for this code point. Note however that this is not sanctioned by the IPA. There are no Unicode code points assigned for the other letters, except that \"ɭ with belt\" and \"ɺ with retroflex hook\" can be represented as composite characters (ɬ or ɺ, followed by U+0322 ̢ combining retroflex hook below (HTML &#802;)). Also note that although the Charis SIL and Doulos SIL fonts have those glyphs in the Private Use Areas (PUA), PUA code points should not be used for data exchange."]}}}
