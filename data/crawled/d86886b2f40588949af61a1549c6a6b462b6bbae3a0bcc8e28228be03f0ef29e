Since both his parents' families had money, it is uncertain what occurred between the time of Michael and Sarah's marriage and the birth of Samuel just three years later to provoke such a change in fortune.[8] Johnson was born in the family home above his father's bookshop in Lichfield, Staffordshire and,[7] because his mother Sarah was 40 when she gave birth, a \"man-midwife\" and surgeon of \"great reputation\" named George Hector was brought in to assist.[9] He did not cry and, with doubts surrounding the newborn's health, his aunt exclaimed \"that she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street.\"[10] Since it was feared that the baby might die, the vicar of St Mary's was summoned to perform a baptism.[11] Two godfathers were chosen: Samuel Swynfen, a physician and graduate of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Richard Wakefield, a lawyer, coroner, and Lichfield town clerk.[12]"]}}}
