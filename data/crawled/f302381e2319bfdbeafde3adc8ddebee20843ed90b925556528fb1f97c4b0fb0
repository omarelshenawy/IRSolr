After the trials, Jesus is led to Calvary carrying his cross; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the Via Dolorosa. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that Simon of Cyrene assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so.[204][205] In Luke 23:27â€“28 Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children.[204] At Calvary, Jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a painkiller. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.[204][205]"]}}}
