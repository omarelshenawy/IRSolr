An (n + 1)-ball is closed if it includes the n-sphere, and it is open if it does not include the n-sphere."],"after":["In general, the volumes of the n-ball in n-dimensional Euclidean space, and the n-sphere in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean, of radius R, are proportional to the nth power of the radius, R. We write for the volume of the n-ball and for the surface of the n-sphere, both of radius ."]}}}
