For other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the exponential of a matrix: for an initial point x0,"],"after":["When b = 0, the eigenvalues of A determine the structure of the phase space. From the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of A it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin."]}}}
