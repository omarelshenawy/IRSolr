The Semites named it gimel. The sign is possibly adapted from an Egyptian hieroglyph for a staff sling, which may have been the meaning of the name gimel. Another possibility is that it depicted a camel, the Semitic name for which was gamal. Barry B. Powell, a specialist in the history of writing, states \"It is hard to imagine how gimel = \"camel\" can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)\".[2]"],"after":["Other alphabets have letters homoglyphic to 'c' but not in use and derivation, like the Cyrillic letter Es (ะก, ั) which derives from the lunate sigma, named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon."]}}}
