This may be heard in such words as Norfolk pronounced by many natives as /ˈnɔːfɪk/. Many visitors to the area may pronounce the city's name as /ˈnɜrfoʊk/ or even /ˈnɜrfɪk/, the \"l\" being silent. The latter of these two is even appearing in younger generations native to the Tidewater area."],"after":["Another traditional feature of the area is the use of /oʊ/ for /aʊ/.[5] For example, words such as \"house\" and \"about\" may be heard in the Tidewater area as \"həuse\" and \"abəut\" respectively, especially among older speakers. Given that there are over 2.8 million people in the area,[6] it is difficult to account for all variants. Also, the area is home to several large military bases such as Naval Station Norfolk, Little Creek Amphibious Base, Oceana Naval Station, and Dam Neck Naval Base. Since a significant portion of the area's inhabitants are actually natives of other areas, there is constant linguistic exposure to other dialects. This exposure could be a reason why the younger generations do not exhibit as many of the traditional variants. These variants can, however, still be found in the youth of the more rural areas of Tidewater as well as many of the adults throughout the Tidewater region."]}}}
