The term was commonly used by the English in the 19th century but became obsolete.[37] To the extent that the opera portrays Japanese culture, style and government, it is a fictional version of Japan used merely to provide a picturesque setting and to capitalise on Japonism and the British fascination with Japan and the Far East and in the 1880s.[17] Gilbert wrote, \"The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.\"[38] The Mikado \"was never a story about Japan but about the failings of the British government\".[39]"]}}}
