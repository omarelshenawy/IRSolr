Ibn Khaldun began gaining more attention from 1806, when Silvestre de Sacy's Chrestomathie Arabe included his biography together with a translation of parts of the Muqaddimah as the Prolegomena.[26] In 1816, de Sacy again published a biography with a more detailed description on the Prolegomena.[27] More details on and partial translations of the Prolegomena emerged over the years until the complete Arabic edition was published in 1858, followed by a complete French translation a few years later by de Sacy.[28] Since then, the work of Ibn Khaldun has been extensively studied in the Western world with special interest.[29]"]}}}
