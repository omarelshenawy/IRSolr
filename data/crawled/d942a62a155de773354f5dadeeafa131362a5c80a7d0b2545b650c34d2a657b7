After overcoming her father's objections, she moved to Paris in 1866, with her mother and family friends acting as chaperones.[14] Since women could not yet attend the École des Beaux-Arts, she applied to study privately with masters from the school[15] and was accepted to study with Jean-Léon Gérôme, a highly regarded teacher known for his hyper-realistic technique and his depiction of exotic subjects. A few months later Gérôme also accepted Eakins as a student.[15] Cassatt augmented her artistic training with daily copying in the Louvre (she obtained the required permit, which was necessary to control the \"copyists\", usually low-paid women, who daily filled the museum to paint copies for sale). The museum also served as a social meeting place for Frenchmen and American female students, who, like Cassatt, were not allowed to attend cafes where the avant-garde socialized. In this manner, fellow artist and friend Elizabeth Jane Gardner met and married famed academic painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau.[16]"],"after":["Toward the end of 1866, she joined a painting class taught by Charles Chaplin, a noted genre artist. In 1868, Cassatt also studied with artist Thomas Couture, whose subjects were mostly romantic and urban.[17] On trips to the countryside, the students drew from life, particularly the peasants going about their daily activities. In 1868 one of her paintings, A Mandoline Player, was accepted for the first time by the selection jury for the Paris Salon. With Elizabeth Jane Gardner, whose work was also accepted by the jury that year, Cassatt was one of two American women to first exhibit in the Salon.[4] A Mandoline Player is in the Romantic style of Corot and Couture,[18] and is one of only two paintings from the first decade of her career that can be documented today.[19]"]}}}
