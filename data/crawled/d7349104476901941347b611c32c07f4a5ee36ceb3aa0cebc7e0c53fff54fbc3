The ten district councils of Greater Manchester approved the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) on 29 March 2010, and submitted final recommendations for a constitution to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Transport. On 31 March 2010 the Communities Secretary John Denham approved the constitution and launched a 15-week public consultation on the draft bill together with the approved constitution.[71] Following requests by the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, which was superseded by the GMCA,[72][73][74] the new authority came into being on 1 April 2011.[75] On the same day, the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee was also formed from a pool of 33 councillors allocated by council population (roughly one councillor per 75,000 residents) to scrutinise the running of Greater Manchester's transport bodies and their finances, approve the decisions and policies of said bodies and form strategic policy recommendations or projects for the approval of the Combined Authority.[68] On 3 November 2014, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that there would be an eleventh member of the GMCA — a directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester, with \"powers over transport, housing, planning and policing\" from 2017.[76] This announcement was followed up on 25 February 2015 with news that Greater Manchester would be the first part of England to get \"get full control of its health spending\" with a devolution deal from April 2016.[77]"],"after":["Greater Manchester is a landlocked county spanning 493 square miles (1,277 km2).[3] The South Pennines rise along the northeastern side of the county, through parts of Oldham, Rochdale and Tameside. The West Pennine Moors and several coalfields (mainly sandstones and shales) lie in the northwest and west respectively, and the Cheshire Plain fringes the south.[14] The rivers Mersey, Irwell and Tame run through Greater Manchester, all of which rise in the Pennines.[14] Other rivers traverse the region as tributaries to the major rivers, including the Douglas, the Irk, and the Roch.[14] Black Chew Head is the highest point in Greater Manchester which forms part of the Peak District National Park, rising 1,778 feet (542 m) above sea-level, within the parish of Saddleworth.[78]"]}}}
