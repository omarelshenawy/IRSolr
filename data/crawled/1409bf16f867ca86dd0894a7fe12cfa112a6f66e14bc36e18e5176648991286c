The set of values written down forms the orbit (under σ) of x, and the parenthesized expression gives the corresponding cycle of σ. One then continues by choosing a new element y of S outside the previous orbit and writing down the cycle starting at y; and so on until all elements of S are written in cycles. Since for every new cycle the starting point can be chosen in different ways, there are in general many different cycle notations for the same permutation; for the example above one has:"],"after":["A cycle (x) of length 1 occurs when σ(x) = x, and is commonly omitted from the cycle notation, provided the set S is clear: for any element x ∈ S not appearing in a cycle, one implicitly assumes σ(x) = x.[21] The identity permutation, which consists only of 1-cycles, can be denoted by a single 1-cycle (x), by the number 1, or by id.[22][23]"]}}}
