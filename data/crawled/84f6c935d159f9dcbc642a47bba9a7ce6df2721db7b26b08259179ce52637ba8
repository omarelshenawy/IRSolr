He strictly forbade him to meddle with any musical instrument but Handel found means to get a little clavichord privately convey'd to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep\".[9] At an early age Handel became a skilful performer on the harpsichord and pipe organ.[10]"]}}}
