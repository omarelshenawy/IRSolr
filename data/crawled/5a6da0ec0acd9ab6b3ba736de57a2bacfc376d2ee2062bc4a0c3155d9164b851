The leaders of the city began a territorial acquisition, in which they gradually brought more nearby land under their control. This laid the ground-work for the Canton of Fribourg. By 1442 the city had control of all the land within about 20 kilometres (12Â mi), on both sides of the Saane. It was therefore directly controlled by the city leaders, not by any intermediate administration."],"after":["The mid-15th century was shaped by various military conflicts. First, considerable losses in a war against Savoy had to be made good. The Savoyard influence on the city grew, and the Habsburgs ceded it to them in 1452.

As an ally of Bern, Fribourg participated in the war against Charles I of Burgundy, thereby bringing more land under its control."]}}}
