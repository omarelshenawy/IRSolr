White and Asian Americans, who have the highest median incomes,[9] are concentrated more in professional, executive, and managerial occupations than blacks, Hispanics, or American Indians.[3][5] Black and Hispanic workers are not only more likely to work in blue-collar or service jobs, but they tend to be concentrated in the lower-wage/skilled jobs, such as operators, fabricators, and laborers, rather than higher-paying precision production and craft jobs within those categories.[3][5]"]}}}
