Each individual sheet of paper is folded into a module or unit, and then the pieces are assembled into a flat shape or three-dimensional structure by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding process. This process creates tension in the model allowing this units to remain together. Modular origami can be viewed as a sub-set of multi-piece origami, and therefore the rules of origami still apply."],"after":[]}}}
