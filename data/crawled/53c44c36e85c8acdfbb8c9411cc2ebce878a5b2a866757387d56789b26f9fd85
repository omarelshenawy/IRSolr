This means that a particular note value (for example, a quarter note, or crotchet) is specified as the beat, and that the amount of time between successive beats is a specified fraction of a minute. The greater the number of beats per minute, the smaller the amount of time between successive beats, and thus faster a piece must be played. For example, a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second, while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid, signifying one beat every 0.5 seconds. Mathematical tempo markings of this kind became increasingly popular during the first half of the 19th century, after the metronome had been invented by Johann Nepomuk MÃ¤lzel, although early metronomes were somewhat inconsistent. Beethoven was one of the first composers to use the metronome; in the eighteen-teens he published metronomic indications for the eight symphonies he had composed up to that time.[1]"]}}}
