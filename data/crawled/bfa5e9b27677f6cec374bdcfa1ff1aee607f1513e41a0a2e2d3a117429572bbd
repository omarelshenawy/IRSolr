The album found Carey working predominantly with Jermaine Dupri, as well as Bryan-Michael Cox, Manuel Seal, The Neptunes and Kanye West.[139] The album debuted atop the charts in several countries, and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as \"cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again\",[140] while USA Today‍ '​s Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\"[141] The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\"[142] song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over.[143] Music critics heralded the song as her \"return to form\",[144] as well as the \"return of The Voice\",[144] while many felt it would revive \"faith\" in Carey's potential as a balladeer.[139] \"We Belong Together\" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100.[145] After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\".[145] Billboard listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time.[146] Besides its chart success, the song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.[147]"]}}}
