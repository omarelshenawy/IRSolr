Prosody is often one of the most noticeable differences between its dialects.[45]","There are 18 consonant phonemes, two of which, /É§/ and /r/, vary considerably in pronunciation depending on the dialect and social status of the speaker. In many dialects, sequences of /r/ with a dental consonant result in retroflex consonants. /r/ has a guttural or \"French-R\" pronunciation in the dialects of ex-Danish (and bordering) provinces; consequently, these dialects lack retroflex consonants.[44]"],"after":[]}}}
