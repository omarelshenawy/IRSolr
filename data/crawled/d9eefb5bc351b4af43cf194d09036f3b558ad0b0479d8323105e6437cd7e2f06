It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\"[37] Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy."],"after":["Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population.
