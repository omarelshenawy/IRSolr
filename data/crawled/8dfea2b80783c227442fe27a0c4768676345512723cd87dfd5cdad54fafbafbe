She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls.[5] Before the late 19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.[note 1]"],"after":["In Algernon Charles Swinburne's 1866 poem Sapphics the term \"lesbian\" appears twice but capitalized both times after twice mentioning the island of Lesbos, and so could be construed to mean 'from the island of Lesbos'.[6] In 1875, George Saintsbury, in writing about Baudelaire's poetry refers to his \"Lesbian studies\" in which he includes his poem about \"the passion of Delphine\" which is a poem simply about love between two women which does not mention the island of Lesbos, though the other poem alluded to, entitled \"Lesbos\", does.[7] Lesbianism, to describe erotic relationships between women, had been documented in 1870.[8] In 1890, the term lesbian was used in a medical dictionary as an adjective to describe tribadism (as \"lesbian love\"). The terms lesbian, invert and homosexual were interchangeable with sapphist and sapphism around the turn of the 20th century.[8] The use of lesbian in medical literature became prominent; by 1925, the word was recorded as a noun to mean the female equivalent of a sodomite.[8][9]"]}}}
