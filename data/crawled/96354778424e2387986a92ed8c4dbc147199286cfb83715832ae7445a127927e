These films were, according to music historian Donald Clarke, the \"ancestors\" of music video.[4]"],"after":["Musical films were another important precursor to music video, and several well-known music videos have imitated the style of classic Hollywood musicals from the 1930s to the 1950s. One of the best-known examples is Madonna's 1985 video for \"Material Girl\" (directed by Mary Lambert)[5] which was closely modelled on Jack Cole's staging of \"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend\" from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Several of Michael Jackson's videos show the unmistakable influence of the dance sequences in classic Hollywood musicals, including the landmark \"Thriller\" and the Martin Scorsese-directed \"Bad\" which was influenced by the stylised dance \"fights\" in the film version of West Side Story.[6] According to the Internet Accuracy Project, disc jockeyâ€“singer J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson was the first to coin the phrase \"music video\", in 1959.[7]"]}}}
