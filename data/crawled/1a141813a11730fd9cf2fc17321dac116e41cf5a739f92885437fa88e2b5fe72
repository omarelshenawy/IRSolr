Several Australian warships operated with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) during the Battle of Okinawa and Australian destroyers later escorted British aircraft carriers and battleships during attacks on targets in the Japanese home islands.[176] Despite its distance from Japan, Australia was the BPF's main base and a large number of facilities were built to support the fleet.[177]"]}}}
