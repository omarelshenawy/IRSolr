(William & Mary Law School opened first in 1779, but closed due to the American Civil War, reopening in 1920.[11] The University of Maryland School of Law was chartered in 1816, but did not begin classes until 1824, and also closed during the Civil War.[12])"],"after":["Its origins can be traced to the estate of Isaac Royall, a wealthy Antiguan slaveholder who immigrated to Boston. His Medford estate, the Isaac Royall House, is now a museum which features the only remaining slave quarters in the northeast United States. The Royall chair was traditionally held by the Dean of the law school. However, because Royall was a slaveholder, Deans Elena Kagan and Martha Minow declined the Royall chair. The Royall family coat-of-arms was adopted as the school crest, which shows three stacked wheat sheaves beneath the university motto (Veritas, Latin \"truth\").[13]"]}}}
