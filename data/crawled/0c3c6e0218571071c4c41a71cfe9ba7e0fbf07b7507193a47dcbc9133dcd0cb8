He appointed Alfred Waterhouse to design another new hall. Again the core of the previous hall was retained; parts were refaced and re-modelled, other parts were completely rebuilt. A private wing was built for the use of the family, and this was joined to the main part of the hall by a corridor. Waterhouse also designed the chapel and a clock-house, and rebuilt most of the stabling.[10] The work began in 1870, took 12 years to complete, and cost £803,000 (£70.6 million in 2015).[2][11] The library was 90 feet (27 m) long, the dining room with its ante room was 105 feet (32 m) long, and the octagonal great hall contained an organ. For the interior, Henry Stacy Marks painted a frieze of the Canterbury Pilgrims for the morning room, Gertrude Jekyll painted panels for the drawing room, and in other rooms were paintings by Gainsborough, Stubbs and Reynolds.[12] Pevsner wrote that it \"was an outstanding expression of High Victorian originality\", and added \"this Wagnerian palace was the most ambitious instance of Gothic Revival domestic architecture anywhere in the country\".[9] The Daily Telegraph described it as \"one of the most princely and beautiful mansions that these islands contain\".[13]"]}}}
