He launched his film career with the 1981 action-drama Taps, where he played a military high school cadet.[8] A year later, he appeared in the hit comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High, in the role of surfer-stoner Jeff Spicoli, with his character helping popularize the word \"dude\" in popular culture.[8] In 1983, Penn appeared as Mick O'Brien, a troubled youth, in the drama Bad Boys.[8] The role earned Penn favorable reviews and jump-started his career as a serious actor."],"after":["In 1985, Penn played Andrew Daulton Lee in the film The Falcon and the Snowman, which closely followed an actual criminal case.[8] Lee was a former drug dealer by trade, convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union and originally sentenced to life in prison, later being paroled in 1998. Penn later hired Lee as his personal assistant, partly because he wanted to reward Lee for allowing him to play Lee in the film; he was also a firm believer in rehabilitation and thought Lee should be successfully reintegrated into society, since he was a free man again.[9] In 1986, Penn starred in the drama At Close Range.[8] He stopped acting for a few years in the early 1990s, having been dissatisfied with the industry, and focused on making his directing debut.[8]"]}}}
