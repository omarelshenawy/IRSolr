The earliest known texts on geometry are the Egyptian Rhind Papyrus (2000â€“1800 BC) and Moscow Papyrus (c. 1890 BC), the Babylonian clay tablets such as Plimpton 322 (1900 BC). For example, the Moscow Papyrus gives a formula for calculating the volume of a truncated pyramid, or frustum.[7] South of Egypt the ancient Nubians established a system of geometry including early versions of sun clocks.[8][9]"]}}}
