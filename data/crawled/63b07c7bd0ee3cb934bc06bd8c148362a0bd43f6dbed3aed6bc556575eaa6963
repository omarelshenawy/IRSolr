The earliest recorded use of the name \"Aemstelredamme\" (Amsterdam) comes from a document dated October 27, 1275. Inhabitants of the village, by this document, were exempted from paying a bridge toll in the County of Holland by Count Floris V.[22] [23] This meant it had been allowed for the inhabitants of the village of Aemstelredamme to travel freely through the County of Holland without having to pay toll at bridges, locks and dams all through the county. The certificate describes the inhabitants as homines manentes apud Amestelledamme (people living near Amestelledamme).[24] By 1327, the name had developed into Aemsterdam.[22][25]"]}}}
