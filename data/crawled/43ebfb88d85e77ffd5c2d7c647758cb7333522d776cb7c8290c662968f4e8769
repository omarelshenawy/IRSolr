The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregionsâ€”Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.[85]"],"after":["There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.[84] The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s (decade) alone.[84] There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers.
