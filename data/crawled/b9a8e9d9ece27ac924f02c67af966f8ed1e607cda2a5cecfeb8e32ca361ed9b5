He is best known for the famous mutiny that occurred against his command aboard HMAV (His Majesty's Armed Vessel) Bounty and the remarkable voyage he made to Timor on the Bounty's launch after being set adrift by the mutineers. Born in St Tudy, Cornwall, Bligh was certainly not the vicious man portrayed in popular fiction, some claim his over-sensitivity and acid tongue damaged what would have otherwise been a distinguished career."]}}}
