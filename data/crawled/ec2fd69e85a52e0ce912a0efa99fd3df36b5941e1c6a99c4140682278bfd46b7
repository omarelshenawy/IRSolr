The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016.[60][61][dated info] The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements[62] which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),[63][64] with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.[62]"]}}}
