Although this application was abandoned, publicity inspired hobbyists to adapt the flexible wing airfoil for modern hang gliders."],"after":["Rocket-powered aircraft consume their fuel quickly, and so most must land unpowered, unless there is another type of engine. The first was the Lippisch Ente. Later examples include the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered interceptor.[23] The American series of research aircraft starting with the Bell X-1 in 1946 up to the North American X-15 spent more time flying unpowered than under power. In the 1960s research was also done on unpowered lifting bodies and on the X-20 Dyna-Soar project, but although the X20 was cancelled, this research eventually led to the Space Shuttle."]}}}
