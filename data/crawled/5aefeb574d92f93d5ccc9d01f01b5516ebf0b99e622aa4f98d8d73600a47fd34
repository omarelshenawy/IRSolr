An Association for Industrial Archaeology publication describes Greater Manchester as \"one of the classic areas of industrial and urban growth in Britain, the result of a combination of forces that came together in the 18th and 19th centuries: a phenomenal rise in population, the appearance of the specialist industrial town, a transport revolution, and weak local lordship\".[13] Much of the county was at the forefront of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and into the early-20th century;[157] Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh, chair of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said \"clearly, all of the Greater Manchester area was once at the heart of a very vibrant [textiles] industry\",[157] represented by former textile mills found throughout the county.[13] The territory that makes up Greater Manchester experienced a rapid decline of these traditional sectors, partly during the Lancashire Cotton famine brought on by the American Civil War, but mainly as part of the post-war economic depression and deindustrialization of Britain that occurred during the 20th century.[143][160]"]}}}
