The graveyards in central London had no space, and fearing that he might have to be cremated against his wishes, his widow appealed to his friends to see whether any of them knew of a church with space in its graveyard."],"after":["David Astor lived in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire, and negotiated with the vicar for Orwell to be interred in All Saints' Churchyard there, although he had no connection with the village.[98] Orwell's gravestone bears the simple epitaph: \"Here lies Eric Arthur Blair, born 25 June 1903, died 21 January 1950\"; no mention is made on the gravestone of his more famous pen name."]}}}
