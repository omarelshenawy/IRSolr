(stylized as :)p!) is Shania's fourth studio album released in 2002. Three versions of the album were released: a country version (green disc), a pop version (red disc) and an international version (blue disc) in the style of Indian film music; all three discs contain exactly the same track listing and featured identifiable picture labels (for example, Shania sports a cowboy hat on the green country disc.) The country and pop versions were released together in North America, while the pop and international versions were released together outside of the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., Up! debuted at number one with sales of 874,000 copies; to date, the album has sold over 13 million copies worldwide."]}}}
