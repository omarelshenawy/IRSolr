It ranks as: the fourth most densely populated country in the Americas (18th globally), and the 10th most populated island country in the region, (101st globally). Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as \"Bajan\") are of Afro-Caribbean descent (\"Afro-Bajans\") and mixed-descent. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (\"Anglo-Bajans\" / \"Euro-Bajans\") mainly from the United Kingdom and Ireland, along with Asians, mostly Chinese and Indians (both Hindu and Muslim). Other groups in Barbados include people from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. Barbadians who return after years of residence in the United States and children born in America to Bajan parents are called \"Bajan Yankees\", a term considered derogatory by some.[64] Generally, Bajans recognise and accept all \"children of the island\" as Bajans, and refer to each other as such."]}}}
