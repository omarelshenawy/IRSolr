Later in the same year, the Emperor Basil I, called \"the Macedonian,\" acceded to the throne; as a result the following period of Byzantine art has sometimes been called the \"Macedonian Renaissance\", although the term is doubly problematic (it was neither \"Macedonian\", nor, strictly speaking, a \"Renaissance\")."]}}}
