According to the Chinese government, China's military budget for 2014 totalled US$132 billion, constituting the world's second-largest military budget.[23] However, many authorities – including SIPRI and the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense – argue that China does not report its real level of military spending, which is allegedly much higher than the official budget.[23][225]"]}}}
