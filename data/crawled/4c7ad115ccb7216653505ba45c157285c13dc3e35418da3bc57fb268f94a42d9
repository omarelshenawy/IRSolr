Jackson performed a medley of \"All for You\", \"Rhythm Nation\", and an excerpt of \"The Knowledge\" before performing \"Rock Your Body\" alongside surprise guest Justin Timberlake. As Timberlake sang the lyric \"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song\", he tore open her costume, exposing her right breast to 140 million viewers. Jackson issued an apology after the performance, saying the incident was accidental and unintended, explaining that Timberlake was only meant to pull away a bustier and leave the red-lace bra intact.[109] She commented, \"I am really sorry if I offended anyone. That was truly not my intention ... MTV, CBS, the NFL had no knowledge of this whatsoever, and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end.\"[110] Timberlake also issued an apology, calling the accident a \"wardrobe malfunction.\"[109] The incident became the most recorded and replayed moment in TiVo history, enticing an estimated 35,000 new subscribers.[111][112] Regarded as one of the most controversial television events in history, Jackson was later listed in Guinness World Records as the \"Most Searched in Internet History\" and the \"Most Searched for News Item\".[113] CBS, the NFL, and MTV (CBS's sister network, which produced the halftime show), denied any knowledge of, and all responsibility for, the incident. The Federal Communications Commission heavily fined all companies involved, and continued an investigation for eight years, ultimately losing its appeal for a $550,000 fine against CBS.[114]"],"after":["Following the incident, CBS permitted Timberlake to appear at the 46th Grammy Awards ceremony but did not allow Jackson to attend, forcing her to withdraw after being scheduled as a presenter.[115] People Magazine revealed Jackson \"had been slated to speak before the accolade but was being pressured to bow out gracefully – or face being uninvited,\" before being completely barred from attending.[116] The controversy halted plans for Jackson to star in the biographical film of singer and activist Lena Horne, which was to be produced by American Broadcasting Company. Although Horne was reportedly displeased by the incident, Jackson's representatives stated she withdrew from the project willingly.[117] A Mickey Mouse statue wearing Jackson's iconic \"Rhythm Nation\" outfit was mantled at Walt Disney World theme park the previous year to honor Jackson's legacy, but was removed following Jackson's controversial performance.[118]"]}}}
