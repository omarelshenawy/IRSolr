One of its first known recorded uses was in a 1914 report put forward in response to what was considered to have been the successful creation of the County of London in 1889.[21] The report suggested that a county should be set up to recognise the \"Manchester known in commerce\", and referred to the areas that formed \"a substantial part of South Lancashire and part of Cheshire, comprising all municipal boroughs and minor authorities within a radius of eight or nine miles of Manchester\".[21][23] In his 1915 book Cities In Evolution, urban planner Sir Patrick Geddes wrote \"far more than Lancashire realises, is growing up another Greater London\".[24]"],"after":["Most of Greater Manchester lay within the ancient county boundaries of Lancashire; those areas south of the Mersey and Tame were in Cheshire. The Saddleworth area and a small part of Mossley are historically part of Yorkshire and in the south-east a small part in Derbyshire. The areas that were incorporated into Greater Manchester in 1974 previously formed parts of the administrative counties of Cheshire, Lancashire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and of eight independent county boroughs.[2] By the early 1970s, this system of demarcation was described as \"archaic\" and \"grossly inadequate to keep pace both with the impact of motor travel, and with the huge increases in local government responsibilities\".[25]"]}}}
