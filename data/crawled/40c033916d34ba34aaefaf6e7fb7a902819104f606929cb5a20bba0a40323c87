This tells the host that one has been given enough food. If one were to clean his or her plate that would indicate that one is still hungry. Most Somalis do not take this rule so seriously, but it is certainly not impolite to leave a few bits of food on one's plate. Somali breakfast typically includes a flatbread called lahoh (injera), as well as liver, toast, cereal, and porridge made of millet or cornmeal. Lunch can be a mixture of rice or pasta with meat and sauce."]}}}
