Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that \"[s]he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys.\"[271] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael.[272] Joshua Klein wrote, \"[f]or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'.\"[233] Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a \"superstar\" in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while \"successfully [shifting] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult.\"[273] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, She signed a $35–$40 million recording contract with Virgin Records.[274][275] Klein argued that \"stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.\".[233]"],"after":["She has also been recognized for playing a pivotal role in crossing racial boundaries in the recording industry, where black artists were once considered to be substandard.[276] In Right to Rock: The Black Rock Coalition and the Cultural Politics of Race (2004), author Maureen Mahon states: \"In the 1980s, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Prince were among the African American artists who crossed over ... When black artists cross over into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word. They get promoted from racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial transcendence.\"[277] Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge (2000) documented that Jackson, along with other prominent African-American women, had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music, receiving \"superstar status\" in the process.[45] She, alongside her contemporaries \"offered viable creative, intellectual, and business paths for establishing and maintaining agency, lyrical potency, marketing and ownership.\"[278] Her business savvy has been compared to that of Madonna, gaining a level of autonomy which enables \"creative latitude and access to financial resources and mass-market distribution.\"[279][280] A model of reinvention, author Jessie Carney Smith wrote that \"Janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative power\", receiving accolades in music, film and concert tours throughout the course of her career.[230]"]}}}
