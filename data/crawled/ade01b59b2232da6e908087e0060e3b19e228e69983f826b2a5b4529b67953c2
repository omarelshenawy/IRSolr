For film and video that must be viewed onsite, there is a screening room (large enough for classes) equipped with a 16Â mm projector. There are also moviolas and Steenbeck equipment, permitting close frame-by-frame examination and analysis."],"after":["The origins of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound can be traced to a gift of 500 78 rpm records by Columbia Records in 1937 to the Music Division. Successive gifts by record companies and individuals led to the formal creation of a separate division with the opening of the building at Lincoln Center in 1965. It was named in honor of a generous gift from the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization.[26] Radio station WQXR donated 11,000 78 rpm recordings in 1966.[27] Carleton Sprague Smith envisioned the purpose of the sound archive as \"stimulating interest among recording and broadcasting executives, as well as other arts institutions that had potential for playing a cooperative role.\"[28]"]}}}
