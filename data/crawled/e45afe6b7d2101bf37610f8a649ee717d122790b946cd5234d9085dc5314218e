His point was to have people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art, because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as \"Readymades\". The Fountain, was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, that shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. It is questionable, to some, whether Duchamp—whose obsession with paradox is well known—can be called postmodernist on only the grounds that he eschews any specific medium, since paradox is not medium-specific, although it arose first in Manet's paintings."]}}}
