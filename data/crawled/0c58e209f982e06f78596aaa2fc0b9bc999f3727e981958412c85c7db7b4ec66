BlitzMail, the campus e-mail network, plays a tremendous role in social life, as students tend to use it for communication in lieu of cellular phones or instant messaging programs.[151][152] Student reliance on BlitzMail (known colloquially as \"Blitz,\" which functions as both noun and verb[152]) is reflected by the presence of about 100 public computer terminals intended specifically for BlitzMail use.[152] Since 1991, Dartmouth students have been required to own a personal computer.[153][154]"]}}}
