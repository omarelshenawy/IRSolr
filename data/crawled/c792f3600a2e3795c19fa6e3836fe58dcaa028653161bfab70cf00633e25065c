Some critics claimed that the bones were those of an upright walking ape, or that they belonged to a primitive human.[28] This judgment made sense at a time when an evolutionary view of humanity had not yet been widely accepted, and scientists tended to view hominid fossils as racial variants of modern humans rather than as ancestral forms.[29] After Dubois let a number of scientists examine the fossils in a series of conferences held in Europe in the 1890s, they started to agree that Java Man may be a transitional form after all, but most of them thought of it as \"an extinct side branch\" of the human tree that had indeed descended from apes, but not evolved into humans.[30] This interpretation eventually imposed itself and remained dominant until the 1940s.[31]"],"after":["Dubois was bitter about this and locked the fossil up in a trunk until 1923 when he showed it to Ales Hrdlicka from the Smithonian Institute.[26] In response to critics who refused to accept that Java Man was a \"missing link\", in 1932 Dubois published a paper arguing that the Trinil bones looked like those of a \"giant gibbon\".[32] Dubois' use of the phrase has been widely misinterpreted as a retraction,[33] but it was intended an argument to support his claim that Pithecanthropus was a transitional form.[34] According to Dubois, evolution occurred by leaps, and the ancestors of humanity had doubled their brain-to-body ratio on each leap.[35] To prove that Java Man was the \"missing link\" between apes and humans, he therefore had to show that its brain-to-body ratio was double that of apes and half that of humans. The problem was that Java Man's cranial capacity was 900 cubic centimeters, about two thirds of modern humans'.[36]"]}}}
