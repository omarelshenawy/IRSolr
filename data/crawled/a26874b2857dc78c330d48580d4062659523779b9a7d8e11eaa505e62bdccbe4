As music critic G. Brown from The Denver Post wrote, \"For better or worse, Mariah Carey's five-octave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers.\"[287] According to Rolling Stone, \"Her mastery of melisma, the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like \"Vision of Love\", inspired the entire American Idol vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&B singer since the Nineties.\"[288] Jody Rosen of Slate wrote of Carey's influence in modern music, calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades, the person who made rococo melismatic singing.[289] Rosen further exemplified Carey's influence by drawing parallel with American Idol, which to her, \"often played out as a clash of melisma-mad Mariah wannabes. And, today, nearly 20 years after Carey's debut, major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of Britain's X Factor show, Leona Lewis, with her Generation Next gloss on Mariah's big voice and big hair.\"[289] Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times wrote, \"Depending on how you feel about public humiliation, the best/worst parts of American Idol are the audition shows, which normally break down into three distinct parts:(1) The Talented Kids.(2) The Weird Kids.(3) The Mariahs.\" Daly further commented, \"The Mariahs are the hardest ones to watch, mainly because most of them think they're reeeaaally good. The poor, disillusioned hopefuls plant themselves in front of judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson – then proceed to stretch, break and mutilate every note of a song, often Mariah's Hero, a tune that has ruined more throats than smoker's cough.\"[290] New York Magazine's editor Roger Deckker said that in regarding Carey as an influential artist in music, he commented that \"Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma (the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty) to the charts, but it was Mariah—with her jaw-dropping range—who made it into America's default sound.\" Deckker also added that \"Every time you turn on American Idol, you are watching her children\".[291] Despite her vocal prowess, Carey's vocal technique particularly with the use of melisma and belting, has been subject to public scrutiny mainly because of young singers such as from talent shows have been overly imitating her singing technique in which critics commented \"Mariah Carey is, without a doubt, the worst thing to happen to amateur singing since the karaoke machine\".[290] As Professor Katherine L. Meizel noted in her book, The Mediation of Identity Politics in American Idol, \"Carey's influence not just stops in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabe's, it's also her persona, her diva, her stardom which inspires them.... a pre-fame conic look.\"[292]"]}}}
