Neel led the study which found that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher among the children of survivors who were pregnant at the time of the bombings.[239] The National Academy of Sciences questioned Neel's procedure which did not filter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure.[240] Among the observed birth defects there was a higher incidence of brain malformation in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, including microencephaly and anencephaly, about 2.75 times the rate seen in Kure.[241][242]"]}}}
