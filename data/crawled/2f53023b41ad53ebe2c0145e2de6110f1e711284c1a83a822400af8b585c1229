A number of identities incorporating the contractions are valid without restriction of their inputs. Benefits of using the left contraction as an extension of the inner product on vectors include that the identity is extended to for any vector a and multivector B, and that the projection operation is extended to for any blades A and B (with a minor modification to accommodate null B, given below)."]}}}
