The flag adopted for Wallachia by the revolutionaries was a blue-yellow-red horizontal tricolour (with blue above, in line with the meaning \"Liberty, Justice, Fraternity\"),[62] while Romanian students in Paris hailed the new government with the same flag \"as a symbol of union between Moldavians and Wallachians\".[63][64] The same flag, with the tricolour being mounted vertically, would later be officially adopted as the national flag of Romania.[65]"]}}}
