As well as the usual athletic disciplines, as at the Summer Olympic Games, the games include sports particularly popular in the Commonwealth, such as bowls, netball, and rugby sevens. Started in 1930 as the Empire Games, the games were founded on the Olympic model of amateurism, but were deliberately designed to be \"the Friendly Games\",[103] with the goal of promoting relations between Commonwealth countries and celebrating their shared sporting and cultural heritage.[104]"]}}}
