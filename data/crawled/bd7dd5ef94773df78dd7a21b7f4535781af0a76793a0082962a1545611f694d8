Turkish geographer, Mahmud al-Kashgari drew a world map on a linguistic basis, and later so did Piri Reis (Piri Reis map). Further, Islamic scholars translated and interpreted the earlier works of the Romans and the Greeks and established the House of Wisdom in Baghdad for this purpose.[20] Ab큰 Zayd al-Balkh카, originally from Balkh, founded the \"Balkh카 school\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad.[21] Suhr훮b, a late tenth century Muslim geographer accompanied a book of geographical coordinates, with instructions for making a rectangular world map with equirectangular projection or cylindrical equidistant projection.[21][verification needed]"]}}}
