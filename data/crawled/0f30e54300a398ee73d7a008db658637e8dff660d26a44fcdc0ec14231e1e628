It is published by HarperCollins in Glasgow.[1]","The first edition of the dictionary, in 1979, with Patrick Hanks as editor and Lawrence Urdang as editorial director, used computer databases and typesetting in the preparation of a dictionary.[citation needed] This meant that, for instance, subject editors could control separate definitions of the same word and the results could be blended into the result, rather than one editor being responsible for a word."]}}}
