In her 2001 Drowned World Tour, she performed the song while slow-riding on a mechanical bull, which was considered by MTV as \"magical\". During the performance, the singer was dressed as a cowgirl.[9] For John McAlley from Entertainment Weekly, Madonna \"prompts the oddly natural sight of Madonna lap-dancing a mechanical bull\".[10] Madonna performed the song again at her 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour, with an electric guitar, also adding vocoder voice effects on the background harmonies, with a video backdrop of American singer Britney Spears trapped in an elevator and trying to get out. At the end of the performance, the doors opened to reveal Spears saying the phrase \"It's Britney, bitch\", from her song \"Gimme More\" (2007).[11] On November 6, 2008 in the Los Angeles show at Dodger Stadium, Spears joined Madonna onstage halfway through the performance.[12]"]}}}
