With Franco's increasing age, left-wing protests increased, while at the same time, the far right factions demanded the return of a hardline absolute monarchy. At the time, the heir to the throne of Spain was Juan de Borb√≥n (Count of Barcelona), the son of the late Alfonso XIII.[14] However, General Franco viewed him with extreme suspicion, believing him to be a liberal who was opposed to his regime.[15]"]}}}
