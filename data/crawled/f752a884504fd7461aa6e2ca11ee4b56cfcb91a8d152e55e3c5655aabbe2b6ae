The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by Wladimir KÃ¶ppen. The Thornthwaite system,[19] in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration in addition to temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species diversity and potential impacts of climate changes.[citation needed]"],"after":["Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time.[20] Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere,[21][22] just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[23] When used without qualification, \"weather\" is understood to be the weather of Earth."]}}}
