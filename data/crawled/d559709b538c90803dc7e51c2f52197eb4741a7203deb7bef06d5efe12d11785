Despite the existence of a \"willing-buyer-willing-seller\" land reform programme since the 1980s, white Zimbabweans continued to hold about 70% of the most arable land.[53] Robert Mugabe began to forcibly redistribute this land to his associates in 2000. Poorly managed confiscation of white farmland (accompanied by brutality and corruption), continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to a sharp decline in agricultural exports, which was traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector.[54] Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.[55]"],"after":["Charged with committing numerous human rights abuses and running the economy of his own nation into the ground, Mugabe found himself beset with a wide range of sanctions.[56][57] In 2002, the nation was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations due to the reckless farm seizures and blatant election tampering.[58] The following year, Zimbabwean officials voluntarily terminated its Commonwealth membership.[59]"]}}}
