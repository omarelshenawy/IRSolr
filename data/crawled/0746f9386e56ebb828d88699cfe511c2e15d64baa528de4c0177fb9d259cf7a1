At one point, seven of Vanderbilt's 16 teams were concurrently ranked in the Top 25 of their respective sports.[121] Women's bowling won the NCAA championship, bringing the university its first team championship since the advent of the NCAA.[122] The baseball team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 according to Baseball America,[123] made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and tournament championships and won the NCAA college world series in 2014 (the university's only men's national championship). Vanderbilt was ranked first in most polls for a large portion of the 2007 season, and the team secured the top seed in the 2007 NCAA tournament.[124]"]}}}
