However, progress has proved hard to come by: no quadratic polynomial (with a ≠ 0) is known to take infinitely many prime values. The Ulam spiral depicts all natural numbers in a spiral-like way. Surprisingly, prime numbers cluster on certain diagonals and not others, suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than other ones."]}}}
