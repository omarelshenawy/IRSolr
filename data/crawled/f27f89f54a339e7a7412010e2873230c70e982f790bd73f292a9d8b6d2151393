Featuring electronic music artist William Orbit, it became Pink's first single to miss the top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, although it was a hit in Europe and in Australia. It was later included on non-U.S. editions of Pink's third album, Try This, which was released on November 11, 2003. Eight of the 13 tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of the band Rancid. Linda Perry was featured on the album as a writer and musician. Despite the album reaching the top ten on album charts in the US, in Canada, in the UK, and in Australia, sales were considerably lower than those of Missundaztood. However, it did go platinum in the US. The singles \"Trouble\" and \"God Is a DJ\" did not reach the US top 40 but did reach the top ten in other countries, and \"Last to Know\" was released as a single outside North America. \"Trouble\" earned Pink the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance category at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, and \"Feel Good Time\" was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.[31] She toured extensively on the Try This Tour through Europe and Australia, where the album was better received.[citation needed]"]}}}
