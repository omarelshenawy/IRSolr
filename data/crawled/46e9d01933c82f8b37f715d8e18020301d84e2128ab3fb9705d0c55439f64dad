It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one on 19 October 1997, making it the group's fifth consecutive number one hit single. That same month, Simon Fuller took the Spice Girls east to perform their first live major concert to 40,000 fans in Istanbul, Turkey. Later, the Girls travelled to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela, who announced, \"These are my heroes.\"[45] This was the year when the Spice Girls reached the height of their career. In November, the Spice Girls released their second album, Spiceworld. The album was a global best seller. It set a new record for the fastest-selling album when it shipped seven million copies over the course of two weeks. Gaining favourable reviews,[40] the album went on to sell over 10 million copies in Europe,[46] Canada,[47] and the United States[36] combined, and 20 million copies worldwide.[48] Criticised in the United-States for releasing the album just nine months after their debut there, and suffering from over-exposure at home, the Spice Girls began to experience a media backlash. The group was criticised for the number of sponsorship deals signed[49]—over twenty in total—and they began to witness diminishing international chart positions. Nevertheless, the Spice Girls remained the biggest-selling pop group of both 1997 and 1998."],"after":["On 7 November 1997, the group performed \"Spice Up Your Life\" in the 1997 MTV Europe Music Awards.[50] After this performance, the Spice Girls made the decision to take over the running of the group themselves, and fired their manager Simon Fuller.[51] The firing was front page news around the world.
