Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a \"distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force.\"[27] His loyal secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: \"his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul.\"[13] Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, \"seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink.\"[citation needed]"],"after":["Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson,[163] Stanford White,[164] Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey's.[165][166][167] In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain's; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.[163] Twain notably described Tesla's induction motor invention as \"the most valuable patent since the telephone.\"[168] In the late 1920s, Tesla also befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist.
