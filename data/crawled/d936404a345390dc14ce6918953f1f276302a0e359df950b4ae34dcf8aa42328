The term \"nano-technology\" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known."],"after":["Inspired by Feynman's concepts, K. Eric Drexler used the term \"nanotechnology\" in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale \"assembler\" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications."]}}}
