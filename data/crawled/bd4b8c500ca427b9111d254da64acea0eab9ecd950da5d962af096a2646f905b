The first two-digit routes were assigned in 1924 while the first three-digit routes were assigned as part of the 1930 state highway renumbering. At that time, three-digit routes were generally assigned in \"clusters\", with the Rochester area playing home to Routes 250 through 261, the North Country having Routes 177 through 195, and so on. This system was used only in the renumbering and no longer exists on a large scale due to the removal and reassignment of designations in the years since."],"after":[]}}}
