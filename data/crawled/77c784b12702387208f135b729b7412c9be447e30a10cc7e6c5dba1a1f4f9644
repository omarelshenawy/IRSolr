For example, she worked on a limited basis with still photographers Imogen Cunningham in the 1930s, and Barbara Morgan in the 1940s. Graham considered Philippe Halsman's photographs of \"Dark Meadow\" the most complete photographic record of any of her dances. Halsman also photographed in the 1940s: \"Letter to the World\", \"Cave of the Heart\", \"Night Journey\" and \"Every Soul is a Circus\". In later years her thinking on the matter evolved and others convinced her to let them recreate some of what was lost."],"after":["In her biography Martha Agnes de Mille cites Graham's last performance as the evening of May 25, 1968, in a \"Time of Snow\". But in A Dancer's Life biographer Russell Freedman lists the year of Graham's final performance as 1969. In her 1991 autobiography, Blood Memory, Graham herself lists her final performance as her 1970 appearance in Cortege of Eagles when she was 76 years old."]}}}
