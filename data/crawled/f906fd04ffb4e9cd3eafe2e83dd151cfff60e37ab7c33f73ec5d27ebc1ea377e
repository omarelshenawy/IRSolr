It can be run on 6 AA batteries but also can be run on a 12V DC plug. It combines a 48-track MIDI sequencer and a 32-voice stereo digital sampler. The MPC500 is the first MPC that only has 12 velocity-sensitive rubber pads. It comes with 16 MB RAM but can be upgraded up to 128 MB of RAM. It has a CompactFlash slot for storage of samples. One major appeal of the MPC500 is the fact that you can take a project created on the MPC500 and transfer it to any current MPC with a CompactFlash reader. The MPC500 has a USB port for computer connectivity. It has one stereo output, making it the only MPC currently in production that does not have assignable outputs."]}}}
