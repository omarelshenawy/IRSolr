They called it Borikén (Borinquen in Spanish transliteration).[h] Having reported the findings of his first travel, Columbus brought with him this time a letter from King Ferdinand [29] empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the Spanish Empire and the Christian faith. Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of the Catholic saint, John the Baptist. Juan Ponce de León, a lieutenant under Columbus, founded the first Spanish settlement, Caparra, on August 8, 1508. He later served as the first governor of the island.[i] Eventually, traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, and San Juan became the name of the main trading/shipping port."]}}}
