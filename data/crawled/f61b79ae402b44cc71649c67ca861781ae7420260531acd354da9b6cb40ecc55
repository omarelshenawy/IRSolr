He has been referred to as the \"father of modern astronomy,\" as the \"father of modern physics,\" and as \"father of science.\" His experimental work is widely considered complementary to the writings of Bacon in establishing the modern scientific method. Galileo was born in Pisa and his career coincided with that of Kepler. The work of Galileo is considered to be a significant break from that of Aristotle; in particular, Galileo placed emphasis on quantity, rather than quality."]}}}
