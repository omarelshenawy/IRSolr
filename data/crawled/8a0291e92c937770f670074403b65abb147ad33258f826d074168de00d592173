The economy of Lesotho is based on agriculture, livestock, manufacturing and mining, and depends heavily on inflows of workersâ€™ remittances and receipts from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).[21][22] The majority of households subsist on farming. The formal sector employment consists of mainly the female workers in the apparel sector, the male migrant labour, primarily miners in South Africa for 3 to 9 months and employment in the Government of Lesotho (GOL). The western lowlands form the main agricultural zone. Almost 50% of the population earn income through informal crop cultivation or animal husbandry with nearly two-thirds of the country's income coming from the agricultural sector. The percentage of the population living below USD Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) US$1.25/day fell from 48 percent to 44 percent between 1995 and 2003.[21] The country is among the \"Low Human Development\" countries (rank 160 of 187 on the Human Development Index) as classified by the UNDP, with 48.2 years of life expectancy at birth.[23] Adult literacy is as high as 82%. Among the children below the age of 5 years, 20% are under weight.[24]"]}}}
