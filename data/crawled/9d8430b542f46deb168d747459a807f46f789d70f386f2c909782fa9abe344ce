They were variously characterised as part of a garage rock, post-punk or new wave revival.[302][303][304][305] Because the bands came from across the globe, cited diverse influences (from traditional blues, through New Wave to grunge), and adopted differing styles of dress, their unity as a genre has been disputed.[306] There had been attempts to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s and by 2000 scenes had grown up in several countries.[307] The Detroit rock scene included the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs and the Detroit Cobras[308] and that of New York Radio 4, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the Rapture.[309] Elsewhere, other lesser-known acts such as Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from Britain,[310] the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden,[311] the 5.6.7.8's from Japan,[312] and the Oblivians from Memphis enjoyed underground, regional or national success.[313]"]}}}
