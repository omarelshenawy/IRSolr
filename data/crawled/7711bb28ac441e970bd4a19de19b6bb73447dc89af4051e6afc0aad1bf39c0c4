None of these have ever been allowed to be excavated, so their possibly spectacular contents remain unknown.[74] Late examples which have been investigated, such as the Kitora Tomb, had been robbed of most of their contents, but the Takamatsuzuka Tomb retains mural paintings. Lower down the social scale in the same period, terracotta haniwa figures, as much as a metre high, were deposited on top of aristocratic tombs as grave markers, with others left inside, apparently representing possessions such as horses and houses for use in the afterlife.[75] Both kofun mounds and haniwa figures appear to have been discontinued as Buddhism became the dominant Japanese religion.[76]"]}}}
