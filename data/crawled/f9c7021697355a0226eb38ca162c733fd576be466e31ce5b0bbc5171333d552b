The portrayal of the street life and high-fashion scene in the video was a reference to Madonna's life in the gritty, multiracial streets and clubs that she used to haunt while her career was beginning as well as the world of popularity and success she was experiencing at that moment.[32] The storyline involved her being emotionally torn between the photographer and her boyfriend.[34] Madonna's boyfriend in the video is portrayed as Latino and her struggles with this relationship depicted the struggle Hispanic women faced with their men.[33] Lambert said that there was \"no formula\" used when making the 'Borderline' video and that they were \"inventing it as we went along.\"[35] In the January 1997 issue of Rolling Stone, Lambert described the video and its plot as, \"Boy and girl enjoy simple pleasures of barrio love, girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was to spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love.\"[5]"]}}}
