Steve Baltin of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Madonna had played many roles in the first night of her Confessions tour – but confessor was not one of them. Apparently, in all the pomp and circumstance, there was no room for warmth, or even the attitude that made her recent Coachella festival performance so memorable.\"[10] Don Chareunsy of The San Diego Union-Tribune commented that Madonna's previous tours, Drowned World Tour (2001) and Re-Invention World Tour (2004), \"were excellent concerts ... but she stepped it up a few notches\" for the Confessions Tour.[14] Ben Wener of The Orange County Register reported that \"No one – but no one – stages elaborate eye-candy productions like Madonna, whose highly impressive Confessions Tour opened Sunday night at a packed Forum so sweltering it seemed as though it were being prepped for the world’s largest Bikram yoga session.\"[15] Lina Das from the Daily Mail complimented the show, saying that Madonna still had the ability to grab the headlines with her shock tactics.[9] Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine complimented the finale of the tour saying, \"There’s not a better way the Confessions Tour could’ve closed.\"[12] Tom Young from the BBC called the show \"a big fat neon light of a pop-dance explosion. There’s a party going on, and unless you were there in the first place, you’re not invited. Whistles and whoops rarely cease and applause ripples throughout building into regular raptures for a consistently first-class performer. It’s almost enough to make those who weren’t there jealous. Almost.\"[16]"]}}}
