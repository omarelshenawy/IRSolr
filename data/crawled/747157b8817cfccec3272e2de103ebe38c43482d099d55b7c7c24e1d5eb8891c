He denounced their willingness to associate with Train despite his disparagement of blacks, and he charged them with advocating \"Educated Suffrage\", thereby repudiating the AERA's principle of universal suffrage.[92] Henry Blackwell responded, \"Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton believe in the right of the negro to vote. We are united on that point. There is no question of principle between us.\"[93] Frederick Douglass objected to Stanton's use of \"Sambo\" to represent black men in an article she had written for The Revolution.[93]"],"after":["The majority of the attendees supported the pending Fifteenth Amendment, but debate was contentious.[94] Douglass said, \"I do not see how anyone can pretend that there is the same urgency in giving the ballot to woman as to the negro. With us, the matter is a question of life and death, at least in fifteen States of the Union.\"[95] Anthony replied, \"Mr. Douglass talks about the wrongs of the negro; but with all the outrages that he to-day suffers, he would not exchange his sex and take the place of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\"[96]"]}}}
