Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones created. Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, all fell after the war: the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburgs, and the Ottomans. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4Â million soldiers dead,[177] not counting other casualties. Germany and Russia were similarly affected.[178]"]}}}
