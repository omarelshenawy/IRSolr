The problem on the sphere or cylinder is equivalent to that on the plane. For closed (orientable or non-orientable) surfaces with positive genus, the maximum number p of colors needed depends on the surface's Euler characteristic Ï‡ according to the formula"],"after":["where the outermost brackets denote the floor function."]}}}
