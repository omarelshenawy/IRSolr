It follows certain rules and conventions, and has its own terminology. For example, the expression has the following components:"],"after":["A coefficient is a numerical value which multiplies a variable (the operator is omitted). A term is an addend or a summand, a group of coefficients, variables, constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators.[3] Letters represent variables and constants. By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g. ) are typically used to represent constants, and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g. and ) are used to represent variables.[4] They are usually written in italics.[5]"]}}}
