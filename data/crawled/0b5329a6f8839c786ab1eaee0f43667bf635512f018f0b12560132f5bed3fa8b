New Zealand historian Michael King in The Penguin History Of New Zealand describes the Māori as \"the last major human community on earth untouched and unaffected by the wider world.\" Early European explorers, including Abel Tasman (who arrived in 1642) and Captain James Cook (who first visited in 1769), recorded their impressions of Māori. Initial contact between Māori and Europeans proved problematic, sometimes fatal, with several accounts of Europeans being cannibalised.[35]"]}}}
