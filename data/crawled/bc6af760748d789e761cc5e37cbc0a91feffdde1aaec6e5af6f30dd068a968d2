Records producer Reggie Lucas, after Sire Records green-lighted it when her first single \"Everybody\" became a club hit.[2] However, she did not have enough material for the album.[3] Lucas brought two new songs to the project and John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, a DJ at Funhouse disco was called to remix the available tracks. In the meantime, due to conflict of interest, Madonna's collaborator on \"Everybody\", Steve Bray had sold another song \"Ain't No Big Deal\" to an act on another label, rendering it unavailable for Madonna's project.[3] It was Benitez who discovered a new song written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of the pop group Pure Energy.[4] The song, titled \"Holiday\", had been turned down by Phyllis Hyman and Mary Wilson, formerly of The Supremes.[5] Jellybean and Madonna sent the demo to their friend, Fred Zarr so he could embellish the arrangement and program the song with his synthesizer magic. After the vocals were added by Madonna, Benitez spent four days and tried to enhance the commercial appeal of the track before the April 1983 deadline.[3][5] Just before it was completed, Madonna and Benitez met Fred Zarr at Sigma Sound in Manhattan [1] where Zarr added the now familiar piano solo towards the end of the track.[4]"]}}}
