The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group.[207] The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down.[21][22][23][24][25][26][208] One member of the crew was arrested. TorrentFreak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5-10% increase in traffic from the displaced users,[209] though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels.[210][211] In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials.[212] The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site,[213] criticizing in particular the increased use of adverts.[214] IsoHunt has since copied much of the original TPB database and made it accessible through oldpiratebay.org, a searchable index of old Pirate Bay torrents.[29][30][214] IsoHunt also released a tool called The Open Bay, in order to allow users to deploy their own version of the The Pirate Bay website.[215] The tool is responsible for around 372 mirror sites.[216] Since 17 December 2014, The Pirate Bay's Facebook page has been unavailable.[211][217] On 22 December 2014, a website was resumed at the domain thepiratebay.se, showing a flip clock with the length of time in days and hours that the site had been offline, and a waving pirate flag.[218] From this day TPB was hosted a period in Moldova,[219] on Trabia Network (Moldo-German company) servers. Then, The Pirate Bay began using the services of CloudFlare, a company which offers reverse proxy services.[220] On 1 January 2015, the website presented a countdown to 1 February 2015.[221][222] The website returned with a prominent phoenix logo displayed at the domain thepiratebay.se on 31 January 2015.[223]"]}}}
