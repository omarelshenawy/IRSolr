Davis's team uncovered a small site containing funerary artifacts with Tutankhamun's name. Assuming that this site, identified as KV54, was Tutankhamun's complete tomb, Davis concluded the dig. The details of both findings are documented in Davis's 1912 publication, The Tombs of Harmhabi and Touat√¢nkhamanou; the book closes with the comment, \"I fear that the Valley of the Kings is now exhausted.\"[2] But Davis was to be proven spectacularly wrong."]}}}
