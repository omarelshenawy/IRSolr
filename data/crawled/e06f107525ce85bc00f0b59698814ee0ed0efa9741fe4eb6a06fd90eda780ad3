The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016.[60][61][dated info] The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements[62] which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),[63][64] with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.[62]"],"after":["Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.[65] The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.[66] Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.[67] The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 7008458525252000000♠14 years and 194 days, having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.[68][69]"]}}}
