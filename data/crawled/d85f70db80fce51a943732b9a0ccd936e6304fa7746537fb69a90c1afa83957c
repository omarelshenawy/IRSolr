While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[45] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[34][46][47] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[48] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations—Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"— and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".[49][50] The album's first single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[51]"]}}}
