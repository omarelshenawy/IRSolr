She gave birth to a son named Wei Ran (韦然).[4] However, Cheng Shuyao was soon embroiled in the Five-anti Campaign, a political campaign launched by Mao against the capitalist class in 1952. He was accused of embezzlement and confessed to the charges under pressure. Shangguan decided to divorce Cheng; their marriage lasted less than two years.[4] She later had another relationship with the director He Lu (贺路).[4]"]}}}
