If the plane is neither vertical nor horizontal nor equatorial, the sundial is said to be reclining or inclining.[42] Such a sundial might be located on a South-facing roof, for example. The hour-lines for such a sundial can be calculated by slightly correcting the horizontal formula above[43]"]}}}
