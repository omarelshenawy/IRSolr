Shannon's classic paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948."],"after":["Much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of thermodynamics by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs. Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by Rolf Landauer in the 1960s, are explored in Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory."]}}}
