He returned to Independence, where he married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919.[25] The couple had one child, Mary Margaret Truman.[26]","Shortly before the wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the recession of 1921.[8] Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so with the aid of a supporter.[27] Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.[28]"]}}}
