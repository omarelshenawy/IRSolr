Farmers are subsidised by the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a number of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land."],"after":["In the final quarter of 2008 the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991.[230] Unemployment increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009 and by January 2012 the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9% to 22.5%, the highest since current records began in 1992.[231][232] Total UK government debt rose from 44.4% of GDP in 2007 to 82.9% of GDP in 2011.[233] In February 2013, the UK lost its top AAA credit rating for the first time since 1978.[234]"]}}}
