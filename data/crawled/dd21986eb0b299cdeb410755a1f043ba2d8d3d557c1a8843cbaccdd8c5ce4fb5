The street itself belonged to the French sector of West Berlin and the East German authorities declared that the windows and doors that led out onto Bernauer Straße should be bricked up. In the early morning of 22 August 1961, Ida Siekmann was the first of 98 people to die while attempting to escape. She was living on the third floor of number 48, threw bedding and some possessions down onto the street and jumped out of the window of her apartment.[15][16][17] She fell on the sidewalk and was severely injured, dying shortly afterwards on her way to the Lazarus Hospital.[15][18] On 8 March 1989, Winfried Freudenberg became the last person to die in an attempt to escape from East Germany to West Berlin across the Berlin Wall by falling from his balloon.[19][20]"],"after":["The Berlin Wall, like the much longer inner German border between East and West Germany, was designed with two purposes in mind: to obstruct would-be border-crossers and to enable border guards to detect and stop illegal border crossings. In its final form, the 156 km (97 mi) wall consisted of inner and outer concrete walls separated by a \"death strip\"[11] some 15 m (49 ft) to 150 m (490 ft) wide. It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches. The shooting orders, or Schießbefehl, issued to the border guards instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals, and that the use of deadly force was required to deal with them: \"Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used\".[21] Some guards have since claimed that the motto at the time was \"a dead refugee is better than an escaped one\".[22] At first, wounded or shot refugees were left out in the open until they were removed, so that people from West Berlin and the western press could see them as well. After the reactions to the public death of Peter Fechter, border guards were ordered to move any casualties out of West Berlin's field of view. Negative reporting was ought to be prevented. Because of this, border guars often pulled people down into the car-moat that was part of the whole border security system. In some cases, the removal of the body was done only after nightfall."]}}}
