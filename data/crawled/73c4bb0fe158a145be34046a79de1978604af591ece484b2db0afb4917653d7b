For example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression.[120] However, this study was criticized on several grounds. For example, it is not known whether dolphins are more effective than common pets.[121] Reviews of this and other published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords more than fleeting mood improvement.[122]"],"after":[]}}}
