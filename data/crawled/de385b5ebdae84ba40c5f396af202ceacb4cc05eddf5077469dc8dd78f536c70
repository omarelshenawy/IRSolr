It had seven dates, three in Japan and four throughout Europe.[76] When tickets went on sale, Carey set records when all 150,000 tickets for her three shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under three hours, breaking the previous record held by The Rolling Stones.[76] Due to the album's success, Carey won two awards at the American Music Awards for her solo efforts: Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist.[77] Daydream and its singles were respectively nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards.[78] Carey, along with Boyz II Men, opened the event with a performance of \"One Sweet Day\".[79] However, Carey did not receive any award, prompting her to comment \"What can you do? I will never be disappointed again. After I sat through the whole show and didn't win once, I can handle anything.\"[79] In 1995, due to Daydream‍ '​s enormous Japanese sales, Billboard declared Carey the \"Overseas Artist of the Year\" in Japan.[80]"]}}}
