While these new instruments were expensive, these characteristics meant musicians were quick to adopt them, especially in the United Kingdom[48] and the United States. This encouraged a trend towards producing music using digital sounds,[note 2] and laid the foundations for the development of the inexpensive digital instruments popular in the next decade (see below). Relatively successful instruments with each selling more than several hundred units per series, included the NED Synclavier (1977), Fairlight CMI (1979), E-mu Emulator (1981), and PPG Wave (1981).[note 1][48][49][50][51]"],"after":["In 1983, however, Yamaha's revolutionary DX7 digital synthesizer[52][53] swept through popular music, leading to the adoption and development of digital synthesizers in many varying forms during the 1980s, and the rapid decline of analog synthesizer technology. In 1987, Roland's D50 synthesizer was released which combined the already existing sample-based synthesis[note 3] and the onboard digital effects,[54] while Korg's even more popular M1 (1988) now also heralded the era of the workstation synthesizer, based on ROM sample sounds for composing and sequencing whole songs, rather than solely traditional sound synthesis.[55]"]}}}
