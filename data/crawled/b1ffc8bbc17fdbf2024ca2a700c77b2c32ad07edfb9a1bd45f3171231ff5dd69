Cobham's thesis states that polynomial time is a synonym for \"tractable\", \"feasible\", \"efficient\", or \"fast\".[9]"],"after":["In some contexts, especially in optimization, one differentiates between strongly polynomial time and weakly polynomial time algorithms. These two concepts are only relevant if the inputs to the algorithms consist of integers."]}}}
