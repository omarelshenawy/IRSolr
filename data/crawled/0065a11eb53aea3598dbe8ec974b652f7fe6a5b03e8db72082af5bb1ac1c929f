In a sense, all simple triple time signatures, such as 3 8, 3 4, 3 2, etc.â€”and all compound duple times, such as 6 8, 6 16 and so on, are equivalent. A piece in 3 4 can be easily rewritten in 3 8, simply by halving the length of the notes. Other time signature rewritings are possible: most commonly a simple time signature with triplets translates into a compound meter."]}}}
