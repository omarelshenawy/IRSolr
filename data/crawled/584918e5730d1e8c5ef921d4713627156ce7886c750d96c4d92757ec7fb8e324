Focusing on this aspect, usually referred to as completeness of orders, one obtains:"],"after":["However, one can go even further: if all finite non-empty infima exist, then ∧ can be viewed as a total binary operation in the sense of universal algebra. Hence, in a lattice, two operations ∧ and ∨ are available, and one can define new properties by giving identities, such as"]}}}
