Unlike Metropolis, where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female.[14] Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity, and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk came to the conclusion that \"Express Yourself\" was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position.[63] Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book Political Theory for Mortals, that \"Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America.\"[64] Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of \"Michael Jackson's androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity.\" He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.[65]"]}}}
