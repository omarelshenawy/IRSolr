For example, with howler monkeys both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity, resulting in groups in which neither the males nor females are typically related.[75] Some prosimians, colobine monkeys and callitrichid monkeys use this system.[55]"],"after":["Primatologist Jane Goodall, who studied in the Gombe Stream National Park, noted fission-fusion societies in chimpanzees.[92] There is fission when the main group splits up to forage during the day, then fusion when the group returns at night to sleep as a group. This social structure can also be observed in the Hamadryas baboon,[93] spider monkeys[75] and the bonobo.[93] The gelada has a similar social structure in which many smaller groups come together to form temporary herds of up to 600 monkeys.[93]"]}}}
