They expressed some of his later themes, as in Night on the El Train (couples in silence), Evening Wind (solitary female), and The Catboat (simple nautical scene).[34] Two notable oil paintings of this time were New York Interior (1921) and New York Restaurant (1922).[35] He also painted two of his many \"window\" paintings to come: Girl at Sewing Machine and Moonlight Interior, both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as gazing out or from the outside looking in.[36]"]}}}
