He has written and recorded material for his four studio albums. Timberlake released his solo debut studio album, Justified, in November 2002.[1] Most of the record was produced by The Neptunes, with additional collaborators including Brian McKnight, Scott Storch, Timbaland, and The Underdogs. The album was preceded by the release of the first single, \"Like I Love You\", written by Timberlake, Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams. The follow-up single \"Cry Me a River\", produced by Timbaland,[2] is a R&B song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past.
