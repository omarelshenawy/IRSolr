It immediately applied for and was granted borough status, which was followed by an award of city status by letters patent in 2000, as the joint winner of a competition to mark the Millennium. Thus Brighton & Hove is not part of the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex, but it is still part of the ceremonial county of East Sussex."]}}}
