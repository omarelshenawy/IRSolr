Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, but gave permission, and later agreed that it contributed to the success of the Trinity test.[35]"],"after":["A 20-foot (6.1 m) high wooden platform was constructed 800 yards (730 m) to the south-east of Trinity ground zero (33°40′16″N 106°28′20″W﻿ / ﻿33.67123°N 106.47229°W﻿ / 33.67123; -106.47229) and 108 long tons (110 t) of TNT were stacked on top of it. Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell off the elevator lifting them up to the platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the pile of boxes of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with 1,000 curies (37 TBq) of beta ray activity and 400 curies (15 TBq) of gamma ray activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured it into the tubing.[35][43][44]"]}}}
