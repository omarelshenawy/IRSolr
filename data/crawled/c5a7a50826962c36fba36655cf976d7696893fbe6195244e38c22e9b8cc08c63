Anglo-Saxon literacy developed after Christianisation in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving text of Old English literature is CÃ¦dmon's Hymn, composed between 658 and 680. There is a limited corpus of runic inscriptions from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably Franks Casket) date to the 8th century."]}}}
