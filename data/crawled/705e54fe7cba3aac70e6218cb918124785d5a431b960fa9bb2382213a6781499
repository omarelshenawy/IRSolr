There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland.[10] Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow. Most of Ireland's bird species come from Iceland, Greenland and Africa."]}}}
