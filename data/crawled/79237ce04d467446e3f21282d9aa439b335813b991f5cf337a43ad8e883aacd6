In 2004, the university opened the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar.[22] It continues to forge partnerships with major institutions in India, Singapore, and the People's Republic of China.[23][24][25] Former president Jeffrey S. Lehman called the university, with its high international profile, a \"transnational university\".[26] On March 9, 2004, Cornell and Stanford laid the cornerstone for a new Bridging the Rift Center located on the Israel–Jordan border.[27]"],"after":["Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York, overlooking the town and Cayuga Lake. When the university was founded in 1865, the campus consisted of 209.5 acres (0.85 km²) of Ezra Cornell's roughly 300 acre (1.2 km²) farm.[not in citation given] Since then, it has swelled to about 2300 acres (3.0 km²), encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.[28] Some 260 university buildings are divided primarily between Central and North Campuses on the plateau of the Hill, West Campus on its slope, and Collegetown immediately south of Central Campus.[28][not in citation given] Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums. The only remaining residential facility on Central Campus is the Law School's dormitory, Hughes Hall which is scheduled to be renovated and converted to office space in the near future. North Campus contains freshman and graduate student housing, themed program houses, and 29 fraternity and sorority houses. West Campus has upperclass residential colleges and an additional 25 fraternity and sorority houses.[29][not in citation given] Collegetown contains two upperclass residence halls[30][31] and the Schwartz Performing Arts Center amid a neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.[32]"]}}}
