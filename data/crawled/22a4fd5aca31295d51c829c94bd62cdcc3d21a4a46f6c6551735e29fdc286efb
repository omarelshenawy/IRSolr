He also spoke in support of organized labor to further chagrin big business, but to their delight, he endorsed the gold standard, protective tariffs and lower taxes.[92] For his aggressive use of United States antitrust law, he became known as the \"trust-buster.\" He brought 40 antitrust suits, and broke up major companies, such as the largest railroad and Standard Oil, the largest oil company.[93]"]}}}
