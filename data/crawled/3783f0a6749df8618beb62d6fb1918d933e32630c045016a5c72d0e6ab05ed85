Influenza is predominantly transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with bird droppings or nasal secretions, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. As the virus can be inactivated by soap, frequent hand washing reduces the risk of infection. The most common symptoms are chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, cough and fatigue. Influenza is occasionally associated with nausea and vomiting, particularly in children. Pneumonia is a rare complication which can be life-threatening. Although often confused with other influenza-like illnesses, especially the common cold, influenza is a more severe disease and is caused by a different type of virus."]}}}
