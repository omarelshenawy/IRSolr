This gives us","By taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral. We know that this limit exists because f was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity."],"after":["Neither F(b) nor F(a) is dependent on , so the limit on the left side remains F(b) âˆ’ F(a)."]}}}
