Initially, under Augustus the Praetorian Guard was a kind of imperial bodyguard. Under Sejanus however it evolved into a powerful and influential branch of the government involved in public security, civil administration, and ultimately political intercession; changes which would have a lasting impact on the course of the principate. Sejanus was an ambitious man and desired to be emperor,[24] consequently he saw Arruntius as an obstacle to his goal which needed to be eliminated. In 31 AD Sejanus concocted a charge of maiestas (treason) against Arruntius which was prosecuted by Sejanus' henchmen Aruseius and Sanquinius.[25] Perhaps at the prompting of Antonia,[26] Tiberius finally saw through the schemes of Sejanus and had the charges quashed, the accusers punished and Sejanus executed.[24] Arruntius had his revenge against his great enemy by being the passive instrument which indirectly brought about Sejanus' fall.[18]"]}}}
