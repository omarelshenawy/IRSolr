His use of the term covered the period 1966 â€“ 1976 and was applied to the work of Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra and new work by former minimalists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, and Barry Le Va, and others.[38] Process art and anti-form art are other terms used to describe this work determined by the space it occupies and the process by which it is made.[51]"]}}}
