The community council is the Falekaupule (the traditional assembly of elders) or te sina o fenua (literally: \"grey-hairs of the land\"). In the past, another caste, the priests (tofuga), were also amongst the decision-makers. The ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority at the local level. Ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry. Under the Falekaupule Act (1997),[95] the powers and functions of the Falekaupule are now shared with the pule o kaupule (elected village presidents; one on each atoll).[96]"],"after":["Local government districts consisting of more than one islet:"]}}}
