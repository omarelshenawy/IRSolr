In 4 dimensions, however, knots made using curves can be trivially untied by displacing them in the fourth direction, but 2-dimensional surfaces can form non-trivial, non-self-intersecting knots in 4-dimensional space.[11] Because these surfaces are 2-dimensional, they can form much more complex knots than strings in 3-dimensional space can. The Klein bottle is an example of such a knotted surface .[citation needed] Another such surface is the real projective plane.[citation needed]"],"after":["The set of points in Euclidean 4-space having the same distance R from a fixed point P0 forms a hypersurface known as a 3-sphere.
