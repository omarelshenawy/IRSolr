But then I felt empowered, it was an incredible feeling.\" She goes on to say about Madonna, \"She looks incredible now — better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now\" before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, \"If she is a good mother that’s all that matters.\" Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna \"will not change\" despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, \"Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'\". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that \"there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake\".[20]"]}}}
