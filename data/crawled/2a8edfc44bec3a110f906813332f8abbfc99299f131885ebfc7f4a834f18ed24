The Spanish Crown gave them freedom, and those freedmen settled north of St. Augustine in Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, the first free black settlement of its kind in what became the United States.[citation needed]"],"after":["Great Britain controlled Florida from 1763 to 1783. Great Britain gained control of Florida through the Peace of Paris and exchanges of possessions with Spain. The British divided their new acquisitions into East Florida, with its capital at St. Augustine, and West Florida, with its capital at Pensacola, by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. East Florida and West Florida did not send any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the Declaration of Independence.[13]"]}}}
