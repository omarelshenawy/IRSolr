It formed on November 13 in the western Caribbean Sea and maintained an unprecedented west-to-east track for its entire duration. It attained hurricane status south of Jamaica and passed south of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, attaining peak winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) about 21 mi (34 km) south of Saint Croix in the US Virgin Islands. It gradually weakened while moving through the Leeward Islands, eventually dissipating on November 23 over the open Atlantic Ocean. Damage in the US territories totaled about $330 million, with widespread flooding and erosion in Saint Croix.
