Other formations also contributed soldiers; estimates range from 2,000 in total[37] to about 3,500 from the far-right National Armed Forces and a few dozen from the communist People's Army.[38] Most of them had trained for several years in partisan and urban guerrilla warfare, but lacked experience in prolonged daylight fighting. The forces lacked equipment,[6] because the Home Army had shuttled weapons to the east of the country before the decision to include Warsaw in Operation Tempest.[39] Other partisan groups subordinated themselves to Home Army command, and many volunteers joined during the fighting, including Jews freed from the Gęsiówka concentration camp in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto.[40]"],"after":["Colonel Antoni Chruściel (codename \"Monter\") commanded the Polish forces in Warsaw. Initially he divided his forces into eight areas.[41] On 20 September, they were reorganized to align with the three areas of the city held by Polish forces. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps (Polish: Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej) and commanded by General Antoni Chruściel—promoted from Colonel on 14 September—formed into three infantry divisions (Śródmieście, Żoliborz and Mokotów).[41]"]}}}
