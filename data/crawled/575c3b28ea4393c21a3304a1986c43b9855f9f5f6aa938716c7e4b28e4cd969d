The word jewellery is derived from the word jewel, which was anglicised from the Old French \"jouel\" in around the 13th century. Further tracing leads back to the Latin word \"jocale\", meaning plaything. Jewellery is one of the oldest forms of body adornment; recently found 100,000 year-old Nassarius shells that were made into beads are thought to be the oldest known jewellery."]}}}
