The area has become popular among tourists, including stag and hen parties from Britain.[76] It was developed as Dublin's cultural quarter and does retain this spirit as a centre for small arts productions, photographic and artists' studios, and in the form of street performers and small music venues. However, it has been criticised as overpriced, false and dirty by Lonely Planet.[77] In 2014, Temple Bar was listed by the Huffington Post as one of the ten most disappointing destinations in the world.[78] The areas around Leeson Street, Harcourt Street, South William Street and Camden/George's Street are popular nightlife spots for locals."]}}}
