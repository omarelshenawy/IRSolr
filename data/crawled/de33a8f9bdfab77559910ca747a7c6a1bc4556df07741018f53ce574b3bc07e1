Instead they worked to interpret \"religion\" (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.[54] In nineteenth century Japan, Buddhism was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of natural law into a \"religion,\" as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence \"religion\" has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.[55]"],"after":["George Lindbeck, a Lutheran and a postliberal theologian (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in \"God\" or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to \"a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments.\"[56]"]}}}
