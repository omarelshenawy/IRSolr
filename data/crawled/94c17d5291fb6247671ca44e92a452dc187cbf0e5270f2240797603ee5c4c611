Operated by Iarnród Éireann, the Dublin Suburban Rail network consists of five railway lines serving the Greater Dublin Area and commuter towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk in County Louth. One of these lines is the electrified Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) line, which runs primarily along the coast of Dublin, comprising a total of 31 stations, from Malahide and Howth southwards as far as Greystones in County Wicklow.[48] Commuter rail operates on the other four lines using Irish Rail diesel multiple units. In 2012, passengers for DART and Dublin Suburban lines were 15.8 million and 9.9 million, respectively (around 70% of all Irish Rail passengers).[49]"]}}}
