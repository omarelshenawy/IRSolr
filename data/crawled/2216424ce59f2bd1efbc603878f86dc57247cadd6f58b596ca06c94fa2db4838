In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe with Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork. These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art,[150] as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern \"Celtic\" culture in general."]}}}
