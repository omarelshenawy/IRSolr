There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor,[5] and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, believed to have been an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes.[6] Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey.[7] The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester,[8] and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth,[9] are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.[10]"],"after":["During the Middle Ages, much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire â€“ an ancient division of the county of Lancashire. Salfordshire encompassed several parishes and townships, some of which, like Rochdale, were important market towns and centres of England's woollen trade. The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic flannel and fustian cloth production, which encouraged a system of cross-regional trade.[11][12][13] In the late-18th century, the Industrial Revolution transformed the local domestic system; mechanisation enabled the industrialisation of the region's textile trade, triggering rapid growth in the cotton industry and expansion in ancillary trades.[14] Infrastructure such as rows of terraced housing, factories and roads were constructed to house labour, transport goods, and produce cotton goods on an industrial scale for a global market.[14][13] The townships in and around Manchester began expanding \"at an astonishing rate\" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in industrial textile production and processing.[15] This population increase resulted in the \"vigourous concentric growth\" of a conurbation between Manchester and an arc of surrounding mill towns, formed from a steady acretion of houses, factories and transport infrastructure.[16] Places such as Bury, Oldham and Bolton played a central economic role nationally, and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive cotton-producing towns in the world.[17] However, it was Manchester that was the most populous settlement, a major city, the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods,[18][19] and the natural centre of its region.[20] By 1835 \"Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world\";[19] and by 1848 urban sprawl had fused the city to its surrounding towns and hinterland to form a single continuous conurbation.[16] In the 1910s, local government reforms to administer this conurbation as a single entity were proposed.[21]"]}}}
