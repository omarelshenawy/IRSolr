They argued that the term \"Jew\" was to be interpreted metaphorically, as referring to the spiritual development of the soul, rather than the superficial denomination of the individual, and they added a chain of intermediary states between \"Jews\" and idol worshippers, or spiritualised the very definition of \"Jews\" and \"non-Jews\" and argued that a soul can be re-incarnated in different communities (whether Jewish or not) as much as within a single one.[64]"],"after":["The idea that there are ten divine sefirot could evolve over time into the idea that \"God is One being, yet in that One being there are Ten\" which opens up a debate about what the \"correct beliefs\" in God should be, according to Judaism.
