The route produces an operating surplus, most of it from the high-speed Acelas. The NEC does require considerable capital investment, and it is still many billions short of a \"state of good repair\". For example, most of the catenary south of New York dates from the Depression, when federal funds largely paid for the electrification, the tunnels under Baltimore are close to 150 years old, and several bridges are more than 100 years old and in need of replacement."]}}}
