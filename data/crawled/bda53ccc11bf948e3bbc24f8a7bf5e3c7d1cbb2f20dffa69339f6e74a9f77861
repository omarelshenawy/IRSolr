That is, the derivative of the area function A(x) is the original function f(x); or, the area function is simply an antiderivative of the original function. Computing the derivative of a function and “finding the area” under its curve are \"opposite\" operations. This is the crux of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."]}}}
