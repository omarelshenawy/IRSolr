However, initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to Poland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French probe into the Saarland.[61] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[62] Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which was to later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic."],"after":["On 17 September 1939, after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviets invaded Poland from the east.[63] The Polish army was defeated and Warsaw surrendered to the Germans on 27 September, with final pockets of resistance surrendering on 6 October. Poland's territory was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union, with Lithuania and Slovakia also receiving small shares. After the surrender of Poland's armed forces, the Polish resistance established an Underground State and a partisan Home Army.[64] About 100,000 Polish military personnel were evacuated to Romania and the Baltic countries; many of these soldiers later fought against the Germans in other theatres of the war.[65] Poland's Enigma codebreakers were also evacuated to France.[66]"]}}}
