They too were subjugated by Assyria and the Hittites for centuries. The Egyptians fought the Hittites for control over western Syria; the fighting reached its zenith in 1274 BC with the Battle of Kadesh.[45][46] The west remained part of the Hittite empire until it's destruction c. 1200 BC,[47] while eastern Syria largely became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire,[48] who also annexed much of the west during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I 1114â€“1076 BC."]}}}
