Gabriel co-produced So with Daniel Lanois, also known for his work with U2 and Brian Eno.[30] In 1990, Rolling Stone ranked So number No. 14 on its list of \"Top 100 Albums of the Eighties\".[31]"],"after":["\"Sledgehammer,\" which dealt specifically with the themes of sex and sexual relations through lyrical innuendos, was accompanied by a much-lauded music video, which was a collaboration with director Stephen R. Johnson, Aardman Animations,[5] and the Brothers Quay. The video set a new standard for art in the music video industry, and won nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1987, a record which still stands as of 2011.[5] \"Sledgehammer\" is the most played music video in the history of MTV,[5] and in 1998 it was named the station's number one animated video of all time.[32] A follow-up video for the song \"Big Time\" also broke new ground in music video animation and special effects. The song is a story of \"what happens to you when you become a little too successful\", in Gabriel's words. The success of the album earned Peter Gabriel two awards at the Brit Awards in 1987: Best British Male Solo Artist and Best British Video for \"Sledgehammer\".[9] Gabriel was also nominated for three Grammy Awards: Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year.[33]"]}}}
