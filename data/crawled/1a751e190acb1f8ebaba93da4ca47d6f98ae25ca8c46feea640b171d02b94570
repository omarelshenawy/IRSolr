The Mildenhall Treasure from Suffolk consists of thirty items of silver tableware deposited in the late fourth century, many large and elaborately decorated, such as the \"Great Dish\".[105] The Water Newton Treasure from Cambridgeshire is smaller, but is the earliest hoard to have a clearly Christian character, apparently belonging to a church or chapel;[106] the assorted collection probably includes items made in Britain.[107] The Kaiseraugst Treasure from the site at Augusta Raurica in modern Switzerland (now in Basel) contained 257 items, including a banqueting service with sophisticated decoration.[108] The Esquiline Treasure, found in Rome, evidently came from a wealthy Roman family of the late fourth century, and includes several large items, including the \"Casket of Projecta\".[109] Most of the Esquiline Treasure is in the British Museum, as are bowls and dishes from the Carthage Treasure, which belonged to a known family in Roman Africa around 400.[110]"]}}}
