During this period the regime launched several campaigns of purges in which numerous \"enemies of the state\" and \"parasite elements\" were targeted for different forms of punishment, such as deportation, internal exile and internment in forced labour camps and prisons, sometimes for life, as well as extrajudicial killing.[103] Nevertheless, anti-communist resistance was one of the most long-lasting in the Eastern Bloc.[104] A 2006 Commission estimated the number of direct victims[vague] of the communist repression at two million people.[105]"],"after":["In 1965, Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the Soviet Union. Thus, communist Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country who refused to participate at the Soviet-led 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia (Ceaușescu even publicly condemned the action as \"a big mistake, [and] a serious danger to peace in Europe and to the fate of communism in the world\"[106]); it was also the only communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War; and established diplomatic relations with West Germany the same year.[107] At the same time, close ties with the Arab countries (and the PLO) allowed Romania to play a key role in the Israel–Egypt and Israel–PLO peace talks.[108] As Romania's foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 (from US$3 billion to $10 billion),[109] the influence of international financial organizations (such as the IMF and the World Bank) grew, gradually conflicting with Ceaușescu's autocratic rule. The latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing austerity steps that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy. At the same time, Ceaușescu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate secret police and imposed a severe cult of personality, which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution, together with his wife, in the violent Romanian Revolution of December 1989."]}}}
