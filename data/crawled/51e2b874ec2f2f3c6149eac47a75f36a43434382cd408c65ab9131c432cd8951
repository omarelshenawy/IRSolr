It was located in the Selwyn Range between Mount Isa and Cloncurry. Mary Kathleen was first settled during the 1860s. Mary Kathleen Uranium built a mine, with 4,080 tonnes of uranium oxide being extracted between 1958 and 1963. The mine then lay idle until 1974, when it was reopened. The second phase of production began in 1976 and the mine was finally closed down in 1982. The township, mine and mill were dismantled and the tailings rehabilitated by the end of 1984."]}}}
