An \"envelope modulation\" (\"env mod\") parameter on many synthesizers with filter envelopes determines how much the envelope affects the filter. If turned all the way down, the filter producs a flat sound with no envelope. When turned up the envelope becomes more noticeable, expanding the minimum and maximum range of the filter."],"after":["When an acoustic musical instrument produces sound, the loudness and spectral content of the sound change over time in ways that vary from instrument to instrument. The \"attack\" and \"decay\" of a sound have a great effect on the instrument's sonic character.[65] Sound synthesis techniques often employ an envelope generator that controls a sound's parameters at any point in its duration. Most often this is an \"ADSR\" (Attack Decay Sustain Release) envelope, which may be applied to overall amplitude control, filter frequency, etc. The envelope may be a discrete circuit or module, or implemented in software. The contour of an ADSR envelope is specified using four parameters:"]}}}
