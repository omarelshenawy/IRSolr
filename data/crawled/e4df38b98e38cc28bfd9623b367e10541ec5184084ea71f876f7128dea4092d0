Roman Catholics now predominate because of massive immigration from primarily Catholic countries and regions - chiefly Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Quebec, and Latin America. A significant Jewish population immigrated to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920. Mary Baker Eddy made the Boston Mother Church of Christian Science the world headquarters. Buddhists, Pagans, Hindus, Seventh-day Adventists, Muslims, and Mormons also can be found. Kripalu Center in Stockbridge, the Shaolin Meditation Temple in Springfield, and the Insight Meditation Center in Barre are examples of non-Abrahamic religious centers in Massachusetts. According to 2010 data from The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) the largest single denominations are the Roman Catholic Church with 2,940,199 adherents; the United Church of Christ with 86,639 adherents; and the Episcopal Church with 81,999 adherents.[162]"],"after":[]}}}
