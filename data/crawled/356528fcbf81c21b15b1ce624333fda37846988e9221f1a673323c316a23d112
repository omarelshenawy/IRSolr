As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognised human right and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.[2] Lastly, freedom of information can include opposition to patents, opposition to copyrights or opposition to intellectual property in general.[3] The international and United States Pirate Party have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues.[4]"]}}}
