The most famous of these include H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, The Mikado.[2] These, as well as several of the other Savoy operas, continue to be frequently performed in the English-speaking world and beyond by opera companies, repertory companies, schools and community theatre groups. Lines from these works have become part of the English language, such as \"short, sharp shock\", \"What, never? Well, hardly ever!\",[3] and \"Let the punishment fit the crime\".[4]"]}}}
