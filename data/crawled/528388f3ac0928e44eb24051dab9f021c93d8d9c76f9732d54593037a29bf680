Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633).[37] Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.[note 3]"]}}}
