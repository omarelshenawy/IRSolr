Her dancers too were told never to address her and her musicians were not even permitted to look at her, unless they were onstage with her.[2] Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of \"those who couldn't help but stare\".[2] DeMann commented: \"She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention\", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. \"You don't behave like a bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status\", he commented.[2]"]}}}
