The plot, set in the 1940s, depicts Madonna as a neglected lover of a bullfighter, played by real-life Spanish bullfighter Emilio Muñoz.[31] Madonna's character yearns for the bullfighter's presence, with erotic heartbreak.[31] A total of three different bulls were used during the production of the music video.[32] In the video Madonna wears fitted, classic suits by British fashion designer John Galliano.[33] In an interview with MTV's Kurt Loder on the set of the music video, Madonna said that when she was initially writing \"Take a Bow\" the inspiration for the song was an actor, but she wanted the male character in the video to be to be a matador instead because she wanted the video to be about an \"obsessive, tragic love story that doesn't work out in the end\" and a matador would be more visually effective in expressing the emotion of the song.[34] The style of the music video has been compared to Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar's 1986 film Matador, starring Antonio Banderas.[35] The music video for Madonna's 1995 single \"You'll See\" is considered a follow up to the \"Take a Bow\" music video, as Madonna and Emilio Muñoz reprise their roles.[36] In that video Madonna's character walks out on Munoz's (bullfighter) character, leaving him behind in despair. Madonna's character is then seen on the train and later on a plane, while Munoz's character tries to catch up with her in vain.[36]"]}}}
