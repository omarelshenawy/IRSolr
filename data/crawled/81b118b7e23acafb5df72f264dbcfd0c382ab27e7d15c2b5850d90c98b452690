The sound is either spoken natural language, (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell Big Ben). Most telecommunication companies also provide a speaking clock service as well."],"after":["Word clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It’s about three o’clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software."]}}}
