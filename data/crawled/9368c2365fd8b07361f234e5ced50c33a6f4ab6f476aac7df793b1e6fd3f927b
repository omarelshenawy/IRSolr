Stallman initially thought this would be legal, but since he also thought it would be \"very undesirable for free software\", he asked a lawyer for advice. The response he got was that judges would consider such schemes to be \"subterfuges\" and would be very harsh toward them, and a judge would ask whether it was \"really\" one program, rather than how the parts were labeled. Therefore, Stallman sent a message back to Jobs which said they believed Jobs' plan was not allowed by the GPL, which resulted in NeXT releasing the Objective-C front end under GPL.[66]"]}}}
