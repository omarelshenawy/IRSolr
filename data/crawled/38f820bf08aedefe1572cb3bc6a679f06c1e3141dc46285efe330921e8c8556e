For example, in some languages written in the Latin alphabet, an initial glottal stop is left unwritten;[examples needed] on the other hand, some languages written using non-Latin alphabets such as abjads and abugidas have a special zero consonant to represent a null onset. As an example, in Hangul, the alphabet of the Korean language, a null onset is represented with ㅇ at the left or top section of a grapheme, as in 역 \"station\", pronounced yeok, where the diphthong yeo is the nucleus and k is the coda."],"after":["The nucleus is usually the vowel in the middle of a syllable. Generally, every syllable requires a nucleus (sometimes called the peak), and the minimal syllable consists only of a nucleus, as in the English words \"eye\" or \"owe\". The syllable nucleus is usually a vowel, in the form of a monophthong, diphthong, or triphthong, but sometimes is a syllabic consonant."]}}}
