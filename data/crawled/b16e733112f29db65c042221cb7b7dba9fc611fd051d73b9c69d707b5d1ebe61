Without such a correction, time reckoned by Earth's rotation drifts away from atomic time because of irregularities in the Earth's rate of rotation. Since this system of correction was implemented in 1972, 26 such leap seconds have been inserted. The most recent one happened on June 30, 2012 at 23:59:60 UTC.[1] A leap second will again be inserted at the end of June 30, 2015 at 23:59:60 UTC.[2]"]}}}
