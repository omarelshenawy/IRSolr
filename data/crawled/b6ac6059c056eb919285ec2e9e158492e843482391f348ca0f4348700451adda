I've said it for the last seven years – since I had my first debut record out – in every interview\".[174] Following James' death in 2012, Aguilera was asked to perform \"At Last\" at James' funeral.[175] Prior to the performance, Aguilera revealed, \"There's a line in this song that says 'I found a dream that I could speak to.' And for me that dream, all my life, has been Etta James\".[176] Other classic artists, including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, are also Aguilera's major influences; her fifth studio album Back to Basics is inspired by vintage jazz, blues and soul music records by them.[177][178][179]"]}}}
