They may take the form of words, images, or other identifying marks. An analogous example of tags in the physical world is museum object tagging. In the organization of information and objects, the use of textual keywords as part of identification and classification long predates computers. However, computer based searching made the use of keywords a rapid way of exploring records."],"after":["Online and Internet databases and early websites deployed them as a way for publishers to help users find content. In 1997, the collaborative portal \"A Description of the Equator and Some Other Lands\" produced by documenta X, Germany, coined the folksonomic term Tag for its co-authors and guest authors on its Upload page. In \"The Equator\" the term Tag for user-input was described as an abstract literal or keyword to aid the user. Turned out in Web 1.0 days, all \"Otherlands\" users defined singular Tags, and did not share Tags at that point."]}}}
