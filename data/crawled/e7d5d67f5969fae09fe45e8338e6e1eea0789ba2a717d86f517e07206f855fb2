In July 2009 a solar panel system was installed, injecting about 50 kW into the Niue national power grid. This is nominal 6% of the average 833 kW electricity production. The solar panels are at Niue High School (20 kW), Niue Power Corporation office (1.7 kW)[56] and the Niue Foou Hospital (30 kW). The EU-funded grid-connected PV systems are supplied under the REP-5 programme and were installed recently by the Niue Power Corporation on the roofs of the high school and the power station office and on ground-mounted support structures in front of the hospital. They will be monitored and maintained by the NPC.[57] In 2014 two additional solar power installations was added to the Niue national power grid, one funded under PALM5 of Japan is located outside of the Tuila power station – so far only this have battery storage, the other under European Union funding is located opposite the Niue International Airport Terminal."]}}}
