By June 2013 over 10 million digitised pages, or 100 million articles were accessible through Trove.[22] Many of the NLA's resource discovery services have been fully integrated with Trove - meaning that several (such as \"music Australia\", \"pictures Australia\" and \"Australian newspapers\") are now accessible only through the site. Others (such as PANDORA and the ANBD) use Trove as their primary means of public access. The service is able locate resources about Australia and Australians, which reaches many locations otherwise unavailable to external search engines.[23]"]}}}
