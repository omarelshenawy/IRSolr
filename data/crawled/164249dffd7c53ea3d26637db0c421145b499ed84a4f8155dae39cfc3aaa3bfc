It is located on the main road that leads from the Danube to the Aegean Sea and is considered by many to be the most famous archaeological site in the Republic of Macedonia. Stobi was built where the Erigón river (mod. River Crna) joins the Axiós river (mod. Vardar), making it important strategically as a center for both trade and warfare. In September 2010, it was announced that part of a €53,000 grant by the US government for restoring and conserving landmarks around Macedonia will go to Stobi."]}}}
