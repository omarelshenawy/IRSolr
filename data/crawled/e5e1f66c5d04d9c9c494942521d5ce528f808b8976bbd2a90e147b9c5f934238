During the performances at the clubs, Madonna emerged from a glitter ball while wearing a purple jacket, velvet pedal pushers and knee-high boots.[34] In the Confessions Tour, the song was the fourth performance of the evening and was part of the equine segment of the show.[35] Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. As the performance of \"Like a Virgin\" ended, Madonna sat on a platform and announced \"Ladies and Gentleman! Thank you for coming to our show. The night is young, and the show has just begun.\"[36] A huge assortment of steel rods and gymnastic equipment were planted on the stage. Madonna started singing the song, as her dancers started running around, displaying routines in parkour.[37] Madonna climbs on blocks to sing the song as well as to strike poses.[36] As the final chorus approached, Madonna went to the front of the stage and struck poses while holding on to the steel rods. The song continued with Madonna swiveling around the rods and the dancers continuing their routine.[36] The performance ends with Madonna disappearing through the middle of the stage and her dancers doing a final vault before the lights are turned off.[36] In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, \"Jump\" was sampled in the song \"Into the Groove\" during which Madonna performed stunts in the air.[38]"]}}}
