Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);[366] and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).[367] Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.[368]"]}}}
