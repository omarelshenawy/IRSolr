In many places, these prehistoric graves are still clearly visible as low hills. The oldest tumuli (grafheuvels) in the Netherlands have built near Apeldoorn about 5,000 years ago. Concentrations of tumuli from the Bronze Age are located on the Veluwe and Drenthe."],"after":["Early scholarly investigation of tumuli and Hunebedden and theorising as to their origins was undertaken from the 17th century by notably Johan Picardt. Although many have disappeared over the centuries, some 3000 tumuli are known of which 636 are protected as Rijksmonument.[22] The largest tumulus in the Netherlands is the grave of a king near Oss. Rijksmuseum van Oudheden and Drents Museum have findings from tumuli in their collections."]}}}
