Cooperation with local power elites was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions by supporting one faction over another: in the view of Plutarch, \"it was discord between factions within cities that led to the loss of self-governance\".[144]"]}}}
