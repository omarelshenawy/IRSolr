That summer, in New York, the Movimiento Libertario Cubano en el Exilio (Cuban Anarchist Movement in Exile [MLCE]) was formed by some of these exiles, making contact with Spanish anarchists exiled following the Spanish Civil War, who were also living in New York. They also made contact with Sam Dolgoff and the New York-based Libertarian League. Very quickly, donations to exiled Cuban anarchists were collected from around the world. However, donations soon dried up following the publishing of the Gaona manifesto, as many anarchists in other countries were swayed by the arguments in the document.[clarification needed] In response to the widespread effect of the manifesto, the MLCE issued the Boletín de Información Libertaria with support from the Libertarian League, and the paper of the Federación Libertaria Argentina (FLA).[5] Among many others, the FLA printed an essay by Abelardo Iglesias titled Revolución y Contrarevolución which stated the differences the Cuban anarchists saw between Marxist and anarchist revolution: \"To expropriate capitalist enterprises, handing them over to the workers and technicians, THIS IS REVOLUTION. But to convert them into state monopolies in which the only right of the producer is to obey, THIS IS COUNTER-REVOLUTION.\"[10]"]}}}
