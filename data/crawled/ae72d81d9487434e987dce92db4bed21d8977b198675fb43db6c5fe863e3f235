In 1906, a group of Jews, among them residents of Jaffa, followed the initiative of Akiva Aryeh Weiss and banded together to form the Ahuzat Bayit (lit. \"homestead\") society. The society's goal was to form a \"Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment, planned according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene.\"[20][unreliable source?] The urban planning for the new city was influenced by the Garden city movement.[32] The first 60 plots were purchased in Kerem Djebali near Jaffa by Jacobus Kann, a Dutch citizen, who registered them in his name to circumvent the Turkish prohibition on Jewish land acquisition.[33] Meir Dizengoff, later Tel Aviv's first mayor, also joined the Ahuzat Bayit society.[34][35] His vision for Tel Aviv involved peaceful co-existence with Arabs.[20][unreliable source?]"],"after":["On 11 April 1909, 66 Jewish families gathered on a desolate sand dune to parcel out the land by lottery using seashells. This gathering is considered the official date of the establishment of Tel Aviv. The lottery was organised by Akiva Aryeh Weiss, president of the building society.[36][37] Weiss collected 120 sea shells on the beach, half of them white and half of them grey. The members' names were written on the white shells and the plot numbers on the grey shells. A boy drew names from one box of shells and a girl drew plot numbers from the second box. A photographer, Avraham Soskin, documented the event. The first water well was later dug at this site (today Rothschild Boulevard, across from Dizengoff House).[38] Within a year, Herzl, Ahad Ha'am, Yehuda Halevi, Lilienblum, and Rothschild streets were built; a water system was installed; and 66Â houses (including some on six subdivided plots) were completed.[32] At the end of Herzl Street, a plot was allocated for a new building for the Herzliya Hebrew High School, founded in Jaffa in 1906.[32] On 21 May 1910, the name Tel Aviv was adopted.[32] Tel Aviv was planned as an independent Hebrew city with wide streets and boulevards, running water at each house and street lights.[39]"]}}}
