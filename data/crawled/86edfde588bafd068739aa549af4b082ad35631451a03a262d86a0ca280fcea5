He produced the regional hit \"Let's Go Trippin'\" in 1961 and launched the surf music craze, following up with songs like \"Misirlou\" (1962).[52][53] Like Dale and his Del-Tones, most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, including the Bel-Airs, the Challengers, and Eddie & the Showmen.[53] The Chantays scored a top ten national hit with \"Pipeline\" in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963's \"Wipe Out\", by the Surfaris, which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965.[54]"],"after":["Groups which crossed over to this genre included the Astronauts, from Boulder, Colorado; the Trashmen, from Minneapolis, Minnesota, who had a number 4 hit with \"Surfin Bird\" in 1964; and the Rivieras from South Bend, Indiana, who reached number 5 in 1964 with \"California Sun\".[52] The Atlantics, from Sydney, made a significant contribution to the genre, with their hit \"Bombora\" (1963).[52] European instrumental bands around this time generally focused more on the more rock and roll style played by The Shadows, but the Dakotas, who were the British backing band for Merseybeat singer Billy J. Kramer, gained some attention as surf musicians with \"Cruel Sea\" (1963), which was later covered by American instrumental surf bands, including the Ventures.[55]"]}}}
