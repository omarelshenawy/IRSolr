The MPC Renaissance is the first MPC to take the power from an external computer (with the dedicated \"MPC Software\") and combine it with the regular tradition of the MPC. The memory limitation depends on the connecting computer. The Renaissance takes on the look of the 3000, sharing its transport buttons, jog wheel, and arm rest. Its LCD has the same look as the MPCs 1000, 2500 and 5000r. The Renaissance is the first MPC to include back lit pads which change colors for velocity levels, sound groups, step edit, etc."],"after":["Features[19]"]}}}
