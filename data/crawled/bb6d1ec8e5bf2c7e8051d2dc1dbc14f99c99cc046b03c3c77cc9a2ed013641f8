According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, the harmonic and melodic styles were more \"complex\" than the songs which Madonna was accustomed to, hence she found it difficult and demanding. She spoke about the \"wilderness\" of the tunes, saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs, and neither was Sondheim. But he kept on encouraging the singer so that the recording sessions would not be affected.[2] Madonna also recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement.[11] Bob Magnusson, who played bass on the records, recalled that Madonna's relationship with Beatty reflected her mood in the studio. \"She was nice to everybody, she introduced herself to the musicians\", he added. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, after Madonna's split from husband Sean Penn in 1989, the singer was comfortable in her new relationship, which influenced the songs and the portrayal of her persona. The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten-piece live band and jazz musicians, to give a swing nature.[15] The sessions took place at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, California, and concluded by three weeks.[2] The songs on the album reflect Madonna's showgirl personality where her singing ranged from \"rootsy, rocking\" in nature to slow, \"laid-back and soulful\" vocals. A studied approach was evident in most of them, which O'Brien compared to \"an actress playing a part and performing a vocal exercise in technique\". Some of the songs had Madonna pitching her vocals and belting the notes only when necessary. A dryness was prevalent in most of the singing, which was required for the songs and the setting. Madonna started smoking cigarettes in order to achieve that. Guy Pratt, who also played bass, said that the singer \"was in character and started smoking. She actually ponced a cigarette off me. Her character smoked, so therefore she did.\"[16]"]}}}
