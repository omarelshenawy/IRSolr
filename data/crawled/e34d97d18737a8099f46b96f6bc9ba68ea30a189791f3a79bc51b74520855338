He had been influenced by the work of musicians such as Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire,[342] Sammy Davis, Jr.,[342] Gene Kelly,[343] David Ruffin,[344] The Isley Brothers, the Bee Gees, and the West Side Story dancers, to whom he made a tribute in \"Beat It\" and in the \"Bad\" video.[345] According to David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, Jackson watched West Side Story almost every week and it was his favorite film.[346][347][348] While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson,[349] James Brown was Jackson's greatest inspiration. In reference to Brown, Jackson declared: \"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\"[350]"]}}}
