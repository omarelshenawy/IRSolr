The mixing-process can consist of various processes but are not limited to: setting levels; setting equalization; using stereo panning and the addition of effects so that your song tells the story you want it to tell. The way you mix your song has as much impact on the way it sounds as each of the individual parts that has been recorded. Dramatic impacts on how the song affects your listeners can be created by minor adjustments in the relationship among the various instruments within your song [1]"]}}}
