Such terms as \"boffo box-office biz\", \"sitcom\", \"sex appeal\", \"payola\", and even \"striptease\" are attributed to the influence of the magazine.[11] Its attempt to popularize \"infobahn\" as a synonym for \"information superhighway\" never caught on. One of its popular headlines was from October 1929, when the stock market crashed: \"Wall St. Lays An Egg\". The most famous was \"Sticks nix hick pix\"[12][13] (the movie-prop version renders it as \"Stix nix hix pix!\" in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), Michael Curtiz's musical-biographical film about George M. Cohan starring James Cagney). Television series are referred to as \"skeins\", and heads of companies or corporate teams are called \"toppers\". In addition, more-common English words and phrases are shortened; \"audience members\" becomes simply \"auds\", \"performance\" \"perf\", and \"network\" becomes \"net\" for example."]}}}
