The set of tools needed to achieve a goal is \"equipment\". The knowledge of constructing, obtaining and using tools is technology."],"after":["Anthropologists believe that the use of tools was an important step in the evolution of mankind.[1] Humans evolved an opposable thumb — useful in holding tools — and increased dramatically in intelligence, which aided in the use of tools.[2] Because tools are used extensively by both humans and wild chimpanzees, it is widely assumed that the first routine use of tools took place prior to the divergence between the two species.[3] These early tools, however, were likely made of perishable materials such as sticks, or consisted of unmodified stones that cannot be distinguished from other stones as tools."]}}}
