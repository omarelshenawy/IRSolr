David Letterman not only wanted to move into that earlier time slot from his late night spot after The Tonight Show, but was also considered by many as the natural successor (despite Leno having been Carson's permanent guest host for several years). Carson himself had always favored Letterman; notably Carson, who had previously been interviewed by Letterman, made two appearances on Letterman's rival CBS show, made no mention of Leno during his final shows and regularly sent Letterman monologue jokes in his final years.[8] Having had his heart set on the earlier time slot, Letterman left NBC and joined CBS. Late Show with David Letterman, airing in the same slot, has been competing head to head against The Tonight Show ever since. Conan O'Brien slid into the late night time slot vacated by Letterman."]}}}
