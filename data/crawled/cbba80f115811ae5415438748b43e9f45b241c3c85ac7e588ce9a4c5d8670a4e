On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \"Forever Young\", which became one of his most popular songs.[141] As one critic described it, the song projected \"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\",[142] and Dylan himself commented: \"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\"[16]"]}}}
