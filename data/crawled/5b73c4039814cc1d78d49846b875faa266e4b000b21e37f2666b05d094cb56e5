Pundits have dismissed the story as unlikely since it was first given the School's seal of approval following an official investigation by the Old Rugbeian Society in 1895. However, the story has entered into legend, and the trophy for the Rugby Union World Cup bears the name of \"Webb Ellis\" in his honour and a plaque at the School commemorates the \"achievement\"."]}}}
