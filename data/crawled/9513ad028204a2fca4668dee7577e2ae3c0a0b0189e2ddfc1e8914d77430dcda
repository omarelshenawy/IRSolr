A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.[50][unreliable source?] The population of Algeria, which stood at about 1.5 million in 1830, reached nearly 11 million in 1960.[51] French policy was predicated on \"civilizing\" the country.[52] Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted.[53] During this period, a small but influential French-speaking indigenous elite was formed, made up of Berbers mostly from Kabyles. As a consequence, French government favored the Kabyles.[54] About 80% of Indigenous Schools were constructed for Kabyles."]}}}
