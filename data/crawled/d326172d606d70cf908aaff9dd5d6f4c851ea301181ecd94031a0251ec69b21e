Early the next morning, the chief priests and scribes lead Jesus away into their council.[187][190][191] John 18:12â€“14 states that Jesus is first taken to Annas, Caiaphas' father-in-law, and then to the high priest.[187][190][191]"],"after":["During the trials Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense, and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests' questions, prompting an officer to slap him. In Matthew 26:62 Jesus' unresponsiveness leads Caiaphas to ask him, \"Have you no answer?\"[187][190][191] In Mark 14:61 the high priest then asks Jesus, \"Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?\" Jesus replies, \"I am\", and then predicts the coming of the Son of Man.[36] This provokes Caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse Jesus of blasphemy. In Matthew and Luke, Jesus' answer is more ambiguous:[36][192] in Matthew 26:64 he responds, \"You have said so\", and in Luke 22:70 he says, \"You say that I am\".[193][194]"]}}}
