The name of the sea may signify the seasonal blooms of the red-coloured Trichodesmium erythraeum near the water's surface.[4] A theory favored by some modern scholars[who?] is that the name red is referring to the direction South, just as the Black Sea's name may refer to North. The basis of this theory is that some Asiatic languages used color words to refer to the cardinal directions.[5] Herodotus on one occasion uses Red Sea and Southern Sea interchangeably.[6]"]}}}
