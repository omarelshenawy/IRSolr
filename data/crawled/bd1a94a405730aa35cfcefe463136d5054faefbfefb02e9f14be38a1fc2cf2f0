Appleby defined public administration as \"public leadership of public affairs directly responsible for executive action\". In a democracy, it has to do with such leadership and executive action in terms that respect and contribute to the dignity, the worth, and the potentials of the citizen.[10] One year later, Gordon Clapp, then Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority defined public administration \"as a public instrument whereby democratic society may be more completely realized.\" This implies that it must \"relate itself to concepts of justice, liberty, and fuller economic opportunity for human beings\" and is thus \"concerned with \"people, with ideas, and with things.\"[11] According to James D. Carroll & Alfred M. Zuck, the publication by \"Woodrow Wilson of his essay, \" The Study of Administration\" in 1887 is generally regarded as the beginning of public administration as a specific field of study\".[12]"]}}}
