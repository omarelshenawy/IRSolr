Of course, other people had had the idea\", adding, \"the actual development of this encyclopedia was the task he gave me to work on.\"[42] Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002;[43] Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as \"chief organizer\" of Wikipedia on March 1 of that year.[44][45] Early on, Bomis supplied the financial backing for Wikipedia,[41][46] and entertained the notion of placing advertisements on Wikipedia before costs were reduced with Sanger's departure and plans for a nonprofit foundation were advanced instead.[37]"],"after":["Wales has asserted that he is the sole founder of Wikipedia,[9] and has publicly disputed Sanger's designation as a co-founder. Sanger and Wales were identified as co-founders at least as early as September 2001 by The New York Times and as founders in Wikipedia's first press release in January 2002.[48][49] In August of that year, Wales identified himself as \"co-founder\" of Wikipedia.[50] Sanger assembled on his personal webpage an assortment of links that appear to confirm the status of Sanger and Wales as co-founders.[8][51] For example, Sanger and Wales are historically cited or described in early news citations and press releases as co-founders.[8] Wales was quoted by The Boston Globe as calling Sanger's claim \"preposterous\" in February 2006,[52] and called \"the whole debate silly\" in an April 2009 interview.[53]"]}}}
