Fungi typify that diversity; an estimated 250,000 species—of which only 5% have been described—occur in Australia.[169] Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique and diverse. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic.[170] Australia has the greatest number of reptiles of any country, with 755 species.[171]"]}}}
