A 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words \"E pur si muove\" written on the wall of his dungeon. The earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death, but Drake writes \"there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to Galileo before his death\".[72]"]}}}
