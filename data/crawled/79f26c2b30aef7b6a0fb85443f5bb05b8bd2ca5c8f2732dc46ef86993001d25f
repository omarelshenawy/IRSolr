A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the world's population.[208] The population of Europe has grown in the past century, but in other areas of the world (in particular Africa and Asia) the population has grown far more quickly.[207] Among the continents, Europe has a relatively high population density, second only to Asia. The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is Monaco. Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"peoples of Europe\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities.[209] According to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653 million people (medium variant, 556 to 777 million in low and high variants, respectively).[207] Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates. The average number of children per female of child bearing age is 1.52.[210] According to some sources,[211] this rate is higher among Muslims in Europe. The UN predicts a steady population decline in Central and Eastern Europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates.[212]"],"after":["Europe is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at 70.6 million people, the IOM's report said.[213] In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth.[214] The European Union plans to open the job centres for legal migrant workers from Africa.[215][216] In 2008, 696,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU27 member state, a decrease from 707,000 the previous year.[217]"]}}}
