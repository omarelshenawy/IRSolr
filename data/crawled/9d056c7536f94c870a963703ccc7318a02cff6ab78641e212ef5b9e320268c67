Most working children are active in agriculture.[91] In 2006, UNICEF estimated that up to 30% of girls in the coastal areas of Malindi, Mombasa, Kilifi, and Diani were subject to prostitution. Most of the prostitutes in Kenya are aged 9â€“18.[91] The Ministry of Gender and Child Affairs employed 400 child protection officers in 2009.[91] The causes of child labour include poverty, the lack of access to education and weak government institutions.[91] Kenya has ratified Convention No. 81 on labour inspection in industries and Convention No. 129 on labour inspection in agriculture.
