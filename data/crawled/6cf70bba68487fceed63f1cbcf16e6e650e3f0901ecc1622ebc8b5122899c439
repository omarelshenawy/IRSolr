On the Boeing 747, seating is in a 2-3-2 configuration on the main deck and a 2–2 configuration on the upper deck. The A330 features a 2-2-2 configuration. There are two versions of what Qantas call its \"Skybed\": the lie flat business class seat. Older versions of the lie-flat Skybeds feature 150 cm (60 in) of seat pitch and 55 cm (21 1⁄2 in) width, however passengers sleep at a distinct slope to the cabin floor. Later versions of the Skybed have an 200 cm (80 in) pitch, and lie fully horizontal.[117] By 2015, the business class of its entire fleet of Airbus A330 aircraft will be fitted with lie flat seats.[118]"]}}}
