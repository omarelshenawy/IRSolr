The parish baptismal record gives his birthday as 22 February 1810, and cites his given names in the Latin form Fridericus Franciscus[2] (in Polish, he was Fryderyk Franciszek).[3] However, the composer and his family used the birthdate 1 March,[n 2][2] which is now generally accepted as the correct date.[5]"]}}}
