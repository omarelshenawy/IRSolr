Matthew and Mark identify the place as the garden of Gethsemane, while Luke identifies it as the Mount of Olives.[183][186] Judas appears in the garden, accompanied by a crowd that includes the Jewish priests and elders, and people with weapons. He kisses Jesus to identify him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus.[183][187] In an attempt to stop them, one of Jesus' disciples uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd.[183][187] Luke states that Jesus miraculously heals the wound, and John and Matthew report that Jesus criticizes the violent act, enjoining his disciples not to resist his arrest. In Matthew 26:52 Jesus says, \"All who take the sword will perish by the sword\".[183][187] After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus.[183] After the third denial, he hears the rooster crow and recalls the prediction as Jesus turns to look at him. Peter then weeps bitterly.[181]"]}}}
