By 1993 the Rolling Stones set upon their next studio album. Darryl Jones, former sideman of Miles Davis and Sting, was chosen by Charlie Watts as Wyman's replacement for 1994's Voodoo Lounge (UK 1; US 2). The album met strong reviews and sales, going double platinum in the US. Reviewers took note of the album's \"traditionalist\" sounds, which were credited to the Rolling Stones' new producer Don Was.[149] Voodoo Lounge would win the Stones the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 1995 Grammy Awards.[150]"]}}}
