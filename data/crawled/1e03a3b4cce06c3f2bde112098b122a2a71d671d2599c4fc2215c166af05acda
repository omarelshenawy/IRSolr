Elements of the geometric algebra that are simply scalar multiples of 1 are grade-0 blades and are called scalars. Nonzero multivectors that are in the span of are grade-1 blades and are the ordinary vectors. Multivectors in the span of are grade-2 blades and are the bivectors. This terminology continues through to the last grade of n-vectors. Alternatively, grade-n blades are called pseudoscalars, grade-nâˆ’1 blades pseudovectors, etc. Many of the elements of the algebra are not graded by this scheme since they are sums of elements of differing grade. Such elements are said to be of mixed grade. The grading of multivectors is independent of the orthogonal basis chosen originally."],"after":[]}}}
