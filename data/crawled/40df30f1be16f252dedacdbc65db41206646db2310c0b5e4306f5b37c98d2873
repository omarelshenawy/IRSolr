She was an atheist who was openly opposed to religion, for example, remaining silent during the part of the Pledge of Allegiance that refers to God.[19] In a 2011 interview Manning's father said, \"People need to understand that he's a young man that had a happy life growing up.\" He also said that Manning excelled at the saxophone, science, and computers, creating her first website at the age of ten. Manning taught herself how to use PowerPoint, won the grand prize three years in a row at the local science fair, and in sixth grade, took top prize at a statewide quiz bowl.[20]"],"after":["A childhood friend of Manning's, speaking about a conversation they had when Manning was 13, said \"he told me he was gay.\" The friend also stated that Manning's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling. Around this time, Manning's parents divorced, and she and her mother Susan moved out of the house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma.[21] Susan's instability continued and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister had to drive them to the hospital, with Manning sitting in the back of the car trying to make sure their mother was still breathing.[22]"]}}}
