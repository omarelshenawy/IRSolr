Nebraska's oldest winery was founded in 1994, and about twenty commercial wineries operate across the state. The vast majority of these wineries are small and sell most of their wine to tourists who visit in person. The University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln has a program in viticulture. There are no designated American Viticultural Areas in Nebraska."]}}}
