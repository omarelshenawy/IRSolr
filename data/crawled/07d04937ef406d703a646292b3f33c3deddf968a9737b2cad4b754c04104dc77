On June 26, 1783 Batanes was incorporated to the Spanish East Indies. In 1571 the capital of the Spanish colony in the Philippines was established in Manila.[1] In 1686, Ivatans were \"forced\" to settle in the lowlands of Batanes .[3] The Ivatans were under Spanish rule for 115 years, and gained their independence on September 18, 1898. Ironically, June 6 is celebrated in Batanes as its founding day.[1]"]}}}
