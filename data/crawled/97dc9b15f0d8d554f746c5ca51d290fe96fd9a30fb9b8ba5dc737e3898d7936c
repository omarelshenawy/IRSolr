Major festivals often feature a large number of acts representing various EDM genres spread across multiple stages. Festivals have placed a larger emphasis on visual spectacles as part of their overall experiences, including elaborate stage designs with complex lighting systems, laser shows, and pyrotechnics, along with the attire of their attendees.[29] These events differed from underground raves by their organized nature, often taking place at major venues, and measures to ensure the health and safety of attendees.[52] Lately the EDM industry has been growing to cater to the needs of festival goers. Now, companies like GloFX, offer a large selection of Diffraction and Kaleidoscope Glasses, as well as LED poi and fashionable accessories."]}}}
