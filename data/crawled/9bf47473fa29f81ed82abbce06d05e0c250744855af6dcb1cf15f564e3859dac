The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and Andr√© Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak.[190] There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some of these)."]}}}
