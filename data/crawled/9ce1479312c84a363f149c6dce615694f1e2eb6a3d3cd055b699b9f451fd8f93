The next version will be version 0.9, which we had hoped to release some time in 2013, but problems with the code prevented this. We did have an offer to fix the code in 2014. Version 1.0 is intended to include a comprehensive index and a version (RevID) quality control system (the latter was used on 0.8). We also intend to continue working with the \"Selection project\" and the One Laptop Per Child organization."]}}}
