Greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans, the press dubbed the phenomenon \"Beatlemania\".[59] Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \"by audience demand\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US.[60] A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison.[61]"],"after":["In late October, the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962.[63] On their return to the UK on 31 October, according to Lewisohn, \"several hundred screaming fans\" greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events.[64] The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks.[65] In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth.[66]"]}}}
