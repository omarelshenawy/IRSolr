With a weekly readership of approximately 950,000 in 2011,[3] it is Canada's largest-circulation national newspaper and second-largest daily newspaper after the Toronto Star. The Globe and Mail is regarded by some as Canada's \"newspaper of record\".[4][5][6][7] Due to its long association with its city of origin, it is often referred to as the Toronto Globe & Mail though this is not how the paper is currently marketed or branded. Its employees are represented by Unifor, whose most recent negotiations brought in a three-year contract which is to end in 2017.[8]"]}}}
