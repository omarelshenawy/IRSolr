The East Frisian Islands just off the mainland belong to the region. Beyond the line of dykes is the coastline, directly affected by the tide, and the mudflats of the Wadden Sea. The mainland is characterised by marshes, geest and moorland; the islands by dunes. The region is divided into the three districts of Aurich, Leer and Wittmund and the town of Emden."]}}}
