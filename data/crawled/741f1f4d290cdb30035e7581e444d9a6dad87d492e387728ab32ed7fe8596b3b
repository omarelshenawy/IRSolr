While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.[8] Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method (1895).[9] In this text he argued: \"[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct.... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism.\"[10]"]}}}
