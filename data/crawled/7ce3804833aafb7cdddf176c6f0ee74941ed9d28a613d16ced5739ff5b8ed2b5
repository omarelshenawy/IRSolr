Hill describes the music as following an arc stretching from the beginning of the Introduction to the conclusion of the final dance.[128] Woodwind and muted trumpets are prominent throughout the Introduction, which ends with a number of rising cadences on strings and flutes. The transition into the \"Mystic Circles\" is almost imperceptible; the main theme of the section has been prefigured in the Introduction. A loud repeated chord, which Berger likens to a call to order, announces the moment for choosing the sacrificial victim. The \"Glorification of the Chosen One\" is brief and violent; in the \"Evocation of the Ancestors\" that follows, short phrases are interspersed with drum rolls. The \"Ritual Action of the Ancestors\" begins quietly, but slowly builds to a series of climaxes before subsiding suddenly into the quiet phrases that began the episode.[121]"]}}}
