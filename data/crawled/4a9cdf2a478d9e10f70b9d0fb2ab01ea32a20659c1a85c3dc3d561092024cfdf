This applied among others Plant litter and Resin extraction, as Pitch (resin) as essential for the caulking of ships, falking and hunting rights, firewood and building timber gathering and wood pasture, the right of grazing animals in forests. The notion of \"commons\" (German \"Allmende\") refers to the underlying traditional legal term of common land. Enclosed private property came up with modern times. However most hunting rights were retained by the members of the nobility which e.g. preserved the right of the nobility to access and chase on common land as in fox hunting."],"after":["Systematic management of forests for a sustainable yield of timber is said to have begun in the German states in the 14th century, e.g. in Nuremberg,[10] and in 16th-century Japan.[11] Typically, a forest was divided into specific sections and mapped; the harvest of timber was planned with an eye to regeneration. As timber rafting allowed for connecting large continental forests, as in south western Germany, via Main, Neckar, Danube and Rhine with the coastal cities and states, early modern forestry and remote trading were closely connected. Large firs in the black forest were called „Holländer“, as they were traded to the Dutch ship yards. Large timber rafts on the Rhine had 200 till 400m length, 40m width and consisted of several thousand logs. The crew consisted of 400 till 500 men, including shelter, bakerys, ovens and livestock stables.[12] Timber rafting infrastructure allowed for large interconnected networks all over continental Europe and is still of importance in Finland."]}}}
