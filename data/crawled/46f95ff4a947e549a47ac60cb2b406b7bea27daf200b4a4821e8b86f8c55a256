On 26 October 1955, the Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality\". The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory\". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland."]}}}
