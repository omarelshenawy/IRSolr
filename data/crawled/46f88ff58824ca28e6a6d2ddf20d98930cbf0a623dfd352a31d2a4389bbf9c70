By 1973 he had essentially disappeared from music, opting instead to study acting and dance and performing in theatrical productions in and around Los Angeles. A comeback tour engineered by music writer Thomas K. Arnold brought him to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1981, and from that point on he became a regular on the national oldies circuit.[2] Puckett was on the bill for the first major Monkees reunion tour in 1986, along with The Grass Roots and former Herman's Hermits lead singer, Peter Noone. He has also released some new material, including a 2001 holiday album entitled Gary Puckett at Christmas.[7] In 1994 and 2002 Puckett performed at the Moondance Jam near Walker, Minnesota. As of 2010, Puckett continued to perform live concerts in venues across the US, including \"package\" oldies circuit tours with The Association and The Lettermen. On June 20, 2010, Puckett performed for the first time in Union Gap, Washington, the namesake city of his former band.[8] Puckett is married to Lorrie and they have two daughters, Syd and Michaela; they currently reside in Clearwater, Florida.[9] Bement later joined the oldies act Flash Cadillac & the Continental Kids. Chater relocated to Nashville, Tennessee where he worked as a songwriter, and had a minor solo hit in 1977 with \"Part Time Love.\" Wheatbread turned to concert promotion, and Withem returned to San Diego to teach high-school band.[2]"]}}}
