Hughes was devastated; they had been separated five months. In a letter to an old friend of Plath's from Smith College, he wrote, \"That's the end of my life. The rest is posthumous.\"[27][36] Plath's gravestone, in Heptonstall's parish churchyard of St Thomas the Apostle, bears the inscription that Hughes chose for her:[37] \"Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be planted.\" Biographers variously attribute the source of the quote to the 16th-century Buddhist novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en[38][39] or to the Hindu text, the Bhagavad Gita.[37]"]}}}
