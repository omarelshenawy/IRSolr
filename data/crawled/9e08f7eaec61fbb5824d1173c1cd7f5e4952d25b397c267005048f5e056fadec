He sings duets with seventeen prominent singers of varying techniques, including Aretha Franklin, Willie Nelson, Queen Latifah, and Lady Gaga.[89] His duet with Amy Winehouse on \"Body and Soul\"—reportedly the last recording she made before her death[90]—charted on the lower reaches of the Billboard Hot 100, making Bennett the oldest living artist to appear there, as well as the artist with the greatest span of appearances.[91] The single did well in Europe, where it reached the top 15 in several countries. The album then debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Bennett the oldest living artist to reach that top spot, as well as marking the first time he had reached it himself.[92] A model of Koss headphones, the Tony Bennett Signature Edition (TBSE1), was created for this milestone[93] (Bennett having been one of the early adopters of the Koss product back in the 1960s).[94] In November 2011, Columbia released Tony Bennett – The Complete Collection, a 73-CD plus 3-DVD set, which although not absolutely \"complete\", finally brought forth many albums that had not had a previous CD release, as well as some unreleased material and rarities.[54][95] In December 2011, Bennett appeared at the Royal Variety Performance in Salford in the presence of HRH Princess Anne.[96]"],"after":["In the wake of the premature deaths of Winehouse and Whitney Houston, Bennett called for the legalization of drugs in February 2012.[97] In October 2012, Bennett released Viva Duets, an album of Latin American music duets, featuring Vicente Fernández, Juan Luis Guerra, and Vicentico among others.[98] The recording and filming for the project, in Fort Lauderdale, was co-sponsored by the city.[99] On October 31, 2012, Bennett performed \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" in front of more than 100,000 fans at a City Hall ceremony commemorating the 2012 World Series victory by the San Francisco Giants.[100] He published another memoir, Life is a Gift: The Zen of Bennett, and a documentary film produced by his son Danny was released, also titled The Zen of Bennett.[101]"]}}}
