There are thought to be at least a thousand such unpaid payments, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remain active despite Erdős's death; Ronald Graham is the (informal) administrator of solutions. The solvers can get either the original check signed by Erdős before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham.[41]"]}}}
