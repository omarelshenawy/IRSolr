Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren instead of the old method which is still used on older presses (conventional dampening), which are rollers covered with molleton (cloth) which absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a \"delta effect or vario \" which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as \"hickies\"."],"after":["The process of lithography printing is illustrated by this simplified diagram. This press is also called an ink pyramid due to the fact that the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production."]}}}
