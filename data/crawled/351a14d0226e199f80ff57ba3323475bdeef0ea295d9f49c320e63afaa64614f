George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, accidentally made the gesture while on a diplomatic trip to Australia.[70] In countries where Spanish, Portuguese, or French are spoken, and especially on the Iberian peninsula and in Latin America, a gesture called the bras d'honneur involving raising a fist and slapping the biceps on the same arm as the fist used, sometimes called the Iberian slap or Iberian finger, is equivalent to the finger. Italy, Poland, and countries under the influence of Russian culture, such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, also see the bras d'honneur as equivalent to the finger, but the majority of young people in these countries use the finger as an insult, which is associated with the Western culture.[3]"]}}}
