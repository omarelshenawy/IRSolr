She is known as the woman who wiped Jesus's face with her veil. Then the image of Jesus's face appeared on it. The closest is the miracle of the woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus’s garment (Luke 8:43–48); her name is later identified as Veronica by the apocryphal \"Acts of Pilate\". The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor Tiberius. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion, and the miraculous appearance of the image only occurs around 1380, in the internationally popular book Meditations on the life of Christ.[9] The story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth Station of the Cross in many Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and Western Orthodox churches.[3][10][11]"],"after":["According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the name \"Veronica\" comes from the Latin vera, meaning \"true\" or \"Truthful\", and the Greek eikon, meaning \"image\"; the Veil of Veronica was therefore largely regarded in medieval times as the \"true image\", the truthful representation of Jesus, preceding the Shroud of Turin.[8]"]}}}
