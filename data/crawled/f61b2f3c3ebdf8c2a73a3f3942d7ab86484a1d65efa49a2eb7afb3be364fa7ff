Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so.[83] Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication.[83] The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all.[83]"]}}}
