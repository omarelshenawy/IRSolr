Such compound time signatures fall under the \"aksak rhythm\" category that he introduced along with a couple more that should describe the rhythm figures in traditional music.[15] The term Brăiloiu revived had moderate success worldwide, but in Eastern Europe it is still frequently used. However, aksak rhythm figures occur not only in a few European countries, but on all continents, featuring various combinations of the two and three sequences. The longest are in Bulgaria. The shortest aksak rhythm figures follow the five-beat timing, comprising a two and a three (or three and two)."],"after":["Some composers have used fractional beats: for example, the time signature 2½ 4 appears in Carlos Chávez's Piano Sonata No. 3 (1928) IV, m. 1."]}}}
