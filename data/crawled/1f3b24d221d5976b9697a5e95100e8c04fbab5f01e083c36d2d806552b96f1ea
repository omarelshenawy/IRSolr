An anagram of a word having some repeated letters is an example of a multiset permutation.[15] If the multiplicities of the elements of M (taken in some order) are , , ..., and their sum (i.e., the size of M) is n, then the number of multiset permutations of M is given by the multinomial coefficient,[16]"],"after":["For example, the number of distinct anagrams of the word MISSISSIPPI is:[17]"]}}}
