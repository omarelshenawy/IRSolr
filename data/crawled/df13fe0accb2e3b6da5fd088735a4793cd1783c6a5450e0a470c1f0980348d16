After relocating to Panay island and consolidating a coalition of native Visayan allies and Hispanic soldiers, the Spaniards then marched upon Islamic Manila. Under Spanish rule, Manila became the capital of the Spanish East Indies (1571), therein they put down the Tondo Conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to Guam and Guerrero.[52] They also defeated the Chinese-warlord Limahong despite the enemies' overwhelming numbers.[53][54] In response to the Islamic invasion of Tondo, the Castille War was waged against the Sultanate of Brunei in Borneo[55][56] and war was also waged against the Sultanate of Ternate and Tidore (In response to Ternatan slaving and piracy against the Butuan Rajahnate and Bohol).[57] Fortifications were also set up in Taiwan and the Maluku islands. These were abandoned and the soldiers withdrew back to the Philippines. They withdrew in order to re-concentrate the military forces because of a threatened invasion by the Japan-born Ming-dynasty loyalist, Koxinga, ruler of the Huangdom of Tungning.[58] However, the invasion was aborted. Meanwhile, settlers were sent to the Pacific islands of Palau and the Marianas.[59]"]}}}
