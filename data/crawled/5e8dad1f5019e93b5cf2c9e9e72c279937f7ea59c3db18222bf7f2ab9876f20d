Sanger[10] coined its name,[11] a portmanteau of wiki[notes 2] and encyclopedia. Initially only in English, Wikipedia quickly became multilingual as it developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. The English Wikipedia is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias and is the largest with over 4.8 million articles. There is a grand total, including all Wikipedias, of nearly 35 million articles in 288 different languages.[13] As of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.[14] Globally, Wikipedia had more than 19 million accounts,[15] out of which there were about 69,000 active editors as of November 2014.[2]"]}}}
