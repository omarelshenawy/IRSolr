Social organisation was largely communal with families (whanau), sub-tribes (hapu) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira) whose position was subject to the community's approval.[268] The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture,[269][270] particularly with the introduction of Christianity.[271] However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples.[272] More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland."],"after":["The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged, industrious problem solvers.[273] Modesty was expected and enforced through the \"tall poppy syndrome\", where high achievers received harsh criticism.[274] At the time New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country.[275] From the early 20th century until the late 1960s Māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of Māori into British New Zealanders.[253] In the 1960s, as higher education became more available and cities expanded[276] urban culture began to dominate.[277] Even though the majority of the population now lives in cities, much of New Zealand's art, literature, film and humour has rural themes."]}}}
