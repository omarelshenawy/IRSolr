This wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm3 and is moving at a velocity of 350–400 km/s (780,000–890,000 mph).[104] The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind.[105] The discovery since 1995 of extrasolar planets means that other stars must possess their own interplanetary media.[106]"]}}}
