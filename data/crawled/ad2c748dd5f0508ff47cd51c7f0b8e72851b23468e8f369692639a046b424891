The patented land had been condemned and grazing rights suspended.[29][30] Scientists used this as a laboratory for testing bomb components.[28] Bainbridge and Davalos drew up plans for a base camp with accommodation and facilities for 160 personnel, along with the technical infrastructure to support the test. A construction firm from Lubbock, Texas built the barracks, officers' quarters, mess hall and other basic facilities.[23] The requirements expanded and, by July 1945, 250 people worked at Trinity. On the weekend of the test, there were 425 present.[31]"],"after":["Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man military police unit arrived at the site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. The horses were used for playing polo.[26][32] Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.[33]"]}}}
