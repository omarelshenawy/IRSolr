Each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that made up Philadelphia County before their absorption into the city.[49]"],"after":["The City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the Philadelphia2035 physical development plan.[51][52] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007-2012 as part of a joint effort between Major John F.
