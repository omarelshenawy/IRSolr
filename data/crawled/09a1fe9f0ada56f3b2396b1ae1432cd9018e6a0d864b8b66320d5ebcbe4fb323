The distance is purely spatial, and is always positive. In spacetime, the displacement four-vector ΔR is given by the space displacement vector Δr and the time difference Δt between the events. The spacetime interval, also called invariant interval, between the two events, s2,[15] is defined as:"],"after":["where c is the speed of light. The choice of signs for above follows the space-like convention (−+++).[16] Spacetime intervals may be classified into three distinct types, based on whether the temporal separation () or the spatial separation () of the two events is greater: time-like, light-like or space-like."]}}}
