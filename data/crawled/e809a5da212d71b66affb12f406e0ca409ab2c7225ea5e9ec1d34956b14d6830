It may have been the \"Promontory of Vinland\" mentioned by the Norse voyagers (985â€“1025). The Manomet River area (taken up by the western end of the Cape Cod Canal in the early 20th century) is claimed by some to have been visited by Leif Eiriksson,[25] and a stone wall[26] discovered in Provincetown in 1805 is also claimed to have been built by his younger brother Thorvald Eiriksson around 1007 AD,[27] when according to Norse sagas, the keel of his ship was repaired in the harbor. He was killed later in the same journey, and is said to have been returned to this spot for burial.[28] However, there is no tangible support of the presence of Norse voyagers in Cape Cod,[29] and the view is not generally accepted by archaeologists or historians.[30][31]"]}}}
