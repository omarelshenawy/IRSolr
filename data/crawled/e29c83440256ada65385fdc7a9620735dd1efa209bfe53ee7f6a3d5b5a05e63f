In the United States, \"officer\" is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \"officer\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \"constable\". In many other countries there is no such title as \"police officer\", as the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel only and thus not applicable. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers."]}}}
