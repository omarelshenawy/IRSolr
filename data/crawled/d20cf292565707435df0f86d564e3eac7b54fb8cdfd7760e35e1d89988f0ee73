These two tangents give two components, ∂z/∂x and ∂z/∂y, which then be used to determine the overall direction of slope, and the aspect of the slope. The gradient is defined as a vector quantity with components equal to the partial derivatives of the surface in the x and y directions.[26]"],"after":["","Zhou and Liu[25] describe another algorithm for calculating aspect, as follows:"]}}}
