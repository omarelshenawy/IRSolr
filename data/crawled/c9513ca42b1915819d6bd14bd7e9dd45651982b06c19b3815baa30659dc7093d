Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, commented that \"the steamrolling 'Hanky Panky' simply sounds like a silly innocent romp until you realize what she's going on and on is about ('Warren's favorite pastime')... being spanked!\". The author also felt Madonna sang with \"just a little too much authority\".[13][14] Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, called it \"a comic hymn to spanking\".[15] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as a \"double entendre-laden hit\".[16] Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted \"Hanky Panky\" as one of the best tracks on I'm Breathless; calling it a \"fake period piece\" but praising its \"risqué s&m-lite\" sound as \"all her\".[17] Rolling Stone‍ '​s Mark Coleman wrote that the song, alongside \"Cry Baby\" and \"I'm Going Bananas\", were some of the \"more-legitimate sounding and confidently sung show tunes without a trace of disco\" on the album. He also noted that \"its titles alone are enough to conjure up visions of the elaborate production numbers on Madonna's summer tour.\"[18]"]}}}
