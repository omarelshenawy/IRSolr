About 70.8%[14] of the surface is covered by water, with much of the continental shelf below sea level. This equates to 7008361132000000000♠361.132 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi).[130] The submerged surface has mountainous features, including a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system, as well as undersea volcanoes,[98] oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus and abyssal plains. The remaining 29.2% (7008148940000000000♠148.94 million km2, or 57.51 million sq mi) not covered by water consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms."]}}}
