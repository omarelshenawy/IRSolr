A leading anarcho-syndicalist and a prominent left-wing intellectual of the 1880s, he is remembered as the lover and mentor of early anarcha-feminist Voltairine de Cleyre. Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts, and contributed to publications including Mother Earth, Twentieth Century, Liberty (Benjamin Tucker's individualist anarchist journal), The Alarm (the journal of the International Working People's Association) and The Open Court among others. Following the arrest of Albert Parsons, Lum edited The Alarm from 1892–1893. Traditionally portrayed as a \"genteel, theoretical anarchist\", Lum has recently been recast by the scholarship of Paul Avrich as an \"uncompromising rebel thirsty for violence and martyrdom\" in the light of his involvement in the Haymarket affair in 1886."]}}}
