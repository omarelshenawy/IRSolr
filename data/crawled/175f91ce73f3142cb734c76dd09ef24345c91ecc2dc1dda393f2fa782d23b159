For example, if a function is taken as ordinal, it is equivalent to the function , because taking the 3rd power is a positive monotone transformation. This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same. In contrast, cardinal utilities are unique up to positive linear transformations, so if is taken as cardinal, it is equivalent to ."],"after":["For example, suppose a consumer's consumption set is X = {nothing, 1 apple,1 orange, 1 apple and 1 orange, 2 apples, 2 oranges}, and its utility function is u(nothing) = 0, u(1 apple) = 1, u(1 orange) = 2, u(1 apple and 1 orange) = 4, u(2 apples) = 2 and u(2 oranges) = 3. Then this consumer prefers 1 orange to 1 apple, but prefers one of each to 2 oranges."]}}}
