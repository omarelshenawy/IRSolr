According to the Federal Board of Revenue's 2006â€“2007 year book, tax and customs units in Karachi were responsible for 46.75% of direct taxes, 33.65% of federal excise tax, and 23.38% of domestic sales tax.[46] Karachi accounts for 75.14% of customs duty and 79% of sales tax on imports.[46] Therefore, Karachi collects 53.38% of the total collections of the Federal Board of Revenue, out of which 53.33% are customs duty and sales tax on imports.[46] (Note: Revenue collected from Karachi includes revenue from some other areas since the Large Tax Unit (LTU) Karachi and Regional Tax Offices (RTOs) Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur & Quetta cover the entire province of Sindh and Balochistan).[46] Karachi's indigenous contribution to national revenue is around 25%.[38]"],"after":[]}}}
