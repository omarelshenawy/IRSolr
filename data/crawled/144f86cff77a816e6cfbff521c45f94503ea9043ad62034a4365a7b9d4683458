Escaping from slavery, he made strong contributions to the abolitionist movement, and achieved a public career that led to his being called \"The Sage of Anacostia\" and \"The Lion of Anacostia\". Douglass is one of the most prominent figures in African American and United States history. He was a firm believer in the equality of all people, whether black, female, Native American, or recent immigrant. He was fond of saying, \"I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.\""]}}}
