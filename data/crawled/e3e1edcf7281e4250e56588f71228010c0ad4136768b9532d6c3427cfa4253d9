Greek-style athletics included footraces, boxing, wrestling, and the pancratium.[343] Aquatic displays, such as the mock sea battle (naumachia) and a form of \"water ballet\", were presented in engineered pools.[344] State-supported theatrical events (ludi scaenici) took place on temple steps or in grand stone theatres, or in the smaller enclosed theatre called an odeum.[345]"],"after":["Circuses were the largest structure regularly built in the Roman world,[346] though the Greeks had their own architectural traditions for the similarly purposed hippodrome. The Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the Colosseum, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome after it opened in 80 AD.[347] The circus races continued to be held more frequently.[348] The Circus Maximus could seat around 150,000 spectators, and the Colosseum about 50,000 with standing room for about 10,000 more.[349] Many Roman amphitheatres, circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today.[350] The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring spectacles and arena events, which both enhanced their status and drained their resources.[351]"]}}}
