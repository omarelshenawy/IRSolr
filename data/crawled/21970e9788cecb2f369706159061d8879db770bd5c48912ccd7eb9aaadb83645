Historically, however, its economic performance has been very uneven, with high economic growth alternating with severe recessions, income maldistribution and—in the recent decades—increasing poverty. Early in the 20th century Argentina achieved development,[14] and became the world's seventh richest country.[13] Although managing to keep a place among the top fifteen economies until mid-century,[13] it suffered a long and steady decline and now it's just an upper middle-income country.[170]"]}}}
