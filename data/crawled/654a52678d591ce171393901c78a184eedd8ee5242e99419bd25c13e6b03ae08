Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: \"This Is Not Here\", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression.[27] At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.[28]"]}}}
