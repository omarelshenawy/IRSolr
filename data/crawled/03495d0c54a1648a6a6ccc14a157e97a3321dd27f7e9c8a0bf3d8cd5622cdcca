The size of a carte de visite is 54.0 mm (2.125 in) × 89 mm (3.5 in) mounted on a card sized 64 mm (2.5 in) × 100 mm (4 in). In 1854, Disdéri had also patented a method of taking eight separate negatives on a single plate, which reduced production costs. The Carte de Visite was slow to gain widespread use until 1859, when Disdéri published Emperor Napoleon III's photos in this format.[3] This made the format an overnight success. The new invention was so popular it was known as \"cardomania\"[4] and it spread throughout Europe and then quickly to America and the rest of the world."]}}}
