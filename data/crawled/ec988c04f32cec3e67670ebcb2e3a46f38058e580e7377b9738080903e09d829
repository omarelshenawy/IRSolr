Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir first announced, in January 2011, that dual citizenship in the North and the South would be allowed,[54] but upon the independence of South Sudan he retracted the offer. He has also suggested an EU-style confederation.[55] Essam Sharaf, Prime Minister of Egypt after the 2011 Egyptian revolution, made his first foreign visit to Khartoum and Juba in the lead-up to South Sudan's secession.[56] Israel quickly recognized South Sudan as an independent country,[57] and is host to thousands of refugees from South Sudan,[58] who now face deportation to their native country.[59][60] Egypt, Sudan, Germany and Kenya were first to recognise the country's independence on 8 July 2011."]}}}
