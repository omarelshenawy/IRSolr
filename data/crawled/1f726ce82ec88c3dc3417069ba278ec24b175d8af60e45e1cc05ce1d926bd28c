We make our own rules,\"[23] explained Möller at a 2005 Citizen Reporters' Forum in Seoul.[24] He stated that Wikinews publishes a daily print edition and is working on other formats including an audio version of articles.[23] Möller was interviewed by Journalism.co.uk on the eightfold increase in traffic to Wikinews on the day of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, and on the effects of free news.[25] \"While Wikinews is still much, much smaller than Wikipedia, the potential for news coverage goes far beyond what Wikipedia is currently doing,\" said Möller.[25] He gave periodic \"State of the Wiki\" reports at Wikinews, where he defended the project's use of both original material and information synthesized from other media sources.[26]"]}}}
