Pick for instance ε = 1⁄2. There is no δ-neighborhood around x = 0 that will force all the f(x) values to be within ε of f(0). Intuitively we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden jump in function values. Similarly, the signum or sign function"],"after":["is discontinuous at x = 0 but continuous everywhere else. Yet another example: the function"]}}}
