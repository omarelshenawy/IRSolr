Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest.[124] Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published.[125] She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.[116] A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.[126]"],"after":["The first volume of Dickinson's Poems, edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890.[127] Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity.[128] The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years.[127] Poems: Second Series followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: \"The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published\".[129]"]}}}
