Furthermore, it covers distributions that are neither discrete nor continuous nor mixtures of the two."],"after":["Other distributions may not even be a mix, for example, the Cantor distribution has no positive probability for any single point, neither does it have a density. The modern approach to probability theory solves these problems using measure theory to define the probability space:"]}}}
