He has been cited as one the nineteenth century's three masters of the \"school of suspicion\", alongside Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud,[229] and as one of the three principal architects of modern social science along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber.[14] In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method.[12] Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean sociological positivism in attempt to develop a science of society.[230] Karl Löwith considered Marx and Søren Kierkegaard to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors.[231] In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. Isaiah Berlin considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology, \"in so far as anyone can claim the title.\"[232] Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts, and the humanities.[233][234][235][236]"],"after":["In social theory, twentieth- and twenty-first-century thinkers have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as Analytical Marxism, which came at the cost of sacrificing its most interesting and perplexing ideas. Another, more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and to emphasise the \"relative autonomy\" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the \"forces of production\" and the succession of \"modes of production.\" Such has been, for example, the neo-marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like Antonio Gramsci who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.[237][238][239][240]"]}}}
