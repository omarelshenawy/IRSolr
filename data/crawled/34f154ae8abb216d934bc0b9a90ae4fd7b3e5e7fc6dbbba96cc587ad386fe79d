Many major departments have been relocated to Broadcasting House and MediaCityUK, particularly since the closure of BBC Television Centre in March 2013. The continued cuts have inspired campaigns, petitions and protests amongst the viewers and listeners of the BBC who are fiercely loyal to the sections of the BBC that they use.
