North of the city, each railroad uses its own rail lines; south of the city, they share a line owned by Union Pacific.[118] The route travels over Tehachapi Pass (and through the Tehachapi Loop).[119] There are several spur lines in and around Bakersfield. The majority are operated by the San Joaquin Valley Railroad, owned by Genesee & Wyoming.[120]"]}}}
