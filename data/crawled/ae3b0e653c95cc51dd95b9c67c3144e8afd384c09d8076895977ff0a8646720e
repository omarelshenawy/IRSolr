Due to dry summers in Southern California, rainouts at Dodger Stadium are rare. Prior to 1976, the Dodgers were rained out only once, against the St.Louis Cardinals, on April 21, 1967, ending a streak of 737 consecutive games without a postponement. On April 12, 1976, the second home rainout ended a streak of 724 straight games. April 19â€“21, 1988 saw three consecutive rainouts, the only time consecutive games have been rained out at Dodger Stadium.[27] No rainouts occurred between April 21, 1988 and April 11, 1999 - a major league record of 856 straight home games without a rainout.[27] That record has since been broken, with no rainouts since April 17, 2000, 1213 consecutive games as of the second game of the 2015 season.[28]"]}}}
