Often the algorithms used emulate the above analog technologies."],"after":["A compressor reduces the level of an audio signal if its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. It is commonly set in decibels dB, where a lower threshold (e.g. -60 dB) means a larger portion of the signal will be treated (compared to a higher threshold of e.g. −5 dB)."]}}}
