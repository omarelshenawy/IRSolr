The SARK is a folding knife with a wharncliffe-style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut trapped victims free without stabbing them.[50] The knife features Emerson's Wave.[31] Seeing another need in the police community, Emerson replaced the blunt end of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the \"P-SARK\", or Police Search And Rescue Knife.[51] In 2005, the Navy changed the requirements on the SARK to incorporate a guthook on the back of the blade for use as a line-cutter.[52] Emerson made the change on this model which is only available to the US Navy and the model designation is the NSAR (Navy Search And Rescue) Knife.[52]"],"after":["In 1999, NASA contracted Emerson to build a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station.[6][7] Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement.[53] The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline with the addition of a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages.[53] The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.[54]"]}}}
