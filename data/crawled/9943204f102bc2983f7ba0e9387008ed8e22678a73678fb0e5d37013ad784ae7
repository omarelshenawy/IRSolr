In 2011, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13â€“14-year-old pupils in England and Wales 10th in the world for maths and 9th for science.[389] The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Two of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 were state-run grammar schools. Over half of students at the leading universities of Cambridge and Oxford had attended state schools.[390] Despite a fall in actual numbers the proportion of children in England attending private schools has risen to over 7%.[391] In 2010, more than 45% of places at the University of Oxford and 40% at the University of Cambridge were taken by students from private schools, even though they educate just 7% of the population.[392] England has the two oldest universities in English-speaking world, Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (jointly known as \"Oxbridge\") with history of over eight centuries. The United Kingdom has 9 universities featured in the Times Higher Education top 100 rankings, making it second to the United States in terms of representation.[393]"],"after":["Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two non-departmental public bodies have key roles in Scottish education. The Scottish Qualifications Authority is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, post-secondary colleges of further education and other centres.[395] The Learning and Teaching Scotland provides advice, resources and staff development to education professionals.[396] Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496.[397] The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4%, and it has been rising slowly in recent years.[398] Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.[399]"]}}}
