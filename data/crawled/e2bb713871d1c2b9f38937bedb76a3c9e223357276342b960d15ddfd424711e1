Perhaps most notably, Conservative Peter Lilley pastiched \"I've got a little list\" to specify some groups to whom he objected, including \"sponging socialists\" and \"young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue\".[126]"],"after":["Many of the songs in The Mikado have been referenced in Broadway shows, films, comedy routines, albums and television. For example, in The Producers, an auditioner for the musical Springtime for Hitler begins his audition with Nanki-Poo's song, \"A wand'ring minstrel I.\" He is quickly dismissed. In the 1966 Batman episode \"The Minstrel's Shakedown,\" the villain identifies himself as \"The Minstrel\" by singing to the tune of \"A wand'ring minstrel I.\" In the Top Cat episode \"All That Jazz\", Officer Dibble woefully sings \"A wand'ring minstrel I\" when urged by Top Cat to demonstrate his 'golden' singing voice. In the 2006 film Brick, femme fatale Laura (Nora Zehetner) performs a spoken-word version of \"The Sun Whose Rays are All Ablaze\" while playing piano. In Blackadder Goes Forth a recording of \"A Wand'ring Minstrel I\" is played on a gramophone at the beginning of the first episode, and a snatch of the song is also sung by Captain Blackadder in the episode involving \"Speckled Jim\". The movie poster for The Little Shop of Horrors, shown to the left, parodies the song title, \"The Flowers that Bloom in the Spring, Tra la!\" changing the word \"bloom\" to \"kill\".[133] \"There Is Beauty in the Bellow of the Blast\" is performed by Richard Thompson and Judith Owen on the album 1000 Years of Popular Music. Thompson comments, \"According to opera convention, it's not just the young folk who get married at the end – at least one set of wrinklies are required to get hitched as well.\"[134]"]}}}
