Consequently, this cycle is also known as the alternation of generations. The diploid organism's germ-line cells undergo meiosis to produce spores. The spores proliferate by mitosis, growing into a haploid organism. The haploid organism's gamete then combines with another haploid organism's gamete, creating the zygote. The zygote undergoes repeated mitosis and differentiation to become a diploid organism again. The sporic life cycle can be considered a fusion of the gametic and zygotic life cycles.[citation needed]"],"after":["The preparatory steps that lead up to meiosis are identical in pattern and name to interphase of the mitotic cell cycle.[citation needed]","Interphase is divided into three phases:"]}}}
