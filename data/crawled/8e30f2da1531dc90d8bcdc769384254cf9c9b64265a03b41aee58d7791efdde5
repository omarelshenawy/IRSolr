Grosvenor appointed William Porden to plan the improvements. Building started in 1803 and Porden estimated it would take three years to build at a cost of £10,000 (£800,000 in 2015).[2] In the event it took just under 10 years and cost over £100,000 (£5,690,000 in 2015).[2][4] The previous house was encased and surrounded by \"every possible permutation of the gothic style\";[5] including turrets, pinnacles, arched windows, octagonal towers, and buttresses (both regular and flying).[6] Two new wings were added in the first stage, and in the 1820s more wings were added, by this time under the direction of Benjamin Gummow. The interior of the house was as lavish as the exterior, with more Gothic detailing. The hangings for the state bed included 97 yards (89 m) of purple damask and 103 yards (94 m) of sarsenet (fine silk) trimmed with gold lace.[4] When the future Queen Victoria visited in 1832 at the age of 13, she wrote in her journal: \"The house is magnificent\".[7][8] Others described it as being \"as extravagant and opulent as the very latest upholsterer-decorators could make it\". A critic found it \"the most gaudy concern I ever saw\" and \"a vast pile of mongrel gothic which ... is a monument of wealth, ignorance and bad taste\".[7] Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, succeeded his father in 1845 and commissioned the Scottish architect William Burn to make alterations to the house. Burn raised the centre of the south front to make it look like a tower, and changed some of the external Gothic features.[7] The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described this house as a \"spectacular Gothic mansion\".[9]"],"after":["The 2nd Marquess died in 1869 and was succeeded by his son Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, initially the 3rd Marquess and from 1874 the 1st Duke of Westminster. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse to design another new hall. Again the core of the previous hall was retained; parts were refaced and re-modelled, other parts were completely rebuilt. A private wing was built for the use of the family, and this was joined to the main part of the hall by a corridor. Waterhouse also designed the chapel and a clock-house, and rebuilt most of the stabling.[10] The work began in 1870, took 12 years to complete, and cost £803,000 (£70.6 million in 2015).[2][11] The library was 90 feet (27 m) long, the dining room with its ante room was 105 feet (32 m) long, and the octagonal great hall contained an organ. For the interior, Henry Stacy Marks painted a frieze of the Canterbury Pilgrims for the morning room, Gertrude Jekyll painted panels for the drawing room, and in other rooms were paintings by Gainsborough, Stubbs and Reynolds.[12] Pevsner wrote that it \"was an outstanding expression of High Victorian originality\", and added \"this Wagnerian palace was the most ambitious instance of Gothic Revival domestic architecture anywhere in the country\".[9] The Daily Telegraph described it as \"one of the most princely and beautiful mansions that these islands contain\".[13]"]}}}
