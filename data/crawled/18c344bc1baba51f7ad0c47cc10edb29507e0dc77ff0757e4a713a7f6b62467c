One archosaur group, the dinosaurs, were the dominant land vertebrates for the rest of the Mesozoic,[74] and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs.[70] During this time mammals' ancestors survived only as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores, but this apparent set-back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair.[75] After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs – birds are the only surviving dinosaurs – mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity, and some took to the air and the sea.[76][77][78]"],"after":["Fossil evidence indicates that flowering plants appeared and rapidly diversified in the Early Cretaceous, between 130 million years ago and 90 million years ago.[79] Their rapid rise to dominance of terrestrial ecosystems is thought to have been propelled by coevolution with pollinating insects.[80] Social insects appeared around the same time and, although they account for only small parts of the insect \"family tree\", now form over 50% of the total mass of all insects.[81]"]}}}
