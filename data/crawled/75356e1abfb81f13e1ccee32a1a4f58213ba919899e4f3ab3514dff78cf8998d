The song fights against the media, mainly for what the media made him out to be during his 1993 child abuse allegations. The single had the highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at number five, and received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals\".[199] \"You Are Not Alone\" was the second single released from HIStory; it holds the Guinness World Record for the first song ever to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[135] It was seen as a major artistic and commercial success, receiving a Grammy nomination for \"Best Pop Vocal Performance\".[199]"],"after":["In late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance; the incident was caused by a stress-related panic attack.[200] \"Earth Song\" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995; it sold a million copies, making it Jackson's most successful single in the UK.[199] The track \"They Don't Care About Us\" became controversial when the Anti-Defamation League and other groups criticized its allegedly antisemitic lyrics. Jackson quickly put out a revised version of the song without the offending lyrics.[201] In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form for \"Scream\" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.[52][202]"]}}}
