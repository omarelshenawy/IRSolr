After landing a deal with Downtown Records before even recording a note of music, Diplo & Switch set out for Jamaica to record a project that, like most of Diplo’s projects before it, would highlight the little-known subgenres, this time of Jamaica’s dancehall scene.[24] The two received support by many already established Jamaican artists such as Vybz Kartel, Elephant Man and Ms. Thing, and the resulting record Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do also featured vocals from Santigold, Amanda Blank, Nina Sky, Ricky Blaze and more.[33] When discussing the Major Lazer project, Diplo described the dancehall sound as being \" the end of the world, all the little influences—house, soca, oldies, R&B, jazz—it all ends up in Jamaica.\"[34] The track \"Pon De Floor\" from Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do was sampled for Beyoncé's single \"Run the World (Girls)\".[35]"]}}}
