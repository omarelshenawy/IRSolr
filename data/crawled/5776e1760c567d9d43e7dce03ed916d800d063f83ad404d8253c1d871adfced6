Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became top twenty hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \"Modern Love\" and \"China Girl\" made number two in the UK, accompanied by a pair of acclaimed promotional videos that, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"were totally absorbing and activated key archetypes in the pop world. 'Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young Aborigine couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene (a homage to the film From Here to Eternity), was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV. Stevie Ray Vaughan was guest guitarist playing solo on \"Let's Dance\", although the video depicts Bowie miming this part.[91] By 1983, Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day. Let's Dance was followed by the Serious Moonlight Tour, during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist Earl Slick and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms. The world tour lasted six months and was extremely popular.\"[92]"],"after":["Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \"God Only Knows\". The album bore the transatlantic top ten hit \"Blue Jean\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, \"Jazzin' for Blue Jean\". Bowie performed at Wembley in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premi√®red, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \"Dancing in the Street\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \"This Is Not America\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a top 40 hit in the UK and US.[93]"]}}}
