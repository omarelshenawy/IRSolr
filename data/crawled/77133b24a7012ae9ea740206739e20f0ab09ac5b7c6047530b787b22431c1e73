A journalist from The Jerusalem Post described the show in Tel Aviv as an \"assault on the senses\". He further comments, \"Despite the confused ideas underlying the performance, it’s difficult to imagine somebody not enjoying a Madonna concert. Say what you will about the Kabbalah-studying, gun-toting, fashionista of pop music – and everyone has something to say – but the woman knows how to put on a good show\".[29] Jon Parales from The New York Times wrote that \"the concert is a display of energy and nutty inventiveness, with Madonna costumed as everything from baton twirler to folk dancer\", adding that it \"is less a story than an excellent excuse for extravagant, perpetually surprising production numbers involving more than three dozen performers, while it turns some of Madonna’s past hits inside out.\"[30] New York Daily News called the show \"an idea-intensive, message-packed riddle wrapped in an enigma that must be seen to be believed,\" arguing that the show's risky artistry \"deserves praise.\"[31] German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost wrote: \"Madonna live in 2012 is still magical and unmatched,\" [32] Newspaper El País said \"Madonna shows her intelligence, femininity and elegance in a danceable and spectacular show,\"[32][33] Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"With three decades of superstardom under her belt, Madonna has pretty much perfected the art of mass entertainment with a hint of scandal.

He says, \"While her previous Sticky and Sweet tour saw her lightly poking fun at herself and her various musical guises throughout the years, this concert was at times brutally dark and suffocating and as much an emotional exorcism as a performance\".[35]"]}}}
