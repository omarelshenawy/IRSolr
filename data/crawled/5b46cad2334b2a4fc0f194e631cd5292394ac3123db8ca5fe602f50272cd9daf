This lake, the third largest in Africa and the eighth largest lake in the world, is located between Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. This lake is also the second deepest lake in Africa, but its placid nature at its northern shore gives no hint of its depth. This great lake's tropical waters reportedly are the habitat of more species of fish than any other lake on the Earth."]}}}
