It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars[32] or an estimated $205 billion in present-day US dollars.[33] (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $26.2 billion, accounting for inflation.)[33][34] It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.[35] The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth."],"after":["The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968.[36] Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon.[37] On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced[38][39] and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.[40]"]}}}
