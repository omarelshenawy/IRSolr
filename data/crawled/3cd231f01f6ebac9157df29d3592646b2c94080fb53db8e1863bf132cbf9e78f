Domino effects in this new world trade cycle lead to both world wide recessions and world economic booms.[50] Modelski describes the late period of proto-globalization as a \"thick range of global networks extending throughout the world at high speed and covering all components of society\".[51] By the 1750s, Europe, Africa, Asia, and America's contact had grown into a stable multilateral interdependency which was echoed in the modern globalization period.[52]"]}}}
