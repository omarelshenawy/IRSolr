Although the alliance lasted less than a year, they recorded what many consider The Wailers' finest work. Marley and Perry split after a dispute regarding the assignment of recording rights, but they would remain friends and work together again."],"after":["Between 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer re-cut some old tracks with JAD Records in Kingston and London in an attempt to commercialise The Wailers' sound. Bunny later asserted that these songs \"should never be released on an album ... they were just demos for record companies to listen to\". In 1968, Bob and Rita visited songwriter Jimmy Norman at his apartment in the Bronx. Norman had written the extended lyrics for Kai Winding's \"Time Is on My Side\" (covered by the Rolling Stones) and had also written for Johnny Nash and Jimi Hendrix.[31] A three-day jam session with Norman and others, including Norman's co-writer Al Pyfrom, resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. This tape is, according to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, rare in that it was influenced by pop rather than reggae, as part of an effort to break Marley into the American charts.[31] According to an article in The New York Times, Marley experimented on the tape with different sounds, adopting a doo-wop style on \"Stay With Me\" and \"the slow love song style of 1960's artists\" on \"Splish for My Splash\".[31] An artist yet to establish himself outside his native Jamaica, Marley lived in Ridgmount Gardens, Bloomsbury, during 1972.[32]"]}}}
