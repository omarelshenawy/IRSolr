Temperatures do not change drastically throughout the seasons. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than the rest of the island. Between winter and summer, there is only a temperature swing of around 6 °F (3.3 °C). This is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal waters temperatures around the years are about 75 °F in February to 85 °F in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 99 °F (37 °C) at Arecibo,[82] while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 °F (4 °C) at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal.[83] The average yearly precipitation is 1,687 mm (66 in).[84]"],"after":[]}}}
