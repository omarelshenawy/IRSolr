After World War I and the breakup of the Austrian monarchy, politicians of the new republic declared its name to be \"Deutsch√∂sterreich\" (Republic of German-Austria) and that it was part of the German Republic. A unification of the two countries was forbidden by the treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye as one of the conditions imposed by the victorious Allies of World War I upon the vanquished nation, to prevent the creation of a territorially extensive German state. Along with the events of World War II and Nazism Austria as a country has made efforts to develop its own distinct national identity among its populace[citation needed], and nowadays many do not consider themselves Germans,[101] while a minority still feels German, a movement historically known as \"Grossdeutsch\", pointing to the fact that they consider historic boundaries of the German people going beyond the boundaries of the actual states. Today 91.1% of the population are regarded as ethnic Austrians.[102]"]}}}
