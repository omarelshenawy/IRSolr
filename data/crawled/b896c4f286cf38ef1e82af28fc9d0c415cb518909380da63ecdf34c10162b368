The study also demonstrated that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the Mexican highlands. Later, maize spread from this region over the Americas along two major paths. This is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the lowlands.[8]"],"after":["The word maize derives from the Spanish form of the indigenous Ta√≠no word for the plant, maiz.[9] It is known by other names around the world.","Corn outside North America, Australia and New Zealand means any cereal crop, its meaning understood to vary geographically to refer to the local staple.[10][11] In the United States,[10] Canada,[12] Australia, and New Zealand,[citation needed] corn primarily means maize; this usage started as a shortening of \"Indian corn\".[10] \"Indian corn\" primarily means maize (the staple grain of indigenous Americans), but can refer more specifically to multicolored \"flint corn\" used for decoration.[13]"]}}}
