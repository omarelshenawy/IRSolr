At the subsequent autopsy, 8 mg/dL of chloral hydrate and 4.5 mg/dL of Nembutal were found in her system,[161] and Dr. Thomas Noguchi (known as the \"coroner to the stars\") of the Los Angeles County Coroners office recorded cause of death as \"acute barbiturate poisoning\", resulting from a \"probable suicide\".[162] Many theories, including murder, circulated about the circumstances of her death and the timeline after the body was found. Some conspiracy theories involved John and Robert Kennedy, while other theories suggested CIA or Mafia complicity. It was reported that President Kennedy was the last person Monroe called.[163][164]"]}}}
