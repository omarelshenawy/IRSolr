Tags are written in all lowercase, with no spaces, and limited to 64 characters. For example, articles could be tagged as being about security or mozilla. Some articles are tagged with longer tags, such as whatcouldpossiblygowrong (expressing the perception of catastrophic risk), suddenoutbreakofcommonsense (used when the community feels that the subject has finally figured out something obvious), correlationnotcausation (used when scientific articles lack direct evidence; see correlation does not imply causation), or getyourasstomars (commonly seen in articles about Mars or space exploration).[50][51]"],"after":["As an online community with primarily user-generated content, many in-jokes and internet memes have developed over the course of the site's history. A popular meme (based on an unscientific Slashdot user poll[52]) is, \"In Soviet Russia, noun verb you!\"[53] This type of joke has its roots in the 1960s or earlier, and is known as a \"Russian reversal\". Other popular memes usually pertain to computing or technology, such as \"Imagine a Beowulf cluster of these\",[54] \"But does it run Linux?\",[55] or \"Netcraft now confirms: BSD (or some other software package or item) is dying.\"[56] Some users will also refer to seemingly innocent remarks by correcting them and adding \"you insensitive clod!\" to the statement â€“ a reference to a February 14, 1986, Calvin & Hobbes cartoon.[57] Also, on the television show Cheers, Season 8 Episode 23 (4/12/1990), Frasier, in protest to a seance, rattles glasses to startle the participants. His wife Lillith remarks, \"Frasier, don't be such an insensitive clod!\" Or the 11th season of The Simpsons episode, Last Tap Dance in Springfield (5/7/2000), wherein Frink exclaims to Homer, \"I was merely trying to spare the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod!\" Users will also typically refer to articles referring to data storage and data capacity by inquiring how much it is in units of Libraries of Congress.[58] Sometimes bandwidth speeds are referred to in units of Libraries of Congress per second. When numbers are quoted, people will comment that the number happens to be the combination to their luggage and express false anger at the person who revealed it."]}}}
