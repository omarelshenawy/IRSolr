The most famous exception to this is a strong sign language law that was passed by the National Congress of Brazil. Legally recognized in 2002,[326] the law was regulated in 2005.[327] The law mandates the use of the Brazilian Sign Language, more commonly known by its Portuguese acronym LIBRAS, in education and government services. The language must be taught as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access (\"inclusion\") to deaf people.[328]"]}}}
