The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the Mesopotamian cities of Uruk and Larsa, dating from the 2nd millennium BC, may have been evidence of type where the reuse of identical characters were applied to create cuneiform text.[6] Babylonian cylinder seals were used to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.[7] Typography was also realized in the Phaistos Disc, an enigmatic Minoan print item from Crete, Greece, which dates between 1850 and 1600 BC.[8][9][10] It has been proposed that Roman lead pipe inscriptions were created by movable type printing,[11][12][13] but German typographer Herbert Brekle recently dismissed this view.[14]"]}}}
