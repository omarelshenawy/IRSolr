Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song \"Lone Pilgrim\",[207] written by a 19th-century teacher. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits.[208] The album from it, MTV Unplugged, included \"John Brown\", an unreleased 1962 song of how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.[209]"],"after":["With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch,[210] Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.[211] Late that spring, before the album's release, Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, \"I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon.\"[212] He was back on the road by midsummer, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric \"Blowin' in the Wind\".[213]"]}}}
