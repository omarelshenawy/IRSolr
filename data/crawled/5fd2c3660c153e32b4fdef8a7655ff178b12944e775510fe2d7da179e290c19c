Although this is no longer an option, some formulae have formatting in them intended to force them to display as an image, such as an invisible quarter space (\\,) added at the end of the formula, or \\displaystyle at the beginning. Such formatting can be removed if a formula is edited and need not be added to new formulae."]}}}
