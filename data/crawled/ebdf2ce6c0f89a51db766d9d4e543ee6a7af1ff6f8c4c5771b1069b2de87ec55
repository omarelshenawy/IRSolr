He was the author of various tracts in defence of corporal presence of the Eucharist against Cranmer's idea of spiritual presence, some of which, being written in prison, were published abroad under a false name. Controversial writings also passed between him and Martin Bucer, with whom he had several interviews in Germany, when he was there as Henry VIII's ambassador. He was a friend of learning in every form, and took great interest especially in promoting the study of Greek at Cambridge. He was, however, opposed to the new method of pronouncing that language introduced by Sir John Cheke, and wrote letters to him and Sir Thomas Smith upon the subject, in which, according to Roger Ascham, his opponents showed themselves the better critics, but he the superior talent. In his own household he loved to take in young university men of promise; many of those he thus encouraged became distinguished in later life as bishops, ambassadors and secretaries of state. His house was spoken of by John Leland as the seat of eloquence and the special abode of the muses."]}}}
