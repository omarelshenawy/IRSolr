Gilbert and Sullivan called them \"pirated\", although the creators did not have any international copyright protection.[67][68][69] The first of these productions, opening at the Boston Museum on 25 November 1878, made such a splash that the piece was quickly produced in major cities and on tour by dozens of companies throughout the country. Boston alone saw at least a dozen productions, including a juvenile version described by Louisa May Alcott in her 1879 story, \"Jimmy's Cruise in the Pinafore\".[70] In New York, different productions of the piece played simultaneously in eight theatres within five blocks of each other and in six theatres in Philadelphia.[71]"],"after":["These unauthorised performances took many forms, including burlesques, productions with men playing women's roles and vice versa, spoofs, variety acts, Minstrel show versions,[70] all-black and Catholic productions, German, Yiddish and other foreign-language versions,[68] performances on boats or by church choirs,[72] and productions starring casts of children.[37][70] Few purported to play the opera as written.[73] Sheet music arrangements were popular, there were Pinafore-themed dolls and household items, and references to the opera were common in advertising, news and other media.[68] Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte brought lawsuits in the U.S. and tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, or at least to claim some royalties, without success. They made a special effort to claim American rights for their next work after Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, by giving the official premiere in New York.[74]"]}}}
