In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies,[65][66] students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like Spacewar! and created much of modern hacker slang and culture.[67] Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology;[68] the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee;[69] the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002;[70] and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.[71]"]}}}
