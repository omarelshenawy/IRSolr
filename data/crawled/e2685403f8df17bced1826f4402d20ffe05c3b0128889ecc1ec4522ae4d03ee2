Computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec proposed in a 1998 book[24] that the exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies prior to the integrated circuit. Futurist Ray Kurzweil postulates a law of accelerating returns in which the speed of technological change (and more generally, all evolutionary processes[25]) increases exponentially, generalizing Moore's Law in the same manner as Moravec's proposal, and also including material technology (especially as applied to nanotechnology), medical technology and others.[26] Between 1986 and 2007, machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita has roughly doubled every 14 months; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months.[27] Like other authors, though, Kurzweil reserves the term \"singularity\" for a rapid increase in intelligence (as opposed to other technologies), writing for example that \"The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine\".[28] He believes that the \"design of the human brain, while not simple, is nonetheless a billion times simpler than it appears, due to massive redundancy\".[29] According to Kurzweil, the reason why the brain has a messy and unpredictable quality is because the brain, like most biological systems, is a \"probabilistic fractal\".[30] He also defines his predicted date of the singularity (2045) in terms of when he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower, writing that advances in computing before that date \"will not represent the Singularity\" because they do \"not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence.\"[31]"]}}}
