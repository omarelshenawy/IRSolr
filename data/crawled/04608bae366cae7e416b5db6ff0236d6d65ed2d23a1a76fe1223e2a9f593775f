The control line that accomplishes this is called a \"sheet.\" If the sheet is too loose the sail will flap in the wind, an occurrence that is called \"luffing.\" Optimum sail angle can be approximated by pulling the sheet in just so far as to make the luffing stop, or by using of tell-tales - small ribbons or yarn attached each side of the sail that both stream horizontally to indicate a properly trimmed sail.[19] Finer controls adjust the overall shape of the sail."]}}}
