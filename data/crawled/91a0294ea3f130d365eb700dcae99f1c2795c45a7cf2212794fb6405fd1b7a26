Anderson always wanted to call it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents.[5] There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly.[5][41] Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.[5]"]}}}
