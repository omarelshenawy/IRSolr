Luganda is the most common language. English is the official language, even though only a relatively small proportion of the population speaks it. Access to economic and political power is almost impossible without having mastered that English. Luganda, a language widespread in central Uganda, is the official vernacular language in education for central Uganda. The East African lingua franca Swahili is relatively widespread as a trade language and became an official national language in September 2005."]}}}
