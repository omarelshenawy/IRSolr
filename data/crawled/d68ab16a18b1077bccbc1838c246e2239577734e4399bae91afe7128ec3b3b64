Bands dubbed \"alternative\" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements.[216] Important alternative rock bands of the 1980s in the US included R.E.M., Hüsker Dü, Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies,[216] and in the UK the Cure, New Order, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Smiths.[217] Artists were largely confined to independent record labels, building an extensive underground music scene based on college radio, fanzines, touring, and word-of-mouth.[218] They rejected the dominant synthpop of the early 1980s, marking a return to group-based guitar rock.[219][220][221]"]}}}
