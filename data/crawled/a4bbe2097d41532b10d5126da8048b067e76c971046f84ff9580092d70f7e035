James Poniewozik of Time ranked it the eighth best television show of the year, commenting: \"when Glee works—which is often—it is transcendent, tear-jerking and thrilling like nothing else on TV.\"[127] Entertainment Weekly‍‍ '​‍s Ken Tucker ranked it ninth, calling it \"Hands down the year's most novel show [and] also its least likely success\",[128] Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that while ordinarily Glee‍‍ '​‍s premise would have been \"a recipe for disaster\", the show has \"such quirky charm and bravado that it is impossible not to get swept up\".[129] Reviews for subsequent seasons on Metacritic, reflecting their initial episodes, were not quite as good—the second season's score was 76 out of 100 from eleven reviews,[130] and the fourth season received a score of 73 out of 100 from six reviews.[131]"]}}}
