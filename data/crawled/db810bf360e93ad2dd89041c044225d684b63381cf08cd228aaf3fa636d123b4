He stated that \"Serbia is not going to do something that is against our interest, because we are defending out territorial integrity and sovereignty by using international law\" and that by constitution he must defend the interests of Serbia, and not the interests of any other country in the world.[54][55]"],"after":["Tadić invoked his constitutional powers of Commander-in-Chief of the Military of Serbia and dismissed the Chief of the General Staff Zdravko Ponoš on 30 December 2008.
