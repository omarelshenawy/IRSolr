Bank collapses were a frequent occurrence and a crisis point was reached in 1893 when 12 banks failed.[149] The Bank of New South Wales exists to this day as Westpac.[150] The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was formed in Sydney in 1911 and began to issue notes backed by the resources of the nation. It was replaced in this role in 1959 by the Reserve Bank of Australia which is also based in Sydney.[149] The Australian Securities Exchange began operating in 1987 and with a market capitalisation of $1.6 trillion is now one of the ten largest exchanges in the world.[151]"]}}}
