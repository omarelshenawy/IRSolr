In addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair. He had previously shaved his mustache in 1983 for the video of \"Ricky\" to resemble Desi Arnaz, and 1996 for the \"Amish Paradise\" video. Yankovic reasoned, \"If Madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15Â minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years.\"[25] He parodied the reaction to this \"new look\" in a commercial for his nonexistent MTV Unplugged special. The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for Hanson's \"River\", claiming his new look was an attempt to \"get back to the core of what I'm all about\", that being \"the music\".[26]"]}}}
