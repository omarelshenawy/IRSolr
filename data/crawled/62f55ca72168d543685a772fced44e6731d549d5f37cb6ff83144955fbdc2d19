In response, Perón, who was then the Secretary of Labour, established a fund to raise money to aid the victims. He devised a plan to have an \"artistic festival\" as a fundraiser, and invited radio and film actors to participate. After a week of fundraising, all participants met at a gala held at Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires to benefit earthquake victims. It was at this gala, on 22 January 1944, that Eva Duarte first met Colonel Juan Perón.[18] Eva promptly became the colonel's mistress. Eva referred to the day she met her future husband as her \"marvelous day\".[19] Fraser and Navarro write that Juan Perón and Eva left the gala together at around two in the morning.[20]"]}}}
