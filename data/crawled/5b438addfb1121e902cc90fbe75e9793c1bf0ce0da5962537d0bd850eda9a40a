The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1958 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Unionâ€™s artists.[49] This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or as his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears,[50] and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed.[51] Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal.[52] Once he joined the Party, several articles denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name, though he did not actually write them. In addition, in joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \"The Year 1917.\"[53] Around this time, his health also began to deteriorate."],"after":["Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece, \"To the victims of fascism and war\",[54] ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram: Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman \"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\"[55] Several of Shostakovich's colleagues, including Natalya Vovsi-Mikhoels[56] and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky,[57] were also aware of the Eighth Quartet's biographical intent."]}}}
