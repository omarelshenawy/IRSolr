According to reports in 2013, \"[m]ost of Chicago's violent crime comes from gangs trying to maintain control of drug-selling territories\",[201] and is specifically related to the activities of the Sinaloa Cartel, which by 2006 had decided to seek to control illicit drug distribution, over against local street gangs.[202] Violent crime rates vary significantly by area of the city, with more economically developed areas having low rates, but other sections have much higher rates of crime.[201] In 2013, the violent crime rate was 910 per 100,000 people;[203] the murder rate was 10.4 -- while high crime districts saw 38.9, low crime districts saw 2.5 murders per 100,000.[204]"]}}}
