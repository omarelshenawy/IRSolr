This ranged from relatively pop oriented acts such as Moby[85] to the distinctly anti-commercial sentiments[86] of Underground Resistance . Derrick May's experimentation on works such as Beyond the Dance (1989) and The Beginning (1990) were credited with taking techno \"in dozens of new directions at once and having the kind of expansive impact John Coltrane had on Jazz\".[87] The Birmingham-based label Network Records label was instrumental in introducing Detroit techno to British audiences.[88] By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the original techno sound had garnered a large underground following in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.
