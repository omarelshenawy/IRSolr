Florida was the top destination state in 2011.[150] Many beach towns are popular tourist destinations, particularly during winter and spring break. Twenty-three million tourists visited Florida beaches in 2000, spending $22 billion.[151] The public has a right to beach access under the public trust doctrine, but some areas have access effectively blocked by private owners for a long distance.[152]"]}}}
