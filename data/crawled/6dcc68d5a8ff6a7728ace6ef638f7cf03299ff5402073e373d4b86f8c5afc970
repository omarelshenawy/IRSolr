He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901,[36] but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father Einstein secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office,[37][38] as an assistant examiner.[39][40] He evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.[40] In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he \"fully mastered machine technology\".[41]:370"]}}}
