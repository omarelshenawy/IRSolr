She sued to prevent him from publishing a book about their marriage in April 2006, contending that it violated their confidentiality agreement.[177] The following year, a court-appointed arbitrator issued a permanent injunction forbidding Noa from \"criticizing, denigrating, casting in a negative light or otherwise disparaging\" Lopez. She was awarded $545,000 in compensatory damages and Noa was ordered to hand over all copies of materials related to the book to Lopez or her attorney.[178] A lawsuit regarding a compromising private honeymoon video in Noa's possession is presently running.[179]"]}}}
