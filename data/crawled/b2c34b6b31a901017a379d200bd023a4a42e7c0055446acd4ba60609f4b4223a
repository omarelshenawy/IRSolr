Herodotus considered the Persian Wars of the early 5th century BC a conflict of Europa versus Asia[citation needed] (which he considered all land north and east of the Sea of Marmara, respectively)[citation needed]. The terms \"West\" and \"East\" were not used by any Greek author to describe that conflict. The anachronistic application of those terms to that division entails a stark logical contradiction, given that, when the term \"West\" appeared, it was used in opposition to the Greeks and Greek-speaking culture.[citation needed]"]}}}
