In the original tight-fitting, extraneously zippered style of the late 1970s and early 1980s, \"parachute\" referred to the pants' synthetic nylon material. In the later 1980s, \"parachute\" may have referred to the extreme bagginess of the pant. These are also referred to as \"Hammer\" pants, due to rapper MC Hammer's signature style. Hammer pants differ from the parachute pants of the 1970s and early 1980s. They are typically worn as menswear and are often brightly colored. Parachute pants became a fad in US culture in the 1980s as part of an increased cultural appropriation of breakdancing.[30]"],"after":[]}}}
