[5] A vertical direct south sundial in the Northern Hemisphere becomes a vertical direct north sundial in the Southern Hemisphere. To position a horizontal sundial correctly, one has to find true North or South. The same process can be used to do both. [6] The gnomon, set to the correct latitude, has to point to the true South in the Southern hemisphere as in the Northern Hemisphere it has to point to the true North. [7] Also the hour numbers go in opposite directions, so on a horizontal dial they run anti-clockwise rather than clockwise.[8]"]}}}
