The perigee distance is less than the radius of the Earth R including atmosphere, hence the ellipse intersects the Earth, and hence the spacecraft will fail to complete an orbit. The major axis is vertical, the semi-major axis a is more than R/2. The specific orbital energy is given by:"],"after":["Thus the net extra specific energy needed compared to just raising the spacecraft into space is between 0 and .","To minimize the required delta-v (an astrodynamical measure which strongly determines the required fuel), the high-altitude part of the flight is made with the rockets off (this is technically called free-fall even for the upward part of the trajectory). The maximum speed in a flight is attained at the lowest altitude of this free-fall trajectory, both at the start and at the end of it."]}}}
