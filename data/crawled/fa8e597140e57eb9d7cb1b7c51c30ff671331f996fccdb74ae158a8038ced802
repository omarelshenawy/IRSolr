In addition, although many partisan units were already mobilized and waiting at assembly points throughout the city, the mobilization of thousands of young men and women was hard to conceal. Sporadic fighting started in advance of \"W-hour\", notably in Żoliborz,[55] and around Napoleon Square and Dąbrowski Square.[56] The Germans had anticipated the possibility of an uprising, though they had not realized its size or strength.[57] At 16:30 Governor Fischer put the garrison on full alert.[58]"]}}}
