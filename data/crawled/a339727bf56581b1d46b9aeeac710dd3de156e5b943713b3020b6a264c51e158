Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a Mammoth Lakes motocross race; she was \"assisting\" in his race and wrote \"Will You Marry Me? I'm serious!\" on a pit board. He initially didn't notice and continued on for another lap. When he did notice later, he veered off the track to accept right then. She then made him finish the race because she wouldn't marry a loser.[144][145] They married in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006.[146]"]}}}
