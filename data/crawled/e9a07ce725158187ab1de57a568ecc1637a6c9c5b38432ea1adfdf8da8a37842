When Jackson granted Yankovic permission to do \"Fat\", Jackson allowed him to use the same set built for his own \"Badder\" video from the Moonwalker film. Though Jackson allowed \"Eat It\" and \"Fat\", he requested that Yankovic not record a parody of \"Black or White\", titled \"Snack All Night\", because he felt the message was too important. This refusal, coming shortly after the commercial failure of Yankovic's movie UHF in theaters, had initially set Yankovic back; he later recognized this as a critical time as, while searching for new parodies, he came across Nirvana, leading to a revitalization of his career with \"Smells Like Nirvana\".[80] Yankovic has performed a concert-only parody \"Snack All Night\" in some of his live shows.[27] Yankovic had a cameo appearance, along with many other celebrities, in Jackson's music video for \"Liberian Girl\"."],"after":["Dave Grohl of Nirvana said that the band felt they had \"made it\" after Yankovic recorded \"Smells Like Nirvana\", a parody of the grunge band's smash hit, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".[7] On his Behind the Music special, Yankovic stated that when he called Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to ask if he could parody the song, Cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, \"Um... it's not gonna be about food, is it?\" Yankovic responded with, \"No, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics.\" According to members of Nirvana interviewed for Behind the Music, when they saw the video of the song, they laughed hysterically. Additionally, Cobain described Yankovic as \"a musical genius\".[81]"]}}}
