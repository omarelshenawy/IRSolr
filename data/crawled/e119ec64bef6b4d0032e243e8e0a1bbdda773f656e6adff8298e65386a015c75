Her mother works as a seamstress in London. An early interest in fashion and textiles – designing confections of \"bright fluorescent fishnet fabrics\" — was a hallmark of her time at Central Saint Martins College. M.I.A. was a roommate of fashion designer Luella Bartley and is a long-time friend of designer Carri Mundane.[180][181] Clothes from her limited-edition \"Okley Run\" line — Mexican and Afrika line jackets and leggings, Islamic-inspired and water melon-print hoodies, and tour-inspired designs – were sold in 2008 during New York fashion week.[24][182][183] She commented, \"I wanted to tie all my work together. When I make an album, I make a number of artworks that go with it, and now I make some clothes that go with it too. So this Okley run was an extension of my Kala album and artwork.\"[182] Spin described her designs as \"1000 watt Malcolm McLaren-meets-Basquiat\", that complimented her personal style that could \"run from futurist aerobic instructor to new wave pirate to queenly candy raver\".[24][184]"]}}}
