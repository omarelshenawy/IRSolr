She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers.[106] Lavinia, who also never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899."],"after":["The 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with Mabel Loomis Todd, an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as \"a lady whom the people call the Myth\".[107] Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief.[108] Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote \"We were never intimate ... while she was our Mother – but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.\"[109] The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert—Emily's favorite—died of typhoid fever.[110]"]}}}
