Many moved on to England and came to be known as Anglo-Saxons, but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians, named after the ancient inhabitants of the Frisii. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast, and it is still the closest to English related living language after Scots. By the Seventh-century a Frisian Kingdom (650–734) under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Utrecht as its centre of power,[42][43] while Dorestad was a Frisian flourishing trading place.[44][45] Between 600 and around 719 the city was often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the Battle of the Boarn, the Frisians in the Netherlands were after a series of wars defeated by the Franks. With the approval of the Franks, Anglo-Saxon missionaries converted the Frisian people to Christianity. Willibrord established the Archdiocese of Utrecht and became bishop of the Frisians. However, his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in Dokkum, in 754."],"after":["The Frankish Carolingian empire – that had the Roman Empire as its example – would eventually include much of Western Europe, but got divided into three parts in 843. Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of Middle Francia; Flanders became part of West Francia. Situated between – and wanted by – the realms of West and East Francia, Middle Francia was a weak kingdom that comprised territories from Frisia in the north to the Kingdom of Italy in the south. Then, the middle kingdom was partitioned; the lands north of the Alps passed to Lothair II and consecutively were named Lotharingia. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, in Upper- and Lower Lotharingia. The latter part comprising of the Low Countries, that technically became part of East Francia in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 850, Lothair I acknowledged the Viking Rorik of Dorestad as ruler of most of Frisia.[46] Around 879, another Viking terrorised the Frisian lands. He became known as Godfrid, Duke of Frisia, but he was assassinated in 885, after which Gerolf of Holland assumed lordship in Frisia and Viking rule came to an end. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that lay the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into (semi-)independent states."]}}}
