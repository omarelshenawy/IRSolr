Following the defeat against the combined British-French-Russian fleet at the Battle of Navarino in 1827, Sultan Mahmud II gave priority to develop a strong and modern Ottoman naval force. The first steam ships of the Ottoman Navy were acquired in 1828. In 1829 the world's largest warship for many years, the 201 x 56 kadem (1 kadem = 37.887 cm) or 76.15 m × 21.22 m (249.8 ft × 69.6 ft) ship of the line Mahmudiye, which had 128 cannons on 3 decks and carried 1,280 sailors on board, was built for the Ottoman Navy at the Imperial Arsenal (Ottoman Empire) on the Golden Horn in Constantinople (kadem, which translates as \"foot\", is often misinterpreted as equivalent in length to one imperial foot, hence the wrongly converted dimensions of \"201 x 56 ft, or 62 x 17 m\" in some sources.)"]}}}
