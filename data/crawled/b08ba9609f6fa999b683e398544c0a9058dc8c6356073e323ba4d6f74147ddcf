Canadian oral histories describe a traditional stick-and-ball game played by the Mi'kmaq in eastern Canada, and Silas Tertius Rand (in his 1894 Legends of the Micmacs) describes a Mi'kmaq ball game known as tooadijik. Rand also describes a game played (probably after European contact) with hurleys, known as wolchamaadijik.[11] Sticks made by the Mi'kmaq were used by the British for their games."],"after":["Early 19th-century paintings depict shinney (or \"shinny\"), an early form of hockey with no standard rules which was played in Nova Scotia.[citation needed] Many of these early games absorbed the physical aggression of what the Mi'kmaq in Nova Scotia called dehuntshigwa'es (lacrosse). Shinney was played on the St. Lawrence River at Montreal and Quebec City, and in Kingston, Ontario[9] and Ottawa, Ontario. The number of players was often large. To this day, shinney (derived from \"shinty\") is a popular Canadian[12] term for an informal type of hockey, either ice or street hockey."]}}}
