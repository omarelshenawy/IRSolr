Plath returned to Newnham in October to begin her second year.[3] During this time, they both became deeply interested in astrology and the supernatural, using Ouija boards. In early 1957, Plath and Hughes moved to the United States and from September 1957 Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She found it difficult to both teach and have enough time and energy to write[15] and in the middle of 1958, the couple moved to Boston. Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evening took creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).[15] Both Lowell and Sexton encouraged Plath to write from her experience and she did so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive of herself as a more serious, focused poet and short-story writer.[3] At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend.[19] Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.[3]"],"after":["Plath and Hughes traveled across Canada and the United States, staying at the Yaddo artist colony in Saratoga Springs, New York State in late 1959. Plath says that it was here that she learned \"to be true to my own weirdnesses,\" but she remained anxious about writing confessionally, from deeply personal and private material.[3][20] The couple moved back to the United Kingdom in December 1959 and[21] lived in London at 3 Chalcot Square, near the Primrose Hill area of Regent's Park, where an English Heritage plaque records Plath's residence.[22] Their daughter Frieda was born on April 1, 1960 and in October, Plath published her first collection of poetry, The Colossus.[21] In February 1961, Plath's second pregnancy ended in miscarriage; several of her poems, including \"Parliament Hill Fields\", address this event.[23] In August she finished her semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar and immediately after this, the family moved to Court Green in the small market town of North Tawton in Devon. Nicholas was born in January 1962.[21] In mid-1962, Hughes began to keep bees, which would be the subject of many Plath poems.[3]"]}}}
