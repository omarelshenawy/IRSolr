They consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band, together with several other solo instruments (such as the piano, harpsichord, and organ). The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music[11] and includes members of the string, woodwind, brass, and percussion families of instruments. The concert band, another ensemble that plays classical music, consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. The concert band generally has a larger variety and a larger amount of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra, but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a double bass."],"after":["Electric instruments such as the electric guitar and the ondes Martenot appear occasionally in the classical music of the 20th and 21st centuries. Both classical and popular musicians have experimented in recent decades with electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, electric and digital techniques such as the use of sampled or computer-generated sounds, and the sounds of instruments from other cultures such as the gamelan."]}}}
