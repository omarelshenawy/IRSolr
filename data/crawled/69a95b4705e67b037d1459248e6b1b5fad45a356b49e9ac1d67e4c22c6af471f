So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.","The inverse square law is a differential equation. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line. See Kepler orbit."]}}}
