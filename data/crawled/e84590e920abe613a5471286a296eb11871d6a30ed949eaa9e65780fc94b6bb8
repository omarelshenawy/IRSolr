Nonetheless some pilots did become famous through press coverage,[2] making the British system for the recognition of successful fighter pilots much more informal and somewhat inconsistent. One pilot, Arthur Gould Lee, described his own score in a letter to his wife as \"Eleven, five by me solo — the rest shared\", adding that he was \"miles from being an ace\".[6] This shows that his No. 46 Squadron RAF counted shared kills, but separately from \"solo\" ones—one of a number of factors that seems to have varied from unit to unit. Also evident is that Lee considered a higher figure than five kills to be necessary for \"ace\" status. Aviation historians credit him as an ace with two enemy aircraft destroyed and five driven down out of control, for a total of seven victories.[7]"],"after":["Other Allied countries, such as France and Italy, fell somewhere in between the very strict German approach and the relatively casual British one. They usually demanded independent witnessing of the destruction of an aircraft, making confirmation of victories scored in enemy territory very difficult.[8] The Belgian crediting system sometimes included \"out of control\" to be counted as a victory.[9]"]}}}
