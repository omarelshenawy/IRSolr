The two official languages, English and Swahili, are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations. English is widely spoken in commerce, schooling and government.[97] Peri-urban and rural dwellers are less multilingual, with many in rural areas speaking only their native languages.[98] British English is primarily used in the country. Additionally, a distinct local dialect, Kenyan English, is used by some communities and individuals in the country, and contains features unique to it that were derived from local Bantu languages, such as Swahili and Kikuyu.[99] It has been developing since colonisation and also contains certain elements of American English. Sheng is a Swahili-based cant spoken in some urban areas. Primarily consisting of a mixture of Swahili and English, it is an example of linguistic code-switching.[100]"]}}}
