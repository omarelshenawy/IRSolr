The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.[77]"],"after":["In 2008 The Scientific World Journal published research in which women with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation in the area of the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method.[37] The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine.[80] Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.[78]"]}}}
