You can almost feel beads of sweat rolling off the title track and 'SexyBack' featuring Timbaland\".[28] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Timbaland, producer of the song, writing that Timbaland offers \"tougher, trickier rhythms, minimal live playing, a plethora of hip-hop cameos, and a self-consciously hard, edgy club sensibility\" to \"SexyBack\".[29] Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, \"The producer's angular synthesizer crunch is all over it â€“ at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back.'\"[30] PopMatters' contributor Quentin B. Huff wrote that \"SexyBack\" was the \"fraternal twin\" to Nelly Furtado's 2006 song \"Promiscuous\".[31] Andrew Murfett of The Age wrote that the song was a \"raunchy club banger that slyly suppresses\" Timberlake's customary falsetto. He continues, \"it's introduced a new phrase into the pop cultural lexicon\".[32] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday was complimentary towards the song, writing that it was \"Timberlake at his best, mainstreaming a combination of the wild, edgy dance-pop style of Basement Jaxx with Missy Elliott's more experimental hip-hop to create a boldly inventive sound that still pleases the masses.\"[33]"]}}}
