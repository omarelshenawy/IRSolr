The show premiered on August 11, 1991, on Nickelodeon as part of its Nicktoons block along with Rugrats and Doug. The series focuses on the titular characters: Ren HÃ¶ek, an emotionally unstable chihuahua, and Stimpson J. Cat, a good-natured, dimwitted cat. The show ran for five seasons on the network, received critical acclaim, and developed a cult following during and after its run. Some critics credit it along with The Simpsons for leading the way for satirical animated shows like Beavis and Butt-head and South Park, and for playing a significant role in television animation. Throughout its run, The Ren & Stimpy Show was controversial for its off-color humor, sexual innuendo, and violence which were rare for television animation of the time. This controversy contributed to the production staff's altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department. A spin-off for adult audiences, Ren & Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\", aired in 2003 on Spike, but was cancelled soon after its debut."]}}}
