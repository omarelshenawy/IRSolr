Michael Cragg of The Guardian wrote that \"Suit & Tie\" feels like the work of someone \"luxuriating in the fact they're making music again\" and not someone \"desperate to redefine pop in the face of its recent club-related slump\". He stated that the song is not a \"sound-redefining, statement-making, globe-conquering comeback single\" like \"SexyBack\" (2006) was, but \"more of a midway point\" between his previous singles \"Señorita\" and \"Summer Love\".[12] A reviewer from The Independent wrote that Timberlake appears to have \"gone up an octave\" since he last released new music. The reviewer also compared the song to \"Rock Your Body\" and \"SexyBack\".[18] Stephen Deusner of Pitchfork awarded the track their Best New Track tag, praising Timberlake's vocal performance and Timbaland's production by saying, \"Timbaland creates a smooth beat out of a marimba roll and harp glissando that Marvin Gaye must have left on the cutting-room floor, and Timberlake rides it with that fluid, effortless falsetto.\" Deusner, however, noted that the feature verse from Jay-Z is \"another in a string of uninspired cameos,\" but it couldn't \"sink the song’s slinky vibe.\"[19] Popjustice, in the same vein, claimed that the song was \"officially, and very disappointingly, mediocre\" and \"it could make a decent third single from an album, if they were struggling\".[20]"]}}}
