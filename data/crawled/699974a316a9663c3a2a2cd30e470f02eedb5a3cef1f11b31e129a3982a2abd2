The name Saskatoon comes from the Cree inanimate noun \"misâskwatômina,\" which refers to a sweet, violet-coloured berry that grows in the area. A long-time nickname for Saskatoon is \"Hub City\", while the name is also commonly abbreviated \"S'toon\". Following the release of the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, the city became popularly known as \"'Toontown\", after a similarly named location in the film, although the nickname \"'Toontown\" had been in use in Saskatoon prior to the film's release. Another, less commonly used nickname is \"POW City\". POW stands for Potash, Oil, and Wheat."]}}}
