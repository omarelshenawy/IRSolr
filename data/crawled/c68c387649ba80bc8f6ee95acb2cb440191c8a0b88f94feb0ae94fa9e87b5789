Truman thought that he would serve out his career in some well-paying sinecure at the county level. After four other men turned him down, Pendergast reluctantly backed Truman as a Democratic candidate for the 1934 U.S. Senate election for Missouri.[32] During the Democratic primary, Truman defeated two congressmen, John J. Cochran and Jacob L. Milligan, with the solid support of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy, as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official. Truman defeated the incumbent Republican Roscoe C. Patterson by nearly 20 percentage points.[32][33][34]"]}}}
