It is unique in having its original medieval face, showing a philosophical model of the pre-Copernican universe.[110] Above the clock is a set of figures, which hit the bells, and a set of jousting knights who revolve around a track every 15 minutes.[110][111] The clock was converted to pendulum and anchor escapement in the 17th century, and was installed in London's Science Museum in 1884, where it continues to operate.[111] Similar astronomical clocks, or horologes, can be seen at Exeter, Ottery St Mary, and Wimborne Minster."],"after":["One clock that has not survived to the present-day is that of the Abbey of St Albans, built by the 14th-century abbot Richard of Wallingford.[112] It may have been destroyed during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries, but the abbot's notes on its design have allowed a full-scale reconstruction. As well as keeping time, the astronomical clock could accurately predict lunar eclipses, and may have shown the Sun, Moon (age, phase, and node), stars and planets, as well as a wheel of fortune, and an indicator of the state of the tide at London Bridge.[113] According to Thomas Woods, \"a clock that equaled it in technological sophistication did not appear for at least two centuries\".[103][114] Giovanni de Dondi was another early mechanical clockmaker, whose clock did not survive, but has been replicated based on the designs. De Dondi's clock was a seven-faced construction with 107 moving parts, showing the positions of the Sun, Moon, and five planets, as well as religious feast days.[113] Around this period, mechanical clocks were introduced into abbeys and monasteries to mark important events and times, gradually replacing water clocks which had served the same purpose.[115][116]"]}}}
