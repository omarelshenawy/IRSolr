If over a region of the xy plane, the PDE is second-order in that region. This form is analogous to the equation for a conic section:"],"after":["More precisely, replacing âˆ‚x by X, and likewise for other variables (formally this is done by a Fourier transform), converts a constant-coefficient PDE into a polynomial of the same degree, with the top degree (a homogeneous polynomial, here a quadratic form) being most significant for the classification."]}}}
