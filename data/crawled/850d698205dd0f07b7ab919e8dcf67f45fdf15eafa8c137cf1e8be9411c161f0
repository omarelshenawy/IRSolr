This term is commonly used in New England, Appalachia, Ozarks, Arkansas and Missouri to describe such geographic features. In rural areas, it may be pronounced as \"holler\". Hollows may be formed by river valleys, such as Mansfield Hollow, or they may be relatively dry clefts with a notch-like characteristic in that they have a height of land and consequent water divide in their bases."],"after":["Rift valleys, such as the Albertine Rift, are formed by the expansion of the Earth's crust due to tectonic activity beneath the Earth's surface."]}}}
