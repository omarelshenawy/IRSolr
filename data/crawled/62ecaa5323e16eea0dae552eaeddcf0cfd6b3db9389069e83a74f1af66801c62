The album spawned the worldwide hit \"Angie\", but proved the first in a string of commercially successful but tepidly received studio albums.[106] The sessions for Goats Head Soup led to a number of outtakes, most notably an early version of the popular ballad \"Waiting on a Friend\", not released until Tattoo You eight years later.[107]"],"after":["The making of the record was interrupted by another legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France; a warrant for Richards' arrest had been issued, and the other band members had to return briefly to France for questioning.[108] This, along with Jagger's convictions on drug charges (in 1967 and 1970[109]), complicated the band's plans for their Pacific tour in early 1973: they were denied permission to play in Japan and almost banned from Australia. This was followed by a European tour (bypassing France) in September/October 1973 â€“ prior to which Richards had been arrested once more on drug charges, this time in England.[110]"]}}}
