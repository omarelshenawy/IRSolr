This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the comparative method in historical linguistics and in creolistics.[12][16][17]"],"after":["Because of social, political, and academic changes brought on by decolonization in the second half of the 20th century, creole languages have experienced revivals in the past few decades. They are increasingly being used in print and film, and in many cases, their community prestige has improved dramatically. In fact, some have been standardized, and are used in local schools and universities around the world.[12][13][18] At the same time, linguists have begun to come to the realization that creole languages are in no way inferior to other languages. They now use the term \"creole\" or \"creole language\" for any language suspected to have undergone creolization, terms that now imply no geographic restrictions nor ethnic prejudices."]}}}
