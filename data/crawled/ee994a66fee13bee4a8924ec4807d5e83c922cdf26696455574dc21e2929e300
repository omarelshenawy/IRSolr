The main areas military history includes are the history of wars, battles, and combats, history of the military art, and history of each specific military service."],"after":["Military strategy is in many ways the centerpiece of military science. It studies the specifics of planning for, and engaging in combat, and attempts to reduce the many factors to a set of principles that govern all interactions of the field of battle. In Europe these principles were first defined by Clausewitz in his Principles of War. As such, it directs the planning and execution of battles, operations, and wars as a whole. Two major systems prevail on the planet today. Broadly speaking, these may be described as the \"Western\" system, and the \"Russian\" system. Each system reflects and supports strengths and weakness in the underlying society."]}}}
