This Golden Age came to an end after the 1973 energy crisis. The failure of the Gierek government, both economically and politically, soon led to the creation of opposition in the form of trade unions, student groups, clandestine newspapers and publishers, imported books and newspapers, and even a \"flying university.\""],"after":["On 16 October 1978 the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, was elected Pope, taking the name John Paul II. The election of a Polish Pope had an electrifying effect on what had been, even under Communist rule, one of the most devoutly Catholic nations in Europe. Gierek is alleged to have said to his cabinet, 'O God, what are we going to do now?' or, as occasionally reported, \"Jesus and Mary, this is the end.\" When John Paul II made his first papal tour of Poland in June 1979, half a million people heard him speak in Warsaw. John Paul II did not call for rebellion, instead he encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next crisis came, the nation would present a united front."]}}}
