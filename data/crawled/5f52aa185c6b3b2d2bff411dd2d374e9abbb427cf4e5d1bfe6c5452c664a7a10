However, infringement upon books and other text works remains common, especially for educational reasons. Statistics regarding the effects of copyright infringement are difficult to determine. Studies have attempted to determine whether there is a monetary loss for industries affected by copyright infringement by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available.[50] Other reports indicate that copyright infringement does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry, and can have a positive effect.[51] In particular, a 2014 University study concluded that free music content, accessed on YouTube, does not necessarily hurt sales, instead has the potential to increase sales.[52]"],"after":[]}}}
