Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincaré, who would become the President of France, 1913 to 1920, and a fellow member of the Académie française.[7] He was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. However, he later on became an agnostic[8][9] and criticized religious dogmas particularly with respect to the mixing of theology and science.[10]"],"after":["During his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).","In 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in Nancy (now renamed the Lycée Henri Poincaré in his honour, along with the University of Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the concours général, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".[11] However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.[12] He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences."]}}}
