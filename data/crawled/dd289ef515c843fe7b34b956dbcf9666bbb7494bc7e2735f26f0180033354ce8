This was the advance guard for Strongbow's army and was to be the springboard for an assault on Waterford.[15] Raymond's force occupied an old promontory fort at Baginbun and plundered the surrounding countryside.[15] They were then besieged by a much larger force of Irish and Norse. The outnumbered Anglo-Normans drove a large herd of cattle into the opposing army.[16] In the ensuing havoc, the Normans routed the besiegers, killing up to 500 and capturing 70. These captives were then executed; the Normans broke their limbs before beheading them and throwing their bodies off the cliff.[16]"]}}}
