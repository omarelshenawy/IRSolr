For example, he expresses a subjectivistic idea when he says to Rosencrantz: \"there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so\".[75] The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek Sophists, who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses—and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive, things differently—there is no absolute truth, only relative truth.[76] The clearest alleged instance of existentialism is in the \"to be, or not to be\"[77] speech, where Hamlet is thought by some to use \"being\" to allude to life and action, and \"not being\" to death and inaction."]}}}
