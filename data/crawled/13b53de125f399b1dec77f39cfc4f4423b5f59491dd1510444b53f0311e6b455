Permission for building the synagogue came from the Dutch West India Company, with additional funding support from the Jewish community on Cura√ßao. Permission was conditional on the fact that the Jewish house of worship would be sited where \"the exercise of their (Jewish) religious duties would not molest those of the Gentiles\".[13] The building is located off a small lane called Synagogue Path, away from the main street. The synagogue attested to the wealth of the Jews of St. Eustatius and their influence on the island.[14]"]}}}
