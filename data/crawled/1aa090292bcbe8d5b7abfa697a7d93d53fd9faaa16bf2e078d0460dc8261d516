Brigham Young University also has an Applied and Computational Emphasis (ACME), a program that allows student to graduate with a Mathematics degree, with an emphasis in Applied Maths. Students in this program also learn another skill (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Pure Math, etc) to supplement their applied maths skills."],"after":["Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences."]}}}
