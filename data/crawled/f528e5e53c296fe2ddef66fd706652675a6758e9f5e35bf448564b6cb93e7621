Colbert's desk is in the shape of serifed C, standing for Colbert. On one wall, there is an artificial fireplace with the engraving \"Videri Quam Esse,\" meaning, \"to seem to be rather than to be\"; it is a play off of the traditional Latin phrase \"esse quam videri,\" or, \"to be, rather than to seem to be,\" reflecting Colbert's mock right-wing personality. Above this fireplace is a portrait of Colbert; it originally showed Colbert standing in front of the same mantel with another portrait of himself. On the show's first anniversary, the portrait was replaced by one of Colbert standing in front of the mantel with the first portrait above it; the original was auctioned off at a charity event[31] and currently hangs in the Sticky Fingers restaurant in Colbert's native Charleston, S.C.[32] Colbert stated that the portrait will be changed every year to add another level of depth. On October 17, 2007, the portrait was removed and replaced with a new one that followed an identical pattern, but changed Colbert's placement in the foreground."],"after":["On January 16, 2008, the \"three-deep\" Colbert portrait was placed on display \"right between the bathrooms near the 'America's Presidents' exhibit\" at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.[33] After first being rejected by the National Museum of American History, Colbert petitioned the Smithsonian to display his portrait, who agreed to \"go along with the joke\", though they stressed that it was only temporary. Colbert said \"I don't mean to brag, but as it contains three portraits, my portrait has more portraits than any other portrait in the National Portrait Gallery!\" The portrait was then put on display at the Smithsonian until April 13. On October 16, 2008, the three-deep portrait was officially donated to the permanent collection of the Smithsonian's American Treasures exhibit. In September 2009, the portrait was retired to the Smithsonian's collection. At the end of that show, a new 5-deep portrait was unveiled, with the newest Colbert holding his newly won Primetime Emmy Award with another Primetime Emmy Award and a Peabody by the mantle."]}}}
