In the years after her death, a number of celebrities decided to go public about their eating disorders, among them actress Tracey Gold[26] and Diana, Princess of Wales.[27] Medical centers and hospitals began receiving increased contact from people with these, and similar disorders.[citation needed] The general public had little knowledge of anorexia nervosa and bulimia prior to Carpenter's death, making the condition difficult to identify and treat.[3] Her family started the Karen A. Carpenter Memorial Foundation, which raised money for research on anorexia nervosa and eating disorders. Today the name of the organization has been changed to the Carpenter Family Foundation. In addition to eating disorders, the foundation now funds the arts, entertainment and education."]}}}
