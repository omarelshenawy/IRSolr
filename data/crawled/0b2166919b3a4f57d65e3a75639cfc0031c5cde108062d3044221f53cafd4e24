Such ideas go back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs (Greek-Latin for \"geometry of place\") and analysis situs (Greek-Latin for \"picking apart of place\"). The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed. By the middle of the 20th century, topology had become a major branch of mathematics."],"after":["See also: topology glossary for definitions of some of the terms used in topology, and topological space for a more technical treatment of the subject.",""]}}}
