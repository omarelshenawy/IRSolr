As Marius failed, Sulla – a legate of Marius at that time – went himself to Bocchus in a dangerous enterprise and convinced Bocchus to hand Jugurtha over to him. This was very provocative to Marius, since many of his enemies were encouraging Sulla to oppose Marius. Despite this, Marius was elected for five consecutive consulships from 104 to 100 BC, because Rome needed a military leader to defeat the Cimbri and the Teutones, who were threatening Rome."],"after":["After Marius's retirement, Rome had a brief peace, in which the Italian socii (\"allies\" in Latin) requested Roman citizenship and voting rights. The reformist Marcus Livius Drusus supported their legal process, but he was assassinated and the socii revolted against the Romans in the Social War. At one point both consuls were killed; Marius was appointed to command the army together with Lucius Julius Caesar and Sulla.[52]"]}}}
