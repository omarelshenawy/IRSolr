The country was ranked second in the United Nations 2011 Human Development Index and first in Legatum's 2008 Prosperity Index.[204] All of Australia's major cities fare well in global comparative livability surveys;[205] Melbourne reached top spot for the fourth year in a row on The Economist's 2014 list of the world's most liveable cities, followed by Adelaide, Sydney, and Perth in the fifth, seventh, and ninth places respectively.[206] Total government debt in Australia is about $190 billion[207] – 20% of GDP in 2010.[208] Australia has among the highest house prices and some of the highest household-debt levels in the world.[209]"],"after":["An emphasis on exporting commodities rather than manufactured goods has underpinned a significant increase in Australia's terms of trade since the start of the 21st century, due to rising commodity prices. Australia has a balance of payments that is more than 7% of GDP negative, and has had persistently large current account deficits for more than 50 years.[211] Australia has grown at an average annual rate of 3.6% for over 15 years, in comparison to the OECD annual average of 2.5%.[211] Australia was the only advanced economy not to experience a recession due to the global financial downturn in 2008–2009.[212] However, the economies of six of Australia's major trading partners have been in recession, which in turn has affected Australia, significantly hampering its economic growth in recent years.[213][214] From 2012 to early 2013, Australia's national economy grew, but some non-mining states and Australia's non-mining economy experienced a recession.[215][216][217]"]}}}
