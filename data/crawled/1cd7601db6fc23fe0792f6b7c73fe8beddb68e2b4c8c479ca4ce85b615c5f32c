Each zone is indicated by a letter Aâ€“H which is followed by a number based on a grid inside that zone. Each county also maintains any other roadway that is not a state trunkline or a city street. The numbering and signing practices vary from county to county, as does the size of each county's system. Numerical designations typically do not carry over from one county to the next; a CDH that crosses county lines keeps its designation in each county however. County road designations are typically abbreviated \"CR\" or \"Co Rd\" followed by the number, and CDHs are abbreviated to just their letter and number assignment."]}}}
