The dancer, Carlton Wilborn, recalled that this performance required a lot of rehearsal time, since the dance portrayed Madonna as a woman trying to find her religion. He explained: \"One side knew she needed it, another side was resistant, and our dance represented that battle inside.\"[53] At the end of the performance, Wilborn pushed down Madonna's head before pulling her back up again, thus portraying his role as the priest, trying to wake up Madonna to the importance of religion.[53] Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition â€“ Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990,[55] and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.[56]"]}}}
