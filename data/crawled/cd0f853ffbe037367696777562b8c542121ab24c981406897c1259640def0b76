If G is compact, one also obtains a Fourier series, which converges similarly to the [−π, π] case, but if G is noncompact, one obtains instead a Fourier integral. This generalization yields the usual Fourier transform when the underlying locally compact Abelian group is R."],"after":["This is called a partial sum. We would like to know, in which sense does fN(x) converge to f(x) as N → ∞."]}}}
