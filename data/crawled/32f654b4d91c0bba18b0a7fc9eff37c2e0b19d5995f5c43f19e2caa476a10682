Afrikaans originated from the Dutch language. The dialect became known as \"Cape Dutch\". Later, Afrikaans was sometimes also referred to as \"African Dutch\" or \"Kitchen Dutch\", although these terms were mainly pejorative. Afrikaans was considered a Dutch dialect until the late 19th century, when it began to be recognised as a distinct language, and it gained equal status with Dutch and English as an official language in South Africa in 1925. Dutch remained an official language until the new 1961 constitution finally stipulated the two official languages in South Africa to be Afrikaans and English (although, curiously, the 1961 constitution still had a sub-clause stipulating that the word \"Afrikaans\" was also meant to be referring to the Dutch language). It is the only Indo-European language of significance that underwent distinct development on the African continent."]}}}
