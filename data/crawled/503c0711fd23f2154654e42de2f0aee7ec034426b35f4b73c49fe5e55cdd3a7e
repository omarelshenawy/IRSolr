The knights, with the help of Spanish and Maltese forces were victorious and repelled the attack. Speaking of the battle Voltaire said, \"Nothing is better known than the siege of Malta.\"[63] After the siege they decided to increase Malta's fortifications, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of Valletta, named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established watchtowers along the coasts – the Wignacourt, Lascaris and De Redin towers – named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights' presence on the island saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of Città Vittoriosa, the construction of new cities including Città Rohan and Città Hompesch and the introduction of new academic and social resources."],"after":[]}}}
