What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in the privacy of their own homes. A person's cultural background as well as their religious teachings will have an impact on the way they view their own nudity, alone or in the presence of others, as well as viewing the nudity of others.
