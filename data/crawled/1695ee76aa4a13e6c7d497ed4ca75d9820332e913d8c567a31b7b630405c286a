An electric current flowing through this finger causes heating of the metals, one side expands less than the other, and an electrical contact on the end of the finger moves away from or towards an electrical switch contact. The most common use of this type is in the \"flasher\" units that flash turn signals in automobiles, and sometimes in Christmas lights. This is a non-electronic type of multivibrator."]}}}
