Holmes is the main character of the stories, and is near always partnered with Dr. Watson, who narrates the vast majority of stories. Holmes is based in 221b Baker Street, in London; where he works as the world's only consulting detective. Holmes first appeared in 1887, debuting in Beeton's Christmas Annual with \"A Study in Scarlet\", which held the first of his 60 stories, 56 short stories and 4 novels. Holmes narrates only 2 stories, leaving the other 58 to be narrated by his friend Dr. Watson. His last appearance was in \"The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\", with Watson, Doyle had previously tried to stop writing the novels with \"The Final Problem\", but was forced to continue, making Holmes miraculously survive due to massive public outrage."]}}}
