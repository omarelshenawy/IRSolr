The attendance included a Q&A session from Madonna and was intended to sell the film to distributors.[48] The rights were acquired by Optimum Releasing for the UK market, The Weinstein Company for the US release and Village Roadshow for Australia and New Zealand.[49][50] Weinstein promoted the film as Madonna's first full-length directorial venture, since her previous directed film, Filth and Wisdom, was considered a short film by them for its runtime of 81Â minutes.[50] Madonna had hoped to premiere the film at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, but could not do so since she was still making finishing touches to the soundtrack and there were three weeks more of post production to complete before the film was ready to be screened to an international audience. A representative for the film festival said that, \"[w]hile the movie's distributors will attend the festival, they will preview select cuts to buyers at private screenings instead of showing the entire feature.\"[51] The Daily Mail columnist Baz Bamingboye reported that W.E. would be premiered at the 2011 Venice Film Festival, where it would be screened out of the competition.[52][53] W.E. was shown at the festival on September 1, 2011, with Madonna attending the premiere, along with the principal cast.[54] Other film festivals where W.E was shown included the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival in the same month.[28][55] Along with the film festivals, still images from W.E. were released in the September 2011 issue of Vanity Fair magazine.[56]"]}}}
