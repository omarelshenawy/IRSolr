By itself, the island of Guernsey has a total area of 63.4 square kilometres (24.5 sq mi). Guernsey is situated 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of France's Normandy coast and 120 kilometres (75 mi) south of Weymouth, England and lies in the Gulf of St Malo. Lihou, a tidal island, is attached to Guernsey by a causeway at low tide. The terrain is mostly level with low hills in southwest.[14][15] The southeastern point is Jerbourg Point, used by the Germans during World War II. Elevation varies across the bailiwick from sea level to 114 m (374 ft) at Le Moulin on Sark. The highest point in mainland Guernsey is Hautnez (111 m (364 ft)), in Alderney at Le Rond But (101 m (331 ft)), in Jethou (76 m (249 ft)) and Herm (98 m (322 ft)).
