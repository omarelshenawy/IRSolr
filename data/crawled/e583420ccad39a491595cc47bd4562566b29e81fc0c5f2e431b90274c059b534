The lead says \"Fossil fuel divestment is the removal of investment assets ... from companies involved in extracting fossil fuels\". Disinvestment is in fact the sale of shares in these companies by one investor to other investors. The article does not explain how these sales affect financing costs for fossil fuel companies, and thus consumer prices. It is just a jumble of assertions, statistics and statements by TV personalities. Bianca Jagger? The subject is important and deserves an article that gives an informed and balanced view. This version reads like an incoherent polemic. Aymatth2 (talk) 02:01, 15 May 2015 (UTC)"]}}}
