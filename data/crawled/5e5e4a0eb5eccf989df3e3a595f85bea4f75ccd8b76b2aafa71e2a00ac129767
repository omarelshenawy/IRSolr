As they adopted language and culture so the barriers that existed between peoples, who had lived parallel lives, started to break down.[37] The archaeological evidence shows a lot of continuity in the system of landscape and local governance,[38] which was inherited from the indigenous community, and there is evidence for a fusion of culture in this early period.,[39] One of the elements is the Brythonic names that appear in the lists of Anglo-Saxon elite. The Wessex royal line was traditionally founded by a man named Cerdic, an undoubtedly Celtic name ultimately derived from Caratacus. This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton, and that his dynasty became anglicised over time.[40][41] A number of Cerdic's alleged descendants also possessed Celtic names, including the 'Bretwalda' Ceawlin.[42] The last occurrence of a British name in this dynasty being that of King Caedwalla, who died as late as 689.[43]"]}}}
