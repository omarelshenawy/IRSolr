A first preview of the song was added on the performance for \"Holiday\" on her 2009 leg of the Sticky & Sweet Tour. It was to be released to radio stations on August 3, 2009.[8] However, the single leaked on to the internet, so the date was changed to July 31, 2009. The digital download was also released on this date due to the leak.[51] Remixes of the song were released to dance clubs on July 24, 2009.[52] \"Celebration\" received mixed reviews from contemporary critics. The song reached the top of the charts in countries like Finland, Italy and Sweden, while reaching the top-ten in other European nations. It became Madonna's fifty-fifth entry to the Billboard Hot 100 and her fortieth number-one song on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.[53][54]"]}}}
