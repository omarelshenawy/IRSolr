Artists also sometimes move their lips at a faster speed from the track, to create videos with a slow-motion effect in the final clip, which is widely considered to be complex to achieve. Similarly, some artists have been known to lip-sync backwards for music videos such that, when reversed, the singer is seen to sing forwards while time appears to move backwards for his or her surroundings."],"after":["Michael Jackson's performance on the television special Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever (1983) changed the scope of live stage show. Ian Inglis, author of Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time (2006) notes the fact that \"Jackson lip-synced 'Billie Jean' is, in itself, not extraordinary, but the fact that it did not change the impact of the performance is extraordinary; whether the performance was live or lip-synced made no difference to the audience.\"[1] In 1989, a New York Times article claimed that \"Bananarama's recent concert at the Palladium\", the \"first song had a big beat, layered vocal harmonies and a dance move for every line of lyrics\", but \"the drum kit was untouched until five songs into the set, or that the backup vocals (and, it seemed, some of the lead vocals as well-a hybrid lead performance) were on tape along with the beat\". The article also claims that \"British band Depeche Mode, ...adds vocals and a few keyboard lines to taped backup onstage\" although this practice is common place in the genre of electric music.[2]"]}}}
