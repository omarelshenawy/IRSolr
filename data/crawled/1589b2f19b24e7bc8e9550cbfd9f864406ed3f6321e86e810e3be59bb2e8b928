Instead, they argue that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government. Reopen911.org says that the holes in the Pentagon walls were far too small to have been made by a Boeing 757: \"How does a plane 125 ft. wide and 155 ft. long fit into a hole which is only 60 ft. across?\" Meyssan’s book, L’Effroyable Imposture (published in English as 9/11: The Big Lie) became available in more than a dozen languages. When released, the book was heavily criticized by both the mainstream French and American press, and later, from within the 9/11 Truth movement by researchers such as Hoffman[101] and websites such as oilempire.us.[102] The French newspaper Liberation called the book \"a tissue of wild and irresponsible allegations, entirely without foundation.\"[103][104][105]"]}}}
