Ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, throat inflammation, chest pain, and congestion. Water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day, mostly due to contamination of drinking water by untreated sewage in developing countries. An estimated 500 million Indians have no access to a proper toilet,[39][40] Over ten million people in India fell ill with waterborne illnesses in 2013, and 1,535 people died, most of them children.[41] Nearly 500 million Chinese lack access to safe drinking water.[42] A 2010 analysis estimated that 1.2 million people died prematurely each year in China because of air pollution.[43] The WHO estimated in 2007 that air pollution causes half a million deaths per year in India.[44] Studies have estimated that the number of people killed annually in the United States could be over 50,000.[45]"]}}}
