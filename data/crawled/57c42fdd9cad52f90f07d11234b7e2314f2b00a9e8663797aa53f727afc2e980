This difference is mainly due to the heavy influence of Norman on English, and to Dutch patterns of word formation, such as the tendency to form long and sometimes very complicated compound nouns, being more similar to those of German and the Scandinavian languages. The Dutch vocabulary is one of the richest in the world and comprises at least 268,826 headwords.[100] In addition, the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (English: \"Dictionary of the Dutch Language\") is the largest dictionary in the world in print and has over 430,000 entries of Dutch words.[101]"]}}}
