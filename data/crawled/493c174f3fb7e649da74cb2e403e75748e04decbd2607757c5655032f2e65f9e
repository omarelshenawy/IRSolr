California based company Torrence All Access Staging and Productions handled the equipments required for the setup. Erik Eastland from the company was the overseer of the whole arrangement, having been associated with a number of high-profile shows like the Grammy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards. Around 70% of the workers were volunteers who had to undergo a screening test of six months to get the job, rest of them were regular employees from various stage vendors. The main stage was 120 feet (36.6Â m) long and modular, and was assembled by dismounting it from six big trucks. Additionally the crew also setup the lighting, video, special effects and audio equipments.[19]"]}}}
