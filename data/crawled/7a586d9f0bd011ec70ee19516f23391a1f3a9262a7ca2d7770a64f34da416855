Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.[193] The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker,[272] but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood's The Word (1872–1890, 1892–1893).[193] Free Society (1895–1897 as The Firebrand; 1897–1904 as Free Society) was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.[273] The publication advocated free love and women's rights, and critiqued \"Comstockery\" – censorship of sexual information. Also M. E. Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.[193]"]}}}
