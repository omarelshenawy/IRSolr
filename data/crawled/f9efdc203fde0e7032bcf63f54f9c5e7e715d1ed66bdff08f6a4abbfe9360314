In The Happy Land (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty.[146][147] In Pinafore, Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by \"never go[ing] to sea\".[117][148] In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in Pirates, and Ko-Ko in The Mikado, are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph \"always voted at [his] party's call\", he sacrificed his personal integrity.[149] The \"commercial middle class\" (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed.[150] In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl.[29] The Times wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a \"paternal\" Captain and the \"ethics ... of all romanticism\" are accepted \"unflinchingly\" and taken to their logical conclusion: \"It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out\".[150]"],"after":["A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks. In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Sorcerer, a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different social classes.[151] In Pinafore, the captain's daughter, Josephine, loves and is loved by a common sailor, but she dutifully tells him, \"your proffered love I haughtily reject\". He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with \"I am a British sailor, and I love you\". It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she. This is a parody of the Victorian \"equality\" drama, such as Lord Lytton's The Lady of Lyons (1838), where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech, ending with \"I am a peasant!\"[152] It then turns out that he has become her social superior. Furthermore, in Pinafore, Sir Joseph assures Josephine that \"love levels all ranks\". In Tom Taylor's The Serf, the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank, and she declares happily at the end that \"love levels all\".[152] In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical melodrama, Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are \"any man's equal\" (excepting his), and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor. Conversely, he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him \"dance a hornpipe on the cabin table\".[152] Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine \"becomes acceptable only through the absurd second-act revelation of Buttercup's inadvertent switching of the infants\" and concludes that Gilbert is a \"conservative satirist [who] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo ... [and] set out to show [that] love definitely does not level all ranks\".[137]"]}}}
