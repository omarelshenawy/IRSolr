A number of Douglas's works were exhibited at the Royal Academy and appeared in Academy Architecture.[133] Douglas's obituary in The British Architect referred to him as having \"achieved a reputation which has long placed him in the front rank of living architects\".[134] In the series The Buildings of England, Nikolaus Pevsner described him, without reservation, as \"the best Cheshire architect\".[135] In the companion series The Buildings of Wales: Clwyd, Hubbard expressed the opinion that he was \"the most important and active local architect of the period\".[136] Critical praise was not confined to Britain; Douglas's works were acclaimed by the French architect Paul SÃ©dille, and the German architect and writer Hermann Muthesius. Despite this, the only official recognition he received in his lifetime was a medal for Abbeystead House, which was shown at an exhibition in Paris.[137]"]}}}
