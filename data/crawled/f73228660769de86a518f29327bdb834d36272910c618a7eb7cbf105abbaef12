The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped. Roosevelt also served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 he convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.[98]"],"after":["During the Panic of 1907, nearly all agreed that a more flexible system to ensure liquidity was needed – the Republicans sought a response to the money supply through the bankers, whereas the Democrats sought government control; Roosevelt was unsure, but leaned towards the Republican view while continuing to denounce corporate corruption.[99] Nonetheless, in 1910, Roosevelt commented on \"enormously wealthy and economically powerful men\" and suggested \"a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes... increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate.\"[100][101]"]}}}
