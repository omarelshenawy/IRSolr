Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile ibija fish, acclimatised them to fresh water, and raised them in the Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable source of food. The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit.[9][10] The name \"Nauru\" may derive from the Nauruan word An√°oero, which means \"I go to the beach\".[11]"]}}}
