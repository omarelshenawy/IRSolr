These, named for the circle of fifths, consist of \"adjacent roots in ascending fourth or descending fifth relationship\"â€”for instance, the sequence vi - ii - V - I ascends with each successive chord to one a fourth above the previous. Such a motion, based upon close harmonic relations, offers \"undoubtedly the most common and the strongest of all harmonic progressions\".[14] The succession of cadences gives an impression of inevitable return to the key-note of the piece."]}}}
