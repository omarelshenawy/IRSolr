These highways are completely owned and maintained by the state. Michigan highways are properly referred to using the M and never as \"Route 28\" or \"Highway 115\", but as M-28 or M-115. The marker used for state trunklines is a diamond with a block-letter \"M\" at the top. Roads that are maintained by the state but not assigned a state trunkline designation carry an unsigned highway designation."]}}}
