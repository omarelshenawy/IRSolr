In 1982 Madonna signed a recording contract with Sire Records, a label owned by Warner Bros. Records, and released her first two singles before launching her eponymous debut album. Madonna's first music video was for the single \"Everybody\", for which Sire Records created a low budget, in-house video. Her first video to receive attention on MTV was \"Borderline\" which was followed by \"Lucky Star\". In 1984 Madonna released \"Like a Virgin\", the lead single from her sophomore album of the same name. The video portrayed Madonna roaming through the streets of Venice and lying in a white wedding dress. The same year she also released the follow-up single, \"Material Girl\". Madonna's third studio album, True Blue, was released in 1986. The video for the lead single, \"Live to Tell\", ushered in a new image for Madonna. With the video of \"True Blue\", Madonna's impact on MTV and popular music was established when a contest entitled Making My Video, was held to create a music video for the song. \"La Isla Bonita\" and \"Who's That Girl\", both released in 1987, portrayed Madonna's fascination with Hispanic culture and the inclusion of religious symbolism. In 1989 Madonna signed a $5Â million deal with Pepsi to use her song \"Like a Prayer\" in one of their commercial advertisements."]}}}
