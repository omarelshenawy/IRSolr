It was created on 1 December 1941 by Administrative Order 9, with Major General John F. Curry as the first CAP national commander. Civil Air Patrol is credited with sinking at least two German U-boats during World War II. Today, CAP is no longer called on to destroy submarines, but is instead is dedicated to education and national service. It is a volunteer organization with a strongly aviation-minded membership. It performs four key missions: emergency services (including search and rescue), aerospace education for youth and the general public, cadet programs, and homeland security."]}}}
