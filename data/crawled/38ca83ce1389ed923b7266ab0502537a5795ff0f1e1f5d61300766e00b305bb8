Turnpike trusts collected tolls from road users and used the proceeds to maintain the highway. There was a toll booth on the Sale side of Crossford Bridge. Another section of road between Altrincham and Crossford Bridge was turnpiked in 1765.[131] The commencement of \"swift packet\" services on the newly opened Bridgewater Canal in 1776 made commuting from Sale into Manchester both practical and convenient, with boats travelling at a relatively swift 10 mph (16 km/h).[132] However the arrival in 1849 of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway[25] sounded a death-knell for both the canal packet services and turnpike trusts. Many trusts went into terminal decline, mirroring a national trend. By 1888 almost all roads and highways were the responsibility of the local authority.[131] Sale's railway station, originally named Sale Moor,[25] was renamed to Sale in 1856.[133] Three years later Brooklands railway station was opened, followed in 1931 by the opening of Dane Road railway station along with the electrification of the entire line.[134] The line was renovated in the early 1990s and is now part of the Metrolink.[134]"]}}}
