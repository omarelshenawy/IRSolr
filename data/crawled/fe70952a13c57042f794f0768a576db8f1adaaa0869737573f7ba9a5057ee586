In addition to this procedure, which he called \"free association\", Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of repression which underlay symptom formation. By 1896, Freud had abandoned hypnosis and was using the term \"psychoanalysis\" to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based.[36]"],"after":["Freud's development of these new theories took place during a period in which he experienced heart irregularities, disturbing dreams and periods of depression, a \"neurasthenia\" which he linked to the death of his father in 1896[37] and which prompted a \"self-analysis\" of his own dreams and memories of childhood. His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his motherâ€™s affections led him to a fundamental revision of his theory of the origin of the neuroses."]}}}
