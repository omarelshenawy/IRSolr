The length of this tail can range from a few inches, known as a \"stumpy\", to being completely nonexistent, or \"rumpy\". Manx cats display a range of colours and usually have somewhat longer hind legs compared to most cats. The cats have been used as a symbol of the Isle of Man on coins and stamps and at one time the Manx government operated a breeding centre to ensure the continuation of the breed.[108]"]}}}
