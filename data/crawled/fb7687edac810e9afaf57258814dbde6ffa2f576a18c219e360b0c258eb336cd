Both volumes were published by Engels after Marx's death.[134] Volume II of Capital was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital.[172] Volume III of Capital was published a year later in October 1894 under the name Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole.[173] Theories of Surplus Value was developed from the Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863 which comprise Volumes 30, 31 32 and 33 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels and from the Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1864 which comprises Volume 34 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels. The exact part of the Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863 which makes up the Theories of Surplus Value are the last part of Volume 30 of the Collected Works,[174] the whole of Volume 31 of the Collected Works,[175] and the whole of Volume 32 of the Collected Works.[176] A German language abridged edition of Theories of Surplus Value was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London. However, the complete unabridged edition of Theories of Surplus Value was published as the \"fourth volume\" of Capital in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.[177]"],"after":["During the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.[134] He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His Critique of the Gotha Programme opposed the tendency of his followers Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel to compromise with the state socialism of Ferdinand Lassalle in the interests of a united socialist party.[134] This work is also notable for another famous Marx's quote: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\"[178]"]}}}
