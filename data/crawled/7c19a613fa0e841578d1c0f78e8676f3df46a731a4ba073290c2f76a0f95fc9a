She eventually settled in Encino, California where she lived until 1982. She then returned to the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan to be close to her ailing father and siblings. Franklin maintains a residence there to this day. Following an incident in 1984, she has cited a fear of flying that has prevented her from traveling overseas; she has performed only in North America since then.[35] The mother of four sons, her first child, Clarence was born just after Franklin turned 14.[36] Neither son's father has been identified. While pursuing her career and \"hanging out with [friends]\", Franklin's grandmother Rachel and sister Erma took turns raising the children.[37] Franklin's third child, Ted White, Jr., was born in 1964 and is known professionally as Teddy Richards. He has provided guitar backing for his mother's band during live concerts.[38]"]}}}
