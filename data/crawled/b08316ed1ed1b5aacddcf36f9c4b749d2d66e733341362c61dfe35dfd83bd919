The university participates in NCAA Division I (Division I-A for football) as a member of the Mid-American Conference and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association for ice hockey. BGSU is one of only 13 universities in the country offering NCAA division I-A football, division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I ice hockey.[123] The Falcons' main rivals are the Rockets of the University of Toledo. Separated by just 20 miles (32Â km) on Interstate 75, the two schools celebrate a heated rivalry in several sports.[124] The most well-known of these games is the Battle of I-75, a football game held each year in which the winner takes home the Peace Pipe, a Native American peace pipe placed upon a wood tablet.[125] The university sponsors 18 athletic teams: baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross county, football, men's and women's golf, women's gymnastics, men's ice hockey, men's and women's soccer, softball, women's swimming, women's tennis, women's track and field, and women's volleyball.[126]"]}}}
