The ability to solve The Telegraph's crossword in under 12 minutes was considered a recruitment test. The newspaper was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which each of the successful participants was contacted and asked if they would be prepared to undertake \"a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort\". The competition itself was won by F H W Hawes of Dagenham who finished the crossword in less than eight minutes.[13]"],"after":[]}}}
