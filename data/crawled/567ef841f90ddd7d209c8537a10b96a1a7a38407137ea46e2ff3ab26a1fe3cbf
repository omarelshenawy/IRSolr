Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since at least the 19th century.[62][63] Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.[64]"]}}}
