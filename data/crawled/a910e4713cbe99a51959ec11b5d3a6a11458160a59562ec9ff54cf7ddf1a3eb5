With 900 ccm, his cranial capacity was smaller than that of later H. erectus specimens. He had human teeth with large canines.[8] Judging from anatomical and archeological aspects as well as Java Man's ecological role, meat from vertebrates was likely an important part of their diet. Java Man, like other Homo erectus, was probably a rare species.[58] There is evidence that Java Man used shell tools to cut meat.[59]"]}}}
