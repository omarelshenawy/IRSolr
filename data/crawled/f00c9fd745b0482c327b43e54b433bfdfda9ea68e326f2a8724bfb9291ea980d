The Greeks considerably advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system.[27] Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer.[28] The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets.[28]"]}}}
