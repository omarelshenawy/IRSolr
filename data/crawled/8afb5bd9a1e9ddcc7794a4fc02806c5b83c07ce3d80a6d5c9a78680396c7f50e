Each article is on one topic (rather than a word and its definition, which belong, if at all, in Wikimedia's dictionary project called Wiktionary). The goal of a Wikipedia article is to create a comprehensive and neutrally-written summary of existing mainstream knowledge about a topic. Accordingly, Wikipedia does not publish original research. An encyclopedia is, by its nature, a tertiary source that provides a survey of information already the subject of publication in the wider world. Accordingly, and because Wikipedia is open to editing by anyone, we require that information be verifiable in reliable sources. Ideally all information should be actually cited to reliable sources to evidence it is verifiable. However, we only mandate citations for quotations, and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged. Sourcing requirements are significantly stricter in articles on living persons. Please note though that we strongly discourage people from writing about themselves, their friends, bands, websites, companies or organizations, pet projects, personal vendettas, campaigns and any other topic in which they have a conflict of interest."]}}}
