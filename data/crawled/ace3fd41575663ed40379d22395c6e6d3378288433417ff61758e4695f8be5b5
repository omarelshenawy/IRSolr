Believers demonstrate submission to God by serving God, following his commands, and rejecting polytheism. The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Qur'an. In some verses, there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal conviction: \"Whomsoever God desires to guide, He opens his heart to Islam.\"[22]"]}}}
