This represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast New England; similar glacial formations make up Long Island in New York and Block Island in Rhode Island. Together, these formations are known as the Outer Lands, or more obscurely as the \"Isles of Stirling\". Geologically speaking, Cape Cod is quite young, having been laid down some 16,000 to 20,000 years ago."]}}}
