The song was to be included as the final performance in the set list, but \"Holiday\" was chosen instead and \"Die Another Day\" was included in the third segment of the show.[73] Wearing a circus-themed corset designed by Chanel, she and her dancers performed a Tango-like choreography to the song, while backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed.[74][75] The performance was received favorably by Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe, who explained that \"the abstract ballroom choreography of 'Die Another Day' was an elegant antidote to the rote gyrations favored by the next generation of pop stars.\"[76] Towards the end of the performance, Madonna's dancers tied the singer on an electric chair and as it was raised high above the stage, she started singing \"Lament\" from Evita.[77] The performance of \"Die Another Day\" was included on Madonna's documentary live album I'm Going to Tell You a Secret (2006), which chronicled the tour.[78]"]}}}
