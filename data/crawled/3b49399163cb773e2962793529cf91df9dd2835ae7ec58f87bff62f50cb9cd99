The first eight seasons of Scrubs were filmed on location at the North Hollywood Medical Center, a decommissioned hospital located at 12629 Riverside Drive in North Hollywood, but the location of Sacred Heart Hospital within the fictional world of Scrubs is left ambiguous. Cast and crew on the show refer to the location as \"San DiFrangeles\"—a portmanteau of San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles that is meant to encompass a large part of California.[14] In season 4's episode 9, \"My Malpractice Decision\", Turk's new phone number has the Sacramento Area code 916. For the ninth season the show moved to Culver Studios.[15] The building used for the exteriors of the new Sacred Heart Hospital is located at the intersection of Ince Boulevard and Lindblade Street in Culver City, California (34°01′26″N 118°23′29″W﻿ / ﻿34.023988°N 118.391414°W﻿ / 34.023988; -118.391414).[16]"]}}}
