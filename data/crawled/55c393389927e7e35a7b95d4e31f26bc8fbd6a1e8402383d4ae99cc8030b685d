Wilson's single \"Lonely Teardrops\", written by Gordy, became a huge success; but Gordy did not feel he made as much money as he deserved from this and other singles he wrote for Wilson. He realized that the more lucrative end of the business was in producing records and owning the publishing."],"after":["In 1959, Billy Davis and Berry Gordy's sisters Gwen and Anna started Anna Records. Davis and Gwen Gordy wanted Berry to be the company president, but Berry wanted to strike out on his own. On January 12, 1959, he started Tamla Records, with an $800 loan from his family and from royalties earned writing for Jackie Wilson. Gordy originally wanted to name the label \"Tammy\" Records, after the hit song popularized by Debbie Reynolds from the 1957 film Tammy and the Bachelor in which Reynolds also starred. When he found the name was already in use, Berry decided on Tamla instead. Tamla's first release, in the Detroit area, was Marv Johnson's \"Come to Me\" in 1959 (released nationally on United Artists). Its first hit was Barrett Strong's \"Money (That's What I Want)\" (1959), which made it to number 2 on the Billboard R&B charts (released nationally on Anna Records)."]}}}
