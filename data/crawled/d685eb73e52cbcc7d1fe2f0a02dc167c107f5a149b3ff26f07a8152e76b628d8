Brand later faced criticism for his swipes at the trio. He confirmed his apology at the MTV Video Music Awards 2009 by saying \"I upset the Jonas Brothers last year, I had to say sorry to them and they forgave me. They had to, they're Christians.\" During her introduction of T.I. and Rihanna's performance, Jordin Sparks, who also wears a purity ring, defended the Jonas Brothers by saying \"It's not bad to wear a promise ring because not everybody, guy or girl, wants to be a slut.\" Sparks was in turn criticized for implying that those who do not wear purity rings or do not abstain are promiscuous.[71]"],"after":["2009: At the 2009 Video Music Awards, country singer Taylor Swift won Best Female video for \"You Belong with Me.\" During her acceptance speech, rapper Kanye West unexpectedly showed up on stage. Taking the microphone from Swift, he announced \"Yo Tay, I'm really happy for you, and Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!\"[72][73] MTV cut away from the stage (showing Beyoncé with an embarrassed look) after West gave the microphone back to Swift and giving the middle finger to the audience as they started booing him off stage, and so Swift did not finish her speech. West was removed for the rest of the show. However, when Beyoncé won Video of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),\" she called Swift back on stage to \"have her moment\" (finishing her speech from winning Best Female Video). In an off-the-record portion of an interview the following day, President Barack Obama called West a \"jackass\" for his antics.[74] During a post-interview, Jay-Z admitted West was wrong to go on stage, but he thought people were overreacting to the incident.[75]"]}}}
