These are called \"self posts\" or \"text submissions\". Many discussion-based subreddits allow only text-only submissions such as \"AskReddit\" â€“ where users are only allowed to pose broad, discussion based questions to the community at large. Self posts do not accumulate karma points for the submitter, but they can still be voted on like other content."],"after":["Reddit communities occasionally coordinate reddit-external projects such as skewing polls on other websites, such as in 2007 when Greenpeace allowed web users to decide the name of a killer whale it was tracking. Reddit users voted en masse to name the whale \"Mr. Splashy Pants\", and Reddit administrators further encouraged this by changing the site logo to a whale during the voting. In December of that year, Mister Splashy Pants was announced as the winner of the competition.[19]"]}}}
