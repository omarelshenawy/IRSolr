The Mayor is elected at large, and is the presiding member of the City Council, although he does not cast a vote except in a few instances.[88] The City Council appoints and confirms (which the mayor does cast a vote[88]) both the City Attorney and the City Manager.[89] The City Manager, in turn, appoints (does not require confirmation from the City Council) the Finance Director, City Clerk, and Deputy City Clerk.[90] In addition to these positions, Bakersfield also has several departments, used to provide the services necessary to the city. They are: Department of Development Services, Department of Economic and Community Development, Fire Department, Police Department, Department of Public Works, Department of Recreation and Parks, and Department of Water Resources."]}}}
