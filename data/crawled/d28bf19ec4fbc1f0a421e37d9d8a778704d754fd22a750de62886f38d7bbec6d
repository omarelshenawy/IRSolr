To get around these problems we give the general definition of the Lie algebra of a Lie group (in 4 steps):"],"after":["This Lie algebra is finite-dimensional and it has the same dimension as the manifold G. The Lie algebra of G determines G up to \"local isomorphism\", where two Lie groups are called locally isomorphic if they look the same near the identity element. Problems about Lie groups are often solved by first solving the corresponding problem for the Lie algebras, and the result for groups then usually follows easily. For example, simple Lie groups are usually classified by first classifying the corresponding Lie algebras."]}}}
