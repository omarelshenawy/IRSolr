The intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even Juan Per贸n himself. Fraser and Navarro write that the wide support Evita's proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that Evita had become as important to members of the Peronist party as Juan Per贸n himself was.[41]"],"after":["On 22 August 1951, the unions held a mass rally of two million people called \"Cabildo Abierto.\" (The name \"Cabildo Abierto\" was a reference and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the May Revolution, in 1810.) The Per贸ns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding set up on the Avenida 9 de Julio, several blocks away from the Casa Rosada, the official government house of Argentina. Overhead were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Per贸n. It has been claimed that \"Cabildo Abierto\" was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure.[16]"]}}}
