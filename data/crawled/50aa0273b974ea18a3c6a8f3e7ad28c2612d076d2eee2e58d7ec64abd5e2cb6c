The book contributed a number of sayings to the Russian language, for example, \"Manuscripts don't burn\" and \"second-grade freshness\". A destroyed manuscript of the Master is an important element of the plot. Bulgakov had to rewrite the novel from memory after he burned the draft manuscript[citation needed]."]}}}
