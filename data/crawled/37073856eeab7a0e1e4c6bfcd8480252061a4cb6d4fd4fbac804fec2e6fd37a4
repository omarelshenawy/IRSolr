As a result, much of the material transmitted in those journals relates to economic theory, and \"economic theory itself has been continuously more abstract and mathematical.\"[116] A subjective assessment of mathematical techniques[117] employed in these core journals showed a decrease in articles that use neither geometric representations nor mathematical notation from 95% in 1892 to 5.3% in 1990.[118] A 2007 survey of ten of the top economic journals finds that onlyÂ 5.8% of the articles published in 2003 and 2004 both lacked statistical analysis of data and lacked displayed mathematical expressions that were indexed with numbers at the margin of the page.[119]"]}}}
