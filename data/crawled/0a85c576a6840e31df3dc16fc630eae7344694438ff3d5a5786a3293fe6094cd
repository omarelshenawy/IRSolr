The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by the Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest point.[132] Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island, the Chatham Islands, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf),[133] d'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds)[134] and Waiheke Island (about 22 km (14 mi) from central Auckland).[135] The country's islands lie between latitudes 29° and 53°S, and longitudes 165° and 176°E."]}}}
