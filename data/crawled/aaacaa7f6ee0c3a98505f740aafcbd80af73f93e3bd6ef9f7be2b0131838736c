The original taglines of the channel were \"You'll never look at music the same way again,\" and \"On cable. In stereo.\" Although the original MTV channel no longer plays music videos 24/7, several of its spin-off channels do, including MTV Hits and MTV Jams. In addition, viewers can play music videos on-demand at MTV.com. MTV continues to support a broad selection of music videos on its international channels as well."],"after":[]}}}
