Originally scheduled to perform in twelve major markets in North America with additional stops in Paris and London, the demand for tickets became so high that in New York City after two Madison Square Garden dates sold out in record time, Madonna's manager Caresse Henry, and the worldwide tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment, decided to add new dates to the tour.[28] Within the first five days the tour was a sell-out for the dates at Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Toronto, Philadelphia and Miami. High-priced ticket packages for all dates on the tour were sold from Madonna's tour website Madonnaviptickets.com. The tickets were priced at $700 ($874 in 2015 dollars[1]) per person.[29] MTV arranged for an on-air contest titled Front and Center With Madonna Contest where fans were able to win tickets to an onstage area at any of the scheduled shows.[30] After the tour started, mid-year it was announced that the tour has grossed US $44.9 million ($56.06 million in 2015 dollars[1]), from the selling of 258,000 tickets at an average price of $174.17. Her average gross per show was US $6.414 million ($8.01 million in 2015 dollars[1]) with still more than half the dates being left.[31]"]}}}
