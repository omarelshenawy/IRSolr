By 1860 it was estimated at 50,000. The Māori population had declined to 37,520 in the 1871 census, although Te Rangi Hīroa (Sir Peter Buck) believed this figure was too low.[52] The figure was 42,113 in the 1896 census, by which time Europeans numbered more than 700,000.[53] Professor Ian Poole noticed that as late as 1890 40% of all female children were dead before they were one, a much higher rate than for males.[54]"]}}}
