The name changed to Kettle Donuts in 1949 and the now corporate name Dunkin' Donuts was adopted in 1950.[9] Rosenberg conceived of the idea for the chain after his experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where doughnuts and coffee were the two most popular items.[3] Rosenberg sold franchises of Dunkin' Donuts to others as early as 1955. In 1959, the company began growing, which led Rosenberg to lobby for Dunkin' Donuts at the International Franchise Association. On September 20, 2002, Rosenberg died from bladder cancer at the age of 86 in Mashpee, Massachusetts.[3]"]}}}
