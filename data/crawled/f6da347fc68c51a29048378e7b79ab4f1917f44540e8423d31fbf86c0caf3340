It connects the interchange of Interstate 5 (I-5) and SR 22 near downtown Orange, locally known as the Orange Crush, to the Glendora Curve interchange with I-210 and SR 210 in Glendora. The highway provides a route across several spurs of the Peninsular Ranges, linking the Los Angeles Basin with the Pomona Valley and San Gabriel Valley. An oiled-dirt predecessor to this road ran through Brea Canyon by the late 1910s; it was paved in concrete in 1923 and added to the state highway system in 1931. The freeway, including the Brea Canyon Freeway segment, was built in stages during the 1950s, becoming SR 57 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the mid 1970s. The last piece of SR 57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR 210 was extended to San Bernardino in 1998. An unconstructed extension of SR 57 from Santa Ana south to Huntington Beach has been studied as a proposed toll road above the Santa Ana River. (Full article...)"]}}}
