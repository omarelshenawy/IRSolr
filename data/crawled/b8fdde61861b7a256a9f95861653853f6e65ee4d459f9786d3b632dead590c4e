Archimedes is said to have used a primitive version that could predict the positions of the sun, the moon, and the planets. On May 17, 1902, an archaeologist named Valerios Stais discovered a lump of oxidated material with in it a mechanism with cogwheels that had been recovered from a shipwreck near Antikythera. This mechanism, known as the Antikythera mechanism, was recently redated between [150 to 100 BC].[1] Extensive study of the fragments, using X-rays, have revealed enough details (gears, pinions, crank) to enable researchers to build partial replicas.[2][3][4] Engraved on the major gears are the names of the planets (such as Venus), which leaves little doubt as to the intended use of the mechanism."]}}}
