Accompanying musicians performing with Madonna were; Mirwais Ahmadzaï on guitar and longtime backing singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory.[41] During the performance of New York, she wore a black tank top with \"Britney Spears\" written on it, along with cowboy hats and boots.[40][41] The costumes for the show and the set was designed by Dolce & Gabbana. Roseland's secondary stage was used for the performance and was decked as a neo-Western wonderland, with bales of hay, yellow-lit horseshoes and silver cacti throughout the lobby and entrance.[42] Dancers dressed as cowboys vogued during the pre-show in provocative poses, lassoing each other and skating around the passersby.[42] The stage was draped in an American flag. As the music started, the flag lifted to reveal a white Ford pickup truck from which Madonna emerged, singing \"Impressive Instant\".[40] Bare-chested male dancers encircled her, as she posed on the hood of the truck and danced through the song.[40] The vocoder effects on Madonna's voice was removed for the live performance, which Jennifer Vineyard from Rolling Stone felt made the singer's vocals sound \"less ridiculous\".[42] By the end of the performance, she as transported onto the main stage of Roseland, with the help of the audience member's hands.[40] A similar performance was done at Brixton Academy; Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes' names printed on it.[43] Around 3,000 fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet.[41] More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer.[41] It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of \"50s rock and roll classics\" at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.[41][44]"],"after":["When Madonna embarked on her Drowned World Tour in 2001, \"Impressive Instant\" was added as the second song in the setlist.[45][46] The costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and had varied accessories like spiked dog collars, Swarovski crystal-encrusted bracelets and tattered tops. Michael Schimdt was responsible for the accessroies; he was sought out by Madonna and her stylist Arianne Phillips, to help with finishing touches for many of the outfits.[47] Madonna opened the show with the punk section, wearing tattered black garments and a tartan kilt and belting out the first song, \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\".[48][49] As the song ended, Madonna started with \"Impressive Instant\", accompanied by her dancers waering gas masks and encased in rolls of black mesh, chasing the singer around the stage.[50][51] In the middle of the song, she was carried around by her dancers.[52] According to Stuart Lenig, author of the book The Twisted Tale of Glam Rock, Madonna merged choreography with narrative in the performance, as she and her dancers crossed the stage.[53] The 1984-style robotic movements denoted fascism with the dancers stalking and then trying to grope Madonna; in the end one dancer dressed as a robot grabbed a big hosepipe and thrust it between Madonna's legs, as it emitted fog towards the audience.[53][54] Lenig deduced that this could denote both an act of achieving orgasm or urination towards the crowd.[53] Santiago Fouz-Hernández, one of the authors of the book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, found similarities with Madonna's exploration of lesbian cultural references from her earlier works, with the performance of \"Impressive Instant\".[55] The placement of the fogging machine between Madonna's legs were seen as symbols for the phallus and ejaculation, and was deduced as an example of the singer's insistence on masculinity as \"performance\".[55] The dancers ultimately get subdued by Madonna, who finish off singing the song and takes up a Gibson Les Paul electric guitar to perform the next track, \"Candy Perfume Girl\".[56]"]}}}
