The church reports approximately 250,000 members in 50 nations. Community of Christ is part of the Latter Day Saint movement begun by Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830, and reorganized on April 6, 1860, following the death of Smith in 1844. It is rooted in Restorationist traditions. Although in some respects the Community of Christ is congruent with mainline Protestant Christian attitudes, it is in many ways theologically distinct, continuing such features as prophetic revelation. It is the second-largest denomination within the Latter Day Saint movement. Community of Christ follows a largely non-liturgical tradition based loosely on the Revised Common Lectionary. From its headquarters in Independence, Missouri, the church offers a special focus on evangelism, peace and justice ministries, spirituality and wholeness, youth ministries and outreach ministries. Church teachings emphasize that \"all are called\" as \"persons of worth\" to \"share the peace of Christ\"."]}}}
