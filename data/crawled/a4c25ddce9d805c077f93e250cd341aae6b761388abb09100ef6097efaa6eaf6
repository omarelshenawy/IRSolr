[...] There's an awful lot going on in the busy dance track [...] but the trade-off chorus between Madge and Justin of 'We've only got four minutes to save the world' is hooky enough unto itself to sell the song.\" He added that the song \"qualifies as an event record between superpowers [Madonna and Timberlake] who not only share equal billing, but sound gangbusters together.\"[10] Mark Savage of BBC described the sound as \"so futuristic it could realistically have been beamed in from the end of the world.\"[14] Andy Gill of The Independent called \"4 Minutes\" one of Hard Candy‍ '​s saviors. He noted that \"the Mardi Gras marching-band bumping rambunctiously along,\" is one of the album's \"most ambitious offerings.\"[15] Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle compared the track to the work of Nelly Furtado and felt that the composition was \"a bid for radio play.\"[16]"]}}}
