In March 2002, a remix compilation titled This Is the Remix was released to win fans over before a new studio album would be released.[32] The remix album reached number 29 in the United States.[14] The lead single \"Survivor\" was by some interpreted as a response to the strife between the band members, although Knowles claimed it was not directed at anybody. Seeing it as a breach of the agreement that barred each party from public disparagement, Roberson and Luckett once again filed a lawsuit against Destiny's Child and Sony Music, shortly following the release of This Is the Remix.
