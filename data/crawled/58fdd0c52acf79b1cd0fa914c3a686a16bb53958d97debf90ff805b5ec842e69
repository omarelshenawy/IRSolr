They are discontinuously distributed from the Atlantic to the Siwa oasis, in Egypt, and from the Mediterranean to the Niger River. Historically they spoke various Berber languages, which together form a branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. Today many of them speak Arabic and also French in the Maghreb, due to the French colonization of the Maghreb, and especially Spanish in Morocco. Today most Berber-speaking people live in Morocco and Algeria, becoming generally scarcer eastward through the rest of the Maghreb and beyond. The largest concentration of Berbers (about 85% of them) is found in Morocco."]}}}
