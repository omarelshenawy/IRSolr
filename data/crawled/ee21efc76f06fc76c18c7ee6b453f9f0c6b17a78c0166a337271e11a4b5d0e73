Her politically inspired art became recognized while she exhibited and published several of her brightly coloured stencils and paintings portraying the tiger, a symbol of Tamil nationalism, ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urban Britain in the early 2000s. Lyrics on Arular regarding her experiences of identity politics, poverty, revolution, gender and sexual stereotypes, war, and the conditions of working class in London were hailed as new and unorthodox, setting her apart from previous artists.[24][36] The album references the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Tamil independence movements and features culture jamming, multi-lingual slang, strident and subtle imagery. Her albums' social commentary and storytelling have incited debate on the \"invigoratingly complex\" politics of the issues she highlighted in the album, breaking taboos while the West was engaged in the 2003 Iraq War in the Middle East during the Presidency of George W. Bush.[3][35][159][160] Government visits to her official website following her debut album's release in 2005, and a US refusal to grant M.I.A. a travel visa coupled with her brief presence on the US Homeland Security Risk List in 2006 due to her politically charged lyrics led to her second album Kala being recorded in a variety of locations around the world.[4][153][161][162] The American Civil Liberties Union described the actions as part of a trend of ideological exclusion by the state which was detrimental to democracy by \"censoring and manipulating debate\".[163][164]"],"after":["On Kala, M.I.A.'s songs explored immigration politics and her personal relationships. Many related her experiences during recording sessions in Madras, Angola, Trinidad shantytowns, Liberia and London, and were well acclaimed.[24][52] The album's artwork was inspired by African art, \"from dictator fashion to old stickers on the back of cars,\" which like her clothing range, she hoped would capture \"a 3-D sense, the shapes, the prints, the sound, film, technology, politics, economics\" of a certain time.[165] I-D magazine described the \"bleeding cacophany of graphics\" on her website during this time as evoking the \"noisy amateurism\" of the early web, but also embodying a rejection of today's \"glossy, professional site design\" which was felt to \"efface the medium rather than celebrate it.\"[166] Jeff Chang, writing for The Nation, described a \"Kala for the Nation\" and the album's music, lyrics and imagery as encompassing \"everywhere â€“ or, to be specific, everywhere but the First World's self-regarding 'here',\" stating that against a media flow that suppresses the \"ugliness\" of reality and fixes beauty to consumption, M.I.A. forces a conversation about how the majority live, closing the distance \"between 'here' and everywhere else\". He felt that Kala explored poverty, violence and globalization through the eyes of \"children left behind.\"[167]"]}}}
