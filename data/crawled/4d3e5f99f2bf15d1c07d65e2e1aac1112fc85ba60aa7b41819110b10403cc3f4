Taking their material primarily from only the last two books of Acts and Monuments (that is, volume II of the 1570 edition), generated texts that genuinely were \"Book(s) of Martyrs\". Famous scenes from Acts and Monuments, in illustrated text, were revived for each new generation. The earliest printed book bearing the title, \"Book of Martyrs\", however, appears to be John Taylor's edition in 1631. While occurring again periodically, that title was not much in use before the mid-seventeen hundreds, and not regularized as the title of choice before 1850. The title, Foxe's Book of Martyrs (where the author's name reads as if part of the title) appears first in John Kennedy's 1840 edition, but this may be just a printing error.[38]"],"after":["Characterized by some scholars as \"Foxe's bastards\", these Foxe-derived texts have recently received increasing attention and recognition as the actual medium through which Foxe and his ideas influenced popular consciousness.[39] Nineteenth-century professionalizing scholars, who wanted to keep separate their (academically significant) Acts and Monuments, clear from the abridgements' \"vulgar corruption\", dismissed these later editions as expressing \"narrowly evangelical Protestant piety\" and as nationalistic tools produced only \"to club Catholics\". Their judgment says more about their own prejudices that it does about any of these texts, as we know very little about any of these editions.[40] Characterized most recently as 'Foxe', with ironic quotation marks signaling a suspect term, and also as \"Foxe-in-action\", these Foxe-derived texts have much yet to teach researchers about the nature of their subject.[41]"]}}}
