Out of these, 650,000 in kindergarten (3–6 years), 3.11 million in primary and secondary level, and 650,000 in tertiary level (universities).[250] In the same year, the adult literacy rate was 97.3% (45th worldwide), while the combined gross enrollment ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary schools was 75% (52nd worldwide).[251] Schooling is compulsory until the first ten years of the primary and secondary schools.[252] There also exists a semi-legal, informal private tutoring system used mostly during secondary school, which has prospered during the Communist regime.[253]"]}}}
