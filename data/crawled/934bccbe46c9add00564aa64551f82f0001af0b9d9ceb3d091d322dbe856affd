In 2009, Bennett performed at the conclusion of the final Macworld Conference & Expo for Apple Inc., singing the \"The Best Is Yet to Come\" and \"I Left My Heart In San Francisco\" to a standing ovation,[83][84] and later making his Jazz Fest debut in New Orleans.[85] In February 2010, Bennett was one of over 70 artists singing on \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\", a charity single in aid of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[86] In October he performed \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" at AT&T Park before the third inning of Game 1 of the 2010 World Series and sang \"God Bless America\" during the seventh-inning stretch. Days later he sang \"America the Beautiful\" at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, D.C."],"after":["In September 2011, Bennett appeared on The Howard Stern Show and named American military actions in the Middle East as the root cause of the September 11 attacks.[23] Bennett also claimed that former President George W. Bush personally told him at the Kennedy Center in December 2005 that he felt he had made a mistake invading Iraq, to which a Bush spokesperson replied, \"This account is flatly wrong.\"[87] Following bad press resulting from his remarks, Bennett clarified his position, writing: \"There is simply no excuse for terrorism and the murder of the nearly 3,000 innocent victims of the 9/11 attacks on our country. My life experiences, ranging from the Battle of the Bulge to marching with Martin Luther King, made me a life-long humanist and pacifist, and reinforced my belief that violence begets violence and that war is the lowest form of human behavior.\"[88]"]}}}
