However, there is no function that makes W=0. The resulting controversy over the validity of Dirichlet's principle is explained in http://turnbull.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Riemann.html . Eventually it was shown that Dirichlet's principle is valid, but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations; see Jost and Li-Jost (1998)."],"after":["If we apply the divergence theorem, the result is","If we first set v=0 on C, the boundary integral vanishes, and we conclude as before that"]}}}
