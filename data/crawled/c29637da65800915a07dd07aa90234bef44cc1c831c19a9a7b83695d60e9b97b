A Grade I listed building, it was built in around 1300, probably on the site of an earlier timber-framed church. The original dedication was to St Lawrence. The tower, considered by F. H. Crossley to be the church's best feature, dates from 1530. A major restoration was carried out by Paley and Austin in 1877–78."]}}}
