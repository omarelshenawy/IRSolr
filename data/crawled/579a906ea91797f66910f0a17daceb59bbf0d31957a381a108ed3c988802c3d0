Penn's personal life began to attract media attention when he married pop singer Madonna in 1985. The two starred in the panned and much-derided Shanghai Surprise, directed by Jim Goddard, and Madonna dedicated her third studio album True Blue to Penn, referring to him in the liner notes as \"the coolest guy in the universe\".[14] The relationship was marred by violent outbursts against the press, including one incident for which he was arrested for assaulting a photographer on a film set; Penn was sentenced to 60 days in jail in mid-1987, of which he served 33 days.[15] Later in the marriage, Penn was charged with felony domestic assault, a charge for which he pleaded to a misdemeanor.[16] Penn and Madonna divorced in 1989."]}}}
