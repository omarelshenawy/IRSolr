Burton Hall is home to the College of Education and Human Development. Many buildings in this area are well over one hundred years old and it includes a 13-building group comprising the Old Campus Historic District that is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[7] A residence hall, Sanford Hall, and a student-apartment complex, Roy Wilkins Hall, are located in this area.
