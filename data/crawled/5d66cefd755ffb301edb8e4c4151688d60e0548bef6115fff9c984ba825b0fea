In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible.[1] Even in a transistorised amplifier with hard clipping, the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to nonlinear distortion) as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the saturation voltage (for bipolar transistors), and so \"full power\" for the purposes of measuring distortion in amplifiers is usually taken as a few percent below clipping."],"after":["In the image domain, clipping is seen as desaturated (washed-out) bright areas that turn to pure white if all color components clip."]}}}
