An orthonormal basis for L2([−π, π]) consisting of real functions is formed by the functions 1/√2π 1 and 1/√π cos(nx),  1/√π sin(nx) with n = 1, 2,...  The density of their span is a consequence of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, but follows also from the properties of classical kernels like the Fejér kernel."],"after":[]}}}
