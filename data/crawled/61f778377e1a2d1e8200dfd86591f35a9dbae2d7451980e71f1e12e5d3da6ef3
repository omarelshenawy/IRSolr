In the paleolithic, people did not normally live in permanent constructions. In the neolithic, mud brick houses started appearing that were coated with plaster.[47] The growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible. Doorways were made on the roof, with ladders positioned both on the inside and outside of the houses.[47] The roof was supported by beams from the inside. The rough ground was covered by platforms, mats, and skins on which residents slept.[48] Stilt-houses settlements were common in the Alpine and Pianura Padana (Terramare) region.[49] Remains have been found at the Ljubljana Marshes in Slovenia and at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria, for example."]}}}
