However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.[29] In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at the Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist.[30] He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presenceÂ ... [a] star quality.\"[31] Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962.[32] Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg.[33] Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage.[34] Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. After an early February audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\"[35] However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.[34]"],"after":["Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962.[36] Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place.[37] Already contemplating Best's dismissal,[38] the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them.[36] A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \"Love Me Do\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \"Love Me Do\", \"Please Please Me\" and \"P.S. I Love You\".[36] Martin initially selected the Starr version of \"Love Me Do\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine.[36] Released in early October, \"Love Me Do\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart.[39] Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places.[40] After Martin suggested rerecording \"Please Please Me\" at a faster tempo,[41] a studio session in late November yielded that recording,[42] of which Martin accurately predicted, \"You've just made your first No.1.\"[43]"]}}}
