I have a few ideas to improve the suspension of the 0-sphere. Instead of having X in plain black, we could show X as the union of A and B with overlapping colors (similarly to A intersect B), and add this in the labeling. Also, could you change the color of A to blue, and the color of B to red so that everything stays consistent (and have the labels colored as well)? Finally, I find the labeling too condensed below, so I propose to put the names of the objects (Y, X = A∪B, A, B, and A∩B) above the pictures, and the descriptions (S^0, SY = S^1, ~pt, ~pt, ~Y = S^0) below. What do you think? (BTW, some problems with SVG graphics are discussed above) GeometryGirl (talk) 23:42, 19 December 2008 (UTC)"],"after":[]}}}
