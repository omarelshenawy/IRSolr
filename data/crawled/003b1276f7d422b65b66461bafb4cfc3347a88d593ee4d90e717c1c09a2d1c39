The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g. 15) and the solution is \"yes\" if the number is prime and \"no\" otherwise (in this case \"no\"). Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input."]}}}
