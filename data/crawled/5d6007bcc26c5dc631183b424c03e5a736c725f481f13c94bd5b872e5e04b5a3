Where available, Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials. From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque, the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form. Just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe.[233] Romanesque buildings have massive stone walls, openings topped by semi-circular arches, small windows, and, particularly in France, arched stone vaults.[234] The large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of fa√ßades, especially in France, and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals.[235] According to art historian C. R. Dodwell, \"virtually all the churches in the West were decorated with wall-paintings\", of which few survive.[236] Simultaneous with the development in church architecture, the distinctive European form of the castle was developed, and became crucial to politics and warfare.[237]"]}}}
