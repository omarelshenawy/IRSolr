The 66th season is now finalized, with Kevin Harvick, Chase Elliott, and Matt Crafton crowned with the drivers' national championships. The three largest racing series sanctioned by NASCAR are the Sprint Cup, the Nationwide Series and the Camping World Truck Series. The NASCAR season consists of a series of races held on purpose-built race tracks. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual NASCAR Championships for each series, one for the drivers and one for the manufacturers. NASCAR cars race at high speeds, up to 200 mph (320 km/h). The cars are capable of pulling in excess of five G-forces in some curves. Charlotte, North Carolina is NASCAR's traditional center, where most of the teams are based. However, the sport's scope has expanded significantly in recent years with races being held all over North America."]}}}
