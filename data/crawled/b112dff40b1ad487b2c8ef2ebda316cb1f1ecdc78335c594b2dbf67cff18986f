Coming up with The Writing's on the Wall, they released it on July 27, 1999 and it eventually became their breakthrough album.[16] The Writing's on the Wall peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and number two on R&B chart in early 2000.[14] \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" was released in 1999 as the album's lead single and reached the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their first US number-one single.[6] The Writing's on the Wall has been credited as Destiny's Child's breakthrough album, spurring their career and introducing them to a wider audience.[11][17] The main key to the group's breakthrough was the album's third single, \"Say My Name\",[17] which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. The successful release of the singles bolstered the album's sales,[8][18] eventually selling over eight million copies in the United States, gaining eight-time platinum certification by the RIAA.[6][15] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and was one of the top-selling albums of 2000.[19]"],"after":["In December 1999, Luckett and Roberson attempted to split with their manager, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the group's profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland.[6] While they never intended to leave the group, when the video for \"Say My Name\" surfaced in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that two new members were joining Knowles and Rowland.[6] Prior to the video premiere, Knowles announced on TRL that original members Luckett and Roberson had left the group.[8] They were replaced by Michelle Williams, a former backup singer to Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress.[11] Shortly after her stint with Monica, Williams was introduced to Destiny's Child by choreographer Braden Larson aka \"Peanut Orlando\", and was flown to Houston where she stayed with the Knowles family.[11]"]}}}
