The development led to the release of the Metropolitan Air Quality Scheme (MAQS), which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in Sydney, allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution.[261] Australian cities are some of the most car dependent cities in the world.[262] Sydney in particular has a very high level of car dependency,[263] especially by world city standards. It also has a low level of mass-transit services thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency.[264][265] Strategies have been implemented to reduce car pollution by encouraging mass and public transit[266] and introducing a fleet of 10 new Nissan LEAF electric cars, the largest order of the pollution-free vehicle in Australia.[267] Electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, gases which contribute to climate change.[268][269] Cycling trips have increased by 113% across Sydney's inner-city since March 2010, with about 2,000 bikes passing through top peak-hour intersections on an average weekday.[270]"]}}}
