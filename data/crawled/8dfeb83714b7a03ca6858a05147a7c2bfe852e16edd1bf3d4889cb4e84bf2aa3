HMS Audacious turned out to have been the only dreadnought sunk by a submarine in WWI.[37] While battleships were never intended for anti-submarine warfare, there was one instance of a submarine being sunk by a dreadnought battleship. HMS Dreadnought rammed and sank the German U-29 on 18 March 1915 off Moray Firth.[37]"],"after":["Whilst the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers successfully turning away the British battleships, the German attempt to rely on U-boat attacks on the British fleet failed.[45]"]}}}
