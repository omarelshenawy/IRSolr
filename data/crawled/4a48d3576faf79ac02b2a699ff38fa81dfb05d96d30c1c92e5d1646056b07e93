In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles.[6] Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.[6] At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino.[6] A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child.[6] She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976.[6] In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times.[6] She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years.[6] Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series.[8][9] Jackson states her ethnicity is African American and Native American.[10]"]}}}
