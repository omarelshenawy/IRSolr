His legal writings were published first and then continued to appear throughout his life. Next were his commentaries on the Qur'an. Lastly, his history was published. Despite a style that makes it seem he drew largely on oral sources, written material (both published and unpublished) provided him with the bulk of his information.[citation needed] His biographers stress his reverence for scholarship and his keen intent to offer his readers hard fact."]}}}
