These lead naturally to the definition of C*-algebras and other operator algebras."],"after":["General Banach spaces are more complicated than Hilbert spaces, and cannot be classified in such a simple manner as those. In particular, many Banach spaces lack a notion analogous to an orthonormal basis."]}}}
