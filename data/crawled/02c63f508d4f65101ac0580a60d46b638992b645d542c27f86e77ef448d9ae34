A field extension F / E is simply a field F and a subfield E âŠ‚ F. Constructing such a field extension F / E can be done by \"adding new elements\" or adjoining elements to the field E. For example, given a field E, the set F = E(X) of rational functions, i.e., equivalence classes of expressions of the kind"],"after":["where p(X) and q(X) are polynomials with coefficients in E, and q is not the zero polynomial, forms a field. This is the simplest example of a transcendental extension of E. It also is an example of a domain (the ring of polynomials in this case) being embedded into its field of fractions ."]}}}
