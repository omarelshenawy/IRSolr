Nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2011, down from 24.9 percent the previous year.[134] However, by May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service.[135] As of November 2014[update], two reactors at Sendai are likely to restart in early 2015.[136] Given its heavy dependence on imported energy,[137] Japan has aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[138]"]}}}
