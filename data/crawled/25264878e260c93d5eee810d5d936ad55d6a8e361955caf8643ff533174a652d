The craft ascended by the dropping of ballast, and was to drift at an altitude of up to 25,000 ft (7.6 km). It was intended to follow wind currents toward Europe, the intended destination, however, unpredictable wind currents could have forced the craft to North Africa or Norway. To descend, Trappe would have popped or released some of the balloons.[60] The last time the Atlantic was crossed by helium balloon was in 1984 by Colonel Joe Kittinger.[63]"]}}}
