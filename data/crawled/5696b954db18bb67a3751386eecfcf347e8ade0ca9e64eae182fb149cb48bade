In the NME, Nick Kent described \"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\"[147] In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\"[147] Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements. In Salon.com, Bill Wyman wrote: \"Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.\"[148] Novelist Rick Moody called it \"the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape.\"[149]"],"after":["That summer Dylan wrote a ballad championing boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, imprisoned for a triple murder in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1966. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote \"Hurricane\", presenting the case for Carter's innocence. Despite its length — over eight minutes — the song was released as a single, peaking at 33 on the U.S. Billboard chart, and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue.[a 4][150] The tour featured about one hundred performers and supporters from the Greenwich Village folk scene, including T-Bone Burnett, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Joni Mitchell,[151][152] David Mansfield, Roger McGuinn, Mick Ronson, Joan Baez, and Scarlet Rivera, whom Dylan discovered walking down the street, her violin case on her back.[153] Allen Ginsberg accompanied the troupe, staging scenes for the film Dylan was shooting. Sam Shepard was hired to write the screenplay, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.[154]"]}}}
