In October 2011, Romanians made up 88.9% of the population. The largest ethnic minorities are the Hungarians, 6.5% of the population, and Roma, 3.3% of the population.[e][228] Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna. Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, and Tatars.[229] In 1930, there were 745,421 Germans in Romania,[230] but only about 36,000 remain today.[229] As of 2009, there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China.[121]"]}}}
