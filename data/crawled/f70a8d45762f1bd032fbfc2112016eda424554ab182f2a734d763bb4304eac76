Other languages are Mandinka, Wolof, Fula, Serer, Krio and other indigenous vernaculars.[32] Due to the country's geographical setting, knowledge of French (an official language in much of West Africa) is relatively widespread."],"after":["The Constitution mandates free and compulsory primary education in the Gambia. Lack of resources and educational infrastructure has made implementation of this difficult.[33] In 1995, the gross primary enrollment rate was 77.1% and the net primary enrollment rate was 64.7%[33] School fees long prevented many children from attending school, but in February 1998 President Jammeh ordered the termination of fees for the first six years of schooling.[33] Girls make up about 52 percent of primary school students. The figure may be lower for girls in rural areas, where cultural factors and poverty prevent parents from sending girls to school.[33] Approximately twenty percent of school-age children attend Quranic schools.[33]"]}}}
