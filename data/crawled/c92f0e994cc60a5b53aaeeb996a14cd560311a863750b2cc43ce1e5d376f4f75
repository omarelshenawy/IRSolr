For the symmetric group of {1, 2, ..., n} there is one particularly natural action, namely the action by permutation on the set Xn of sequences of n symbols taken from some set X. As with the matrix representation, there are two natural ways in which the result of permuting a sequence (x1,x2,...,xn) by σ can be defined, but only one is compatible with the multiplication of permutations (so as to give a left action of the symmetric group on Xn); with the multiplication rule used in this article this is the one given by"],"after":["This means that each component xi ends up at position σ(i) in the sequence permuted by σ."]}}}
