In 1887, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced his fictional master sleuth, Sherlock Holmes who applied his keen deductive acumen and prodigious range of knowledge to solve his cases. Encyclopedia Brown is a series of books by Donald J. Sobol featuring the adventures of boy detective Leroy Brown, nicknamed \"Encyclopedia\" for his intelligence and range of knowledge that was first published in 1963. One of the most celebrated is the fictional Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by the late Douglas Adams which began its evolution through numerous mediums as a British radio program in 1978.[5] In 2004, NPR contributor A.J. Jacobs published The Know-It-All, about his experience reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from start to finish.[6]"]}}}
