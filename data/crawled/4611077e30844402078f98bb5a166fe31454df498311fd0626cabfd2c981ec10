Bernoulli's equation can be used in almost any situation to determine the pressure at any point in a fluid. The equation makes some assumptions about the fluid, such as the fluid being ideal[7] and incompressible.[7] An ideal fluid is a fluid in which there is no friction, it is inviscid,[7] zero viscosity.[7] The equation for all points of a system filled with a constant-density fluid is"],"after":["where:"]}}}
