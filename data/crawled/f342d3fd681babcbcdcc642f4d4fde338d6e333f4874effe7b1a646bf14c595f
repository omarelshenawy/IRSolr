He was appointed the king's secretary. He had already been archdeacon of Taunton for several years, and the archdeaconries of Worcester and of Norfolk were added to it before November 1529 and in March 1530 respectively; in April 1531 he resigned all three for that of Leicester. In 1530 he was sent to Cambridge to procure the decision of the university as to the unlawfulness of marriage with a deceased brother's wife, in accordance with the new plan devised for settling the question without the pope's intervention. In this he succeeded, though not without a good deal of artifice, more creditable to his ingenuity than to his virtue. In November 1531 the king rewarded him with the bishopric of Winchester, vacant since Wolsey's death. The unexpected promotion was accompanied by expressions from the king which made it still more honourable, showing that if he had been subservient, it was not for the sake of his own advancement. Gardiner had, in fact, argued boldly with the king on some points, and Henry now reminded him of the fact. \"I have often squared with you, Gardiner,\" he said familiarly, \"but I love you never the worse, as the bishopric I give will convince you.\" In 1532, nevertheless, he displeased the king by taking part in the preparation of the \"Answer of the Ordinaries\" to the complaints brought against them in the House of Commons. On this subject he wrote to the king in his own defence."]}}}
