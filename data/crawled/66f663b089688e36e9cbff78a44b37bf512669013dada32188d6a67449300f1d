Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.[7] Most scholars consider the era of merchant capitalism and mercantilism as the origin of modern capitalism,[41][42] although Karl Polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he referred to as the \"fictitious commodities\": land, labor, and money. Accordingly, he argued that \"not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date.\"[43]"]}}}
