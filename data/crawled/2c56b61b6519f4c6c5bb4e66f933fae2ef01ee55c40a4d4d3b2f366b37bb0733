Whereas the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records, the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. One could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally, as on a monophonic recording, with the right channel information recorded with a \"hill and dale\" vertical motion; such systems were proposed but not adopted, due to their incompatibility with existing phono pickup designs (see below)."]}}}
