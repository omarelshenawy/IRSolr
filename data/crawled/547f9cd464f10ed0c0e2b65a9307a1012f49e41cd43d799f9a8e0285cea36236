The state route's signs are in the shape of a miner's spade to honor the California Gold Rush. Each state highway in the U.S. State of California is assigned a Route (officially State Highway Route) number in the Streets and Highways Code (Sections 300-635). Since July 1 of 1964, the majority of legislative route numbers, those defined in the Streets and Highways Code, match the sign route numbers. On the other hand, some short routes are instead signed as parts of other routes — for instance, Route 112 and Route 260 are signed as part of the longer State Route 61, and Route 51 is part of Interstate 80 Business. California County Highways are marked with the usual County route shield, and are assigned a letter for where they are located. For instance, county highways assigned \"S\" are located in Southern California, ones assigned \"J\" are found in Central California, and those assigned \"A\" are located in Northern California."]}}}
