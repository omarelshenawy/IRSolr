Studios in Burbank, California.[54] Besson later directed Madonna in the 2007 animated film Arthur and the Invisibles.[55] \"There are a lot of special effects. I talked to things that weren't there â€“ which is what you do when you're doing green-screen or blue-screen stuff. There's going to be a lot of fairies dancing around me. Isn't that exciting? I always have a lot of fairies dancing around me\", Madonna commented about the music video.[56] The video premiered in the US on February 11, 2004 on AOL's First View. After the premiere, it was streamed on Yahoo!, MSN, Windows Media, Apple, MTV, VH1, iFilm and Madonna.com.[57]"]}}}
