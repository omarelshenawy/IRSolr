Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple's break-up, it was noted that \"they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come\".[81] With a production budget of $35 million, the film was a commercial failure, earning a total of $36 million at the box office.[82] The film, however, received generally positive reviews from critics, despite being \"full of cloyingly sentimental cliches\".[83] In October, Lopez co-starred alongside Richard Gere in the drama Shall We Dance?, a re-make of the 1996 Japanese film of the same title. With a production budget of $50 million, the film grossed a total of $170 million worldwide.[84] It received generally positive reviews from critics, although it was noted that it \"loses the nuances of the original\", with the loss of cultural context and the addition of high-profile celebrities.[85]"]}}}
