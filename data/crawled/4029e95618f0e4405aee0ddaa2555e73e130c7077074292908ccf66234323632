The term is derived from the Latin trans (\"across\") and portare (\"to carry\"). Industries which have the business of providing transport equipment, transport services or transport are important in most national economies, and are referred to as transport industries. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations. Infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, and may be roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines or terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations and seaports. Vehicles traveling on the network include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, people and aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including the financing, legalities and policies."]}}}
