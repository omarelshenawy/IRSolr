The mid-1988 UK release of Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit,[73][74] an album compiled by ex-Northern Soul DJ and Kool Kat Records boss Neil Rushton (at the time an A&R scout for Virgin's \"10 Records\" imprint) and Derrick May, was an important milestone and marked the introduction of the word techno in reference to a specific genre of music.[3][4] Although the compilation put techno into the lexicon of music journalism, the music was, for a time, sometimes characterized as Detroit's high-tech interpretation of Chicago house rather than a relatively pure genre unto itself.[4][75] In fact, the compilation's working title had been The House Sound of Detroit until the addition of Atkins' song \"Techno Music\" prompted reconsideration.[73][76] Rushton was later quoted as saying he, Atkins, May, and Saunderson came up with the compilation's final name together, and that the Belleville Three voted down calling the music some kind of regional brand of house; they instead favored a term they were already using, techno.[4][76][77]"]}}}
