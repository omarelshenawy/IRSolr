Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\"[20] But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become household guests."]}}}
