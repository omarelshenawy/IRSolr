Usually formal education takes place in a school environment, with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained teacher. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, physical classroom design, student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.[10][11]"],"after":["Preschools provide education from ages approximately 3 to 7, depending on the country, when children enter primary education.
