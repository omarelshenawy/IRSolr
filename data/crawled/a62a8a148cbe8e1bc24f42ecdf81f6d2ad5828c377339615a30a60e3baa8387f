Published by Billboard magazine, its data are similar to Billboard‍‍ '​‍s U.S.-based Hot 100 in that it compiles Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay. Canada's airplay chart is compiled with information collected from monitoring more than 100 stations that represent rock, country, adult contemporary and contemporary hit radio genres.[1] The online version of the chart features the Canadian flag next to tracks that qualify as Canadian content.[2][3]"]}}}
