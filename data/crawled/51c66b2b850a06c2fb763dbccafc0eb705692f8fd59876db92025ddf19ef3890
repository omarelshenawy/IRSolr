A term is an addend or a summand, a group of coefficients, variables, constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators.[3] Letters represent variables and constants. By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g. ) are typically used to represent constants, and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g. and ) are used to represent variables.[4] They are usually written in italics.[5]"],"after":["Usually terms with the highest power (exponent), are written on the left, for example, is written to the left of . When a coefficient is one, it is usually omitted (e.g. is written ).[9] Likewise when the exponent (power) is one, (e.g. is written ).[10] When the exponent is zero, the result is always 1 (e.g. is always rewritten to ).[11] However , being undefined, should not appear in an expression, and care should be taken in simplifying expressions in which variables may appear in exponents."]}}}
