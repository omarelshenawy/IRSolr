Over 7.6 million passengers flew through Bucharest's Henri Coandă International Airport in 2013.[197]"],"after":["Romania is a net exporter of electrical energy and is 46th worldwide in terms of consumption of electric energy.[198] Around a third of the produced energy comes from renewable sources, mostly as hydroelectric power.[199] In 2010, the main sources were coal (36%), hydroelectric (33%), nuclear (19%), and hydrocarbons (11%).[200] It has one of the largest refining capacities in Eastern Europe, even though oil- and natural gas production has been decreasing for more than a decade.[198] With one of the largest reserves of crude oil and shale gas in Europe,[198] it is among the most energy-independent countries in the European Union,[201] and is looking to further expand its nuclear power plant at Cernavodă.[202]"]}}}
