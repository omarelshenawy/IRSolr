After Madonna's entrance, the ground as well as the stage floor changed to reveal numerous video images, showing Vogue magazine covers with Madonna's face imposed on them. The images continued to change rapidly as the performance moved on to the next songs. This was achieved by technology known as projection mapping, which is used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into a display surface for video projection. It had been used previously in shows like Nokia Lumia's launch as well as projecting images of NBA players on the Hudson River in 2011. However, it had never been used on such a grandiose scale like Madonna's halftime show. Eric Fournier, partner and executive producer at Moment Factory, explained that they had previously been associated with such technology dependent shows, so preparing and adjusting to the requirements for Super Bowl was easy. When they arrived at the halftime show preparations, Madonna's team had already selected the songs to be performed, hence the studio had to develop the visual effects complimenting the choreography.[22] Moment Factory Creative Director, Sakchin Bessette, believed that video projections would be more efficient in highlighting the show, and there would be less equipment to move to the field.[23] Fournier said that \"It all came from the decision at the beginning to make a show out of it, not just a performance. Madonna's a perfectionist, and she wanted to do something extraordinary, so that was the objective of everybody\".[22]"]}}}
