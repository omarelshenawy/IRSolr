G. Wells's The War of the Worlds, performed by Orson Welles. Its unique format, a contemporary version of the story in the form of faux news broadcasts, had panicked many listeners into believing invaders from Mars were actually invading and devastating Grover's Mill, New Jersey, despite three disclaimers during the broadcast that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on faux news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for The Mercury Theatre on the Air â€“ the former sustaining program became The Campbell Playhouse to sell soup.[53] Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as \"the Mercury Theater's own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'\"[54]"]}}}
