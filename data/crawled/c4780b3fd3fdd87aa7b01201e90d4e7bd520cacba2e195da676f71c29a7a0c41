A k-dimensional subspace W of V is represented by taking an orthogonal basis and using the geometric product to form the blade D = b1b2⋅⋅⋅bk. There are multiple blades representing W; all those representing W are scalar multiples of D. These blades can be separated into two sets: positive multiples of D and negative multiples of D. The positive multiples of D are said to have the same orientation as D, and the negative multiples the opposite orientation."]}}}
