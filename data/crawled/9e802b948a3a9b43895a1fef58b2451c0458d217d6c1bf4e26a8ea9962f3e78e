Each year the park attracts over 260,000 visitors who come to enjoy the crystal clear waterfalls which cascade from a sandstone plateau called the Tabletop Range, the idyllic year-round swimming areas, the intriguing magnetic termite mounds, and the bushwalking tracks. Proclaimed a national park in 1986, it is named after Fred Litchfiel, a Territory pioneer, who explored areas of the Northern Territory from Escape Cliffs on the Timor Sea to the Daly River in 1864."]}}}
