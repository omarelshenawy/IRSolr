The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.[37] The production of plays usually involves contributions from a playwright, director, a cast of actors, and a technical production team that includes a scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer, sound designer, stage manager, and production manager. Depending on the production, this team may also include a composer, dramaturg, video designer or fight director."]}}}
