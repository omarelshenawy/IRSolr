The band Cobra Starship released a song called \"Middle Finger\", and released a music video that showed people giving the finger.[50] Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan installed a marble statue of a middle finger measuring 11 metres (36Â ft), located directly in front of the Milan Stock Exchange.[51] A now-famous photograph of Johnny Cash shows him giving the middle finger to a photographer during a 1969 concert at San Quentin State Prison, released as At San Quentin.[52] However, the photo remained fairly obscure until 1998, when producer Rick Rubin made it the centerpiece of an ad in Billboard criticizing country radio for not giving airplay to Cash's Grammy-winning album Unchained.[53] Cameron Diaz made the gesture during a photo shoot for Esquire.[54] Harold Lloyd shot the finger to his own reflection in a Coney Island funhouse after getting paint on his suit in Speedy, his final silent feature, from 1928.[55]"]}}}
