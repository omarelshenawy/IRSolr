This time she walks out on him, leaving him behind in despair. She's seen on the train and later on a plane, while Emilio tries to catch up with her in vain. The video's wardrobe was styled by noted fashion editor/stylist, Lori Goldstein. The video for \"Verás\" intercalates scenes from \"You'll See\" with footage of Madonna recording the Spanish version of the song.[21] The music video for \"You'll See\" was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography in 1996,[22] and was included on the DVD edition of 2009 compilation Celebration.[21]"]}}}
