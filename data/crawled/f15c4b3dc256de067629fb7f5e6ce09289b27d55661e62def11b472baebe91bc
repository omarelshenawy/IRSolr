(2012) used and described the STS respectively science studies for social studies of volcanology and the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes.[1] It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the UK, Montserrat, Italy and Iceland during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking.[1] A main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the Black Swan Theory [27] directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infractructure, as the island's airport.[28] About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 to the United Kingdom.[29] The Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches.[1] The STS approach provided valuable insights in that situation.[1] There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge.[1] The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step.[1] It involved as well local knowledge and experience.[1]"]}}}
