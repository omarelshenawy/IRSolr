Salsa is the primary music played at Latin dance clubs and is the \"essential pulse of Latin music\", according to author Ed Morales, while music author Peter Manuel called it the \"most popular dance (music) among Puerto Rican and Cuban communities, (and in) Central and South America\", and \"one of the most dynamic and significant pan-American musical phenomena of the 1970s and 1980s\".
