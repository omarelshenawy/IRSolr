While making Arular in her bedroom in west London, she built tracks off her demos, using beats she programmed on the Roland MC-505.[9][41] The album experiments with bold, jarring and ambient sounds, and its lyrics address the Iraq War and daily life in London as well as M.I.A.'s past.[24][35][42]"],"after":["\"Galang\", \"Sunshowers\", \"Hombre\" and the funk carioca-inspired co-composition \"Bucky Done Gun\" were released as singles from Arular. The release of the latter marked the first time that a funk carioca-inspired song was played on mainstream radio and music television in Brazil, its country of origin.[43] M.I.A. worked with one of her musical influences Missy Elliott, contributing to the track \"Bad Man\" on her 2005 album The Cookbook.[35] Despite initial fears that her dyslexia might pose problems while touring, M.I.A. supported the album through a series of festival and club shows, including the Bue Festival, a free headlining show at Central Park Summerstage, the Summer Sonic Fest and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where she played an encore in response to crowd enthusiasm, a rare occurrence for the festival generally and the first encore following a tent performance at Coachella.[35][44][45] She also toured with Roots Manuva and LCD Soundsystem, and ended 2005 briefly touring with Gwen Stefani and performing at the Big Day Out festival.[46][47] On 19 July 2005, M.I.A. was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize for Arular.[48] According to the music review aggregation Metacritic, it garnered an average score of 88 out of 100, described as \"universal acclaim\".[39] They reported in 2010 that Arular was the seventh best reviewed album of 2005 and the ninth Best-Reviewed Electronic/Dance Album on Metacritic of the 2000 – 09 decade.[49][50] Arular became the second most featured album in music critics’ Year-End Top 10 lists for 2005 and was named best of the year by publications such as Blender, Stylus and Musikbyrån.[39]"]}}}
