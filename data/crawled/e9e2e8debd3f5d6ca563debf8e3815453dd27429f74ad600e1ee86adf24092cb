I see classical construction as free from number; Euclid stands to one side and points to this line or that and argues, \"These things are alike; therefore these are also alike.\" Logic prevails and what I like to think of as an algebra-free zone. Naturally, one can switch on algebra, introduce the Cartesian plane (with or without complex numbers); but I just don't see any of this as Euclidean."]}}}
