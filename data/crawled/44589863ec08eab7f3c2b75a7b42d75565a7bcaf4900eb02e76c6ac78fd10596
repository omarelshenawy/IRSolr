The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city."],"after":["The university’s arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht’s city centre, west of the river Meuse.
