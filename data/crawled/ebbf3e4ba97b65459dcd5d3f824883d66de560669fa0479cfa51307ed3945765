Historical records showed that Mao directed the PVA campaigns in the Korean War to the minute details as Chairman of the ruling CPC's Central Military Commission that oversees the country's armed forces. Since he was the Chairman of the CPC's CMC, he was also the Supreme Commander in Chief of the PLA aside from being the Chairman of the People's Republic and Chairman of the ruling CPC. The PVA was under the overall command of then newly installed Premier Zhou Enlai and with General Peng Dehuai as field commander and political commissar as well.[166]"],"after":["Along with land reform, during which significant numbers of landlords and well-to-do peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings organised by the Communist Party as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants,[167] there was also the Campaign to Suppress Counter-revolutionaries,[168] which involved public executions targeting mainly former Kuomintang officials, businessmen accused of \"disturbing\" the market, former employees of Western companies and intellectuals whose loyalty was suspect.[169] The U.S. State department in 1976 estimated that there may have been a million killed in the land reform, and 800,000 killed in the counter-revolutionary campaign.[170]"]}}}
