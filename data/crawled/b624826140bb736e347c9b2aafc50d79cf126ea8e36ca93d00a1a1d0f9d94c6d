She even invited Björk to feature in the performance; hovever, the singer turned it down, saying \"I was supposed to get [Madonna's] personal number and call her up, but it just didn't feel right. I'd love to meet her accidentally, really drunk in a bar. It's just all that formality that confuses me\".[5] This performance was ranked number four on Marie Claire‍ '​s \"30 Best Brit Award Moments\" list. It was described by the magazine as the \"best opening performance\" from the awards, and commented that \"the star pulled out all the stops, treating the audience to a light show and trio of satin-clad male dancers\".[46]"]}}}
