In 2014, the census of pupils in Scotland showed that only 497 pupils in publicly funded schools had Gaelic as the main language at home. This is down from 606 students in 2010, a sharp 18% drop in just four years. At the same time, Gaelic medium education in Scotland is growing markedly. In 2014, 3,583 pupils were being educated in a Gaelic-immersion environment in the country, up from just 2,638 pupils in 2009.[27]"],"after":[]}}}
