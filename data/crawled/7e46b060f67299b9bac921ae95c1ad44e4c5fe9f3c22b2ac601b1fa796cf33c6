However, after the East Asian financial crisis, the Russian default in 1998[205] and the series of adverse financial events that followed it, the Central Bank of Brazil temporarily changed its monetary policy to a managed-float[206] scheme while undergoing a currency crisis, until definitively changing the exchange regime to free-float in January 1999.[207]"],"after":["Brazil received an International Monetary Fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4 billion,[209] then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, although it was not due to be repaid until 2006.[210] One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall in the value of the U.S. dollar against the real during that period.[211] Nonetheless, foreign direct investment (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8 billion for 2007.[212] Inflation monitoring and control currently plays a major part in the Central bank's role of setting out short-term interest rates as a monetary policy measure.[213]"]}}}
