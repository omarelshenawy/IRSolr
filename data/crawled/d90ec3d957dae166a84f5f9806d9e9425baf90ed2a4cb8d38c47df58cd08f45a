It may also be used in a more narrow sense to refer only to the peer-level web meeting context, in an attempt to disambiguate it from the other types of collaborative sessions. [1] Terminology related to these technologies is inexact, and no generally agreed upon source or standards organization exists to provide an established usage reference. The distinction between webcast and webinar is becoming particularly difficult to define as functionality and usage becomes more similar and vendors substitute the terms freely.
