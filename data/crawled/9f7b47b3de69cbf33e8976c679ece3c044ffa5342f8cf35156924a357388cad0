The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing \"Dress You Up\".[12] After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went to the back of the stage, as the music of \"Holiday\" began.[12] Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, \"I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now,\" and started the performance of \"Into the Groove\", playing a tambourine.[13] A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her \"box\".[14] She continued with \"Everybody\", while asking the audience to clap along with her.[14] As she finished the vigorous performance of \"Everybody\", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of \"Angel\" started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above.[12] Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change.[12] She appeared on the stage wearing a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, and a number of crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts of her body.[15] As the guitar intro of \"Gambler\" started, Madonna stood on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, as flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present on the side of the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one.[15] She then performed \"Borderline\", \"Lucky Star\" and \"Crazy for You\"—while touching the hands of the audience members.[4] Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing \"Over and Over\" from Like a Virgin. It was followed by \"Burning Up\" during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change.[16] As the music of the song \"Like a Virgin\" started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck.[12] Madonna asked the audience \"Will you marry me?\" When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song.[17] Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, \"Billie Jean\". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience.[17] She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck.[12] In a self-parodying performance of the song \"Material Girl\", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience \"Do you really think I'm a material girl? ... I'm not ... Take it [Throwing fake money] ... I don't need money ... I need love.\"[14] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.[12]"]}}}
