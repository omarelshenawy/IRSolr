She favored authenticity over glamour and was willing to change her own appearance if it suited the character. Claudette Colbert commented that Davis was the first actress to play roles older than herself, and therefore did not have to make the difficult transition to character parts as she aged.[89]"],"after":["As she entered old age, Davis was acknowledged for her achievements. John Springer, who had arranged her speaking tours of the early 1970s, wrote that despite the accomplishments of many of her contemporaries, Davis was \"the star of the thirties and into the forties,\" achieving notability for the variety of her characterizations and her ability to assert herself, even when her material was mediocre.[95] Individual performances continued to receive praise; in 1987, Bill Collins analyzed The Letter (1940), and described her performance as \"a brilliant, subtle achievement,\" and wrote, \"Bette Davis makes Leslie Crosbie one of the most extraordinary females in movies.\"[96] In a 2000 review for All About Eve, (1950) Roger Ebert noted, \"Davis was a character, an icon with a grand style, so even her excesses are realistic.\"[97] In 2006, Premiere magazine ranked her portrayal of Margo Channing in the film as fifth on their list of \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time,\" commenting, \"There is something deliciously audacious about her gleeful willingness to play such unattractive emotions as jealousy, bitterness, and neediness.\"[98] While reviewing What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) in 2008, Ebert asserted that \"no one who has seen the film will ever forget her.\"[99]"]}}}
