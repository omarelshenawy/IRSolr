The first guest was Stone Phillips, a partial influence on the character.[16] In the debut episode, Colbert coined the word truthiness, defined as \"a quality characterizing a \"truth\" that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively \"from the gut\" or because it \"feels right\" without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts.\"[50] Truthiness was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster.[51][52] The character's forceful nature confused some in the program's early days. During an appearance on the segment \"Better Know a District\" in the show's first season, a frustrated Barney Frank declined to continue, deeming the conversation too dumb.[53]"]}}}
