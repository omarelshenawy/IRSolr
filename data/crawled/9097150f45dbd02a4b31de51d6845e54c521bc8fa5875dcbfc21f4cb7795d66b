(The Empire, coincidentally, was founded in 1887 by a rival of Brown's, Tory politician and then-Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald.) Press reports at the time stated, \"the minnow swallowed the whale\" because The Globe's circulation (at 78,000) was smaller than The Mail and Empire's (118,000)."],"after":["The merger was arranged by George McCullagh, who fronted for mining magnate William Henry Wright and became the first publisher of The Globe and Mail. McCullagh committed suicide in 1952, and the newspaper was sold to the Webster family of Montreal. As the paper lost ground to The Toronto Star in the local Toronto market, it began to expand its national circulation."]}}}
