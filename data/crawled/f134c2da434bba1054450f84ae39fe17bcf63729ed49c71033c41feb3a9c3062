It became obvious that the advancing Soviet Red Army might not come to Poland as an ally but rather only as \"the ally of an ally\".[15]"],"after":["The Soviets and the Poles distrusted each other, and Soviet partisans in Poland often clashed with Polish resistance increasingly united under the Home Army's front.[16] Stalin broke off Polish-Soviet relations on 25 April 1943 after the Germans revealed the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers, but Stalin refused to admit to ordering the killings and blamed the Germans for propaganda. Afterwards, Stalin created the Rudenko Commission, whose goal was to blame the Germans for the war crime at all costs. The alliance took Stalin's words as truth in order to keep the Anti-Nazi alliance intact.[17] On 26 October, the Polish government-in-exile issued instructions to the effect that if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before the Soviet entry into Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions."]}}}
