Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were the Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of Richard Stallman.[106] Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia.[107][108] While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[109][110] Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[111] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[112]"],"after":["Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[113] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[109] Wikipedia's policy of \"neutral point-of-view\"[114] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[109] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[115]"]}}}
