The family resided in the German city of Belsen throughout the war years, running a movie theatre for Nazi officers and officials who oversaw the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Dietrich interceded with Allied officials on behalf of her relatives, sheltering them from possible prosecution as Nazi collaborators.[33] Dietrich was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the US in 1945. She said this was her proudest accomplishment.[30] She was also awarded the Légion d'honneur by the French government as recognition for her wartime work.[34]"],"after":["From the early 1950s until the mid-1970s, Dietrich worked almost exclusively as a highly paid cabaret artist, performing live in large theaters in major cities worldwide.","In 1953, Dietrich was offered a then-substantial $30,000 per week[35] to appear live at the Sahara Hotel[36] on the Las Vegas Strip. The show was short, consisting only of a few songs associated with her.[36] Her daringly sheer \"nude dress\"—a heavily beaded evening gown of silk soufflé, which gave the illusion of transparency—designed by Jean Louis, attracted a lot of publicity.[36] This engagement was so successful that she was signed to appear at the Café de Paris in London the following year; her Las Vegas contracts were also renewed.[37]"]}}}
