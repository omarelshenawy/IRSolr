Fellatio can be sexually arousing for participants, and males commonly experience orgasm and ejaculation of semen during the act.[3][4] People may use fellatio as foreplay to sexually arouse their sex partner before vaginal or anal intercourse, or other sexual activity,[3][8] or they may use it as an erotic and physically intimate act in its own right.[3][4] Though a person who receives fellatio is male, his sex partner may be of either gender. When the penis is thrust into someone's mouth, it may be called irrumatio, though the term is rarely used.[16]"]}}}
