However, in June 2013 news surfaced that the university has had trouble selling the seats.[151] The roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20 percent of Cal's athletics' budget; principal repayment begins in 2032 and is scheduled to conclude in 2113.[101]"],"after":["The Golden Bears' traditional arch-rivalry is with the Stanford Cardinal.
