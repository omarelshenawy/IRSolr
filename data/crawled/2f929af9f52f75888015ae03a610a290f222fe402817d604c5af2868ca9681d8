The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity.[72] This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least sixty percent of the land area under forest cover, to designate more than 40%[73][74] of its territory as national parks, reserves and other protected areas, and most recently to identify a further nine percent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas. Environmental conservation has been placed at the core of the nation's development strategy, the middle path. It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in Bhutan's overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law."],"after":["Although Bhutan's natural heritage is still largely intact, the Government has said that it cannot be taken for granted and that conservation of the natural environment must be considered one of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the years ahead[citation needed]."]}}}
