Each had its own shelter chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000.[71] Many other observers were around 20 miles (32 km) away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield to screen out harmful ultraviolet wavelengths.[72] Bainbridge asked Groves to keep his VIP list down to just ten. He chose himself, Oppenheimer, Richard Tolman, Vannevar Bush, James Conant, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Charles Lauritsen, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Sir Geoffrey Taylor and Sir James Chadwick.[68] The VIPs viewed the test from Compania Hill, about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of the tower.[73] The observers set up a betting pool on the results of the test. Edward Teller was the most optimistic, predicting 45 kilotons of TNT (190 TJ).[74] He wore gloves to protect his hands, and sunglasses underneath the welding goggles that the government had supplied everyone with.[73] Teller was also one of the few scientists to actually watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground with his back turned.[75] He also brought suntan lotion, which he shared with the others.[76]"],"after":["Others were less optimistic. Ramsey chose zero (a complete dud), Robert Oppenheimer chose 300 tons of TNT (1,300 GJ)), Kistiakowsky 1,400 tons of TNT (5,900 GJ), and Bethe chose 8,000 tons of TNT (33,000 GJ).[74] Rabi, the last to arrive, won the pool with a prediction of 18,000 tons of TNT (75,000 GJ).[77] Bethe's choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segrè, with Bethe stating that he was swayed by Segrè's authority over that of a more junior member of Segrè's group who had calculated 20 kt. Enrico Fermi offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state, or incinerate the entire planet.[78] This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible,[79][80] although for a while it had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for scaring the guards who, unlike the physicists, did not have the advantage of their knowledge about the scientific possibilities. His own biggest fear was that nothing would happen, in which case he would have to head back to the tower to investigate.[81]"]}}}
