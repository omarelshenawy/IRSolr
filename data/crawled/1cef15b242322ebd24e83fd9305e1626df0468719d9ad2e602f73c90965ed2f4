In gas adsorption nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being absorbed is dependent on the size of the pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its saturation pressure. Measure the volume of the gas adsorbed by using the Brunauer, Emmit and, Teller formula (BET) gives the specific surface area of the sample. At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample. In Mercury Porosimetry, the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force. The Scattering Methods involves the angle dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample. The sample can be solid particles or pores. The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network. The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons. Aerogel is also an open porous network, the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gasses can enter and leave the substance without any limitation. While a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing it to stay within the pores.

The lowest-density silica nanofoam weighs 1,000 g/m3,[14] which is the evacuated version of the record-aerogel of 1,900 g/m3.[15] The density of air is 1,200 g/m3 (at 20 °C and 1 atm).[16] As of 2013[update], aerographene had a lower density at 160 g/m3, or 0.13 times the density of air at room temperature.[17]"]}}}
