In June 2007, the band began new sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who contributed not only as producers, but for the first time with U2, as songwriters as well.[123] In March 2008, the band signed a 12-year deal with Live Nation worth an estimated $100 million (£50 million),[124] which includes Live Nation controlling the band's merchandise, sponsoring, and their official website.[125] Recording on the album lasted through December 2008 in the US, the UK, Ireland, and Fez, Morocco, where the band explored North African music. Intended as a more experimental work than their previous two albums,[126] No Line on the Horizon was released in February 2009 and received generally positive reviews, including their first five-star Rolling Stone review. Critics, however, did not find it to be as experimental as originally billed. The album debuted at number one in over 30 countries,[127] but its sales of 5 million were seen as a disappointment by U2 standards and it did not contain a hit single.[128][129]"]}}}
