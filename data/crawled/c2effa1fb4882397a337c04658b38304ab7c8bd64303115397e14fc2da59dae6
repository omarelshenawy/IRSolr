The idea of being \"Australian\" began to be celebrated in songs and poems. This was fostered by improvements in transport and communications, such as the establishment of a telegraph system between the colonies in 1872. The Australian colonies were also influenced by other federations which had emerged around the world, notably in Argentina, Canada, Switzerland and the United States."]}}}
