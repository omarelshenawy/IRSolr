Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant, and appeals to \"Goldilocks principles\" (or other such fairy tales) are unnecessary to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large."],"after":["Advances in particular sciences such as archaeology, gene mapping, and evolutionary ecology have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources.[2] One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to \"upend\" the conventional practice in historiography of relying on written records.[2]"]}}}
