Assume that we know the coordinates of the vectors, x, v and w in the natural basis i=(1,0) and j =(0,1). Our goal is two find the real numbers α, β, so that x=αv+βw, that is"],"after":["To solve this equation for α, β, we compute the linear coordinate functionals σ and τ for the basis v, w, which are given by,[21]"]}}}
