The speakers of the language are known as Zimbern.","Cimbrian is a Germanic language related to Bavarian and most probably deriving from a Southern Bavarian dialect (although a Lombardic origin cannot be ruled out). It is also related to the MÃ³cheno language. Its many essential differences in grammar as well as in vocabulary and pronunciation make it practically unintelligible for people speaking Standard German or Bavarian. Bavarian is also spoken in the province of South Tyrol. The impact of the surrounding varieties of Italian on Cimbrian has been very strong."]}}}
