In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[418] About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[420] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[421]"]}}}
