Carter administration and Congress' Reorganization Act of 1979 pressured Amtrak to drop several lines. The main lines to be dropped were the Lone Star from Chicago to Houston (thereby cutting off north-south travel through Oklahoma), the Floridian from Chicago to Miami (thereby eliminating north-south travel through Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia) and the North Coast Hiawatha from Chicago to Seattle, via southern North Dakota and southern Montana.[37] Carter wanted to eliminate the Southwest Chief from Los Angeles to Chicago, but that route was saved.[38] The Hilltopper and the National Limited (thereby eliminating service to Columbus) were also eliminated in October of that year."],"after":["Ridership stagnated at roughly 20Â million passengers per year amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000.[35][39]","In the 1990s, Amtrak's stated goal remained operational self-sufficiency. By this time, however, Amtrak had a large overhang of debt from years of underfunding, and in the mid-1990s, Amtrak suffered through a serious cash crunch. To resolve the crisis, Congress issued funding but instituted a glide-path to financial self-sufficiency, excluding railroad retirement tax act payments.[40]"]}}}
