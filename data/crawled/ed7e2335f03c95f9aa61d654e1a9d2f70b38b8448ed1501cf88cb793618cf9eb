Lady Margaret Hall (1878)[32] was followed by Somerville College in 1879;[33] the first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[31] The first two colleges for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886),[34] St Hilda's (1893)[35] and St Anne's College (1952).[36] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[37] and it was not until 7 October 1920 that women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[38] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[31] However, before the 1970s all Oxford colleges were for men or women only, so that the number of women was limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status."]}}}
