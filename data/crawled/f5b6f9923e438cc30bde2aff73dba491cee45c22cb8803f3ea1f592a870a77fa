As his early biographer Niemetschek wrote, \"there was nothing special about [his] physique. [...] He was small and his countenance, except for his large intense eyes, gave no signs of his genius.\" His facial complexion was pitted, a reminder of his childhood case of smallpox. There is a photofit of Mozart, created from four contemporary portraits.[88] He loved elegant clothing. Kelly remembered him at a rehearsal: \"[He] was on the stage with his crimson pelisse and gold-laced cocked hat, giving the time of the music to the orchestra.\" Of his voice his wife later wrote that it \"was a tenor, rather soft in speaking and delicate in singing, but when anything excited him, or it became necessary to exert it, it was both powerful and energetic\".[89]"]}}}
