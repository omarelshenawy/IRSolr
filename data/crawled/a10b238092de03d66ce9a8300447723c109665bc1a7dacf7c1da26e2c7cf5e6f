The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe. Perhaps the most famous megalithic structure is Stonehenge in England. In Sardinia, in addition to dolmens, menhirs, cromlech and spirals there are also more than 8000 megalithic structure made by a Nuragical Civilisation and called NuragheÂ : buildings similar to towers (sometimes with really complex structures) made using only rocks.
