An explanation could be that the Romans collected all gold objects by force after conquering Dacia.[32] Some, including Manaila, explained the scarcity of these kinds of archaeological finds as due to Dacian religious reasons, all gold being collected by the priests and given to the Dacian king.[32] Numerous researchers, including Rustoiu, argued the existence of a royal monopoly of the gold and silver exploitation in Dacia;[215] and that after the Roman conquest, this monopoly passed to the Roman Emperor.[216]"]}}}
