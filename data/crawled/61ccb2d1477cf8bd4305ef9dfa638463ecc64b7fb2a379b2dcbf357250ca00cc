H. Smith & Son when his only son, also William Henry, became a partner.[4] The firm took advantage of the railway boom by opening news-stands on railway stations, beginning with Euston in 1848.[4] In 1850, the firm opened depots in Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool.[4] It also ran a circulating library service for a century, from 1860 to 1961.[5][6] The younger W. H. Smith also used the success of the firm as a springboard into politics, becoming an MP in 1868[4] and serving as a minister in several Conservative governments.[4]"]}}}
