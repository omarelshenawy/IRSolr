In some congenital disorders, such as Down syndrome, cytogenetics revealed the nature of the chromosomal defect: a \"simple\" trisomy. Abnormalities arising from nondisjunction events can cause cells with aneuploidy (additions or deletions of entire chromosomes) in one of the parents or in the fetus. In 1959, Lejeune[20] discovered patients with Down syndrome had an extra copy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome is also referred to as trisomy 21."]}}}
