Thus the \"hands\" of a robot are often referred to as end effectors,[32] while the \"arm\" is referred to as a manipulator.[33] Most robot arms have replaceable effectors, each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks. Some have a fixed manipulator which cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general purpose manipulator, for example a humanoid hand.[34]"]}}}
