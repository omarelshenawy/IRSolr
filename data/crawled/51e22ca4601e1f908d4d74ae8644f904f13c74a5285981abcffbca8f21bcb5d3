Waters told the Associated Press that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be \"slight\" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences.[77] Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he \"agreed to roll over for one night only\",[78] Gilmour told the Associated Press, \"The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it.\"[79] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.[80]"]}}}
