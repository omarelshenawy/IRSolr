Early analog examples of additive synthesizers are the Teleharmonium and Hammond organ. To implement real-time additive synthesis, wavetable synthesis is useful for reducing required hardware/processing power,[63] and is commonly used in low-end MIDI instruments (such as educational keyboards) and low-end sound cards."]}}}
