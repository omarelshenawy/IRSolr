In the True Law, he sets out the divine right of kings, explaining that for Biblical reasons kings are higher beings than other men, though \"the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon\".[57] The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would \"stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings\".[58] Basilikon Doron, written as a book of instruction for the four-year-old Prince Henry, provides a more practical guide to kingship.[59] The work is considered to be well written and perhaps the best example of James's prose.[60] James's advice concerning parliaments, which he understood as merely the king's \"head court\", foreshadows his difficulties with the English Commons: \"Hold no Parliaments,\" he tells Henry, \"but for the necesitie of new Lawes, which would be but seldome\".[61] In the True Law James maintains that the king owns his realm as a feudal lord owns his fief, because kings arose \"before any estates or ranks of men, before any parliaments were holden, or laws made, and by them was the land distributed, which at first was wholly theirs. And so it follows of necessity that kings were the authors and makers of the laws, and not the laws of the kings.\"[62]"]}}}
