It makes legislation and is empowered by the constitution to oversee the activities of the President and the Cabinet.[73] The lower chamber is the Chamber of Deputies, which has 80 members serving five-year terms. Twenty-four of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a joint assembly of local government officials; another three seats are reserved for youth and disabled members; the remaining 53 are elected by universal suffrage under a proportional representation system.[74] Following the 2008 election, there are 45 female deputies, making Rwanda the only country with a female majority in the national parliament.[75] The upper chamber is the 26-seat Senate, whose members are selected by a variety of bodies. A mandatory minimum of 30% of the senators are women. Senators serve eight-year terms.[76]"],"after":["Rwanda's legal system is largely based on German and Belgian civil law systems and customary law.[77] The judiciary is independent of the executive branch,[78] although the President and the Senate are involved in the appointment of Supreme Court judges.[79] Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty,[80] but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions.[81] The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised.[82] Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and the traditional Gacaca courts, which have been revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects.[83]"]}}}
