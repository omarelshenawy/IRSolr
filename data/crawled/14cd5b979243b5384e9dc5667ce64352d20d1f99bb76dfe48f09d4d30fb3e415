Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from The Wall, but also songs from Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material.[73] On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its overture, were played on the occasion of the Welcome Europe celebrations in the accession country of Malta. Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over Grand Harbour in Valletta.[74] In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks on the Internet: \"To Kill the Child\", inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and \"Leaving Beirut\", an anti-war song \"inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager\".[75]"],"after":["In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for what would be their final performance together at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of The Wall at Earls Court London 24 years earlier.[76] They played a 23-minute set consisting of \"Speak to Me/Breathe\"/\"Breathe (Reprise)\", \"Money\", \"Wish You Were Here\", and \"Comfortably Numb\". Waters told the Associated Press that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be \"slight\" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences.[77] Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he \"agreed to roll over for one night only\",[78] Gilmour told the Associated Press, \"The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it.\"[79] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.[80]"]}}}
