Elysa Gardner from USA Today called the song \"thumping\" and \"breathless\", naming it one of the standout tracks of the album.[16] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone described \"Give It 2 Me\" as a \"thumpy self-empowerment anthem\".[6] About.com listed it as one of the top tracks on Hard Candy, and called it a \"wonderful, fun Madonna song to dance to\".[4] Mark Beech from Bloomberg Television complimented the track's \"insidious beats\".[12] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it \"a little careerism on the dance floor\", for the line \"Give me a record and I'll break it\". However, she criticised the \"Get stupid\" interlude, calling it \"plain stupid\".[13] Jon Pareles from The New York Times, and Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, compared the song with Rick James' \"Super Freak\" (1981).[14][17] Mark Savage from BBC described the song as \"one of the [Hard Candy] record's few out-and-out pop moments, featuring a cute, bouncy beat, and a sense of humour that has been missing from Madonna's music since her Dick Tracy days.\"[11] Tom Ewing of Pitchfork named the song as one of Hard Candy's better tracks, possessing the album's \"most urgent tune\", stating that Madonna sings the lyrics \"Show me a record and I'll break it/ I can go on and on\" over \"hard-pushing electro-ska whose keyboards break up trying to keep pace.\"[18]"]}}}
