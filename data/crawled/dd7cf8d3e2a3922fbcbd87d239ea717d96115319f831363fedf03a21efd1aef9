(The suffix \"bidgee\" was common in Aboriginal languages for rivers in the Canberra area and presumably means \"water\" or \"river\".) The Moolinggolah people of the district around Captains Flat probably gave the Molonglo its name.[citation needed] Where the river flowed through what is now Canberra, it was probably known after the Ngambri people, transcribed as Kembury, Canberry, and other transcription variations.[citation needed]"]}}}
