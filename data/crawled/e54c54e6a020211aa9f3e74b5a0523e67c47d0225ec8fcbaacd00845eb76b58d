With about a third of the world population infected, this case-fatality ratio means 3% to 6% of the entire global population died.[34] Influenza may have killed as many as 25 million people in its first 25 weeks. Older estimates say it killed 40–50 million people,[4] while current estimates say 50–100 million people worldwide were killed.[35]"]}}}
