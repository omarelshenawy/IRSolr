During the operation, a substantial British military force was landed by the Royal Navy at Grand Baie on Île de France. Marching inland against weak French opposition, the British force was able to overwhelm the defenders in a series of minor engagements, culminating in the capture of the island's capital Port Napoleon and the surrender of Charles Decaen, the French governor. The surrender eliminated the last French territory in the Indian Ocean and among the military equipment captured were five French Navy frigates and 209 heavy cannon. Île de France was retained by Britain at the end of the war under the name of Mauritius and remained part of the British Empire until 1968."]}}}
