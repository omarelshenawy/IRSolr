Before that, Tel Aviv had had a generally low-rise skyline.[130] However, the towers were not concentrated in certain areas, and were scattered at random locations throughout the city, creating a disjointed skyline."],"after":["New neighborhoods, such as Park Tzameret, have been constructed to house apartment towers such as YOO Tel Aviv towers, designed by Philippe Starck. Other districts, such as Sarona, have been developed with office towers. Other recent additions to Tel Aviv's skyline include the 1 Rothschild Tower and First International Bank Tower.[131][132] As Tel Aviv celebrated its centennial in 2009,[133] the city attracted a number of architects and developers, including I. M. Pei, Donald Trump, and Richard Meier.[134] American journalist David Kaufman reported in New York magazine that since Tel Aviv \"was named a UNESCO World Heritage site, gorgeous historic buildings from the Ottoman and Bauhaus era have been repurposed as fabulous hotels, eateries, boutiques, and design museums.\"[135] In November 2009, Haaretz reported that Tel Aviv had 59 skyscrapers more than 100 meters tall.[136] Currently, dozens of skyscrapers have been approved or are under construction throughout the city, and many more are planned."]}}}
