In combination with a generally condescending attitude by the upper classes of Dutch society and the media towards speakers of Low Saxon varieties (or in fact anything different from Standard Dutch), this goaded many parents to stop passing the language on to their children. It also brought about a general opinion among speakers of Low Saxon that having the slightest accent in Dutch would reduce job opportunities and social status. Up to today, children using a Low Saxon expression or having an accent may be 'corrected' by their parents, who may be overheard urging them to \"speak decently\", implying Low Saxon is indecent."]}}}
