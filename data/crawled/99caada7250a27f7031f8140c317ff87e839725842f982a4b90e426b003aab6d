The line was opened in October 1849, with services from Manchester London Road[117] via Sale to Altrincham.[118] In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130Â train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham.[17] The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system.[119] Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.[120]"]}}}
