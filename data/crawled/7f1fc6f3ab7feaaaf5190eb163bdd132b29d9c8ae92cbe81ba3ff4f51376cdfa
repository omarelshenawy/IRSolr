As timber rafting allowed for connecting large continental forests, as in south western Germany, via Main, Neckar, Danube and Rhine with the coastal cities and states, early modern forestry and remote trading were closely connected. Large firs in the black forest were called „Holländer“, as they were traded to the Dutch ship yards. Large timber rafts on the Rhine had 200 till 400m length, 40m width and consisted of several thousand logs. The crew consisted of 400 till 500 men, including shelter, bakerys, ovens and livestock stables.[12] Timber rafting infrastructure allowed for large interconnected networks all over continental Europe and is still of importance in Finland."]}}}
