While it has certain appealing to large market niches (such as independent scaling of power and energy (runtime), very long durability compared to conventional batteries with solid electroactive materials) current implementations have rather low areal powers which translate into the cost of power being too high for stationary energy storage. Commercial applications of most flow batteries are appealing only for long half cycle duration stationary energy storage (such as back up grid power for emergency), since increasing a system's overall energy capacity (measured in MWh) basically requires only an increase in the size of its liquid chemical storage reservoirs."],"after":["Supercapacitors, also called electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or ultracapacitors, are generic terms for a family of electrochemical capacitors.[44] Supercapacitors don't have conventional solid dielectrics. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is determined by two storage principles, which both contribute indivisibly to the total capacitance:[45][46][47]"]}}}
