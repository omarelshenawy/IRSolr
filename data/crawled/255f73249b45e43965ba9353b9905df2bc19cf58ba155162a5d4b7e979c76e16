The environment of an organism includes both physical properties, which can be described as the sum of local abiotic factors such as solar insolation, climate and geology, as well as the other organisms that share its habitat. The term Ökologie was coined in 1866 by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel; the word is derived from the Greek οικος (oikos, \"household\") and λόγος (logos, \"study\"); therefore \"ecology\" means the \"study of the household (of nature)\"."]}}}
