By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.[52] With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, it doubled the output of the old style press.[53] Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious."],"after":["Two ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.[54] Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807.[52] Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press \"much like a hand press connected to a steam engine.\"[52] The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer."]}}}
