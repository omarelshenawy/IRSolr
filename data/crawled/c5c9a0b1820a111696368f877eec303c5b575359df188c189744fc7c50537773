These groups, collectively known as the Free Zone or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the official Church of Scientology, as well as entirely new members. Capt. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s.[194] The church labels these groups as \"squirrels\" in Scientology jargon and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.[195][196][197] More recently, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder have championed the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church.[198][199]"],"after":[]}}}
