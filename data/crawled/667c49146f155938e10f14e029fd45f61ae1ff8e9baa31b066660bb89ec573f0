These quotes directly from Mao led to other actions by the Red Guards in the views of other Maoist leaders.[43] Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the central Maoist leaders forbade \"armed struggle (武斗, wudou)\" in favor of \"verbal struggle\" (文斗, wendou), these struggle sessions often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent, especially when activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The central Maoist leaders limited their intervention in activist violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage \"physical struggle,\" and only after the PLA began to intervene in 1969 did authorities begin to suppress the mass movement."]}}}
