The article gave examples of results that differ significantly between WEIRD subjects and tribal cultures, including the Müller-Lyer illusion."],"after":["Some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices.[189] Critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence.[190] One skeptic asserts that practices, such as \"facilitated communication for infantile autism\"; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other therapies, such as rebirthing and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity.[191] In 1984, Allen Neuringer made a similar point[vague] regarding the experimental analysis of behavior.[192] Psychologists, sometimes divided along the lines of laboratory vs. clinic, continue to debate these issues.[193]"]}}}
