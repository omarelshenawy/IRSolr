It debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200, with 145,000 units shifted in its first week, achieving a gold certification after six weeks. Soon after, however, the album began to lose steam and descend the charts. It was not until the release of the second single, \"Take a Bow\", that the album picked up pace and made a noticeable rebound. The album was eventually certified 3Ã— Platinum in the United States[11] and was nominated for a Grammy Award. In the UK, the success was moderate; it debuted at number two behind Bon Jovi's Cross Road.[citation needed]"]}}}
