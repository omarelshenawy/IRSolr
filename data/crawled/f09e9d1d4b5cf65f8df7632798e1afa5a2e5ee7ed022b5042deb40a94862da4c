Please be intuitive about schools and colleges. They may not be tagged for deletion per CSD-A7, but check for copyvios from the school web site. Most mainstream high/secondary schools are notable if they are proven to exist. Middle schools and primary (elementary) schools are generally redirected to the page about the school's district (USA) or to the education section of the articles about the locality.[1] It is not necessary to tag bomb them either. People are proud of their schools and many school articles may appear to be promotional; unless it is a mere advertisement without useful content, they can be cleaned up. Cram schools or diploma mills should be treated as any other business or organisation. If an article needs attention please use the message box in the Curation Toolbar.
