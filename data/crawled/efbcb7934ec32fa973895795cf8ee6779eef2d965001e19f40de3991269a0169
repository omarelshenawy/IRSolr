As the natural tendency is to create progressively more complex structures,[27] there will be a time (Kyriazis claims this time is now[28]), when evolution of a more complex human brain will be faster via a process of developmental singularity[29] rather than through Darwinian evolution. In other words, the evolution of the human brain as we know it will cease and there will be no need for individuals to procreate and then die. Instead, a new type of development will take over, in the same individual who will have to live for many centuries in order for the development to take place. This intellectual development will be facilitated by technology such as synthetic biology, artificial intelligence and a technological singularity process."]}}}
