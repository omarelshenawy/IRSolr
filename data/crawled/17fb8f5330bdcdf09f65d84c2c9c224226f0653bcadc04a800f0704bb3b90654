The Bakersfield Amtrak Station is located downtown, at the intersection of S Street and Truxtun Avenue. The city is the southern terminus of the route. There are five Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach routes, which connect passengers to destination west, south, and east.[121] Kern Transit also uses the station as one of its hubs, connecting passengers to regions throughout Kern County.[122] Bakersfield is a planned station for the proposed California High Speed Rail system.[123]"],"after":[]}}}
