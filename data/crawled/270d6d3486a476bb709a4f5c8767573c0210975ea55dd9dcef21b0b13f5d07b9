It is useful only for n > 1,[footnote 1] and the case n = 2 is somewhat special. Namely, on an oriented Euclidean plane one can define an angle between two vectors as a number defined modulo 1 turn (usually denoted as either 2π or 360°), such that ∠y x = −∠x y. This oriented angle is equal either to the angle θ from the formula above or to −θ. If one non-zero vector is fixed (such as the first basis vector), then each non-zero vector is uniquely defined by its magnitude and angle."]}}}
