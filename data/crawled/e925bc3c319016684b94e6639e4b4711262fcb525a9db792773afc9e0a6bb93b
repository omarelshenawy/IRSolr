Outside of these states, it has a special status in the Crown dependencies (Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey), Gibraltar (one of the British Overseas Territories) and Malta and Cyprus (two former British colonies). In the Kingdom of the Netherlands, English has an official status as a regional language on the isles of Saba and Sint Eustatius.
