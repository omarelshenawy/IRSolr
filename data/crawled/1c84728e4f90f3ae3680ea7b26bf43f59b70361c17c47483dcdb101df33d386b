One is Euler's identity:[5]"],"after":["This is a special case of Euler's formula, which the physicist Richard Feynman called \"our jewel\" and \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\".[6] Modern examples include the modularity theorem, which establishes an important connection between elliptic curves and modular forms (work on which led to the awarding of the Wolf Prize to Andrew Wiles and Robert Langlands), and \"monstrous moonshine\", which connects the Monster group to modular functions via string theory for which Richard Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal."]}}}
