The term for a Christian in Hebrew is נוּצְרי (Notzri—\"Nazarene\"), a Talmudic term originally derived from the fact that Jesus came from the Galilean village of Nazareth, today in northern Israel.[18] Adherents of Messianic Judaism are referred to in modern Hebrew as יְהוּדִים מָשִׁיחַיים (Yehudim Meshihi'im—\"Messianic Jews\")."]}}}
