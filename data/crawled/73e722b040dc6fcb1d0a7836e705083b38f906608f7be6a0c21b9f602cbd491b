For example, given a domain D with boundary B in three dimensions we may define","These latter conditions are the natural boundary conditions for this problem, since they are not imposed on trial functions for the minimization, but are instead a consequence of the minimization."],"after":["and","Let u be the function that minimizes the quotient with no condition prescribed on the boundary B.
