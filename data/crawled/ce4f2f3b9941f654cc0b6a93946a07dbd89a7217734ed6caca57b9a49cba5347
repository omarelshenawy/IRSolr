Dolphins are common in Greek mythology, and many coins from ancient Greece have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin.[110] The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a shipâ€™s wake was considered a good omen.[111] In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin."]}}}
