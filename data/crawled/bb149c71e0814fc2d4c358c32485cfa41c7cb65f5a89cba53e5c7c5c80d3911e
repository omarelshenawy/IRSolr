Annas is believed to have been the former high priest, and it appears that Caiaphas sought Annas' confirmation of Caiaphas' actions. In 18:24, Jesus is sent from Annas to Caiaphas the high priest, and 18:28 states that, in the morning, Jesus was led from Caiaphas to Pontius Pilate in the Praetorium.[10][11][12]"],"after":["In all four Gospel accounts, the trial of Jesus before the priests and scribes is interleaved with the Denial of Peter narrative, where Apostle Peter who has followed Jesus denies knowing him three times.[14] Luke 22:61 states that as Jesus was bound and standing at the priest's house Peter was in the courtyard. Jesus \"turned and looked straight at him\", and Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\"[10][11][12][14]"]}}}
