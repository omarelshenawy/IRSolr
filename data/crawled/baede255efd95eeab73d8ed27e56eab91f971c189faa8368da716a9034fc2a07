According to Bede, they finally settled in Kent (where they became known as the Cantuarii), Hampshire (in Wessex), and the Isle of Wight (where they became known as the Uictuarii). There is some evidence that the Haestingas people who settled in the Hastings area of Sussex, in the 6th century, may have been Jutish in origin.[7] There are also a number of toponyms that attest to the presence of the Jutes in the area, such as Ytene, which Florence of Worcester states was the contemporary English name for the New Forest. Also the Meonwara who settled the Meon Valley area of Hampshire.[8]"]}}}
