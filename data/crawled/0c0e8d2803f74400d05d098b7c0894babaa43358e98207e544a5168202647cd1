Raw foods included on such diets have not been heated above 40 °C (104 °F).[5] Raw animal foodists believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost a lot of their nutritional value and are less bioavailable. Many believe that raw meats should come from sources such as grassfed meats or wild game rather than grainfed or factory-farmed meats."]}}}
