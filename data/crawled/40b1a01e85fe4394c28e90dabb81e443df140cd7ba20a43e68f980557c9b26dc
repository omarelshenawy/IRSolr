Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others.[80][81] However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its own favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.[82][83][84]"],"after":["The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system."]}}}
