Timbaland and Tweet performed \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\", Eve and Keyshia Cole performed \"Hot Boyz\" and \"Work It\", Fatman Scoop and Ciara performed \"Lose Control\", and Nelly Furtado performed \"Get Ur Freak On (The Remix).\"[25] Since 2007, Elliott's seventh studio album has had several different forms with extensive delays. In 2007, she worked with Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, Danja, T-Pain and DJ Toomp and planned to release an album at the beginning of 2008.[26] In January 2008, \"Ching-a-Ling\" was released as the lead single for the Step Up 2: The Streets soundtrack, which also featured \"Shake Your Pom Pom\" produced by Timbaland. While Elliott did also release the song \"Best, Best\" in 2008,[27] she renamed the album from FANomenal to its current tentative title to Block Party in 2008.[28] She later decided against Block Party and four years later, in 2012, Elliott released two Timbaland-produced singles (\"9th Inning\" and \"Triple Threat\") exclusively to iTunes.[29] Though the songs managed to chart on Billboard Hot Digital Songs,[30] in an interview with Yahoo's The Yo Show, Missy talked about her hiatus from making records: \"Your brain needs time to refresh! Things happen in your life where you can then write something else instead of the same three topics. Like, how many times we gonna talk about the club? I gotta feel like what I'm giving the fans is 100 percent and that it's game-changing. I don't just throw out microwave records.\"[31]"],"after":["In between the recording of her seventh album, Missy Elliott found success behind the scenes. Elliott's writing and production helped her reach #1 on Billboard‍ '​s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs with Keyshia Cole's \"Let It Go\" (2007), Jazmine Sullivan's \"Need U Bad\" (2008), and Monica's \"Everything to Me\" (2010). Since 2008, songs written and/or produced by Elliott for Fantasia (\"Free Yourself\"), Jennifer Hudson (\"I'm His Only Woman\"), Monica (\"Everything to Me\"), Keyshia Cole (\"Let It Go\"), and Jazmine Sullivan (\"Need U Bad\" and \"Holding You Down (Goin' in Circles)\") have all received Grammy nominations. Both Fantasia's \"Free Yourself\" (2005) and Sullivan's \"Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles)\" reached #3 on Billboard‍ '​s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. In the summer of 2010, Elliott embarked on a 2 part tour with stops in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia,[32] while she also performed at VH1's \"Hip Hop Honors: The Dirty South\" in a tribute to Timbaland, performing \"Get Ur Freak On\" and \"Work It\". In 2011 and 2012, Elliott made guest appearances on \"All Night Long\" by Demi Lovato, \"Nobody's Perfect\" by J. Cole, the remix of \"Why Stop Now\" by Busta Rhymes with Chris Brown and Lil Wayne, and a remix of Katy Perry's \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" that helped catapult \"T.G.I.F.\" to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. She also produced Monica's singles \"Anything (To Find You)\" and \"Until It's Gone\"."]}}}
