In the absence of significant external factors, humans tend to walk at about 1.4 m/s (5.0 km/h; 3.1 mph).[1][2][3] Although humans are capable of walking at speeds upwards of 2.5 m/s (9.0 km/h; 5.6 mph), humans typically choose to use only a small range within these speeds.[4] Individuals find exceptionally fast or slow speeds uncomfortable. Horses have also demonstrated normal, narrow distributions of preferred walking speed within a given gait, which suggests that the process of speed selection may follow similar patterns across species.[5] Preferred walking speed has important clinical applications as an indicator of mobility and independence. For example, elderly people or those suffering from osteoarthritis prefer to walk more slowly. Improving (increasing) preferred walking speed has therefore been a significant clinical goal in these populations."]}}}
