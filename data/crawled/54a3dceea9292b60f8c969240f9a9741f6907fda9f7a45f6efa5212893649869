Evidence suggests that colonisation of the island took place by sea some time before 6500 BC.[17] The first residents lived in small huts, hunting, fishing and gathering their food. They used small tools made of flint or bone, examples of which have been found near the coast. Representatives of these artefacts are kept at the Manx Museum.[18]"]}}}
