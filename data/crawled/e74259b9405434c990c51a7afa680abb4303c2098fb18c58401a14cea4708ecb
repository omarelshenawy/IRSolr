The Pirate Bay was first run by Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij, who are known by their nicknames \"anakata\" and \"TiAMO\", respectively. They have both been accused of \"assisting in making copyrighted content available\" by the Motion Picture Association of America. On 31 May 2006, the website's servers in Stockholm were raided and taken away by Swedish police, leading to three days of downtime.[8]"]}}}
