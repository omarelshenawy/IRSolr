Mack, who supported progressive causes, noticed that the company's strategy of using advertising for a general audience either ignored African Americans or used ethnic stereotypes in portraying blacks. He realized African Americans were an untapped niche market and that Pepsi stood to gain market share by targeting its advertising directly towards them.[8] To this end, he hired Hennan Smith, an advertising executive \"from the Negro newspaper field\"[9] to lead an all-black sales team, which had to be cut due to the onset of World War II."]}}}
