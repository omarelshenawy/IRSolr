It nearly led to war in 1878 and kindled a naval arms race from 1887 to 1902 which was only settled via British mediation. As part of the three pacts which ended the dispute, restrictions were placed on the navies of both countries. The British Royal Navy bought two Swiftsure-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.[3] Meanwhile, beginning in the late 1880s, Brazil's navy fell into obsolescence after an 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and a 1893 civil war.[4] By the turn of the 20th century it was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage,[B] despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile.[6]"],"after":["By 1904, however, Brazil began to seriously consider upgrading its navy to compete with Argentina and Chile.[5] Soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought the Brazilian economy an influx of revenue,[8] which paid for a US$31.25 million[C] naval repair scheme, a substantial amount for the time period. The bill authorized 28 ships, including three battleships and three armored cruisers.[9] It was not possible to lay down the battleships until 1906, the same year the trend-setting HMS Dreadnought was constructed. This ship prompted the Brazilians to cancel their battleship plans in favor of two Minas Geraes-class dreadnoughts.[5] The ordering of these powerful ships—designed to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the time—shocked Argentina and Chile. Historian Robert Scheina comments that the dreadnoughts alone \"outclassed the entire [elderly] Argentinian fleet.\"[10]"]}}}
