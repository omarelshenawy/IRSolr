Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with Kind of Blue (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis' earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation,[128] the entire Kind of Blue album was composed as a series of \"modal sketches\", in which each performer was given a set of scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.[129] \"I didn't write out the music for Kind of Blue, but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,\"[130] recalled Davis. The track \"So What\" has only two chords: D-7 and Eâ™­-7.[131]"],"after":["Other innovators in this style include Jackie McLean,[132] and two of the musicians who had also played on Kind of Blue: John Coltrane and Bill Evans."]}}}
