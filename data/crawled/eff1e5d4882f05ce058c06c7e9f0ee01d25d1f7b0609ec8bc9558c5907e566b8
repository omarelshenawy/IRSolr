Madonna stopped in the middle of the show to speak on the issues at hand: \"...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love.\" She continued, noting Martin Luther King, Jr. as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, \"I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love.\" She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their \"love and support of the gay community.\" She concluded, \"for people quoting the Bible, and using God as a defense mechanism: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, and Moses preached this—it's in every Holy book—'love thy neighbor as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and live our lives without fear. Amen.\"[40][41]"]}}}
