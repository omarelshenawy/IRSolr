Lady Mosley wrote to her sister, the Duchess of Devonshire, after the death of the Duke of Windsor, \"probably the theory of their [the Windsors'] contemporaries that Cake [a Mitford nickname for the Queen Mother, derived from her delighted exclamation at the party at which Deborah Devonshire first met her] was rather in love with him [the Duke] (as a girl) & took second best, may account for much.\"[82]"],"after":["The Duke and Duchess lived in France in the pre-war years. In 1937, they made a high profile visit to Germany and met Adolf Hitler at his Berchtesgaden retreat. After the visit, Hitler said of Wallis, \"she would have made a good Queen\".[83] The visit tended to corroborate the strong suspicions of many in government and society that the Duchess was a German agent,[18] a claim that she ridiculed in her letters to the Duke.[84] U.S. FBI files compiled in the 1930s also portray her as a possible Nazi sympathiser. Duke Carl Alexander of WÃ¼rttemberg told the FBI that she and leading Nazi Joachim von Ribbentrop had been lovers in London.[85] There were even rather improbable reports during World War II that she kept a signed photograph of Ribbentrop on her bedside table,[86] and had continued to pass details to him even during the invasion of France.[87]"]}}}
