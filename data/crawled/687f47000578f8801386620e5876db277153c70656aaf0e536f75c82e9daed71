Woodruff's large collection of diaries provides an important record of Latter Day Saint history, and his decision to formally end the practice of plural marriage among the members of the LDS Church in 1890 brought to a close one of the most difficult periods of church history. Woodruff joined the Latter Day Saint church on December 31, 1833. At that time, the church numbered only a few thousand believers clustered around Kirtland, Ohio. On January 13, 1835, Woodruff left Kirtland on his first full-time mission, preaching without \"purse or scrip\" in Arkansas and Tennessee. Woodruff was always known as a conservative religious man, but was also enthusiastically involved in the social and economic life of his community. As an adult, he was a farmer, horticulturist and stockman by trade and wrote extensively for church periodicals."]}}}
