Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.[87] At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.[88][89]"]}}}
