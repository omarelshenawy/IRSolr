The Royal Victorian Order is an order of knighthood awarded by the sovereign of the United Kingdom and several Commonwealth realms. It is granted personally by the monarch and recognises personal service to the monarchy, the Royal Household, royal family members, and the organisation of important royal events. The order was instituted with five grades, the highest of which was Knight Grand Cross, which conferred the status of knighthood on holders (apart from foreigners, who typically received honorary awards not entitling them to the style of a knight). Of the 97 appointments, 6 were members of King Edward VII's own family, 3 were Indian princes, 1 was an Archbishop, 31 were already peers and 56 were knights (including 8 baronets). Of the total substantive appointments, 30 were to serving commissioned officers, including General Sir John French and Admiral of the Fleet John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher. Royalty feature heavily in the foreign appointments; the King of Greece was among them, as were the future kings of Norway, Denmark, Greece and Thailand. (Full list...)"]}}}
