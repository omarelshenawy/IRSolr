A Coru単a was the main Galician port where most of them departed from. Tradition has it that the Galician emigrants thought that the A Coru単a naval flag flying on the emigrant ships was actually the flag of Galicia. Therefore, when they arrived to the new world they started flying the A Coru単a naval flag, believing that it was the flag of Galicia. Years later, the flag crossed the Atlantic back to the homeland, where it was officially adopted as the new national flag of Galicia."]}}}
