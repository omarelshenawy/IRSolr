Extremely selective and low in cytotoxicity, it was seen as the start of a new era in antiviral therapy. Aciclovir was discovered by Howard Schaffer and colleagues, and developed by Schaffer and Gertrude Elion, who was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for its development. Nucleosides isolated from a Caribbean sponge, Cryptotethya crypta, formed the basis for its synthesis. Aciclovir differs from earlier nucleoside analogues in containing only a partial nucleoside structure: the sugar ring (pictured in blue) is replaced with an open chain (pink). One of the most commonly used antiviral drugs, aciclovir is active against most viruses in the herpesvirus family. It is mainly used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, chickenpox and shingles. Aciclovir resistance is rare."]}}}
