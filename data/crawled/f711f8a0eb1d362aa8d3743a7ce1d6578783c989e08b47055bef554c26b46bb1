After completing a show in Chicago, they joined Rihanna in the studio, where Timberlake experimented with beats and melodies.[1] Weeks later, the three got together in New York City, where Timberlake had already conceptualized a song for Rihanna. Timbaland, who wanted to compose a song called \"Rehab\" for Rihanna, was producing a beat, when Timberlake came in and improvised the song over it.[1] Hannon Lane co-wrote and co-produced the song,[2][3] and Demacio Castellon recorded and mixed it in 2007 at Roc The Mic Studios in New York City.[4] Rihanna's stint with Timbaland also resulted in \"Sell Me Candy\" and \"Lemme Get That\", produced for Good Girl Gone Bad.[4][5]"]}}}
