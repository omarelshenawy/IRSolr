The term, \"Hinduism,\" is heterogeneous, as Hinduism consists of several schools of thought. It encompasses many religious rituals that widely vary in practice, as well as many diverse philosophies. Most Hindus believe in a Supreme Cosmic Spirit, which may be understood in abstract terms as Brahmaand or which may be worshipped in personal forms such as Vishnu, Shiva or Shakti. The religion has no clear cut classification, and has alternately been classified as monotheism, monism, pantheism, polytheism and even atheism. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world with approximately 1 Billion adherents, (2010), approximately 930 million of whom are in India."]}}}
