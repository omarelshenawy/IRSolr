It was what your teachers would call you. It meant that you were the lowest.\"[75] The first known use of the phrase punk rock appeared in the Chicago Tribune on March 22, 1970, attributed to Ed Sanders, cofounder of New York's anarcho-prankster band The Fugs. Sanders was quoted describing a solo album of his as \"punk rock—redneck sentimentality\".[76] In the December 1970 issue of Creem, Lester Bangs, mocking more mainstream rock musicians, ironically referred to Iggy Pop as \"that Stooge punk\".[77] Suicide's Alan Vega credits this usage with inspiring his duo to bill its gigs as a \"punk mass\" for the next couple of years.[78]"],"after":["Dave Marsh was the first music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he described ? and the Mysterians, one of the most popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a \"landmark exposition of punk rock\".[79] Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about \"...what I have chosen to call 'punk rock' bands—white teenage hard rock of '64-66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)\".[80] Robert Christgau writing for the Village Voice in October, 1971 refers to \"mid-60's punk\" as a historical period of rock-and-roll.[81] Lester Bangs would use the term \"punk rock\" in several articles written in the early 70s to refer to mid-60s garage acts. In his June, 1971 piece in Creem, \"Psyhotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung,\" he wrote \"...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter...oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever.\"[82] In several places in a 1971 article in Who Put the Bomp, Bangs refers to Britain's the Troggs and bands of their ilk as \"punk.\"[83] In the liner notes of the 1972 anthology LP, Nuggets, musician and rock journalist, Lenny Kaye, later a member of the Patti Smith Group, used variations of the term in two places: first \"punk rock,\" in the essay liner notes, to describe the genre of 60s garage bands, and then, later, \"classic garage-punk,\" in the track-by-track notes, to describe a song recorded in 1966 by The Shadows of Knight.[84][85] In June 1972, the fanzine Flash included a \"Punk Top Ten\" of 1960s albums.[86] By that December, the term was in circulation to the extent that The New Yorker‍ '​s Ellen Willis, contrasting her own tastes with those of Flash and fellow critic Nick Tosches, wrote, \"Punk-rock has become the favored term of endearment.\"[87] In February 1973, Terry Atkinson of the Los Angeles Times, reviewing the debut album by a hard rock band, Aerosmith, declared that it \"achieves all that punk-rock bands strive for but most miss.\"[88] Three months later, Billy Altman launched the short-lived punk magazine, which pre-dated the better-known 1975 publication of the same name, but, unlike the later magazine, was more devoted to covering 60s garage and psychedelic acts.[89][90][91]"]}}}
