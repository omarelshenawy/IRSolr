Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the United Kingdom there has to be some 'skill, labour, and judgment' that has gone into it.[22] In Australia and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a trademark instead."]}}}
