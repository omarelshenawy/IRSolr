There are no native land mammals, though reindeer, brown rats and mice have been introduced through the activities of man. The rats, being brought to the island as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century,[27] have destroyed tens of millions of ground-nesting birdsâ€™ eggs and chicks, and scientists plan to eradicate them over four years starting 2011. It will be by far the largest rodent eradication attempt in the world to date.[28][29][30] The project is being led by zoologist Anthony Martin of The University of Dundee who states, \"This is a man-induced problem and it's about time that man put right earlier errors.\"[31] In July 2013, the success of the main phase of the extermination of the rats, which took place in May that year, was announced. 180 tonnes of rat poison, brodifacoum, has been dropped over 70% of the island, in what was the world's largest ever operation of this kind.[32] The island is currently separated by glaciers, but as the climate warms the island's natural glaciers are slowly melting.[33] As this continues, there will no longer be a natural barrier preventing the rats from spreading. 100% eradication is hoped to be achieved by 2015. Another 95t of rat poison will be dropped by three helicopters in the January summer 2015.[34]"]}}}
