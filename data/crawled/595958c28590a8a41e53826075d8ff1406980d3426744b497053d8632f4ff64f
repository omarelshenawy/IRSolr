Since various differentials, derivatives, and functions become inevitably related to each other via equations, a differential equation is the result, describing dynamical phenomena, evolution, and variation. Often, quantities are defined as the rate of change of other quantities (time derivatives), or gradients of quantities, which is how they enter differential equations."]}}}
