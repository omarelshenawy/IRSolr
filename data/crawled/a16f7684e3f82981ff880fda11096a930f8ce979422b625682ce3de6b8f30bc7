On May 1948, Syrian forces invaded Palestine, together with other Arab states, and immediately attacked Jewish settlements.[67] Their president, Shukri al-Quwwatli instructed his troops in the front, “to destroy the Zionists\".[68][69] The Invasion purpose was prevention of the establishment of the State of Israel.[70] Defeat in this war was one of several trigger factors for the March 1949 Syrian coup d'état by Col. Husni al-Za'im, described as the first military overthrow of the Arab World[70] since the start of the Second World War. This was soon followed by another overthrow, by Col. Sami al-Hinnawi, who was himself quickly deposed by Col. Adib Shishakli, all within the same year.[70]"]}}}
