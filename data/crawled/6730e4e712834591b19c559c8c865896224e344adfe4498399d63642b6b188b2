Ontario's Sum 41 reached the Canadian top ten with its 2001 debut album, All Killer, No Filler, which eventually went platinum in the United States. The record included the number one U.S. Alternative hit \"Fat Lip\", which incorporated verses of what one critic called \"brat rap.\"[370]"],"after":["The effect of commercialization on the music became an increasingly contentious issue. As observed by scholar Ross Haenfler, many punk fans \"'despise corporate punk rock', typified by bands such as Sum 41 and Blink 182\".[371] At the same time, politicized and independent-label punk continued to thrive in the United States. Since 1993, Anti-Flag had been putting progressive politics at the center of its music. The administration of George W. Bush provided them and similarly minded acts eight years of conservative government to excoriate. Rise Against was the most successful of these groups, registering top ten records in 2006 with The Sufferer & the Witness and two years later with Appeal to Reason.
