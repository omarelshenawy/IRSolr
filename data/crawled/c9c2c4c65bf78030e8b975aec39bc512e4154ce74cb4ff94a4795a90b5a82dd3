There are religions (including Buddhism and Taoism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or nontheistic. The true opposite of \"religious\" is the word \"irreligious\". Irreligion describes an absence of any religion; antireligion describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general."]}}}
