It follows, essentially from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, that f∞ is absolutely summable. The sum of this series is a continuous function, equal to f, since the Fourier series converges in the mean to f:"],"after":["This result can be proven easily if f is further assumed to be C2, since in that case tends to zero as n → ∞. More generally, the Fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to f, provided that f satisfies a Hölder condition of order α > ½. In the absolutely summable case, the inequality   proves uniform convergence."]}}}
