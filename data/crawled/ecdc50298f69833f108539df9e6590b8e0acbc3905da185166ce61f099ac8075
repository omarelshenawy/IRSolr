Metabolism is the modification of biological chemicals by a complex network of enzymatic chemical reactions which occur within the cell. Metabolic processes are vital for life, they provide the raw ingredients for all cell processes, including protein biosynthesis and DNA replication, produce energy for the cell in the form of ATP and breakdown harmful substances such as ethanol. Metabolism is broken down into many separate interconnecting metabolic pathways for ease of study."],"after":[]}}}
