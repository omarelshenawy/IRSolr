From Columbus Circle northward, Broadway becomes a wide boulevard to 169th Street; it retains landscaped center islands that separate northbound from southbound traffic. The medians are a vestige of the central mall of \"The Boulevard\" that had become the spine of the Upper West Side, and many of these contain public seating."]}}}
