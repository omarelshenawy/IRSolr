It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.[125] Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versionsâ€”flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.[126] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".[127] Alfred Pollard termed some of them \"bad quartos\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.[128] Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers.[129] In some cases, for example Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto, that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.[130]"]}}}
