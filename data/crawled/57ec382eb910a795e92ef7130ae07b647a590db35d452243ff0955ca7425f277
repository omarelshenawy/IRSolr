The five most important differential operations in vector calculus are:"],"after":["where the curl and divergence differ because the former uses a cross product and the latter a dot product, denotes a scalar field and denotes a vector field. A quantity called the Jacobian is useful for studying functions when both the domain and range of the function are multivariable, such as a change of variables during integration."]}}}
