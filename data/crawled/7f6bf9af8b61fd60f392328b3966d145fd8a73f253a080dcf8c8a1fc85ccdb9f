In ancient Greek comedy, the finger was a gesture of insult toward another person, with the term katapugon also referring to \"a male who submits to anal penetration\"[11] or katapygaina to a female.[12] In Aristophanes's comedy The Clouds (423 BC),[13] when the character Socrates is quizzing his student on poetic meters, Strepsiades declares that he knows quite well what a dactyl is, and gives the finger. The gesture is a visual pun on the two meanings of the Greek word dactylos, both \"finger\" and the rhythmic measure composed of a long syllable and two short, like the joints of a finger (— ‿ ‿, which also appears as a visual pun on the penis and testicles in a medieval Latin text[14]). Socrates reacts to the gesture as boorish and childish.[13][15] The gesture recurs as a form of mockery in Peace, alongside farting in someone's face;[16][17] the usage is later explained in the Suda and included in the Adagia of Erasmus.[18][19] The verb \"to play the Siphnian\" appears in a fragment of Aristophanes and has a similar meaning;[20][21] the usage is once again explained in the Suda, where it is said to mean \"to touch the anus with a finger\".[22] Diogenes Laertius records how the Cynic philosopher Diogenes directed the gesture at the orator Demosthenes in 4th-century BC Athens.[6] In the Discourses of Epictetus, Diogenes's target is instead one of the sophists.[23]"]}}}
