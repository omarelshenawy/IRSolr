The sales were less than Madonna's previous studio album, Music, which debuted with 420,000 copies in 2000, but was the only one that week to sell over 200,000 copies.[92] It was Madonna's second consecutive number one debut, and her fifth number one album overall in the US.[93] The next week, sales dropped by 62% to 91,000 copies, and the album slid from the top of the chart to number eight.[94] It continued to decrease in sales down the chart and fell off the Billboard 200. In September 2003, following Madonna's performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, the album saw a sales gain of 19%, but did not chart back.[95] On July 7, 2003, just months after the release, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipment of one million copies in the US alone.[96] However, it became the second lowest selling studio album by Madonna behind her 2012 release MDNA, with sales of 680,000 copies as of October 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[97][98] It ranked at number 125 on the year-end ranking of the albums by Billboard.[99] In Canada, the album debuted at the top of the Canadian Albums Chart with sales of 18,000 copies on May 10, 2003. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the sum was considerably less than her previous studio efforts, Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000), which debuted with 59,000 and 50,000 copies respectively.[100][101] It gained a Platinum certification one month later from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for shipment of 100,000 copies of the album.[102]"]}}}
