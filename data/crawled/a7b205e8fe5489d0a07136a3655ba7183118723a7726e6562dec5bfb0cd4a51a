This involves modelling components of musical objects and creating systems that define action, filters, envelopes and other parameters over time. Various models can also be combined, e.g. the model of a violin with characteristics of a pedal steel guitar and the action of piano hammer. When an initial set of parameters is run through the physical simulation, the simulated sound is generated. Although physical modeling was not a new concept in acoustics and synthesis, it was not until the development of the Karplus-Strong algorithm and the increase in DSP power in the late 1980s that commercial implementations became feasible. The quality and speed of physical modeling on computers improves with higher processing power."]}}}
