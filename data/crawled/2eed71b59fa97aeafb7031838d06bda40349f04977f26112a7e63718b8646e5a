Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK.[31] The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was \"heavy and hard, brutal and direct\", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated.[32] Steve Waksman has suggested that Led Zeppelin II was \"the musical starting point for heavy metal\".[33]"]}}}
