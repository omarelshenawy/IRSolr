In his The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Freud's analysis starts from the premise that \"the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations\".[83] After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an \"Oedipal desire for his mother and the subsequent guilt [is] preventing him from murdering the man [Claudius] who has done what he unconsciously wanted to do\".[84] Confronted with his repressed desires, Hamlet realises that \"he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish\".[83] Freud suggests that Hamlet's apparent \"distaste for sexuality\"—articulated in his \"nunnery\" conversation with Ophelia—accords with this interpretation.[85][86] This \"distaste for sexuality\" has sparked theories of Hamlet being what is now referred to as a homosexual or asexual.[87] John Barrymore's long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, \"broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character\", in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian.[88] He had a \"blunter intention\" than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.[89]"]}}}
