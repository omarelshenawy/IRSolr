Priya Elan from NME said the song \"seems to soar effortlessly\" and that \"what Madonna's doing in this song is so much more impossibly fun than we could have imagined.\" She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album, Hard Candy.[35] Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is \"a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits. Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj, and the less so M.I.A., tell us what decade we're in.\"[36] Michael Cragg from The Guardian wrote that: \"it's not bad. Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given all the love she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited.\" Speaking of the rap part, he thought that \"Minaj certainly does her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum.\"[37] Andrew Hampp from Billboard gave the song a score of 60/100[38] and said \"It amounts to a subpar effort from all parties, particularly Madonna, who hasn't sounded this robotic since the more tweaked-out moments on her last album, Hard Candy.\"[39]"]}}}
