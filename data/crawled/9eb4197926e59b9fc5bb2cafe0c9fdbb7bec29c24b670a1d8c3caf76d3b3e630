These brands, which are advertised in store as \"Only at Macy's\", account for 20% of the company's sales. The merchandise in each brand is designed to appeal to different demographics and customers. Bar III, the most recent addition to the company's portfolio, was launched in Spring 2011.[42] Some of Macy's private brands are sold internationally in non-competing department stores.[43]"],"after":["Macy's distinguishes its \"private brands\" from its \"labels\". The company has said the difference is \"subtle but important\", in that Macy's \"private brands\" are claimed to have fully developed brand profiles targeted to specific consumers and supported with national advertising and branded in-store environments, whereas a \"label\" is just a name attached to a category of merchandise that fills a niche in Macy's assortments.[1]:15"]}}}
