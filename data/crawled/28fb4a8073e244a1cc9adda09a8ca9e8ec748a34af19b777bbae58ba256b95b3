His association with the Tào Té Chīng has led him to be traditionally considered the founder of philosophical Taoism (pronounced as \"Daoism\"). He is also revered as a deity in most religious forms of Taoist philosophy, which often refers to Laozi as Taishang Laojun, or \"One of the Three Pure Ones\". According to Chinese traditions, Laozi lived in the 6th century BCE. Some historians contend that he actually lived in the 5th–4th century BCE, concurrent with the Hundred Schools of Thought and Warring States period, while some others argue that Laozi is a synthesis of multiple historical figures or that he is a mythical figure. A central figure in Chinese culture, both nobility and common people claim Laozi in their lineage. He was honored as an ancestor of the Tang imperial family, and was granted the title Táishāng xuānyuán huángdì, meaning \"Supreme Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\". Throughout history, Laozi's work has been embraced by various anti-authoritarian movements."]}}}
