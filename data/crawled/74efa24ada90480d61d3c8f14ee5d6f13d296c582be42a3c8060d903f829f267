P. Willis) and one of the first commercially successful magazine writers in America.[43] In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold.[44] During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year,[43] a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.[3]"]}}}
