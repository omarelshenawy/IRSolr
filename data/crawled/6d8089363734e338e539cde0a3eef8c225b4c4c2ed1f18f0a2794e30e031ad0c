Thomas, an American sociologist who had come to Poland in connection with his research on Polish immigrants in the United States. Thomas and Znaniecki had begun to collaborate, and soon Thomas invited Znaniecki to come to Chicago to continue work with him in the United States.[27][28] In July 1914, just on the eve of World War I, Znaniecki left Poland to work with Thomas as a research assistant.[28][29] From 1917 to 1919 Znaniecki also lectured in sociology at the University of Chicago.[30]"]}}}
