A major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.[367] China's family planning minister indicated in 2008 that the one-child policy would be maintained until at least 2020.[368] The one-child policy is resisted, particularly in rural areas, primarily because of the need for agricultural labour and a traditional preference for boys. Families who breach the policy often lie during the census.[369] Data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may now be around 1.4.[370]"],"after":["The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may be contributing to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth.[371][372] According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls,[373] which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls.[374] The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population.[373] However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population.[373]"]}}}
