He befriended and picked up material from folk singers there, including Dave Van Ronk, Fred Neil, Odetta, the New Lost City Ramblers, and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem.[26] In September, Dylan gained public recognition when Robert Shelton wrote a review in The New York Times of a show at Gerde's Folk City.[27] The same month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester's third album, which brought his talents to the attention of the album's producer, John Hammond.[28] Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October. The performances on his first Columbia album, Bob Dylan, in March 1962,[29] consisted of familiar folk, blues and gospel with two original compositions. The album sold only 5,000 in its first year, enough to break even.[30] Within Columbia Records, some referred to the singer as \"Hammond's Folly\"[31] and suggested dropping his contract, but Hammond defended Dylan and was supported by Johnny Cash.[30] In March 1962, Dylan contributed harmonica and back-up vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen, accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records.[32] While working for Columbia, Dylan recorded under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt,[33] for Broadside, a folk magazine and record label.[34] Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on The Blues Project, a 1964 anthology album by Elektra Records.[33] As Tedham Porterhouse, Dylan played harmonica on Ramblin' Jack Elliott's 1964 album, Jack Elliott.[33]"],"after":["Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan,[36] and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman.[37] (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.)[38] Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty.[39] Dylan said, \"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figureÂ ... you could smell him coming.\"[18] Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond's being replaced as producer of Dylan's second album by the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson.[40]"]}}}
