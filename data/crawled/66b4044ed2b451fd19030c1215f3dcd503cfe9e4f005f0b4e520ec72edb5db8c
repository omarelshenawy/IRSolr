Each canonical basis consists of 2n elements. Every multivector of the geometric algebra can be expressed as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements. If the canonical basis elements are {Bi | iâˆˆS} with S being an index set, then the geometric product of any two multivectors is"],"after":[]}}}
