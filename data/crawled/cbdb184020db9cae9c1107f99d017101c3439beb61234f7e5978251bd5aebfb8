Bulgarian Wikipedia has Bulgarian alphabet (Cyrillic) interface and users can include Cyrillic letters for their Wikipedia names although the common practice is that the user name is registered in Latin alphabet and the userboxes and all other personal content is in Cyrillic. This is also due to the need of one username for all Wikipedia languages registrations and edits while many of the Bulgarian Wikipedians also contribute to the English, French, etc. Wikipedias where Cyrrillic nicknames maybe hard to read or guess."],"after":["The Bulgarian Wikipedia was created on 6 December 2003. In 2005 Bulgarian Wikipedia added its 20,000th article and was the 21st largest Wikipedia at the time. Later in 2007 it was the 30th largest Wikipedia by article count, with over 50,000 articles.[2][3] In 24 May 2010, the distinctive Wikipedia globe logo for the Bulgarian Wikipedia was temporarily altered to include the number 100,000 to commemorate the 100,000 article milestone, it became the 32nd largest Wikipedia by size and now it holds 36th place with more than 150'000 articles."]}}}
