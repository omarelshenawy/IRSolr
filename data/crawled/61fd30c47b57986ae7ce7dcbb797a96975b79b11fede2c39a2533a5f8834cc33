Godbolt remembers that in 1951 it was used to refer to the fans of Old Etonian jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton who would turn up in droves to the 100 Club in Oxford Street, London and shout in loud, upper class voices between songs, \"Hooray!, Hooray!\". Lyttelton himself has commented on the term but credits Runyon with coining it; he once stated in an interview, \"In jazz circles, aggressively \"upper class\" characters are known as Hoorays, an adaption, I believe, of Damon Runyon's \"Hooray Henries\".[11] For the English language specialist David Crystal, the term is usually given to the \"loud-mouthed ineffectual upper class twit\". He explains that it began appearing in British literature in the 1950s, although the Americans then \"seemed to lose track of the term\". As a result, it was often included in British English guides in order to assist Americans.[9] By the 1960s, the term was likened to Sloane Rangers,[12] a term later applied to women such as Lady Diana Spencer before she married Prince Charles.[13]"]}}}
