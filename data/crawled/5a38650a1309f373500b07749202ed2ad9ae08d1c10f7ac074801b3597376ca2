If we assume by contradiction that a := p(z0) ≠ 0, then, expanding p(z) in powers of z − z0 we can write"],"after":["When r is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for |p(z)| is strictly smaller than |a|, in contradiction to the definition of z0. (Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction θ0 such that if one approaches z0 from that direction one can obtain values p(z) smaller in absolute value than |p(z0)|.)"]}}}
