In the same sources, implicit ODE systems with a singular Jacobian are termed differential algebraic equations (DAEs). This distinction is not merely one of terminology; DAEs have fundamentally different characteristics and are generally more involved to solve than (nonsigular) ODE systems.[14][15] Presumably for additional derivatives, the Hessian matrix and so forth are also assumed non-singular according to this scheme,[citation needed] although note that any ODE of order greater than one can [and usually is] rewritten as system of ODEs of first order,[16] which makes the Jacobian singularity criterion sufficient for this taxonomy to be comprehensive at all orders."],"after":["a function u: I ⊂ R → R is called the solution or integral curve for F, if u is n-times differentiable on I, and","Given two solutions u: J ⊂ R → R and v: I ⊂ R → R, u is called an extension of v if I ⊂ J and"]}}}
