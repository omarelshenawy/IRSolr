A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145â€“147) due to a pairing-off failure.[32] A proposal for a broader language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008. It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag and entered into effect on 1 July 2009.[33]"]}}}
