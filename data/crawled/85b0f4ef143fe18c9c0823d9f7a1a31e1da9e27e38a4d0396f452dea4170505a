The frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with Jupiter's moon, Europa. If life was discovered in Lake Vostok, it would strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Europa.[36] On 7 February 2008, a NASA team embarked on a mission to Lake Untersee, searching for extremophiles in its highly alkaline waters. If found, these resilient creatures could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in extremely cold, methane-rich environments.[37]"],"after":[]}}}
