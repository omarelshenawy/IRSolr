In areas not served by these systems, hand pumps and managed springs are used.[166] Despite rainfall exceeding 100 centimetres (39Â in) annually in many areas,[122] little use is made of rainwater harvesting.[166] Access to sanitation remains low; the United Nations estimates that in 2006, 34% of urban and 20% of rural dwellers had access to improved sanitation.[167] Government policy measures to improve sanitation are limited, focusing only on urban areas.[167] The majority of the population, both urban and rural, use public shared pit latrines for sanitation.[167]"]}}}
