The duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians and Madonna hired the duo after just discussing the concept for six minutes.[25][26] The photo shoot for the album was done by photographer Craig McDean in January 2003 at Los Angeles, and cost a reported $415,000.[27] McDean had already worked with Madonna for the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in October 2002; this shoot had a military theme, with Madonna posing in dark green and black cloths, combat boots, and guns.[27]"],"after":["As with 1989's album Like a Prayer, Madonna's hair was dyed dark brown to signify \"seriousness\", and on the cover of the album Madonna wore a beret while resurrecting the famous Guerrillero Heroico image of Guevara.[27] In an interview with Veja magazine, she described Guevara as \"an icon instantaneously identified with an revolution spirit. That goes for the whole album: the current moment, I feel a revolutionary state of mind\".[28] Author Santiago Fouz-Hern√°ndez wrote in his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Subcultural Transformations, that the inclusion of Guevara as an inspiration for the cover was one of the many instances of Madonna incorporating Hispanic identity and the Latino subculture in her work.[29] Because of the paramilitary theme, the dyed hair and the artistic composition, was compared with an infamous seventies photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress, Patty Hearst.[30] The cover also had military styled stenciled lettering. The word \"American Life\" is written in blood red color and has a punk-rock style.[27][31] Inside the CD booklet, she wielded an Uzi submachine gun, her body in various martial art poses, spelling out her name.[27] By late 2003, she had wiped out the military image completely, and followed with another subtle toned-down image of that of a writer and philanthropist.[24]"]}}}
