For our current example, If we subtract the first equation from the second we get: The in the first equation is subtracted from the in the second equation leaving no term. The variable has been eliminated. We then solve the remaining equation for , in the same way as in the substitution method. We next place this value of in either of the original equations and solve for :"]}}}
