The Equestrian segment of the show began with images of Madonna, riding crop in hand, and horses cantering across windswept plains on the big screens.[9] A giant disco ball was then lowered onstage, and opened like a flower bud to reveal Madonna inside.[10] As she took her dancers' reins, she performed \"Future Lovers/I Feel Love\". This was followed by \"Get Together\" backed by her dancers in horse reins.[10] She rode a carousel horse-like dancepole during \"Like a Virgin\". The backdrops displayed the X-Ray of Madonna's broken bones, which she had during a previous accident.[9][11] \"Jump\" followed this performance, where the dancers displayed the physical discipline parkour.[12][13] After Madonna disappeared backstage, three of her dancers then revealed personal tragedies during an interlude called \"Confessions\".[12][13] The second segment titled Bedouin started with Madonna appearing on a mirrored crucifix to sing \"Live to Tell\" as a death toll of African AIDS victims counted down onscreen above her.[10] She stepped down off the cross to perform \"Forbidden Love\" where two male dancers intertwined each other while displaying religious symbolism on the screens like blood corpuscles connecting to form symbols of hope and unity.[9][11] Madonna brought a guest vocalist from her Confessions on a Dance Floor album onstage for \"Isaac\", when a female dancer in an oversized Middle-Eastern burka danced within a cage with the backdrops displaying sand dunes.[10][11] Madonna then recreated the dance-off scene from her \"Sorry\" music video live with her troupe for her performance of the song.[9] The performance was followed by the song \"Like It Or Not\" where burlesque-style dancing was performed by Madonna with the help of a chair as a prop. After the performance, her dancers performed krump dancing for a remix interlude of \"Sorry\" as social, political, and ecological images flashed onscreens.[9]"]}}}
