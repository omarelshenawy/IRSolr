Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the College's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty.[88] The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking façade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.[89] Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium.[88] The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes (\"Hinman boxes\")[90] and the Courtyard Café dining facility.[91] The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation,[92] and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.[93]"],"after":["In addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus[94] and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library.[95] The Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School.[96] The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River.[95] The Thayer School presently comprises two buildings;[95] Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas.[97] The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library.[97]"]}}}
