In 1970 the band's contracts with both Allen Klein and Decca Records ended (cf. \"Schoolboy Blues\"), and amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, Rolling Stones Records. Sticky Fingers (UK number 1; US 1), released in March 1971, the band's first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover design by Andy Warhol.[98] The Stones' Decca catalogue is currently owned by Klein's ABKCO label."],"after":["Sticky Fingers was the first to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which effectively became the band's logo. It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, \"Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own ... It quickly and deservedly became the most famous logo in the history of popular music.\"[99] The tongue and lips design was part of a package that, in 2003, VH1 named the \"No. 1 Greatest Album Cover\" of all time.[98]"]}}}
