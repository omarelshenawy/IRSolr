Madonna's friend Debi Mazar was hired as the make-up artist for the video while Maripol was the stylist with Madonna's then boyfriend Ken Compton appearing as her onscreen lover. By the time the video was released, MTV had begun to show dance music videos. Hence the music video of \"Burning Up\" became a minor hit on the channel.[17] The narrative of the video shows Madonna in a white dress, as she sings the song proclaiming her helpless passion for her lover.[18] She wore her famous rubber bracelets which were actually typewriter belts.[5] Her love for the boy portrayed her as a helpless victim like the stereotyped female portrayed in many silent movies. At one point in the video Madonna is shown being hit by a car driven by a young man, played by Compton. By the end of the song Madonna is shown driving the car, with a knowing, defiant smile on her lips and has ditched the man, thereby giving the message that she was in charge, a theme recurrent throughout her career.[17]"]}}}
