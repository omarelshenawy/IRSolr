It was released on July 10, 2009, by Epic Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the producers for the song. A Spanish-language translation of the song titled \"Loba\", which features additional lyrical contributions by Jorge Drexler, was also released earlier on July 6. Musically, \"She Wolf\" is a disco and hi-NRG-inspired electropop track that details Shakira's boredom due to her uncaring partner, and how she looks for others to please her. In addition to favourable reviews from critics, the single was a commercial success, going platinum in Italy and the United States, and double-platinum in Spain."]}}}
