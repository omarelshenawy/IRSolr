From its formation until 1992, it was the only legally permitted party in the country. This changed on 1 July 1992, when amendments to the Constitution[48]:ยง 3 and a number of laws permitting and regulating the formation and operations of more than one political party were enacted by the National Assembly.[citation needed] Elections for president and all National Assembly seats were last held in October 2010.[citation needed] The CCM holds approximately 75% of the seats in the assembly.[citation needed]"]}}}
