Fryderyk lived with his family in the Palace grounds. The father played the flute and violin;[9] the mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept.[10] Chopin was of slight build, and even in early childhood was prone to illnesses.[11]"],"after":["Fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the Czech pianist Wojciech Żywny.[12] His elder sister Ludwika also took lessons from Żywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother.[13] It quickly became apparent that he was a child prodigy. By the age of seven Fryderyk had begun giving public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two polonaises, in G minor and B-flat major.[14] His next work, a polonaise in A-flat major of 1821, dedicated to Żywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.[12]"]}}}
