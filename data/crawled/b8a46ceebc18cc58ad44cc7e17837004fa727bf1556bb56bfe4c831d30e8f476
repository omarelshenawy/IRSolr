The different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store, and in how long it takes for the 14 C generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them. This affects the ratio of 14 C to 12 C in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir.[5] The atmosphere, which is where 14 C is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the 14 C it contains mixes in less than seven years.[18][20] The ratio of 14 C to 12 C in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of 14 C to 12 C, it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that some of the 14 C has decayed.[14] The ocean surface is an example: it contains 2.4% of the carbon in the exchange reservoir,[18] but there is only about 95% as much 14 C as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere.[5] The time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years,[21] but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir.[14] Water in the deep ocean takes about 1,000 years to circulate back through surface waters, and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water, with depleted 14 C, and water recently at the surface, with 14 C in equilibrium with the atmosphere.[14]"]}}}
