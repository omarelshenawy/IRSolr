Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the Lord Chancellor in a production of Iolanthe.[143] Alternatively, Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer is recorded as objecting so strongly to Iolanthe's comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office.[119] British politicians, beyond quoting some of the more famous lines, have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches. These include Conservative Peter Lilley's speech mimicking the form of \"I've got a little list\" from The Mikado, listing those he was against, including \"sponging socialists\" and \"young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue\".[119] Political humour based on Gilbert and Sullivan's style and characters continues to be written.[144]"],"after":[]}}}
