After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume \"Library Edition\", completed in 1912 by his friends Edward Tyas Cook and Alexander Wedderburn.[186] The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, John A. Hobson observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, \"the spell of his eloquence is broken\".[187] Clive Wilmer has written, further, that \"the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts\" is \"something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start\".[188] Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration."]}}}
