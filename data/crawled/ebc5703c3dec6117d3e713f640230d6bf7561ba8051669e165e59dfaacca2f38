Gaye's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page lists the Capris' song, God Only Knows as \"critical to his musical awakening.\"[88] Of the Capris' song, Gaye said, \"It fell from the heavens and hit me between the eyes. So much soul, so much hurt. I related to the story, to the way that no one except the Lord really can read the heart of lonely kids in love.\"[89] Gaye's main musical influences were Rudy West of The Five Keys, Clyde McPhatter, Ray Charles and Little Willie John.[90][91] Gaye considered Frank Sinatra a major influence in what he wanted to be.[91] He also was influenced by the vocal styles of Billy Eckstine and Nat King Cole.[92]"]}}}
