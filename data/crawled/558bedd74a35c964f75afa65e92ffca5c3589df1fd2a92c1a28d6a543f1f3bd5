The Hall itself, the stables, and the carriage house of Dunham Massey are all Grade I listed buildings, three of six such buildings in Trafford.[7]"],"after":["The site is moated and lies immediately west of the village of Dunham, with the deer park to the south. The Hall was donated to the National Trust by Roger Grey, 10th and last Earl of Stamford, in 1976. The Hall was used as a military hospital during the First World War. Inside is a significant collection of Huguenot silver, the carving The Crucifixion by 17th-century wood carver Grinling Gibbons, and a white marble bust of the Emperor Hadrian; the head is antique, but the neck and shoulders are 18th-century; it was probably acquired by the George, Earl of Stamford and Warrington. The collection of paintings in the Hall include Allegory with Venus, Mars, Cupid and Time by Guercino; The Cascade at Terni by Louis Ducros; and portraits by William Beechey, Francis Cotes, Michael Dahl, A. R. Mengs, Sir Joshua Reynolds, George Romney, Enoch Seeman, and Zoffany. George Harry, Earl of Stamford and Warrington removed a selection of paintings to Enville Hall[8] in the late 1850s, and it was not until Roger Grey, 10th Earl of Stamford succeeded as Earl, that some were rebought by the family after sales in 1929 and 1931.[9] The deer park at Dunham Massey is the only medieval park in Trafford or the surrounding area still surviving.[6] The hall and grounds are open to the public and are a popular tourist attraction, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2010.[10][11]"]}}}
