The building was dubbed the Variety Building because a red, illuminated \"Variety\" sign graced the top north and south sides of the building. In early 2014, the sign and offices moved west to 11175 Santa Monica Blvd. in Westwood, where Variety shares the 9-story building with parent company PMC and its other editorial properties, including Deadline.com and the West Coast offices of Women's Wear Daily."]}}}
