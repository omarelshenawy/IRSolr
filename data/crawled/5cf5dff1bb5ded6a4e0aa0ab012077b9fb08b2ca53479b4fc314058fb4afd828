The studio was designed to have excellent views of the Catskill and Berkshire Mountains, and had excellent natural lighting.[9] The Clifton Park Historic Preservation Commission awarded \"The Castle\" its Historic Designation plaque,[11] and a \"Clifton Park Register of Historic Places\" sign also marks the studio property. The home is now a private residence, and it is not open to the public. Baker also had a studio in the Knickerbocker Building in New York City."],"after":["Baker was just beginning to hit his stride as a landscape painter in the Realism movement[7] when he died on November 20, 1886[8] at the age of 26[n 3] of a cold[5] at his father's house at Hoosick Falls, New York after sustaining injuries while ice skating.[1][3][9] His final work was Meadow Brook.[12] Baker completed over 130 paintings in his career.[7]"]}}}
