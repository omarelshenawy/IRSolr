The act, along with the economic prosperity of the 1960s, contributed to rising black wages, increased education for blacks, and increased returns to education.[4] Indeed, in 1940, black men's weekly wages were only 48.4 percent of white men's wages. In 1990, black men's wages were 75 percent of white men's, a 60 percent improvement over five decades.[12]"]}}}
