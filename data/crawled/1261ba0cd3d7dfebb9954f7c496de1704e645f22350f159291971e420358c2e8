Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he \"did not want her children to have to read it.\"[70] He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013.[70][71] In the reams of literary criticism and biography published after their deaths, after the release of new material, biopics, or any old-new controversy, the debate over Plath's literary estate is very often reduced to black and white, that is, whose story the readers choose.[72] Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas.[73][74]"]}}}
