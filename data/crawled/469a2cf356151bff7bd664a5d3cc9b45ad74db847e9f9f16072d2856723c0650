In its final form, the 156 km (97 mi) wall consisted of inner and outer concrete walls separated by a \"death strip\"[11] some 15 m (49 ft) to 150 m (490 ft) wide. It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches. The shooting orders, or Schießbefehl, issued to the border guards instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals, and that the use of deadly force was required to deal with them: \"Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used\".[21] Some guards have since claimed that the motto at the time was \"a dead refugee is better than an escaped one\".[22] At first, wounded or shot refugees were left out in the open until they were removed, so that people from West Berlin and the western press could see them as well. After the reactions to the public death of Peter Fechter, border guards were ordered to move any casualties out of West Berlin's field of view. Negative reporting was ought to be prevented. Because of this, border guars often pulled people down into the car-moat that was part of the whole border security system. In some cases, the removal of the body was done only after nightfall."]}}}
