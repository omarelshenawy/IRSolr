As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the Great Powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution and Greek War of Independence marked the birth of nationalism in the Balkans.[124] Formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878."],"after":["The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment, and the rise of a new working class.[125] Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the first laws on child labour, the legalisation of trade unions,[126] and the abolition of slavery.[127] In Britain, the Public Health Act of 1875 was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities.[128] Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[129] The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the Irish Potato Famine, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people.[130] In the 19th century, 70 million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States.[131]"]}}}
