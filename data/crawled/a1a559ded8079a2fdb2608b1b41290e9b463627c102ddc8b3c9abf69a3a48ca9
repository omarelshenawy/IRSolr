Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore physics is sometimes called the \"fundamental science\".[43] Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together."]}}}
