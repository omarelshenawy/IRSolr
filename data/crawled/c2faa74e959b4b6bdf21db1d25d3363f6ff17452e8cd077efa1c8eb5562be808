The shows featured an introductory verse from \"Family Affair\" by Sly and the Family Stone.[44][45] Madonna wore an all-black ensemble involving a cage vest, the longline bra, skintight shorts, knee-pads and a bowler hat. Her getup was a nod to actress Liza Minnelli in the film Cabaret.[44] The performance started with her dancers appearing on the stage, with chairs on their back. Madonna appeared in their middle and started doing push-ups on the stage. She started singing \"Family Affair\", then mid-way through the song, changed to \"Keep It Together\".[46] During the intermediate music, Madonna and her dancers performed an intricate choreography with the chairs. At the end, all the musicians, dancers and collaborators came to say good-bye to Madonna. The singer was left alone on stage to finish with a powerful repeat of her line \"Keep people together forever and ever\".[46]"]}}}
