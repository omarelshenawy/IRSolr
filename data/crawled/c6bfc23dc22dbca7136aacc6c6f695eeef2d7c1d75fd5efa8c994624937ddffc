In other words, future cash flows are exponentially discounted (exp) by the sum (integral, ) of the future discount rates ( for future, r(v) for discount rates), while past cash flows are worth 0 (), because they have already occurred. Note that the value at the moment of a cash flow is not well-defined – there is a discontinuity at that point, and one can use a convention (assume cash flows have already occurred, or not already occurred), or simply not define the value at that point."]}}}
