The project eventually involved 700,000 workers.[9] Geographer Li Daoyuan, writing six centuries after the First Emperor's death, recorded in Shui Jing Zhu that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology, \"famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the First Emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there\".[10][11] Sima Qian, in his most noted work, Shiji, finished a century after the mausoleum's completion, wrote that the First Emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects. According to this account, 100 rivers had their flow simulated by mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to \"models\" or \"imitations,\" however those words were not used in the original text, which makes no mention of the terracotta army.[9][12]"],"after":["High levels of mercury were found in the soil of the tomb mound, giving credence to Sima Qian's account.[13]"]}}}
