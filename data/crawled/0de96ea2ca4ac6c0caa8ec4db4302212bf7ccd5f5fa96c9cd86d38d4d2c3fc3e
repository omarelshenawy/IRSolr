The airport is the third busiest in the United Kingdom and the largest outside the London region. Airline services exist to many destinations in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than any other airport in Britain).[106] A second runway was opened in 2001 and there have been continued terminal improvements. The airport has the highest rating available: \"Category 10\", encompassing an elite group of airports which are able to handle \"Code F\" aircraft including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8.[107] From September 2010 the airport became one of only 17 airports in the world and the only UK airport other than Heathrow Airport to operate the Airbus A380.[108]"]}}}
