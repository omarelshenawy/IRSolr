The camera cuts to Ciara who appears almost impervious to gravity. Dressed in lingerie, she maneuvers around a horizontal dance pole; background dancers are veiled in vibrant color schemes and alternating strobe lights. The video then cuts to Ciara in a leotard, posing in abstract and flexible poses. Ciara is then seen dressed in a tiger-striped catsuit performing solo dance moves on a stage. Timberlake performs his verse seated onstage while Ciara performs intricate tricks, such as snaking under his legs. Then the two begin to lightly move to the track before Ciara forms her body as an armrest as he leans on her. Ciara and the dancers perform choreography and cabaret-style moves on the pole. The bridge of the song puts Timberlake on the ground and Ciara, standing over him, turns and performs her signature \"Matrix\" over him as he guides her body toward his with his right hand. The two perform and as Ciara gets up, Timberlake smacks her side as she pops to the beat. The video then cuts to a scene with Ciara in the catsuit portraying a tiger in a cage. In the final scene, Ciara and the dancers perform, dressed in 70s-inspired tuxedos and colored afros. The video ends with clips of Ciara's multiple performance scenes from throughout the video."]}}}
