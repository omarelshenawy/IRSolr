To the north is Eaton Chapel; this, with its clock tower, is a Grade I listed building. The decorative scheme of the interior of the chapel is based on the 'Te Deum'; it involves stained glass and stone mosaic, and was developed by Frederic Shields.[18] Immediately to the north of the chapel is the Stable Court; this is listed at Grade II*.[19] The buildings in the Stable Court are in brick, red stone, and half-timbering, with red tile roofs. The west range has a half-timbered upper storey with two gables, and a central gatehouse with turrets which are polygonal at the base and circular higher up and have conical roofs. On each side of the gatehouse are two-storey arcades with gables above. In the courtyard is a statue of a horse by Joseph Boehm,[20] which is listed at Grade II.[21] At the southeast corner of the stable yard is a postillion's house, dated 1873 and listed at Grade II*.[22] In a lobby between the stable yard and the chapel is an artificial grotto, listed at Grade II.[23] In the area around the Stable Court are further structures listed at Grade II. To the north is the Coachhouse Court, which consists of a coach-house, a covered court and a riding school. These were designed in the 1870s for the 1st Duke.[24] To the north of this are Eaton Hall Cottages, four attached cottages, which were designed about the same time.[25] In the forecourt between the Coachhouse Court and the cottages is a lodge, with gates, piers and screens.[26] Near to the cottages is the former engine shed of the Eaton Hall Railway.[27] To the east of the stable yard is a chapel-like sandstone game pantry dating from the 1870s.[28]"]}}}
