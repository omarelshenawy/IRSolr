The majority are Sunni, with an estimated 5â€“20% Shia.[52][363][365] The Ahmadis, are another minority sect in Pakistan, albeit in much smaller numbers and are officially considered non-Muslims by virtue of the constitutional amendment.[366] There are also several Quraniyoon communities.[367][368] After the 9/11 attacks in the United States, the sectarian violence among Muslim denominations has increased with systematic targeted killings of both sects, Sunnis and Shias.[369][370] In 2013, there were country-wide protests by both Shias and Sunnis calling an end to sectarian violence in the country, toughen up the law and order, and urging for Shia-Sunni unity in the country.[371] The Ahmadis are particularly persecuted, especially since 1974 when they were banned from calling themselves Muslims. In 1984, Ahmadiyya places of worship were banned from being called \"mosques\".[372] As of 2012, 12% of Pakistani Muslims self-identify as non-denominational Muslims.[373]"]}}}
