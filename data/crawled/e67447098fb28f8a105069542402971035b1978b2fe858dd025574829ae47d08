It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation.[84] A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45,[59] and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison.[85] By 05:30 the rain had gone.[59] There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.[81]"],"after":["At 05:29:21 MWT (± 2 seconds),[86] the device exploded with an energy equivalent to around 20 kilotons of TNT (84 TJ). The desert sand, largely made of silica, melted and became a mildly radioactive light green glass, which was named trinitite.[87] It left a crater in the desert 5 feet (1.5 m) deep and 30 feet (9.1 m) wide.[44] At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated \"brighter than daytime\" for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as \"being as hot as an oven\" at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers. It was felt over 100 miles (160 km) away, and the mushroom cloud reached 7.5 miles (12.1 km) in height.[88] Ralph Carlisle Smith, watching from Compania Hill, wrote:"]}}}
