The garden contains the Tea House which was designed by John Douglas.[65] This has a cruciform plan and is a half-timbered building on a sandstone plinth. The roof is of red tiles, and sweeps upwards to a small spire surmounted by a weathercock. It is listed at Grade II.[66] In the centre of the garden is a statue of Mercury and in front of the Tea House are two stone Talbots.[67] To the north of the Tea House, on the path leading to the Broad Walk, is a pair of wrought iron gates made in 1913 for the 2nd Duke. The gates and their overthrow are listed at Grade II.[68]"],"after":["To the south of the hall is a formal garden known as the Italian Garden. This contains a pool at the centre of which is the Dragon Fountain.[67] The fountain is listed at Grade II.[69] In the Italian Garden are two statues, also listed at Grade II, which were taken from the old hall when it was demolished; these are a statue of Joan of Eaton,[70] and of the Norman Bishop Odo.[71]"]}}}
