At the back, the chains meet at a mount centred on a gold solidus of Gratian (r. 375–383), which has been converted from an earlier use, probably as a pendant, and which may have been a family heirloom.[49] Body chains of this type appear in Roman art, sometimes on the goddess Venus or nymphs; some examples have erotic contexts, but they are also worn by respectable high-ranking ladies. They may have been regarded as a suitable gift for a bride.[50] The Hoxne body chain, worn tightly, would fit a woman with a bust-size of 76–81 cm (30–32 inches).[51] Few body chains have survived; one of the most complete, from the early Byzantine era and found in Egypt, is also in the British Museum.[52]"],"after":[]}}}
