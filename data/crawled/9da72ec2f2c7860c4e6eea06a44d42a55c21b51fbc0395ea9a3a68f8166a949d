They are usually board games, computer or video games, card games, or another type of game. Several games include strategy extensively, while others to a lesser degree, complicating demarcation. It is sometimes more accurate to say that some games have strategic elements, rather than being a strategy game; however, this depends on the game. The deciding factor separating strategy game from other genres is that there is either no or relatively less chance involved. Usually, the only physical element is the interaction with the game pieces, although there are exceptions. Players have similar starting positions or sitiuations, but use strategy to gain advantages over others. Strategy, as well as tactics, is dissimilar to luck in that chance-based games rely more heavily on probability. The word \"strategy\" is used by the military, and refers to high-level planning. Strategy games often deal with small-scale situations. Tactical games, a type of strategy game, deal with military planning, though also on a smaller scale than the military."]}}}
