The war caused a drastic decrease in male enrollment and by 1943, the university canceled dances and formals, citing the lack of male students.[25] The university continued expanding facilities including its first student union, The Falconâ€™s Nest, and new cottage-style dorms for social groups and learning-living communities, and dedication of the Wood County airport.[25][26] Bowling Green was one of 240 colleges and universities to take part in the V-5 and V-12 Navy College Training Programs to supplement the lower enrollment during the war.[27] The programs offered students a path to a Navy commission, enrolling cadets in regular college courses as well as naval training.[10] Faculty were added to accommodate the military training programs.[28] Student life adapted to the wartime era with efforts such as the War Relief Committee, blood drives and War Bonds initiatives.[28]"]}}}
