Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: \"I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always promoted freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; that would be a tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political.\"[26] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying \"...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom.\"[27] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said \"Pussy Riot\" on her back in place of the usual \"No Fear\" slogan, and performed \"Like a Virgin\" donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark.[28] It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.[29]"]}}}
