The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow, aided by an unusually harsh winter. The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war. After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945. The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.[33]"],"after":["The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Sovietâ€“Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945[34] and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945.[35] This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II."]}}}
