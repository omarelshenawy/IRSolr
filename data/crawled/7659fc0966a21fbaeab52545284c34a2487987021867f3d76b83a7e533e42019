There is limited data with widely varying estimates on religious affiliation in the country. According to the Malawi Religion Project[63] run by the University of Pennsylvania in 2010, approximately 68% of the population identify as Christians, 25% as Muslim and 5% as \"other\".[64] Slightly more dated CIA statistics from 1998 indicate that 82% of the population was Christian, with 13% Muslim.[65] The largest Christian groups in Malawi are the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Central Africa, Presbyterian. The Church of Central Africa, Presbyterian is the biggest Protestant denomination in Malawi with 1.3 million members. There are smaller Presbyterian denominations like the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Malawi and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Malawi. There are also smaller numbers of Anglicans, Baptists, evangelicals and Seventh-day Adventists. Most of the Muslim population is Sunni, of either the Qadriya or Sukkutu groups, with few Ahmadiyya Muslims.[66] Other religious groups within the country include Rastafarians, Hindus, Baha'is (0.2%[67]) and around 300 Jews.[68] Atheists make up around 4% of the population, although this number may include people who practice traditional African religions.[69]"],"after":["Malawi has central hospitals, regional and private facilities. The public sector offers free health services and medicines, while non-government organisations offers services and medicines for fees. Private doctors offer fee-based services and medicines. Health insurance schemes have been established since 2000.[70] The country has a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry consisting of four privately owned pharmaceutical companies. Malawi's healthcare goal is for \"promoting health, preventing, reducing and curing disease, and reducing the occurrence of premature death in the population\".[71]"]}}}
