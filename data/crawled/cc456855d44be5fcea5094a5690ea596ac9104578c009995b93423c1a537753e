That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home.[51] First, they spent three weeks in Washington, where her father was representing Massachusetts in Congress. Then they went to Philadelphia for two weeks to visit family. In Philadelphia, she met Charles Wadsworth, a famous minister of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church, with whom she forged a strong friendship which lasted until his death in 1882.[52] Despite seeing him only twice after 1855 (he moved to San Francisco in 1862), she variously referred to him as \"my Philadelphia\", \"my Clergyman\", \"my dearest earthly friend\" and \"my Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\".[53]"],"after":["From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became effectively bedridden with various chronic illnesses until her death in 1882.[55] Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily said that she would visit if she could leave \"home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away â€“ Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her\".[56] As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her.[56] Emily took this role as her own, and \"finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it\".[56]"]}}}
