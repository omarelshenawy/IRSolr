Before the official launch of her campaign, aides for Clinton were already planning to position her as the 'change' candidate, as strategist Mark Penn made clear in an October 2006 memo titled \"The Plan.\"[109] In his presidential run announcement, Obama framed his candidacy by emphasizing that \"Washington must change.\"[110] In response to this, Clinton adopted her experience as a major campaign theme.[111] By early and mid-2007, polls regularly found voters identifying Clinton as the more experienced candidate and Obama as the \"fresh\" or \"new\" candidate.[112][113] Exit polls on Super Tuesday found that Obama won voters who thought that the ability to bring change was the most important quality in a candidate, who made up a majority of the Democratic electorate. By a margin of about 2-1, Clinton was able to make up for this deficiency by an almost total domination among voters who thought experience was the most important quality.[114] These margins generally remained the same until Obama clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3."],"after":["Obama's promised \"universal health care, full employment, a green America, and an America respected instead of feared by its enemies\".[115] He used new media to \"form a bond with his supporters\" which helped him \"appeal to the youth audience's need to feel special, in-the-know, empowered and special\". This was best displayed in his text message announcement of Joe Biden as the vice-presidential candidate.[116] He has also declared, in his book The Audacity of Hope, that he did not experience a religious upbringing. Rather he developed his faith due to the church's ability to motivate social change.[117] Bowdern wrote, \"This is best exemplified in his \"50 state strategy\", where he campaigned in states that historically would never vote for a Democrat. The 2008 presidential election saw a large youth turn out, up to 51%.\"[118]"]}}}
