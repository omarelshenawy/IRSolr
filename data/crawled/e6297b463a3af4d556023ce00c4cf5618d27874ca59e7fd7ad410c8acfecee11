Barry Walters from Rolling Stone commented that \"Jonas Akerlund's 2005 kinetic yet personable documentary of Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention Tour lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles to become a less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person. The bonus live CD proves that she's a better singer.\"[41] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic complimented the release saying \"as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, and even if the excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done.\"[40] The release debuted at number 33 on the Billboard 200 and the top ten in Canada and the European Top 100 Albums etc.[42]"],"after":["Source:[43]"]}}}
