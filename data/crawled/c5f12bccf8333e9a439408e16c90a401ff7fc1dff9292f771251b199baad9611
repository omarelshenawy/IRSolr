Protestant groups in which baptism in the early teens is the norm often have no confirmation. The Roman Catholic Church confirms converts from Protestantism, not recognizing their Protestant confirmations as sacramentally valid."],"after":["Lutheran confirmation is a public profession of faith prepared for by long and careful instruction. In English, it is called \"affirmation of baptism\", and is a mature and public profession of the faith which \"marks the completion of the congregation's program of confirmation ministry\".[37] The German language also uses for Lutheran confirmation a different word (Konfirmation) from the word used for the sacramental rite of the Catholic Church (Firmung).[38]"]}}}
