The most significant of these adaptations are 1. bipedalism, 2. increased brain size, 3. lengthened ontogeny (gestation and infancy), 4. decreased sexual dimorphism. The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[31] Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in H. erectus.[32]"]}}}
