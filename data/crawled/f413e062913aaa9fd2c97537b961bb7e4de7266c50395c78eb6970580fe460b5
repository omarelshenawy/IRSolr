The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita[189] consumers of potatoes in Europe. An example of this new cuisine is \"Dublin Lawyer\": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.[194] Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork, both a type of sausage, or blaa, a doughy white bread particular to Waterford."],"after":["Ireland once dominated the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands)[195] and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s,[196] sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century.[197] In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.[198]"]}}}
