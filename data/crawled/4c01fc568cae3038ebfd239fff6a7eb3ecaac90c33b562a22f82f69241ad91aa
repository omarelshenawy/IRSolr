Among his design credits for the Warner family of labels were The Jimi Hendrix Experience’s Are You Experienced, Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks, the Grateful Dead’s Anthem of the Sun, the Doobie Brothers’ Toulouse Street, Tiny Tim’s God Bless Tiny Tim and Joni Mitchell's Clouds, which started a trend for musicians to create the art for their own records. In 1973, when Frank Sinatra emerged from retirement with his comeback album, Thrasher shot candid photographs for the cover and also devised the album title Ol’ Blue Eyes Is Back, which was widely used to promote Sinatra’s return to recording and touring. Besides his work on album covers, Thrasher art-directed many of Warner Bros. ads and posters from 1964 to 1979.[25]"],"after":["In 1964, Warner Bros. successfully negotiated with French label Disques Vogue and Warner Bros.' British distributor Pye Records for the rights to distribute Petula Clark's recordings in the US. Clark soon scored a #1 US hit with \"Downtown\" and she enjoyed consistent chart success in the USA over the next four years with hits such as \"My Love\", \"I Know A Place\", \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\", \"This Is My Song\" and \"Don't Sleep In The Subway\". Warner also released other Pye artists in the U.S. market such as The Kinks."]}}}
