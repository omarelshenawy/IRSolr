It was Julian Assange—an Australian Internet activist and journalist, and the de facto editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks—who had the idea of creating what Ben Laurie called an \"open-source, democratic intelligence agency.\" The open-editing aspect was soon abandoned, but the site remained open for anonymous submissions.[69]"]}}}
