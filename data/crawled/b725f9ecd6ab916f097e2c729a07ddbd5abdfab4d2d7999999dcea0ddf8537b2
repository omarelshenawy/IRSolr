Arkansas was admitted to the Union on 15 June 1836 becoming the 25th US state. On 6 May 1861, the state seceded and was the tenth state to join the Confederate States of America. Arkansas shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the Mississippi River. Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozarks and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is Little Rock, located in the central portion of the state."]}}}
