It was Madonna's first major venture from her new recording and business deal with Live Nation. Announcements for the tour happened as early as February 2008 with dates for the UK and the American venues being announced. However, though initially planned, the tour failed to visit Australia like her past three tours, due to financial problems and the recession. Costume designer Arianne Phillips designed the costumes, supported by a number of renowned famous designers and brands. The stage for the main show was planned almost the same way as Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour. After the tour was over in 2008, Madonna announced plans of resuming the tour in 2009, to play in previously unventured territories. The second leg, however, did not go to the United States."]}}}
