He first took office on May 24, 2004, after winning a disputed presidential election. With the support of President Bakili Muluzi, Mutharika won the 2004 election as the candidate of the United Democratic Front (UDF); he broke with the UDF (which remained under Muluzi's control) in February 2005, however, due to disagreements over Mutharika's anti-corruption campaign. He then formed a new party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but lacked a parliamentary majority for the rest of his first term. He won a second term in the May 2009 election. His supporters credit him with responsible policies that have encouraged economic growth."]}}}
