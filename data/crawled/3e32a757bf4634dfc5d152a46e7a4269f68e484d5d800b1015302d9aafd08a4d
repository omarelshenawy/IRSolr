In various branches of art, the vulva has been depicted as the organ that has the power both to \"give life\" (often associated with the womb), and to give sexual pleasure to humankind.[2]"],"after":["In humans, major structures of the vulva are:[3]","Other structures:","The soft mound at the front of the vulva is formed by fatty tissue covering the pubic bone, and is called the mons pubis. The term mons pubis is Latin for \"pubic mound\" and it is gender-nonspecific. There is, however, a variant term that specifies gender: in human females, the mons pubis is often referred to as the mons veneris, Latin for \"mound of Venus\" or \"mound of love\". The mons pubis separates into two folds of skin called the labia majora, literally \"major (or large) lips\". The cleft between the labia majora is called the pudendal cleft, or cleft of Venus, and it contains and protects the other, more delicate structures of the vulva. The labia majora meet again at a flat area between the pudendal cleft and the anus called the perineum. The color of the outside skin of the labia majora is usually close to the overall skin color of the individual, although there is considerable variation. The inside skin and mucous membrane are often pink or brownish. After the onset of puberty, the mons pubis and the labia majora become covered by pubic hair. This hair sometimes extends to the inner thighs and perineum, but the density, texture, color, and extent of pubic hair coverage vary considerably, due to both individual variation and cultural practices of hair modification or removal."]}}}
