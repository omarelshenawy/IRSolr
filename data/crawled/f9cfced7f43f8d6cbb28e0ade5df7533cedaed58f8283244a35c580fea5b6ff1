The first article in a general interest publication about Creative Commons, written by Hal Plotkin, was published in February 2002.[4] The first set of copyright licenses was released in December 2002.[5] The founding management team that developed the licenses and built the Creative Commons infrastructure as we know it today included Molly Shaffer Van Houweling, Glenn Otis Brown, Neeru Paharia, and Ben Adida.[6] Matthew Haughey and Aaron Swartz[7] also played a significant role in the early stages of the project. As of November 2014 there were an estimated 880 million works licensed under the various Creative Commons licenses.[8] As of March 2015, Flickr alone hosts over 306 million Creative Commons licensed photos.[9] Creative Commons is governed by a board of directors. Their licenses have been embraced by many as a way for creators to take control of how they choose to share their copyrighted works."],"after":["Creative Commons has been described as being at the forefront of the copyleft movement, which seeks to support the building of a richer public domain by providing an alternative to the automatic \"all rights reserved\" copyright, and has been dubbed \"some rights reserved.\"[10] David Berry and Giles Moss have credited Creative Commons with generating interest in the issue of intellectual property and contributing to the re-thinking of the role of the \"commons\" in the \"information age\". Beyond that, Creative Commons has provided \"institutional, practical and legal support for individuals and groups wishing to experiment and communicate with culture more freely.\"[11]"]}}}
