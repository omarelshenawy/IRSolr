In it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, e.g. 2 = ab, then one of a or b must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of \"prime\". It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid's lemma; e.g. 2 divides neither (1 + √−5) nor (1 − √−5) even though it divides their product 6. In algebraic number theory 2 is called irreducible in (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not prime in in (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in Similarly, 5 is prime and irreducible in and not prime nor irreducible in Using these definitions it can be proven that in any ring a prime must be irreducible. Euclid's classical lemma can be rephrased as \"in the ring of integers every irreducible is prime\". This is also true in and but not in"]}}}
