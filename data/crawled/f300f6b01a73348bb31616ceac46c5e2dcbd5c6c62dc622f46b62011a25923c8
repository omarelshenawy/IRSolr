The specialization restricting the meaning of \"science\" to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted \"natural science\" to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as psychology, biology, or physics. Albert Einstein stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"[16] More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics \"the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery\".[55]"]}}}
