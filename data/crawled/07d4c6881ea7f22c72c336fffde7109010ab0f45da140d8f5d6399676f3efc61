A call for extras received an enthusiastic response by many teenagers in the Newcastle area. Filming locations included Stockton, Maroubra Beach, Caves Beach, and NESCA House.[3] Notable Stockton landmarks seen in the film include the Stockton Ferry[16] and Stockton Bridge.[3]"],"after":["The community of Stockton opposed filming in the area, as memories of Leigh's murder were still fresh and the details of the script were \"too close for comfort\".[10] When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996,[18] locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available. The local media treated them with hostility.[10] Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production, saying \"I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else.\"[3] Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area, saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so.[18][3] The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite their choice of Stockton for filming.[19] During production in September 1996, Elfick told The Newcastle Herald that he was \"getting a bit bored\" of people mentioning Leigh's murder. While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, \"Unfortunately, that event happens all over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders\". He was also quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald as saying, \"The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing\".[4] Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive way of looking at the circumstances that led to Leigh's death,[3] and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future.[20] Leigh's family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were \"feasting on an unfortunate situation\",[10] insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so.[18] One of Leigh's aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month, saying \"David Elfick doesn't seem to mind free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'\"[21] Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.[3]"]}}}
