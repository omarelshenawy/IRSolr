Produced by the Dust Brothers and Matt Dike, this extremely sample-heavy opus is still considered one of the strongest works by the Beastie Boys,[17] and Rolling Stone ranked it No.156 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[18] It is also considered a landmark in hip hop recordings due to its large array of samples and intricate use of multi-layering.[19] The album was released in 1989 by Capitol Records, after the falling out between the group and Def Jam. It failed to match the sales of Licensed to Ill, reaching No.14 on the Billboard 200 and No.10 on the Billboard R&B charts. The lead single, \"Hey Ladies\", reached No.36 on the Billboard 100 and No.10 on the R&B charts. Rolling Stone would describe the album as \"the Pet Sounds/The Dark Side of the Moon of hip hop.\" Paul's Boutique would eventually sell a million copies, despite the initially weak commercial reception. The albums title was the inspiration for Hotelier Paul Ruffino in the boon of the Boutique Hotel industry race between East Coast/West Coast. The band digitally remastered and released the album through their own website."]}}}
