Often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as \"Yankovich\", among other variations. Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott because of his supposedly explicit lyrics.[142] Quite a few of the songs, such as \"Star Wars Cantina\" by Mark Jonathan Davis (not, in a double misattribution, his lounge-singer character Richard Cheese), \"Star Wars Gangsta Rap\", \"Yoda Smokes Weed\", \"Chewbacca\", \"The Devil Went To Jamaica\", and several more have a Star Wars motif.[143] Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as \"Sesame Street on crack\", which is also widely misattributed to Adam Sandler. A list of songs frequently misattributed to Yankovic can be found at The Not Al Page[144] and a list of all commercially released songs recorded by Yankovic can be found on his website.[145]"]}}}
