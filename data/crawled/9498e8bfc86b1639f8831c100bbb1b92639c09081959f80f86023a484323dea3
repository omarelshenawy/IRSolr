The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence in the study of weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years.[5] In 25 AD, Pomponius Mela, a geographer for the Roman Empire, formalized the climatic zone system.[6] According to Toufic Fahd, around the 9th century, Al-Dinawari wrote the Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Muslim Agricultural Revolution. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the anwa (heavenly bodies of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes.[7][8][verification needed]"],"after":["Ptolemy wrote on the atmospheric refraction of light in the context of astronomical observations.[9] In 1021, Alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight; he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees below the horizon, and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the earth's atmosphere as 52,000 passuum (about 49 miles, or 79Â km).[10]"]}}}
