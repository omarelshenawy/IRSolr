Once the political crises of the first years of his reign had subsided, he set out to remedy this state of affairs.[85] Ernest's support led to gas lighting in the city streets of Hanover, up-to-date sanitation and the development of a new residential quarter. He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica's death, to leave standing the Altes Palais, where the two had lived since arriving in Hanover.[40] Ernest's interest in and support of the railroads led to Hanover becoming a major rail junction, much to the nation's benefit.[40] However, when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal \"this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this green field\".[86] The King finally gave his consent in 1844, and the opera house opened in 1852, a year after the King's death.[86]"],"after":["Every week, the King travelled with his secretary to different parts of his kingdom, and anyone could lay a petition before himâ€”although Ernest had petitions screened by the secretary so he would not have to deal with frivolous complaints.[87] Ernest opened high ministerial positions to those of any class, securing the services of several ministers who would not have been eligible without this reform.[88] Though the King had, while Duke of Cumberland, fought against Catholic emancipation, he made no objection to Catholics in government service in Hanover, and even visited their churches. Ernest explained this by stating that there were no historical reasons to restrict Catholics in Hanover, as there had been in the United Kingdom.[89] He continued to oppose admission of Jews into the British Parliament, but gave Jews in Hanover equal rights.[90]"]}}}
