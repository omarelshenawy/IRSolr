Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo, which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.[122] The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as \"the preventive counter-revolution.\" [44] In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.[123]"]}}}
