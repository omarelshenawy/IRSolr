This was later changed to Sticky & Sweet Tour and the packaging design was slightly altered with the additional wording, although the DVD and Blu-ray menu screen retains the original title announced. The album included 30 minutes of exclusive footage, filmed behind the scenes during the course of the tour. The release included \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\" which was only performed at the River Plate Stadium concerts.[1][2] The photography used on the front cover is by Guy Oseary and is included in his book Madonna: Sticky & Sweet. The imagery is from the video interlude section of \"Die Another Day\" and has been slightly altered, removing the dancers on stage in the mock-boxing ring.[3] The filmed tour footage was broadcast on VH1 on April 2, 2010, just a few days after the official release.[4]"]}}}
