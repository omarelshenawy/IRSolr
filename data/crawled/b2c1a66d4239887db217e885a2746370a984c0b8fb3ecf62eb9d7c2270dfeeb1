Ramciel is considered to be the geographical center of the country,[47] and the late pro-independence leader John Garang allegedly had plans to relocate the capital there before his death in 2005. The proposal was supported by the Lakes state government and at least one Ramciel tribal chief.[48] The design, planning, and construction of the city will likely take as many as five years, government ministers said, and the move of national institutions to the new capital will be implemented in stages.[46]"],"after":["South Sudan is divided into ten states, which correspond to three historical regions: Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria, and Greater Upper Nile."]}}}
