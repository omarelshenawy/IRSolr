For example, considering the permutation (2)(31), which is in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain a different permutation in one-line notation, namely 231. (The permutation (2)(31) is actually 321 in one-line notation.) Foata's transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a bijection on the set of n-permutations (to itself).[40] Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the fundamental bijection.[38]"],"after":["For example, in the one-line notation 312548976, 5 is the first element larger than 3, so the first cycle must be (312). Then 8 is the next element larger than 5, so the second cycle is (54). Since 9 is larger than 8, (8) is a cycle by itself. Finally, 9 is larger than all the remaining elements to its right, so the last cycle is (976)."]}}}
