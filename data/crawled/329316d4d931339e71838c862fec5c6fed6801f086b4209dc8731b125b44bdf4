They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others).[98] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[99] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[100] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects."],"after":["Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because fully automated translation of articles is disallowed.[101] Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions."]}}}
