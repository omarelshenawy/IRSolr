Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency was first published in 1987, and was described by its author as \"a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics\".[25] It was derived from two Doctor Who serials Adams had written."]}}}
