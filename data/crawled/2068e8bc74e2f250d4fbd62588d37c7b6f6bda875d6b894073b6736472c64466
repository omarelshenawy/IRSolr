Henderson and Roy W. Carlson of the Los Alamos Laboratory's X-2A Section. The bomb would be placed into the heart of Jumbo, and if the bomb's detonation was unsuccessful, the outer walls of Jumbo would not be breached, making it possible to recover the bomb's plutonium. Hans Bethe, Victor Weisskopf, and Joseph O. Hirschfelder, made the initial calculations, followed by a more detailed analysis by Henderson and Carlson.[24] They drew up specifications for a steel sphere 13 to 15 feet (4.0 to 4.6 m) in diameter, weighing 150 long tons (150 t) and capable of handling a pressure of 50,000 pounds per square inch (340,000 kPa). After consulting with the steel companies and the railroads, Carlson produced a scaled-back cylindrical design that would be much easier to manufacture, but still difficult to transport. Carlson identified a company that normally made boilers for the Navy, Babcock & Wilcox, had made something similar and were willing to attempt its manufacture.[37]"]}}}
