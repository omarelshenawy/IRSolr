It is surrounded by the North Sea on the west, the Skagerrak on the north, the Kattegat and Baltic Sea on the east and borders Germany on the south. Much of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein is part of the Jutland Peninsula. The Danish parts of Jutland belong to one of the three administrative regions: North Denmark Region, Central Denmark Region, or Region of Southern Denmark.[1]"]}}}
