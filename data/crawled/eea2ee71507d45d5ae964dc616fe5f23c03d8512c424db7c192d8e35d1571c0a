She exemplified the enlightened despot of her era. Catherine's father, Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, held the rank of a Prussian general in his capacity as Governor of the city of Stettin (now[update] Szczecin, Poland) in the name of the king of Prussia. Though born as Sophia Augusta Frederica (Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst, nicknamed \"Figchen\"), a minor German princess in Stettin, Catherine did have some (very remote) Russian ancestry, and two of her first cousins became Kings of Sweden: Gustav III and Charles XIII. In accordance with the custom then prevailing amongst the German nobility, she received her education chiefly from a French governess and from tutors."]}}}
