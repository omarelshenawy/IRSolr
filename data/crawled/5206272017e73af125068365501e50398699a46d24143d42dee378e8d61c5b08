PopMatters writer Rob Wheaton felt M.I.A. subverted the \"abstract, organized, refined\" distilling of violence in Western popular music and imagination and made her work represent much of the developing world's decades-long experiences of \"arbitrary, unannounced, and spectacular\" slaughter, deeming her work an \"assault\" with realism.[10] Some detractors criticized M.I.A. early in her music career for \"using radical chic\" and for her attendance of an art school.[159] Critic Simon Reynolds, writing in The Village Voice in 2005 saw this as a lack of authenticity and felt M.I.A. was \"a veritable vortex of discourse, around most likely irresolvable questions concerning authenticity, postcolonialism, and dilettantism\". He continued that while swayed by her chutzpah and ability to deliver live, he \"was also turned off by the stencil-sprayed projection imagery of grenades, tanks, and so forth (redolent of the Clash with their strife-torn Belfast stage backdrops and Sandinista cred by association)\" while the \"99 percent white audience punched the air\", admonishing what he perceived as a \"lack of local character\" to her debut album.[200]"]}}}
