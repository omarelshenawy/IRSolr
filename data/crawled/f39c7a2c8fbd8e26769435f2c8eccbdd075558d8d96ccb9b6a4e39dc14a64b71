The first edition of Top of the Pops was broadcast from a studio in Rusholme on New Year's Day 1964.[189] Manchester was the regional base for BBC One North West Region programmes before it relocated to MediaCityUK in nearby Salford Quays.[190][191] The Manchester television channel, Channel M, owned by the Guardian Media Group operated from 2000 but closed in 2012.[182][192] Manchester is also covered by two internet television channels: Quays News and Manchester.tv.
