Arruntius, now in old age, committed suicide by opening his veins, tired of enduring a life of peril and scorn due to the tyranny of the Praetorian Guard prefects Sejanus and after 31 AD, Macro.[27] Arruntius was aware at this stage that Tiberius was ill and unlikely to recover however he foresaw only worse conditions to come under the reign of Tibetrius' successor Caligula.[2] He declared, \"I cannot in my old age become the slave of a new master like him.\"[28] Years later Gaius Silius would say of him in the Senate that he had come to eminence by his \"incorrupta vita\" (blameless life).[4]"]}}}
