The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes (i.e., is equal to zero). The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions where the functional derivative is equal to zero. This leads to solving the associated Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation.[Note 3]"],"after":["where"]}}}
