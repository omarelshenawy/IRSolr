The city, with around 154,000 residents at the time, was returned to Christian rule. The reconquest of Portugal and re-establishment of Christianity is one of the most significant events in Lisbon's history, described in the chronicle Expugnatione Lyxbonensi, which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city's residents prayed to the Virgin Mary as it happened. Many of the Muslim residents converted to Roman Catholicism, and those who did not fled to other parts of Islamic world, mostly Muslim Spain and North Africa. All mosques were either destroyed or converted into churches, keeping in line with the Islamic practice of converting conquered churches to Mosques. As a result of the end of Muslim rule, spoken Arabic gradually lost its place in the everyday life of the city."]}}}
