Close studding was an elite style found mostly on expensive buildings. A principal style of the western school is the use of square panels of roughly equal size and decorative framing utilizing many shapes such as lozenges, stars, crosses, quatrefoils, cusps, and many other shapes.[32] The northern school sometimes used posts which landed on the foundation rather than on a sill beam, the sill joining to the sides of the posts and called an interrupted sill. Another northern style was to use close studding but in a herring-bone or chevron pattern.[32]"],"after":["As houses were modified to cope with changing demands there sometimes were a combination of styles within a single timer frame construction.[33] The major types of historic framing in England are 'cruck frame',[33] box frame,[33] and aisled construction. From the box frame, more complex framed buildings such as the Wealden House and Jettied house developed[citation needed]."]}}}
