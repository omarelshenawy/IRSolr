Madonna, who is in a room filled with men smoking cigars, observes her from television monitors throughout the club.[52] She wears a white trouser suit and carries a cane, signifying a position of moneyed power. Her suit is also notably fitted, especially in the waistcoat, revealing Madonna's body to be female and not masculine.[53] Although the areas are separated by a wall, Spears and Madonna sense their presences through extrasensory perception and dance in synchronicity.[52] Julie Andsager in Sex in consumer culture (2006) noted that the video hints at a same-sex relationship between the two.[54]"]}}}
