She describes a tautologous exchange between Agent Smith and Neo in the film, where Neo is asked by Smith: \"Why do you continue to do this, Mr. Anderson?\" and Neo responds: \"Because I choose to.\" Diamond uses this example to explain the Landmark Forum's discussion of \"choice and decision.\"[38] Diamond provides further analysis of other Landmark Forum concepts utilized in The Matrix Revolutions in her book Stepping Into Spiritual Oneness: Spiritual Rememberings of the Soul Through Life Experience, including the concept that: \"we all choose to BE who we are being in each and every moment of our experience.\"[39]"]}}}
