This maps to 11 July new style, but because of the date of a subsequent battle it is commemorated as \"The Twelfth\" on 12 July \"New Style\" by a public holiday in Northern Ireland, with the Orange parades, and is an exception to the usual historical method of commemorating events of that period within Great Britain and Ireland by mapping the Julian date directly onto the modern Gregorian calendar (as happens for example with Guy Fawkes Night on 5 November)."],"after":["Because of the differences, English people and their correspondents often employed two dates, dual dating, more or less automatically. In his biography of Dr John Dee, The Queen's Conjurer, Benjamin Woolley surmises that because Dee fought unsuccessfully for England to embrace the 1583/84 date set for the change, \"England remained outside the Gregorian system for a further 170 years, communications during that period customarily carrying two dates, one 'O.S.' or Old Style, the other 'N.S.' or New Style.\"[23] In contrast, Thomas Jefferson, who lived during the time that the British Isles and colonies eventually converted to the Gregorian calendar, instructed that his tombstone bear his date of birth in the Old Style and his date of death in the New Style.[24] At Jefferson's birth the difference was eleven days between the Julian and Gregorian calendars; thus his birthday of 2 April in the Old Style is 13 April in the New Style. Similarly, George Washington is nowadays officially reported as having been born on 22 February 1732, rather than on 11 February 1731/32 O.S.[25] After the conversion to the Gregorian calendar, Washington continued to celebrate his birthday according to the Old Style calendar (as if he had been born on 22 February). Many British people likewise continued to celebrate their holidays \"Old Style\" well into the 19th century, a practice that according to the author Karen Bellenir reveals a deep emotional resistance to calendar reform.[26]"]}}}
