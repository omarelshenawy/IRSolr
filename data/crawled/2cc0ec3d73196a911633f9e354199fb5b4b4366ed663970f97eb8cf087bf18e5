Hughes cites examples from the Epilogue to The Golden Legend and Victoria and Merrie England.[224] In the Savoy operas, fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in Trial by Jury and Iolanthe (e.g., the Lord Chancellor's leitmotif in the latter).[225] Less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as \"Brightly Dawns our Wedding Day\" (The Mikado) and \"When the Buds are Blossoming\" (Ruddigore).[225]"]}}}
