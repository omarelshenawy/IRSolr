Without an article, the term can refer to the entirety of humanity (also: \"society in general\", \"society at large\", etc.), although those who are unfriendly or uncivil to the remainder of society in this sense may be deemed to be \"antisocial\". Adam Smith wrote that a society \"may subsist among different men, as among different merchants, from a sense of its utility without any mutual love or affection, if only they refrain from doing injury to each other.\"[1]"]}}}
