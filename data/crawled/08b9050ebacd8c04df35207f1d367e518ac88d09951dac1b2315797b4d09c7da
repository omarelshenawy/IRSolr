Responsible government was first granted to Nova Scotia in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the British North America Act, 1867 by the British Parliament, Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the Dominion of Canada, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of international relations.[121] Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self-government after 1900, with the Australian colonies federating in 1901.[122] The term \"dominion status\" was officially introduced at the Colonial Conference of 1907.[123]"]}}}
