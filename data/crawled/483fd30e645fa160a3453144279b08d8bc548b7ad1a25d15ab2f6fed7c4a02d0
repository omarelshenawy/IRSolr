From Worsley to Manchester its construction cost £168,000 (£22,589,130 as of 2015),[15][16] but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.[17] This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as Canal Mania.[18] Along with its stone aqueduct at Barton-upon-Irwell, the Bridgewater Canal was considered a major engineering achievement.

The boats in some places are to go underground, and in other places over a navigable river, without communicating with its waters\".[11]"]}}}
