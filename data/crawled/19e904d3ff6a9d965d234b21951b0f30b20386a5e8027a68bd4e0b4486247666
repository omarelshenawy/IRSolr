Permutohedra are sometimes also called permutation polytopes, but this terminology is also used for a related polytope, the Birkhoff polytope, defined as the convex hull of permutation matrices. More generally, Bowman (1972) uses the phrase \"permutation polytope\" for any polytope whose vertices are in 1-1 correspondence with the permutations of some set."],"after":["The permutohedron of order n has n! vertices, each of which is adjacent to n − 1 others, so the total number of edges is (n − 1)n!/2. Each edge has length √2, and connects two vertices that differ by swapping two coordinates the values of which differ by one.[3]"]}}}
