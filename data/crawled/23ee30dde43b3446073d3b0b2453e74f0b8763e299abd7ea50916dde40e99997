Spectacles could quickly become sites of social and political protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.[353]"],"after":["The chariot teams were known by the colours they wore, with the Blues and Greens the most popular. Fan loyalty was fierce and at times erupted into sports riots.[355] Racing was perilous, but charioteers were among the most celebrated and well-compensated athletes.[356] One star of the sport was Diocles, from Lusitania (present-day Portugal), who raced chariots for 24 years and had career earnings of 35 million sesterces.[357] Horses had their fans too, and were commemorated in art and inscriptions, sometimes by name.[358] The design of Roman circuses was developed to assure that no team had an unfair advantage and to minimize collisions (naufragia, \"shipwrecks\"),[359] which were nonetheless frequent and spectacularly satisfying to the crowd.[360] The races retained a magical aura through their early association with chthonic rituals: circus images were considered protective or lucky, curse tablets have been found buried at the site of racetracks, and charioteers were often suspected of sorcery.[361] Chariot racing continued into the Byzantine period under imperial sponsorship, but the decline of cities in the 6th and 7th centuries led to its eventual demise.[362]"]}}}
