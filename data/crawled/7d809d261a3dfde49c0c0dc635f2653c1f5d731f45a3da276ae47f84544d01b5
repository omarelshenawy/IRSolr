For days, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in several cities to protest.[135] Initially a movement against the increase in public transport fares, it assumed gigantic proportions, sparked by the excessive use of force by the state polices, turning into a series of huge demonstrations by groups and individuals, angry about a range of issues (including new stadium projects for international sports events, demands on quality of public services, anger about corruption, and opposition to a constitutional amendment proposal, PEC 37, which is interpreted by some as an attempt to curb repression of corruption[136][137]). Thus it became a movement containing conflicting ideologies, with so far no single political agenda nor recognizable leadership.[138][139][140]"],"after":[]}}}
