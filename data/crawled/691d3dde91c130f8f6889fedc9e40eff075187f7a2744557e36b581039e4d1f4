The first of these was first announced on May 27, 2009. The company described Google Wave as a product that helps users communicate and collaborate on the web. The service is Google's \"email redesigned\", with realtime editing, the ability to embed audio, video, and other media, and extensions that further enhance the communication experience. Google Wave was initially in a developer's preview, where interested users had to be invited to test the service, but was released to the public on May 19, 2010, at Google's I/O keynote. On September 1, 2008, Google pre-announced the upcoming availability of Google Chrome, an open source web browser,[219] which was then released on September 2, 2008.

In addition to scanning QR codes, the app can recognize historic landmarks, import business cards, and solve Sudoku puzzles.[222] While Goggles could originally identify people as well, Google has limited that functionality as a privacy protection.[223]"]}}}
