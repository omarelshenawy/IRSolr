Vice President Joe Biden expressed concerns regarding the ongoing lack of progress in forming a new Iraqi government, saying of the Iraqi people that \"they expect a government that reflects the results of the votes they cast\". Gen. Ray Odierno stated that the new era \"in no way signals the end of our commitment to the people of Iraq\". Speaking in Ramadi earlier in the day, Gates said that U.S. forces \"have accomplished something really quite extraordinary here, [but] how it all weighs in the balance over time I think remains to be seen\". When asked by reporters if the seven-year war was worth doing, Gates commented that \"It really requires a historian's perspective in terms of what happens here in the long run\". He noted the Iraq War \"will always be clouded by how it began\" in regards Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were never confirmed to have existed. Gates continued, \"This is one of the reasons that this war remains so controversial at home\".[267] On the same day Gen.
