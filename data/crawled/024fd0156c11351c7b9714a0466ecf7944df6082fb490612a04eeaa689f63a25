Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.[65] The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.[66] Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.[67] The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 7008458525252000000♠14 years and 194 days, having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.[68][69]"],"after":["The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2015, is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.[70] The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz.[71] The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.[72]"]}}}
