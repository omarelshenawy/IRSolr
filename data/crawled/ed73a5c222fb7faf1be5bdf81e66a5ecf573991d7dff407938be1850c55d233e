The song was produced and written by Tim Bergling and contains a vocal sample from the 1962 gospel-inspired \"Something's Got a Hold on Me\" by Etta James. The same vocal sample was used first by Pretty Lights in his 2006 song \"Finally Moving\". This sample was also used by Drum and Bass producer Logistics on \"Call Me Back\" and by Flo Rida in his single \"Good Feeling\", which was produced by DJ Prak and Cirkut.[7] \"Levels\" reached the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Bosnia, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom, whilst topping the charts in Hungary, Norway and Sweden."]}}}
