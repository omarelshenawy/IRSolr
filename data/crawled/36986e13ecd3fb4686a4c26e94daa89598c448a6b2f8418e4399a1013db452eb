It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 326,000 copies.[52] It was later certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[53] The project spawned Cyrus's debut single as herself, \"See You Again\", which became her first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[54] It was eventually certified Platinum in the country, making it her first single to be RIAA certified.[55] The track also had success in countries such as Australia and Canada, where it also peaked inside of the Top 10.[56][57] The follow-up single \"Start All Over\" was released in early 2008; it failed to match the success of its predecessor, debuting and peaking at number 68 on the Hot 100.[58][59] Numerous songs from the Hannah Montana portion of the album charted worldwide following its release.[60]"],"after":["During the fall of 2007, the Best of Both Worlds Tour was launched to promote the joint album. With the Jonas Brothers, Aly & AJ, and Everlife as her opening acts, Cyrus toured from October 17, 2007, to January 31, 2008, with stops in the United States and Canada.[61] Tickets sold out in minutes and were scalped for up to $2,500 and an average of $214, well above their $26â€“$65 face value.[62] A Ticketmaster official commented that \"there [hadn't] been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis.\"[63] Upon the conclusion of the tour in January 2008, Walt Disney Pictures released Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, a 3D concert film of the tour, on February 1, 2008, for what was expected to be a one-week run. The film earned over $31 million[64] at the box office and an average of $42,000 per theater, twice the expected total, convincing Disney executives to extend the release for an indefinite run.[65] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records on April 15, 2008.[66]"]}}}
