It was originally established in 1934 by Daniel Cosío Villegas as a way to provide students of economics with books in Spanish on the subject. Little by little, FCE expanded its publishing areas to other subjects that today encompass almost everything, from children's literature to scientific texts. Fondo de Cultura Económica is a decentralized publishing institution funded by the Mexican government."]}}}
