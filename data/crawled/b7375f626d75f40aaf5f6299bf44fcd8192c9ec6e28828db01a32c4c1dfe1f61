Zack O'Malley Greenburg from Forbes explained that \"Typically, the entertainers for the Super Bowl do not get a cash payment... This is the kind of exposure that entertainers would give their right arm for, they could do 20 Leno and Letterman appearances and still not reach that [kind of] audience.\" He further analyzed that with 30-second commercial spots commanding over $3 million apiece, the 12 minutes of free television exposure had a total value of $84 million for Madonna's multiple enterprises coming to market at the time of the event. Although the singer did not get paid, she also did not have to pay for their accommodation, travels, backup dancers and stage setup. Other opportunities enlisted included the free advertising and publicity. Greenburg concluded by saying that \"Given all these benefits, playing the Super Bowl halftime show for free is more than worth the trouble. In fact, it's incredibly lucrativeâ€“and such a good deal for artists that some suspect a major change might be on the horizon.\"[50]"]}}}
