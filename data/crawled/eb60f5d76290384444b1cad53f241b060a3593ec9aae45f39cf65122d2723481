His words were our words in our conversations all the time.\"[163] She said: \"I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to even be able to take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here\", adding that Foxy Brown was \"the most influential female rapper\" for her.[164]"]}}}
