Tel Aviv's White City, around the city center, contains more than 5,000Â Modernist-style buildings inspired by the Bauhaus school and Le Corbusier.[7][8] Construction of these buildings, later declared protected landmarks and, collectively, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, continued until the 1950s in the area around Rothschild Boulevard.[8][128] Some 3,000 buildings were created in this style between 1931 and 1939 alone.[127] In the 1960s, this architectural style gave way to office towers and a chain of waterfront hotels and commercial skyscrapers.[20] Some of the city's Modernist buildings were neglected to the point of ruin. Before legislation to preserve this landmark architecture, many of the old buildings were demolished. Efforts are under way to refurbish Bauhaus buildings and restore them to their original condition.[129]"]}}}
