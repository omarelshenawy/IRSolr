Protesters sat down on University Avenue, occupying a large portion of the street.[11] On the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident was the first one to happen among these protests in Canada.[12][13] The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters."]}}}
