The commonly held view that nature abhorred a vacuum was called horror vacui. Speculation that even God could not create a vacuum if he wanted to was shut down[clarification needed] by the 1277 Paris condemnations of Bishop Etienne Tempier, which required there to be no restrictions on the powers of God, which led to the conclusion that God could create a vacuum if he so wished.[20] Jean Buridan reported in the 14th century that teams of ten horses could not pull open bellows when the port was sealed.[24]"],"after":["The 17th century saw the first attempts to quantify measurements of partial vacuum.[36] Evangelista Torricelli's mercury barometer of 1643 and Blaise Pascal's experiments that both demonstrated a partial vacuum."]}}}
