However, in many western societies and in appropriate settings, such as while suntanning, toplessness is not, of itself, normally regarded as indecent. In the United States, however, exposure of female nipples is a criminal offense in many states and not usually allowed in public (see public indecency), while in the United Kingdom, nudity may not be used to \"harass, alarm or distress\" according to the Public Order Act of 1986.[35] Different standards apply to art, with one example being the dome of the US Capitol featuring a fresco depicting goddesses with their breasts exposed."]}}}
