Garbage picking may take place in dumpsters or in landfills. When in dumpsters, the practice is called dumpster diving in American English and skipping in British English.[1][2] Dumpster diving is viewed as an effective urban foraging technique.[3] Dumpster divers forage dumpsters for items such as clothing, furniture, food, and similar items in good working condition.[3] Some people dumpster dive out of necessity due to poverty,[4] while others are high end professional divers that can earn 100s of thousands of US dollars per year.[5]"]}}}
