A statement by Pliny the Younger that his uncle was offered 400,000 sesterces for his manuscripts by Larcius Licinius while he (Pliny the Elder) was procurator of Hispania makes it the most certain of the three.[16] Pliny lists the peoples of \"Hither Hispania\", including population statistics and civic rights (modern Asturias and Gallaecia). He stops short of mentioning them all for fear of \"wearying the reader\".[33] As this is the only geographic region for which he gives this information, Syme hypothesizes that Pliny contributed to the census of Hither Hispania conducted in 73/74 by Vibius Crispus, legate from the Emperor, thus dating Pliny's procuratorship there.[34]"],"after":["During his stay in Hispania he became familiar with the agriculture and especially the gold mines of the north and west of the country.[35] His descriptions of the various methods of mining appear to be eye-witness judging by the discussion of gold mining methods in his Natural History. He might have visited the mine excavated at Las Medulas."]}}}
