On the inner keystone are the arms of the county palatine, a sword of justice and three sheaves. On this side of the gateway is a frieze-band with an inscription reading \"THIS GATE BEGUN MDCCLXVIII JOHN KELSAL ESQ. MAYOR: FINISHED MDCCLXIX CHA. BOSWELL ESQ. MAYOR\". The outer keystone has the arms of Richard Grosvenor with the motto \"NOBILITATE VIRTUS NON STEMMA CHARACTER\". The frieze-band inscription reads \"ERECTED AT THE EXPENSE OF RICHARD LORD GROSVENOR A.D. MDLXIX\".[1] The walkway which forms part of the circuit of the city walls crosses the top of Eastgate[8] which is surmounted by the Victorian clock."],"after":[]}}}
