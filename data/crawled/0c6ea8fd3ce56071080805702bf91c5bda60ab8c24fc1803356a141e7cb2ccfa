She accepted her next role, in the Grand Guignol horror film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) after reading the script and believing it could appeal to the same audience that had recently made Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) a success. She negotiated a deal that would pay her 10Â percent of the worldwide gross profits, in addition to her salary. The film became one of the year's biggest successes.[72]"]}}}
