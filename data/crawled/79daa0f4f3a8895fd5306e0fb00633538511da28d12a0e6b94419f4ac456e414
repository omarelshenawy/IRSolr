The Massachusetts Bay banished dissenters such as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams who were banished due to religious and political disagreements. In 1636, Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island and Hutchinson joined him there several years later.[96]"],"after":["In 1641, Massachusetts expanded inland significantly, acquiring the Connecticut River Valley settlement of Springfield, which had recently disputed with, and defected from its original administrators, the Connecticut Colony.[97] This established Massachusetts' southern border in the west,[98] though surveying problems resulted in disputed territory until 1803â€“04."]}}}
