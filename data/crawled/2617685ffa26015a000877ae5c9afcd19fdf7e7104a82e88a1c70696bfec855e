This can be the most comfortable point of sail, but requires constant attention. When the wind is coming directly behind the boat, the sailor must sail wing on wing, one sail on port the other on starboard. Loss of attention by the helmsperson can lead to an accidental jibe, causing injury to the boat or crew. All on deck must be aware of, and if possible avoid, the potential arc of the boom, mainsheet and other gear in case an accidental jibe occurs during a run. A preventer can be rigged to reduce danger and damage from accidental jibes."],"after":["Another technique used while running is sailing by the lee. Here the main sail is placed on the windward side of the boat, leading to a heightened risk of gybing. With the main placed perpendicular to the boat to windward, and then pulled in slightly, the leech is allowed to act as the leading edge of an airfoil. (Usually, the luff is the leading edge, such as when close-hauled.) This position, though unstable to accidental gybes, allows the sail to generate some force from lift, just as when sailing on a broad-reach. In fact, because there is no mast to generate turbulence around the sail's leading edge (as happens on the broad reach) the lift generated is somewhat stronger than might be expected for such an oblique profile."]}}}
