Although pop music is often seen as oriented towards the singles charts it is not the sum of all chart music, which has always contained songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs, while pop music as a genre is usually seen as existing and developing separately. Thus \"pop music\" may be used to describe a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll."]}}}
