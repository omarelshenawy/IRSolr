Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennonâ€“McCartney songwriting partnership.[109]"],"after":["In early 1965, while they were his guests for dinner, Lennon and Harrison's dentist secretly added LSD to their coffee.

I was pretty stunned for a month or two.\"[111] He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966.[112] He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that \"it opened my eyes\" and \"made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society\".[113]"]}}}
