Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada.[149][150] The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settingsâ€”the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed.[150] The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks.[151] In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron.[152] Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production has resulted in the subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.[44]"]}}}
