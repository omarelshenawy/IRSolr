Speaking on behalf of black women, she stated that not allowing them to vote condemned African American freedwomen \"to a triple bondage that man never knows,\" that of slavery, gender, and race.[55] She was joined in this belief by Anthony, Olympia Brown, and most especially Frances Gage, who was the first suffragist to champion voting rights for freedwomen.[56]"],"after":["Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and ardent abolitionist, agreed that voting rights should be universal. In 1866, Stanton, Anthony, and several other suffragists drafted a universal suffrage petition demanding that the right to vote be given without consideration of sex or race. The petition was introduced in the United States Congress by Stevens.[57] Despite these efforts, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, without adjustment, in 1868."]}}}
