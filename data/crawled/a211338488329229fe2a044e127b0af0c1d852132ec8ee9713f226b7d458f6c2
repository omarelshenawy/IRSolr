It was a cantata for the Leeds Festival, The Golden Legend, based on Longfellow's poem of the same name. Apart from the comic operas, this proved to be Sullivan's best received full-length work.[114] It was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime, and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation, fearing that it would become over-exposed.[115] Only Handel's Messiah was performed more often in Britain in the 1880s and 90s.[116] It remained in the repertory until about the 1920s, but since then it has been seldom performed,[117] although it received its first professional recording in 2001.[116] The musical scholar and conductor David Russell Hulme writes that the work influenced Elgar and Walton.[n 18]"]}}}
