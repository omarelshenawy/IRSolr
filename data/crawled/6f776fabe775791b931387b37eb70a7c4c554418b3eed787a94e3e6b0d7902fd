This observation has prompted the hypothesis that whereas female humans interbreeding with male Neanderthals were able to generate fertile offspring, the progeny of female Neanderthals who mated with male humans were either rare, absent or sterile.[140] However, some researchers have argued that there is evidence of possible interbreeding between female Neanderthals and male modern humans.[141][142]"],"after":["This section describes bones with Neanderthal traits in chronological order."]}}}
