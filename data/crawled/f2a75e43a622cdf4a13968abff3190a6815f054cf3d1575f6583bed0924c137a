For the former, I was thinking some like a helix (with ends joined togther) projected down onto a circle, to show that its charecterised by the number of turns (i.e. same image with one turn of the helix, two turns, three turns etc.). For the latter, some way of showing that any loop on a sphere can be deformed into a simple loop and hence a point. Can anyone help me here? Tompw 00:39, 22 April 2006 (UTC)"],"after":[]}}}
