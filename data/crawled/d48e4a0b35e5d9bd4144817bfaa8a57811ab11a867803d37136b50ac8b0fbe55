Johnston, many of whom were Scottish, meeting public demand for information on an expanding Empire. This British tradition continues in the electronic age with innovations such as the National Land and Property Gazetteer, the text-based Gazetteer for Scotland, and the new (2008) National Gazetteer (for Scotland), formerly known as the Definitive National Address – Scotland National Gazetteer. In addition to local or regional gazetteers, there have also been comprehensive world gazetteers published; an early example would be the 1912 world gazetteer published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.[23] There are also interregional gazetteers with a specific focus, such as the gazetteer of the Swedish atlas \"Das Bästas Bilbok\" (1969), a road atlas and guide for Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark.[24]"],"after":[]}}}
