Previously he had operated his own small cotton factory. During the time period of 1830 to 1836, Miss Anthony attended The Friends' Boarding School in the Black Hill section of Plainfield, Connecticut. The boarding school was run by The Reverend Doctor Rowland Greene, his wife Susanna & Master Doctor Benjamin Greene. Her fellow students included Miss Pheobe Jackson, Master Samuel B. Tobey, and Master Elisha Dyer. Between 1833 & 1834, the students, including Miss Anthony, would walk to visit Miss Prudence Crandall & her school of Young Ladies & Little Misses of Color, who lived approximately 2 miles over the Quinnebaug River in Canterbury, Connecticut.[citation needed] When she was seventeen, Anthony was sent to a Quaker boarding school in Philadelphia, where she unhappily endured its severe atmosphere. She was forced to end her studies after one term because her family was financially ruined during an economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837. They were forced to sell everything they had at an auction, but they were rescued by her maternal uncle, who bought most of their belongings and restored them to the family. To assist her family financially, Anthony left home to teach at a Quaker boarding school.[4]"],"after":["In 1845, the family moved to a farm on the outskirts of Rochester, New York, purchased partly with the inheritance of Anthony's mother. There they associated with a group of Quaker social reformers who had left their congregation because of the restrictions it placed on reform activities, and who in 1848 formed a new organization called the Congregational Friends. The Anthony farmstead soon became the Sunday afternoon gathering place for local activists, including Frederick Douglass, a former slave and a prominent abolitionist who became Anthony's lifelong friend.[5][6]"]}}}
