He also recounted that a young Japanese lady, a tea-server from the Japanese village, came to rehearsals to coach the three little maids in some native Japanese dances.[19] On 12 February 1885, one month before The Mikado opened, the Illustrated London News wrote about the opening of the Japanese village noting, among other things, that \"the graceful, fantastic dancing featured... three little maids!\"[20] The title character appears only in Act II of the opera. Gilbert related that he and Sullivan had decided to cut the Mikado's Act II only solo song, but that members of the company and others who had witnessed the dress rehearsal \"came to us in a body and begged us to restore [it]\".[19] The original designs for the men's costumes were by C.
