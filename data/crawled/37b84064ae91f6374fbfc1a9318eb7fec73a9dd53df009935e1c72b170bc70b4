English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French, and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[228]"],"after":["English and French are the first languages of 59.7 and 23.2 percent of the population respectively.
