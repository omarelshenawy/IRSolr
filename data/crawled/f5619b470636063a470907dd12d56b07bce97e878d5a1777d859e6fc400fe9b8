Helsinki was to become Finland's window to the world; a European city to which the University belonged as an integral part. Carl Ludvig Engel, architect, was given the assignment of designing an Empire-style main building next to Senate Square, facing the Imperial Senate. The main building was completed in 1832. Thanks to the lessons learnt from the fire of Turku, the library was built separate from other premises. The library and several faculty buildings in the campus were also designed by Engel."],"after":["The main building as well as other buildings of the campus were badly damaged during the Soviet bombings in World War II but rebuilt after the war.[18]"]}}}
