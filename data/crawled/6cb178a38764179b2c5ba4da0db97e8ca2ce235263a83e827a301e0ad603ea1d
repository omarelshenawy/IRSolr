A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specializes in this field of study. The term \"botany\" comes from the Ancient Greek word βοτάνη (botanē) meaning \"pasture\", \"grass\", or \"fodder\"; βοτάνη is in turn derived from βόσκειν (boskein), \"to feed\" or \"to graze\".[1][2][3] Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms[4] of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.[5]"]}}}
