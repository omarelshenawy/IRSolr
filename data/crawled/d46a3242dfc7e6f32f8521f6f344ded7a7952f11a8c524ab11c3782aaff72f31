The club plays in the Vanarama Conference, the fifth tier of English football. In the 1970s and 1980s Altrincham F.C. built a reputation for \"giant-killing\" acts against Football League teams in FA Cup matches. The club has knocked out Football League opposition on a record 16 occasions,[76] including a 1986 victory against top-flight Birmingham City.[77] Altrincham won the forerunner of the Football Conference in its first two seasons, but was denied election to the Football League on both occasions, falling a single vote short in 1980.[78] Altrincham have since had mixed fortunes. Relegated to the Northern Premier League in 1997, the club earned promotion two years later, but suffered a second relegation after a single season in the Conference.[79] In the 2010–11 season Altrincham were relegated to Conference North.[80]"],"after":["Altrincham is one of the few towns in North West England with an ice rink, and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham Ice Rink was built in Broadheath.[81] The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham Ice Rink closed.[82] The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until construction of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham Ice Dome was completed.[83] Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the Ice Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's MEN Arena.[84] In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix English National Ice Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into use.[85] When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to the public for ice skating.[86]"]}}}
