The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology."],"after":["The product topology on X is the topology generated by sets of the form pi−1(U), where i is in I and U is an open subset of Xi. In other words, the sets {pi−1(U)} form a subbase for the topology on X. A subset of X is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) union of intersections of finitely many sets of the form pi−1(U). The pi−1(U) are sometimes called open cylinders, and their intersections are cylinder sets."]}}}
