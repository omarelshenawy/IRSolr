Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus' foster father. Historians such as Geza Vermes, E. P. Sanders, and Reza Aslan state Joseph as Jesus' father.[102][103][104] Geza Vermes notes that the differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views.[102] Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter.[105] His other family members—his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters[106]—are mentioned in the gospels and other sources. Some early Christian writers, concerned that mention of Jesus' brothers and sisters contradicted the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, argued that these represented either older children of Joseph by a previous marriage, or that the reference was actually to \"cousins\". Both interpretations are discounted by modern scholars.[107][108]"]}}}
