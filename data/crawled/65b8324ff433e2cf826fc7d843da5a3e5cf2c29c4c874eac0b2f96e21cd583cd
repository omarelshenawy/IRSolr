The list of records which the Guinness World Records covers is not fixed, records may be added and also removed for various reasons. The public are invited to submit applications for records, which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record.[4] The company also provides corporate services for companies to \"harness the power of record-breaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses.\"[19]"],"after":["Guinness World Records states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons, such as those related to the killing or harming of animals.[22]","Several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons, including concerns for the wellbeing of potential record breakers. For example, following publication of a \"heaviest fish\" record, many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy, therefore such entries were removed.[23] The Guinness Book also dropped records within their \"eating and drinking records\" section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential litigation.[24] These changes included the removal of all liquor, wine, and beer drinking records, along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees.[24] Other records, such as sword swallowing and rally driving (on public roads), were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels."]}}}
