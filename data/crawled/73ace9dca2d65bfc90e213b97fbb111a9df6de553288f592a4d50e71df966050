The film was directed by Billy Wilder and co-starred Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Wilder had experienced Monroe's tardiness, stage fright, and inability to remember lines during production of The Seven Year Itch. However her behavior was now more hostile, and was marked by refusals to participate in filming and occasional outbursts of profanity.[112] Monroe consistently refused to take direction from Wilder, or insisted on numerous retakes of simple scenes until she was satisfied.[113] She developed a rapport with Lemmon, but she disliked Curtis after hearing that he had described their love scenes as \"like kissing Hitler\".[114] Curtis later stated that the comment was intended as a joke.[115] During filming, Monroe discovered that she was pregnant. She suffered another miscarriage in December 1958, as filming was completed.[116]"],"after":["Some Like it Hot became a resounding success, and was nominated for six Academy Awards. Monroe was acclaimed for her performance and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Wilder commented that the film was the biggest success he had ever been associated with.[117] He discussed the problems he encountered during filming, saying \"Marilyn was so difficult because she was totally unpredictable. I never knew what kind of day we were going to have ... would she be cooperative or obstructive?\"[118] He had little patience with her method-acting technique and said that instead of going to the Actors Studio \"she should have gone to a train-engineer's school ... to learn something about arriving on schedule.\"[119] Wilder had become ill during filming, and explained, \"We were in mid-flight—and there was a nut on the plane.\"[120] In hindsight, he discussed Monroe's \"certain indefinable magic\" and \"absolute genius as a comic actress.\"[118]"]}}}
