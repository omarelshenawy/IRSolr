The vowel /ɔə/ (as in \"door\", \"boar\") had largely merged with /ɔː/ by the Second World War, and the vowel /ʊə/ (as in \"poor\", \"tour\") has more recently merged with /ɔː/ as well among most speakers,[61] although the sound /ʊə/ is still found in conservative speakers (and this is still the only pronunciation given in the OED). See poor–pour merger. The remaining two centring glides /ɪə/ /eə/ are increasingly pronounced as long monophthongs [ɪː] [ɛː], although without merging with any existing vowels.[46]"]}}}
