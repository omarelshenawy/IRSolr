The oldest art objects in the world—a series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave.[23] Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years.[24] Etched shells by homo erectus from 430,000 and 540,000 years ago were discovered in 2014.[25]"]}}}
