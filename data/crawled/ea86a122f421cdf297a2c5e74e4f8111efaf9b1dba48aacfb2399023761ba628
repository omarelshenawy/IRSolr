Negating the Playfair's axiom form, since it is a compound statement (... there exists one and only one ...), can be done in two ways. Either there will exist more than one line through the point parallel to the given line or there will exist no lines through the point parallel to the given line. In the first case, replacing the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) with the statement \"In a plane, given a point P and a line ℓ not passing through P, there exist two lines through P which do not meet ℓ\" and keeping all the other axioms, yields hyperbolic geometry.[18] The second case is not dealt with as easily. Simply replacing the parallel postulate with the statement, \"In a plane, given a point P and a line ℓ not passing through P, all the lines through P meet ℓ\", does not give a consistent set of axioms. This follows since parallel lines exist in absolute geometry,[19] but this statement says that there are no parallel lines. This problem was known (in a different guise) to Khayyam, Saccheri and Lambert and was the basis for their rejecting what was known as the \"obtuse angle case\". In order to obtain a consistent set of axioms which includes this axiom about having no parallel lines, some of the other axioms must be tweaked. The adjustments to be made depend upon the axiom system being used. Among others these tweaks will have the effect of modifying Euclid's second postulate from the statement that line segments can be extended indefinitely to the statement that lines are unbounded. Riemann's elliptic geometry emerges as the most natural geometry satisfying this axiom."],"after":["Two dimensional Euclidean geometry is modelled by our notion of a \"flat plane.\""]}}}
