Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.[273] The two important political legacies that flowed from the adoption of the Lost Cause analysis were that it facilitated the reunification of the North and the South, and it excused the \"virulent racism\" of the 19th century, sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. But the Lost Cause legacy to history is \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.[274]"],"after":[]}}}
