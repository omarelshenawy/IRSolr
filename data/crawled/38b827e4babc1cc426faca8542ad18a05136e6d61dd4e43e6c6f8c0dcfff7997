This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent as it did in the rest of Greater Manchester.[65] There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester.[65] After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census.[65] The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.[65]"]}}}
