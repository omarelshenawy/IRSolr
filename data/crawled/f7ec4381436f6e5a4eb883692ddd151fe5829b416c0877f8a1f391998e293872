Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone wrote that it is \"one of a handful of tracks with bells and whistles — the classic disco 'toot-toot, beep-beep' — traceable to two of Madonna's touchstones: Chic, and Donna Summer.\" Ganz went on to criticize West's appearance, calling it \"uninspired\".[17] In a similar review, Thomas Hauner of PopMatters wrote that the song \"continues the Donna Summer touch, this time opting for 'beep beep' vocals on a surprisingly sweet track.\"[18] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine believed that the song \"has inexplicably lost its definite article but gained a Kanye guest spot and a flattering sonic facelift that transports it from 2001 to 1979.\"[15] Talia Soghomolian of musicOMH praised \"the variations in its tempo\", making it \"the perfect dance floor tune, merging old school and modern takes on urbanity.\"[19] Stern wrote a positive review for Idolator that \"by the time West shows up unexpectedly for his rap at the end, you have no choice but to heed his call to get down, beep beep, and get up outta your seat.\"[10]"]}}}
