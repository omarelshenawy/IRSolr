On July 10, Tucker (formerly The Situation with Tucker Carlson) started airing at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET (taking over Abrams' old timeslot), while Rita Cosby's Live & Direct was taken off the schedule. Cosby was instead given the role of primary anchor for MSNBC Investigates at 10 and 11 p.m. ET, a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson's timeslots. According to the press release, MSNBC Investigates promised to \"...complement MSNBC's existing programming by building on [the channel's] library of award winning documentaries.\"[25] The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p.m. was likely a result of the success that MSNBC saw with their Friday \"experiment\" of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials. On September 24, 2007, Abrams announced that he would leave the position of General Manager to focus on his 9:00Â p.m. ET talk show, \"Live With Dan Abrams\". Oversight of MSNBC is now provided by Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC.[26]"],"after":[]}}}
