The fear of nationalistic misuse of Pan-Germanism nevertheless remains strong. But the overwhelming majority of Germans today are not chauvinistic in nationalism, but in 2006 and again in 2010, the German National Football Team won third place in the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, ignited a positive scene of German pride, enhanced by success in sport."],"after":["For decades after the Second World War, any national symbol or expression was a taboo.[149] However, the Germans are becoming increasingly patriotic.[149][150][151] During a study in 2009, in which some 2,000 German citizens age 14 and upwards filled out a questionnaire, nearly 60% of those surveyed agreed with the sentiment \"I'm proud to be German.\" And 78%, if free to choose their nation, would opt for German nationality with \"near or absolute certainty\".[152] Another study in 2009, carried out by the Identity Foundation in DÃ¼sseldorf, showed that 73% of the Germans were proud of their country, twice more than 8 years earlier. According to Eugen Buss, a sociology professor at the University of Hohenheim, there's an ongoing normalisation and more and more Germans are becoming openly proud of their country.[150][151]"]}}}
