Each term in the sum corresponds to a mode of vibration of the string. The mode with n = 1 is called the fundamental mode, and the frequencies of the other modes are all multiples of this frequency. They form the overtone series of the string, and they are the basis for musical acoustics. The initial conditions may then be satisfied by representing f and g as infinite sums of these modes. Wind instruments typically correspond to vibrations of an air column with one end open and one end closed. The corresponding boundary conditions are"],"after":["The method of separation of variables can also be applied in this case, and it leads to a series of odd overtones."]}}}
