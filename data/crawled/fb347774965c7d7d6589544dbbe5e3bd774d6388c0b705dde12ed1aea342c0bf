Tolstoy described him as, \"one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times\" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his words into Russian.[159] Proust not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.[160] Gandhi wrote of the \"magic spell\" cast on him by Unto This Last and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it Sarvodaya, \"The Advancement of All\".[citation needed] In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.[161][162]"],"after":["A number of Utopian socialist Ruskin Colonies attempted to put his political ideals into practice.
