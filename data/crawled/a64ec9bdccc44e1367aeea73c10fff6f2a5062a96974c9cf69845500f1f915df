While a simile compares two items, a metaphor may compare or directly equate them, and so does not necessarily apply any distancing words of comparison, such as \"like\" or \"as\". A metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech which achieve their effects via association, comparison or resemblance - including allegory, hyperbole, and simile."]}}}
