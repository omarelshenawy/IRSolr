Impressionist literature is closely related to Symbolism, with its major exemplars being Baudelaire, Mallarm√©, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. Authors such as Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, and Joseph Conrad have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life."],"after":[]}}}
