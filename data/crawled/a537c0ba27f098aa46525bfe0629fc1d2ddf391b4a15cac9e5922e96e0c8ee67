He flew some of the equipments to the roof of Lucas Oil and had to attach them there at a height of 175 feet (53.3Â m), so that it did not intervene with the camera movements during the main game. When the show time came on, they were lowered to light the venue. Golden light was used during the opening sequence, followed by black and white strobes for \"Vogue\". A colorful palette provided the lights for \"Music\" while a primarily red hue was prevalent during \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\". Finally, the performance of \"Like a Prayer\" had another stream of gold Sharpys, making rays of sunlight.[26]"],"after":["Sound equipments from Sennheiser were used for audio. Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer explained that they wanted to keep the arrangements simple by using Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software which was used for tweaking the frequencies. Madonna used the HSP 4 headset at the beginning of the show, and changed it to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld Blake and Mirandatransmitter afterwards. Sennheiser transmitters were used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO while Green's mic used the MD 5235 capsule. According to an article in Mix, during the show Napier recalled that they needed specific gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided immediately by Sennheiser on the day of the event.[28] Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound Company, were in charge of the wireless sound monitoring throughout the show. The team initially inspected the site and submitted their findings to the NFL, who agreed on using their services.. Through a series of trial runs, PWS was able to deduce which frequency to use, so that interference was eliminated.[29]"]}}}
