Later that year she performed a lip-synched version at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards which was later released on the video compilation The Immaculate Collection and the European video single for \"Justify My Love\". It featured Madonna and her dancers dressed in an 18th-century French theme, with Madonna bearing great resemblance to Marie Antoinette. Madonna wore Glenn Close's costume from the film Dangerous Liaisons.[33][46][47] During the performance, Madonna and her dancers flashed their undergarments during their routine, and at one point Madonna pushed the faces of two male dancers into her breasts, and one of her dancers also fondled her breasts. Overall, the performance was ranked as the sixth best in the history of MTV Video Music Awards in a Billboard poll.[48] In 1993, Madonna performed the song on The Girlie Show World Tour and wore a large beaded headdress by Dolce and Gabbana with the music re-arranged with a Middle-Eastern influence.[citation needed] In 2004, Madonna opened her Re-Invention World Tour with the song and was included in the 2005 documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, it was later released on the live album to accompany it.[citation needed] Madonna performed the song again on the 2008â€“09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, this version includes a mash-up including \"4 Minutes\" and Timbaland's \"Give It to Me\".[citation needed] \"Vogue\" also served as the opening song in Madonna's Super Bowl XLVI halftime performance with an Egyptian thematic. The same version of the song was performed on the MDNA Tour in which Madonna wore a reinvented cone bra designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier.[citation needed]"]}}}
