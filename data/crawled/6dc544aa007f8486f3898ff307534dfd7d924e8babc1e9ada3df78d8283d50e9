Exposed to high risks of disruption to their agriculture, Ivatans have adopted strategies in order to live. Traditionally, because of the frequent typhoons and drought, they plant root crops able to cope with the environment. These crops include yam, sweet potato, taro, garlic, ginger and onion, as they ensure higher chances of survival during awry climate conditions.[6] The Ivatan study the behavior of animals, sky color, wind and clouds to predict the weather. The Ivatans usually gather their animals and stay in their houses when they see that the cows take shelter from the payaman (communal pasture) and birds taking refuge in houses or in the ground. A pink sky with an orange hue also heralds a storm.[7] The sea is vital to the Ivatan's way of life.[3] Although abundant only in the month of March to May, they depend on the flying fish (dibang) and dolphinfish (arayu) present on the shores of Batanes.[2] They have a native delicacy called uvod (the pith of the banana stalk) which is served, along with the wine palek, on festive occasions such as weddings.[1]"],"after":["Before Spaniards arrived at the Philippines, Ivatans built their houses largely from cogon grass, small and well situated, designed to protect against strong winds.[2][3] The Spaniards introduced large-scale production of lime for the construction of their now-famous stone houses. With meter-thick limestone walls,[3] the type of their infrastructures are designed against the harsh Batanes environment,[8] which is known as a terminal passage of typhoons in the Philippines. The basic cogon grass is still preserved as roofs of their houses, thickly constructed to withstand strong winds.[2] These houses are comparable to the white houses in New Zealand, Ireland and Scottish Highlands.[9]"]}}}
