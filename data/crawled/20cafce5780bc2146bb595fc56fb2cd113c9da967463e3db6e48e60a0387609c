On 5 February 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared before the UN to present evidence that Iraq was hiding unconventional weapons.[80] The French government also believed that Saddam had stockpiles of anthrax and botulism toxin, and the ability to produce VX.[81] In March, Blix said progress had been made in inspections, and no evidence of WMD had been found.[82] Iraqi scientist Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi codenamed \"Curveball\", admitted in February 2011, that he lied to the CIA about biological weapons in order to get the US to attack and remove Saddam from power.[83]"],"after":["In early 2003, the US, British, and Spanish governments proposed the so-called \"eighteenth resolution\" to give Iraq a deadline for compliance with previous resolutions enforced by the threat of military action. This proposed resolution was subsequently withdrawn due to lack of support on the UN Security Council. In particular, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members France, Germany and Canada and non-NATO member Russia were opposed to military intervention in Iraq, due to the high level of risk to the international community's security, and defended disarmament through diplomacy.[84][85]"]}}}
