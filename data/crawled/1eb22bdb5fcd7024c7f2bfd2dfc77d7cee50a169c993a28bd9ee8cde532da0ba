The earliest dated work on this subject is the drypoint Gardner Held by His Mother (an impression inscribed \"Jan/88\" is in the New York Public Library),[57] although she had painted a few earlier works on the theme. Some of these works depict her own relatives, friends, or clients, although in her later years she generally used professional models in compositions that are often reminiscent of Italian Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child. After 1900, she concentrated almost exclusively on mother-and-child subjects.[58]"]}}}
