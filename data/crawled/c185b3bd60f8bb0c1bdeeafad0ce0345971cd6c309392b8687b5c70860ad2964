Two newspapers, La Prensa and La Argentina, heavily advocated for a third ship; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship.[71] The American minister to Argentina, Charles H. Sherrill, cabled back to the United States that \"this newspaper rivalry promises the early conclusion of a movement which means a third battleship whether by public subscription or by Government funds.\"[72] On 31 December 1910, the Argentine government decided against constructing the ship, after Roque Sáenz Peña, who had been making entreaties to Brazil to end the expensive naval race, was elected to the Presidency.[73] In addition, the intended target of the third Argentine dreadnought, the third Brazilian dreadnought, had already been canceled multiple times.[74][M]"]}}}
