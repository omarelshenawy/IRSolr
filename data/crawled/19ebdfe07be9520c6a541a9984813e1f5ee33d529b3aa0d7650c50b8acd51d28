At this early time, the workforce consisted of the manager who was Basil Brown, and the maintenance engineer and workshop manager, who was Cedric Wood. Cedric Wood was an exceptional aircraft engineer, having an unblemished maintenance record, despite having nine separate aircraft maintenance licences to his name. Enabling the company to operate maintenance procedures on a 'shoe string' budget. Initially, using 'tiger moth' aircraft, East-West established Australia's first regular mail delivery service between Tamworth NSW, Port Maquarie and Newcastle. The company bought Anson aircraft which allowed it to carry more mail and passengers. It grew in the following years to an intrastate operator to Australia's third largest domestic carrier which owned by 1982 ten Fokker aircraft. By that time East-West was also about to acquire its first jet aircraft. It was however still reeling from a venture into the Northern Territory in 1980, which incurred heavy losses. This caused also a falling out among board members.[2] East-West, already in 1981 in an era still governed by the Two Airlines Policy, became the first \"third\" carrier operating between Sydney and Canberra.[3][4]"]}}}
