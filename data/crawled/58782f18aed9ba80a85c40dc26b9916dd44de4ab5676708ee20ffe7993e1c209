According to Nicephorus (Historia eccl., 2, 40), Matthias first preached the Gospel in Judea, then in Ethiopia (made out to be a synonym for the geographically quite separate Colchis, now Caucasian Georgia) and was crucified in Colchis. A marker placed in the ruins of the Roman fortress at Gonio (Apsaros) in the modern Georgian region of Adjara claims that Matthias is buried at that site. Since 1970, the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, which formerly celebrated St. Matthias on the sixth day to the Calends of March (24 February usually, but 25 February in leap years) holds his feast day on 14 May.
