Tesla coils are composed of coupled resonant electric circuits. Nikola Tesla actually experimented with a large variety of coils and configurations, so it is difficult to describe a specific mode of construction that will meet the wants of those who ask about \"Tesla\" coils. \"Early coils\" and \"later coils\" vary in configuration and setup. Tesla coils in general are very popular devices among high-voltage enthusiasts."]}}}
