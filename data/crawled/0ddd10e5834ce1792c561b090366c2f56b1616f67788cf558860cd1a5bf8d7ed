It did not add other letters on the parts that cannot be seen on the 2D logo, but used that space to include small logos of the sister projects and information about Wikimania. A variant of that model was used to build a person-sized Wikiball that spun on a stand, featured during the event.[7] This led to a renewed interest in getting a proper 3D model for the logo."],"after":["By 2007, users on listservs discovered that the logo had some minor errors. The errors were not immediately fixed, because, according to Friedland, he could not locate the original project file. Friedland added that \"I have tried to reconstruct it, but it never looks right\" and that the logo \"should be redrawn by a professional illustrator.\"[5] Kizu Naoko (木津 尚子?), a Wikipedian, said that most Japanese users supported correcting the errors. In an e-mail to Noam Cohen of The New York Times, Kizu said that \"It could be an option to leave them as they are. Most people don't take it serious [sic] and think the graphical logo is a sort of pot-au-feu of various letters without meaning.\"[5]"]}}}
