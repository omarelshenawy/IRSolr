Hooks are run every time a certain event happens; for instance, the ArticleSaveComplete hook occurs after a save article request has been processed.[88] This can be used, for example, by an extension that notifies selected users whenever a page edit occurs on the wiki from new or anonymous users.[89] New tags can be created to process data with opening and closing tags (<newtag>...</newtag>).[90] Parser functions can be used to create a new command ({{#if:...|...|...}}).[91] New special pages can be created to perform a specific function. These pages are dynamically generated. For example, a special page might show all pages that have one or more links to an external site or it might create a form providing user submitted feedback.[92] Skins allow users to customize the look and feel of MediaWiki.[93] A minor extension point allows the use of Amazon S3 to host image files.[94]"],"after":["MediaWiki can be made more advanced and useful for various purposes through its extensions. These extensions vary greatly in complexity.","The Wikimedia Foundation operates a Git server where many extensions host their repository. Most of them also have a documentation page on the MediaWiki website."]}}}
