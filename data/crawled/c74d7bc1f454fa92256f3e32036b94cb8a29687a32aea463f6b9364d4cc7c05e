These include cottages in Great Budworth, and cottages, houses, schools and farms in the Eaton Hall estate and its associated villages.[56] In 1872 he designed Shotwick Park, a large house in Great Saughall, built in brick with some half-timbering; it has steep roofs, tall ribbed chimneys and turrets.[57][58] About the same time he reconstructed Broxton Higher Hall, incorporating much half-timbering.[59][60] Commissions for more large houses came in the late 1870s and 1880s. The Gelli (1877) is a house in three ranges designed for the Kenyon sisters in the village of Tallarn Green, Flintshire.[61][62] Also built for the Kenyon family is Llannerch Panna in Penley, Flintshire (1878â€“79), which is \"competent in its handling of timberwork\".[63][64] An entirely black-and-white house with jettying is Rowden Abbey (1881) in Hertfordshire.[65] Back in North Wales, Plas Mynach (1883) in Barmouth includes much detailed woodwork internally.[66]"]}}}
