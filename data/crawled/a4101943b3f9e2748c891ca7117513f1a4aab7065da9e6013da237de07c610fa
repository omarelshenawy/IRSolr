Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album's producers to stop the release.[49] The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[50] On September 11, 2001, Aguilera and Santos ended their relationship.[51]"]}}}
