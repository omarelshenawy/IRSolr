Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".[14] In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figuresâ€”generally made up of 8th or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.[21]"]}}}
