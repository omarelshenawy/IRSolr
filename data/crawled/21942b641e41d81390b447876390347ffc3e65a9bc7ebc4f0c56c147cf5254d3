Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.[175] In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including biopesticides, plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace.[176] However, organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.[177] The reconditioning of soil to restore nutrients lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques also takes time.[175]"]}}}
