These teams are given limited authority and can only make recommendations to individuals higher in the organizational hierarchy.[18] Parallel teams are used for solving problems and activities that are in need of revision or improvement.[19] Examples of parallel teams are quality circles, task forces, quality improvement teams, employee involvement groups. The effectiveness of parallel teams is proven by the continuation of their usage and expansion throughout organizations due to their ability to improve quality and increase employee involvement.[20][21]"]}}}
