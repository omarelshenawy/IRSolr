The iPhone 3GS and later also feature a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.[105]"],"after":["The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, featuring five buttons. The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display, and is called the \"Home button\" because it closes the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface. The home button is denoted not by a house, as on many other similar devices, but a rounded square, reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen."]}}}
