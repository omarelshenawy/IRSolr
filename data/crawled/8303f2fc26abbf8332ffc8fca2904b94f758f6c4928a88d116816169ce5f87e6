Another condition given by the Committee was that a moderator or an anti-piracy spokesperson be present to balance the debate.[28]"],"after":["The documentary was officially released for peer-to-peer filesharing using peer-to-peer networks on December 28, 2007 and, according to the filmmakers, downloaded 150,000 times in the first three days of distribution.[29] Pirate Bay encouraged the downloading of Steal This Film Two, announcing its release on its blog.[30] Steal This Film Part 2 was also screened by the Pirate Cinema Copenhagen in January 2008.[31] The documentary can also be downloaded on the official Steal This Film website.[32]"]}}}
