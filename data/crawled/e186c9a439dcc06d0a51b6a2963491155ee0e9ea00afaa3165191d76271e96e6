She was descended from Dutch, African and English ancestors.[3] William Du Bois' maternal great-great-grandfather was Tom Burghardt, a slave (born in West Africa around 1730) who was held by the Dutch colonist Conraed Burghardt. Tom briefly served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, which may have been how he gained his freedom during the 18th century.[4] Tom's son Jack Burghardt was the father of Othello Burghardt, who was the father of Mary Silvina Burghardt.[4]"]}}}
