The gentleman on the original cover, now referred to as \"Eustace Tilley\", is a character created by Corey Ford for The New Yorker. The hero of a series entitled \"The Making of a Magazine\", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a morning coat and striped trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley's last name from an aunt—he had always found it vaguely humorous. \"Eustace\" was selected for euphony, although Ford may have borrowed the name from Eustace Taylor, his fraternity brother from Delta Kappa Epsilon at Columbia College of Columbia University."]}}}
