Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region."],"after":["The pagan Franks, from whom the ancient name of \"Francie\" was derived, originally settled the north part of Gaul, but under Clovis I conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central Gaul. In 498, Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" (French: La fille aînée de l’Église) by the papacy,[34] and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" (Rex Christianissimus)."]}}}
