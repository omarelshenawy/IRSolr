The changes in agriculture in Britain between the 16th and 19th centuries would subsequently affect agriculture around the world. Major points of development included enclosure, mechanization, crop rotation and selective breeding. Prior to the 1960s, historians viewed the British Agricultural Revolution of having been \"largely facilitated by a small number of key innovators,\" including Robert Bakewell,[43] Thomas Coke and Charles Townshend.
