In some cases, that name has been selected by the individual, who may have originally been given a polynym (\"multiple name\"). In other cases, it has been determined by the custom of the country[3] or by some interested segment. In the case of historical figures, it may be the only one of the individual's names that has survived and is still known today."]}}}
