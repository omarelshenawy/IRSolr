The municipality invested two million shekels in the project. The goal was to make Florentin the Soho of Tel Aviv, and attract artists and young professionals to the neighborhood. Indeed, street artists, such as Dede, installation artists such as Sigalit Landau, and many others made the upbeat neighborhood their home base.[124][125] Florentin is now known as a hip, \"cool\" place to be in Tel Aviv with coffeehouses, markets, bars, galleries and parties.[126]"],"after":[]}}}
