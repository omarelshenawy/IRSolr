In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together.[43] He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, beliefs and values (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration.[22][44] Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive.[45] Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, and at the same time individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions.[44][46] Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.[45]"]}}}
