It is so called because its root mean square value is 230 V. This means that the time-averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a DC voltage of 230 V. To determine the peak voltage (amplitude), we can rearrange the above equation to:"],"after":["For 230 V AC, the peak voltage is therefore , which is about 325 V."]}}}
