It is an example of the transition from a centrally planned to a primarily market-based economy. In 2009 Poland had the highest GDP growth in the EU - 1.6%.[120][121][122] The country's most successful exports include machinery, furniture, foods and meats,[123] motor boats, light planes, hardwood products, casual clothing, shoes and cosmetics.[124] Germany is by far the biggest importer of Poland's exports as of 2013.[125]"]}}}
