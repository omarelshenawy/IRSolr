It was first cultivated in what is now the United States, at several sites in New Mexico and Arizona, about 2100 BC.[55] As it was introduced to new cultures, new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations. Maize was the staple food, or a major staple (along with squash, Andean region potato, quinoa, beans, and amaranth), of most pre-Columbian North American, Mesoamerican, South American, and Caribbean cultures. The Mesoamerican civilization was strengthened upon the field crop of maize, through harvesting it, its religious and spiritual importance and how it impacted their diet. Maize formed the Mesoamerican people's identity. During the first millennium AD, maize cultivation spread from Mexico into the US Southwest and during the following millennium into the US Northeast and southeastern Canada, transforming the landscape as Native Americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop.[citation needed]"]}}}
