Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0.[41] Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character displays.[41]"]}}}
