According to public logs, he has edited his biography 19 times,[12] as of September 9, 2013, seven times altering information about whether Larry Sanger was a co-founder of Wikipedia. It was also revealed that Wales had edited the Wikipedia article of his former company, Bomis. \"Bomis Babes\", a section of the Bomis website, had been characterized in the article as \"soft-core pornography,\" but Wales revised this to \"adult content section\" and deleted mentions of pornography. He said he was fixing an error, and didn't agree with calling Bomis Babes soft porn. Wales conceded that he had made the changes, but maintained that they were technical corrections.[13]"]}}}
