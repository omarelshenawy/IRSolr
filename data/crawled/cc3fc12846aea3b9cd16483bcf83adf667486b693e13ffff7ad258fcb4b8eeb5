Keith Caulfied of Billboard deemed it as a \"very dance-by-the-numbers with Madonna\" song, and further assessed that the chorus made \"Girl Gone Wild\" a memorable song.[25] Robbie Daw from Idolator said that \"Madge [is] doing what she does best: turning up the heat on the dance floor,\" but that \"the song is packed with tried-but-true sexual pop cliches.\"[27] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone rated it three out of five stars. He commended the singer for the electro and Europop composition of the track, describing it as \"buoyant and warm-rinse soothing. It's the sound of a woman who hits the dance-floor for restoration more than craziness.\"[28] Haigh from Attitude believed that \"Girl Gone Wild\" should have been released as the lead single from MDNA. He felt that the track \"screams\" early 1990s Madonna's work, and complimented it for being a \"basic, balls-to-the-wall night out anthem\", adding \"why does that have to be something that's considered 'below' Madonna?\"[19] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from the same magazine praised the \"pop stomper\" track, writing: \"The production might sound like she's been listening to a fair bit of Rihanna, but who's counting. Madonna brings her own authority, creating the kind of anthemic party song that she does best, the kind where everyone from your three-year-old niece to your 60-year-old mother gets up on the dancefloor.\"[29] MTV News journalist Bradley Stern felt that the composition emulated her single \"Celebration\" (2009).[20]"],"after":["A writer for Virgin Media gave the song four out of five stars, writing: \"It sounds a tad familiar, not to mention inappropriate in a track named after a US porn-movie series, but Benny Benassi then lifts 'Girl Gone Wild' into a fantastic throbbing Kelis-style dancefloor-filler.\"[30] Nick Levine, writing for The National, praised the composition saying that it \"gets better the more (and louder) you play it\".[31] Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the song was \"more interesting musically\", especially during the middle eight. \"A signal we're back in Confessions on a Dance Floor territory following the relative misstep of Hard Candy,\" Cragg concluded.[22] Laurence Green from musicOMH believed that with its nod to Confessions on a Dance Floor and \"Get Together\", the song was commercial enough to represent the current sound.[32] In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised the track calling it a \"lean, sleek, electro stomper, balancing the twin requirements of radio friendly hooks and dance floor drive\".[33] Aidin Vaziri of the San Francisco Chronicle called it \"insistent and sleek\" but hoped that Madonna would have found different lyrical references than Lauper's song.[34] Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media praised the Benassis' production, adding that it was worthy of \"competing with singers like Kesha, Britney Spears, and Katy Perry on pop radio\".[35] Senior from Sound on Sound was pleased with the synth sounds and the departure from the \"brightness\" of Confessions on a Dance Floor tracks, making it more \"palatale\".[17]"]}}}
