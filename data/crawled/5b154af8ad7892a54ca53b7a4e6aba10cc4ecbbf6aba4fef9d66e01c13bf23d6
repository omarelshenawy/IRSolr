This time, it included a hunky dancer watching from a distance as Madonna entered the stage with her hair stretched into a topknot and fake blond ponytail, which was replaced by short peroxide tangles in the European leg of the tour.[53] She wore a double breasted suit with the outer jacket cut in slits so that the conical bra underneath could point through. Showing off the satin pink bodysuit and her monocle chain, Madonna performed the song on a chair. Playing a dominatrix role, Madonna got on top of one of the dancers before carrying off an exhibitionist dance routine with the chair as a prop.[52] Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990,[56] and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.[57]"],"after":["The opening musical introduction of the song served as a brief twenty-six seconds musical interlude on the Drowned World Tour in 2001. As Madonna finished a performance of \"Frozen\" in the Geisha inspired segment of the show, she sat in a cross-legged position in front of the stage. The musical intro for \"Open Your Heart\" would start with a dancer in a Japanese costume dancing behind her on a raised podium.[58] As the music ends, Madonna starts singing \"Nobody's Perfect\" from her 2000 album Music. In 2008, Madonna sang the first verse and chorus at two dates—Las Vegas and East Rutherford—of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna forgot the lyrics at the Vegas show and refused to sing the song in Boston; she performed \"Express Yourself\" instead.[59]"]}}}
