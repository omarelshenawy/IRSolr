Harvey's note says that \"the wiser sort\" enjoy Hamlet, and implies that the Earl of Essex—executed in February 1601 for rebellion—was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the \"sense of time is so confused in Harvey's note that it is really of little use in trying to date Hamlet\". This is because the same note also refers to Spenser and Watson as if they were still alive (\"our flourishing metricians\"), but also mentions \"Owen's new epigrams\", published in 1607.[34]"],"after":["Three early editions of the text have survived, making attempts to establish a single \"authentic\" text problematic.[35] Each is different from the others:[36]"]}}}
