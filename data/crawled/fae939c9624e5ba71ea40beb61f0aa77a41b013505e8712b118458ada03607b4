She begins with \"Girl Gone Wild\" holding a rifle and \"breaks\" the glass, of a confessional box, she later performs \"Revolver\" with female dancers dancing with automatic rifles. During the third song, \"Gang Bang\" she performed in a motel setting where she is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrops.[12] In wake of the 2012 Aurora shooting, Madonna was urged to remove the use of firearms from the show. Authorities previously warned the singer about use of guns for the concert in Edinburgh, before the events in Colorado. However, the order was reinforced after the tragedy occurred. Madonna continued the show in Scotland as planned, with the use of the props. During the concert, she expressed her joy for first concert in the country, saying she could be onstage for three hours. She then joked, \"Due to your laws here they might pull the plug on me so if they cut us off suddenly, write to your local MP\".[13]"]}}}
