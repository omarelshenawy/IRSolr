These include shorter limb proportions, a wider, barrel-shaped rib cage, a reduced chin and, perhaps most notably, a large nose, which was much larger in both length and width, and started somewhat higher on the face, than in modern humans.[41] Evidence suggests they were much stronger than modern humans, with particularly strong arms and hands,[73][74] while they were comparable in height; based on 45 long bones from at most 14 males and 7 females, Neanderthal males averaged 164–168 cm (65–66 in) and females 152–156 cm (60–61 in) tall.[15] Samples of 26 specimens in 2010 found an average weight of 77.6 kg (171 lb) for males and 66.4 kg (146 lb) for females.[75] A 2007 genetic study suggested some Neanderthals may have had red hair and blond hair, along with a light skin tone.[76]"]}}}
