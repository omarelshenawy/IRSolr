Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes, the Arawaks and Carib (Kalinago) tribes occupied it at the time European settlers reached the island. \"Massacre\" is a name of a river dedicated to the murders of the Native villagers by French and British settlers, because the river ran red with blood for days. Both the French and British tried to claim the island and imported slaves from Africa for labor. The remaining Caribs now live on a 3,700-acre (15Â km2) territory on the east coast of the island. They elect their own chief. This mix of cultures has produced the current culture."]}}}
