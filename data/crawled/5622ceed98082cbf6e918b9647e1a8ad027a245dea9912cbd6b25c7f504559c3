Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album 'Hours...' featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his \"Cyber Song Contest\" Internet competition, Alex Grant.[117] Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica.[118] Sessions for the planned album Toy, intended to feature new versions of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album was never released. Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen.[119] Alexandria Zahra Jones, Bowie and Iman's daughter, was born on 15 August.[120]"]}}}
