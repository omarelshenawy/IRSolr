In 1854, a cholera epidemic killed over 20,000 inhabitants.[26] At emancipation in 1833, the size of the slave population was approximately 83,000. Between 1946 and 1980, Barbados' rate of population growth was diminished by one-third because of emigration to Britain.[27]"],"after":["Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy modelled on the British Westminster system. The Barbadian monarch—presently Queen Elizabeth II—is head of state and is represented locally by the Governor-General of Barbados—presently Elliott Belgrave. Both are advised on matters of the Barbadian state by the Prime Minister of Barbados, who is head of government. The number of representatives within the House of Assembly has gradually increased from 24 at independence to its present total of 30 seats."]}}}
