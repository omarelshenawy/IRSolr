William Eitel and Jack McCullogh formed the company in 1934. It specialized in the manufacture of power grid tubes.[32] Known as Eimac, the company also made vacuum tubes used in communication equipment, as well as other products for military and commercial applications.[33] Due to its work on broadcast transmission parts, Eimac operated an FM radio station, KSBR, which transmitted on 100.5 megahertz.[34] The station began operations in 1947 and, that same year, was one of only two in the nation to test Rangertone tape recorders. (The other station was WASH-FM in Washington, D.C.)[35] The recorders were based on the German Magnetophon.[36] In need of more space, the company moved to San Carlos in 1959.[37] Eimac's San Carlos plant was dedicated on April 16, 1959.[37] In 1965, Eimac merged with Varian Associates and became known as the Eimac Division. In 1995, Leonard Green & Partners purchased the entire Electron Devices Business from Varian and formed Communications & Power Industries.[38]"],"after":["Crestmoor High School opened in September 1962, but was closed in June 1980 due to a decline in school enrollment.
