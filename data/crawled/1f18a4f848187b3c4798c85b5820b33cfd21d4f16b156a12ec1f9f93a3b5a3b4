For example, 羊 can mean ram, sheep or Goat. Similarly, 鼠 (Rat) can also be translated as mouse, as there are no distinctive words for the two genera in Chinese. Further, 豬 (Pig) is sometimes translated to boar (猪) after its Japanese name, and 牛 plainly means cow or Ox, and not water buffalo, 水牛. 雞(Rooster) may mean chicken, hen or cock. However, Rooster is the most commonly used one among all the synonyms, same for 羊, 鼠, etc."],"after":[]}}}
