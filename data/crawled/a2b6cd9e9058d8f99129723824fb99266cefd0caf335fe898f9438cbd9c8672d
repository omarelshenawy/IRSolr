Humans are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.[65] Currently, through land development, combustion of fossil fuels, and pollution, humans are thought to be the main contributor to global climate change.[66] If this continues at its current rate it is predicted that climate change will wipe out half of all plant and animal species over the next century.[67][68]"],"after":["Most aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The human body consists of the legs, the torso, the arms, the neck, and the head. An adult human body consists of about 100 trillion (1014) cells. The most commonly defined body systems in humans are the nervous, the cardiovascular, the circulatory, the digestive, the endocrine, the immune, the integumentary, the lymphatic, the muscoskeletal, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary system.[69][70]"]}}}
