At some point prior to the sixteenth century within the general area that is today encompassed by modern Iran, /eː/ and /iː/ merged into /iː/, and /oː/ and /uː/ merged into /uː/. Thus, the older contrasts such as shēr \"lion\" vs. shīr \"milk\", and rūd \"river\" vs rōd \"bow-string\" were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words \"ē\" and \"ō\" are preserved or merged into the diphthongs [eɪ] and [oʊ] (which are descendants of the diphthongs [æɪ] and [æʊ] in Early New Persian), instead of merging into /iː/ and /uː/. Examples of this exception can be found in words such as [roʊʃæn] (bright)."]}}}
