On The Virgin Tour, Madonna performed the song wearing an entirely black costume, consisting of a crop top worn beneath a vest, fringed elbow length gloves, a fringed miniskirt, leggings, and low heel leather boots. She also wore a crucifix earring in one ear and a silver cross patt√©e was pinned to the right shoulder of her vest. Madonna sang the original version of the song, and pranced around the stage while showing her stomach.[38] The performance was included in the Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour VHS, released in 1985.[39] At the Who's That Girl World Tour, \"Lucky Star\" was performed as the second song of the set list. Madonna wore a black bustier like the music video to her single \"Open Your Heart\" (1987). Her hair was platinum blond and in a big bushy shape.[40] The performance of \"Lucky Star\" included a disco ball spinning above the stage, as Madonna and her dancers moved around it as the light from the ball flickered on them like a star.[40] Two different performances are found in Ciao Italia: Live from Italy tour video filmed at Stadio Communale in Turin, Italy on September 4, 1987[41] and the Who's That Girl: Live in Japan tour video filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan on June 22, 1987.[42]"]}}}
