Porphyry stated that this silence was \"of no ordinary kind\". Candidates had to pass through a period of probation, in which their powers of maintaining silence (echemythia) were especially tested, as well as their general temper, disposition, and mental capacity.[65] There were also gradations among the members themselves. It was an old Pythagorean maxim, that every thing was not to be told to every body.[66] Thus the Pythagoreans were divided into an inner circle called the mathematikoi (\"learners\") and an outer circle called the akousmatikoi (\"listeners\").[67] Iamblichus describes them in terms of esoterikoi and exoterikoi (or alternatively Pythagoreioi and Pythagoristai),[68] according to the degree of intimacy which they enjoyed with Pythagoras. Porphyry wrote \"the mathematikoi learned the more detailed and exactly elaborated version of this knowledge, the akousmatikoi (were) those who had heard only the summary headings of his (Pythagoras's) writings, without the more exact exposition\"."],"after":["There were ascetic practices (many of which had, perhaps, a symbolic meaning) in the way of life of the sect.[69] Some represent Pythagoras as forbidding all animal food, advocating a plant-based diet, and prohibiting consumption of beans. This may have been due to the doctrine of metempsychosis.[70] Other authorities contradict the statement. According to Aristoxenus,[71] he allowed the use of all kinds of animal food except the flesh of oxen used for ploughing, and rams.[72] There is a similar discrepancy as to the prohibition of fish and beans.[73] But temperance of all kinds seems to have been urged. It is also stated that they had common meals, resembling the Spartan system, at which they met in companies of ten.[74]"]}}}
