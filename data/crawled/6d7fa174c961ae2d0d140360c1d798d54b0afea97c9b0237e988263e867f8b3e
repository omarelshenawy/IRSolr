Earth controllers for some Mars missions have synchronized their sleep/wake cycles with the Martian day,[27] because solar-powered rover activity on the surface was tied to periods of light and dark. The difference in day length caused the sleep/wake cycles to slowly drift with respect to the day/night cycles on Earth, repeating approximately once every 36 days."],"after":[]}}}
