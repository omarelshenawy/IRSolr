Virginia was given the title \"Dominion\" by King Charles II of England at the time of The Restoration, because it had remained loyal to the crown during the English Civil War, and the present moniker, \"Old Dominion\" is a reference to that title. Charles' supporters were called Cavaliers, and \"The Cavalier State\" nickname was popularized after the American Civil War to romanticize the antebellum period. Sports teams from the University of Virginia are called the Cavaliers.[308] The other nickname, \"Mother of Presidents\", is also historic, as eight Virginians have served as President of the United States, including four of the first five.[1]"]}}}
