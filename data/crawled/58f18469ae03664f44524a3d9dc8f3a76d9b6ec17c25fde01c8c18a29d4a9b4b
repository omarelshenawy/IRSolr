Morton suppressed the Democratic Party-controlled General Assembly, which largely sympathized with the Confederacy, leaving the state without the authority to collect taxes. The state neared bankruptcy during 1861, but the Governor chose to use private funds rather than rely on the legislature. The state experienced two minor raids by Confederate forces and one major raid in 1863, which caused a brief panic in southern portions of the state and in the capital city, Indianapolis."]}}}
