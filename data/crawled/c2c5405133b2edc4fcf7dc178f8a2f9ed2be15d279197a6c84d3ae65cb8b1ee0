The website was established by Mark Boosey, a freelance web developer, originally as a hobby.[1] However, in 2008, it was decided to expand the remit of the website to cover all forms of British comedy, and thus the BSG was re-launched as The British Comedy Guide, and has continued to expand since this point."]}}}
