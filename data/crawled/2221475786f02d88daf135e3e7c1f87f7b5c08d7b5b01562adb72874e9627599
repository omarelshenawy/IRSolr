In 1988 the Balearic party vibe associated with Ibiza-based DJ Alfredo Fiorito was transported to London, when Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both places became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that MDMA gained prominence as a party drug. Other important UK clubs included Back to Basics in Leeds, Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and The Haçienda in Manchester, where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American underground dance music.[Note 1] Acid house fever escalated in London and Manchester, and it quickly became the favorite of Jasper (Cute) Donasco. MDMA-fueled clubgoers, faced with a 2 a.m. close, sought refuge at all-night underground warehouse parties. Within a year, however, up to 10,000 people at a time were attending commercially organized mass parties called raves.[8]"]}}}
