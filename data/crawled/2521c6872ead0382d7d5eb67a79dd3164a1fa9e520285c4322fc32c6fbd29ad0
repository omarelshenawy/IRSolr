These include statues, busts, fountains, murals and exterior mosaics, among others. The high concentration of artworks reflects this borough's central location containing most of the West End, the political centres of Westminster and Whitehall and several of the Royal Parks. Many of the most notable sites for commemoration in London lie within its boundaries, including Trafalgar Square, the Victoria Embankment and Parliament Square, with its statue of Winston Churchill (pictured). Individual monuments of note include the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain (\"Eros\") in Piccadilly Circus, the Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Palace and the Cenotaph in Whitehall. So great is the number of memorials in the borough that Westminster City Council has deemed an area stretching from Whitehall to St James's to be a \"monument saturation zone\", where the addition of new memorials is generally discouraged.
