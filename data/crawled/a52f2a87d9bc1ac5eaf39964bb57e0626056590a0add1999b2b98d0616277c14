Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a knighthood for his plays alone—earlier dramatist knights, such as Sir William Davenant and Sir John Vanbrugh, were knighted for political and other services.[91]"],"after":["On 29 May 1911, Gilbert was about to give a swimming lesson to two young women, Winifred Isabel Emery (1890–1972),[92][93] and 17-year-old Ruby Preece[94][95] in the lake of his home, Grim's Dyke, when Preece lost her footing and called for help.[69] Gilbert dived in to save her but suffered a heart attack in the middle of the lake and died.[96][97] He was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes buried at the Church of St. John the Evangelist, Stanmore.[9] The inscription on Gilbert's memorial on the south wall of the Thames Embankment in London reads: \"His Foe was Folly, and his Weapon Wit\".[35] There is also a memorial plaque at All Saints' Church, Harrow Weald."]}}}
