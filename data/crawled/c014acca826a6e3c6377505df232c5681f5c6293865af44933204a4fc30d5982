It was performed at the last \"disco fever\" segment of the tour.[81] During the performance, her dancers displayed the Parkour routine all over the stadium as the familiar ABBA sample played. Madonna changed her aerobics costume for a purple leotard.[82] As the music progressed, she and her dancers appeared on the center stage and she started singing. During the second verse, she left her sunglasses and jacket and proceeded towards the front of the stage.[83] A boombox appeared in the center with Madonna playing with it. The song starts again as balloons fall on the crowd from the top.[83] The finale had Madonna engaging the audience to sing-along with her to the song while making a contest as to which side of the stadium can sing the loudest.[24][83] Madonna then uttering the line \"I'm tired of waiting for you\" while the backdrop showed the phrase \"Have You Confessed?\".[83] The New York Times‍ '​ Ginia Belafonte compared this performance with that of Ethel Merman.[82] Slant Magazine commented that the performance reminded Madonna's ability to encapsulate the audience as a part of her performance.[24]"],"after":["The song was also added to the six song set list of the Hard Candy Promo Tour in 2008. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots.[84] \"Hung Up\" was the fourth song of the set list. It was re-invented as a heavy-metal version.[85] As the performance of \"4 Minutes\" ended, Madonna picked up an electric guitar and played the first few chords of The Rolling Stones single \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". She then asked the crowd whether they thought they had come to a Rolling Stones concert. When the crowd responded negatively, she started \"Hung Up\", while dedicating it to all the people who had waited outside in the queue to watch the show. She declared that the noisy, metallic guitar breakdown of the song symbolised what waiting sounded like in the brain of all those who had waited.[84] The song was performed in the futuristic rave with Japanese influences segment of the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour.[86] Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by Heatherette, with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair.[87] The similar heavy-metal version of \"Hung Up\" was performed but it later gave way to the ABBA music.[88] Before starting the performance, she played a capella versions of her older hit songs on audience demand, mostly \"Express Yourself\" and \"Like a Virgin\". However after that, the electric guitar was played to make noises, which Madonna dedicated to Republican vice-presidential nominee for the 2008 election, Sarah Palin. She said, \"I'd like to express myself to Sarah Palin right now. [Playing a screeching note on her guitar] This is the sound of Sarah Palin thinking. [...] Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal.\"[89] For the second European leg of the tour in 2009, \"Hung Up\" was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of \"Frozen\". This version included lyrical interpolations from \"Open Your Heart\", and was set between the performances of \"Like a Prayer\" and \"Ray of Light\".[90]"]}}}
