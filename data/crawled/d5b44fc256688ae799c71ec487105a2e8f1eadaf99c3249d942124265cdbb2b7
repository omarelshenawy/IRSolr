As a noun, Russell Sturgis distinguished between architecture as being artistic structure, where a building is unadorned and can be \"poor... commonplace, ugly, insufficient, or otherwise of small importance; \"[1] and the use of the word construction as meaning built using scientific principles in a highly skillful way.

The Oxford English Dictionary includes that structure may be used for a large or imposing building."],"after":["In general, there are nine types of construction:[citation needed]"]}}}
