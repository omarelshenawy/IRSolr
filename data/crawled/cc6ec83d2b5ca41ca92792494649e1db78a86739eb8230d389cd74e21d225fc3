In The idea of human rights it says: \"if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights\". Despite this, the strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable skepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. Indeed, the question of what is meant by a \"right\" is itself controversial and the subject of continued philosophical debate."]}}}
