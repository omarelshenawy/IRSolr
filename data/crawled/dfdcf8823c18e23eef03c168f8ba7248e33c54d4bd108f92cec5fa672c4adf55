It is often called the Garden of Mughals because of the heritage of the Mughal Empire. It is located near the Ravi River, close to the Pakistan-India border. Mughal structures such as the Badshahi Mosque, Ali Hujwiri, Lahore Fort, Shalimar Gardens and the mausoleums of Jehangir, and Nur Jehan are popular tourist spots in the city. Colonial British structures such as the Lahore High Court, General Post Office (GPO) and many of the older universities still retain their Mughal-Gothic style. Punjabi and Urdu are the native languages of the province and are the most widely spoken languages in Lahore and rural areas. Urdu and English, however, are becoming more popular with younger generations since they are officially supported, whereas Punjabi has no official patronage. Many people of Lahore who speak Punjabi are known as Lahori Punjabi due to their use of a mixture of Punjabi and colloquial Urdu. According to the 1998 census, Lahore's population was nearly 7 million. Mid-2006 government estimates now put the population at approximately 10 million.This makes Lahore the second largest city in Pakistan, fifth largest city in South Asia and the 26th largest city in the world."]}}}
