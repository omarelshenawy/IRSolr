His goal was to persuade Henry to modify his demands against the French. Henry lavishly entertained the emperor and even had him enrolled in the Order of the Garter. Sigismund, in turn, inducted Henry into the Order of the Dragon.[15] Henry had intended to crusade for the order after uniting the English and French thrones, but he died before fulfilling his plans.[16][17][18] Sigismund left England several months later, having signed the Treaty of Canterbury, acknowledging English claims to France."],"after":["Henry may have regarded the assertion of his own claims as part of his royal duty, but in any case, a permanent settlement of the national debate was essential to the success of his foreign policy."]}}}
