The system went live in May 2008. Certain users[who?] are now able to mark article versions as \"reviewed\", indicating that the text contains no obvious vandalism. A note in the top right corner of the screen indicates to the reader whether or not the present version of an article has already been reviewed, and provides access to the most recent reviewed version or a more current, unreviewed version as needed."],"after":["The first real-life meetup of Wikipedians took place in October 2003 in Munich. As a result of this meeting regularly striking round tables (called “Wikipedia-Stammtisch”) established themselves at various places in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The round tables have become an important aspect of collegial exchange within the German-speaking community.[24]"]}}}
