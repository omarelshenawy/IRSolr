A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (1837),[68] [69] whose proof introduced L-functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.[70] The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually goes back to Euler (1730s),[71] [72] who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of complex analysis in number theory comes later: the work of Bernhard Riemann (1859) on the zeta function is the canonical starting point;[73] Jacobi's four-square theorem (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory (modular forms).[74]"]}}}
