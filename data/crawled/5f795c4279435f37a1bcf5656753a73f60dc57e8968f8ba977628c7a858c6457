Charging a guinea at a time (about Â£100 in today's money,[44]) they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland. From such eighteenth-century activities grew Scottish Standard English.[45] Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working class Scots.[46]"],"after":["In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the use of Scots as a literary language was revived by several prominent Scotsmen such as Robert Burns.
