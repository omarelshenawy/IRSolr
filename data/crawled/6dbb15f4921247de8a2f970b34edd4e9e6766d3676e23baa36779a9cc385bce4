Rob Walker of Slate considered the video \"interesting because Madonna has always been praised as much for her ability to market herself as for her actual talent as a singer and performer\". However, he noted that \"[the singer] can't even get an actual commercial right. Maybe Madonna really is over.\"[25] A parody of the commercial which satirized at Madonna's age was featured on the ninth season of MADtv.[26]"]}}}
