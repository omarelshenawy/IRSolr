Trees consist of nodes linked by edges in such a way that there are no cycles. There is generally a node called the root, which has no parent node. In Plane trees each node can have an arbitrary number of children. In binary trees, a special case of plane trees, each node can have either two or no children. Let denote the family of all plane trees. Then this family can be recursively defined as follows:"],"after":["In this case represents the family of objects consisting of one node. This has generating function x. Let P(x) denote the generating function Putting the above description in words: A plane tree consists of a node to which is attached an arbitrary number of subtrees, each of which is also a plane tree. Using the operation on families of combinatorial structures developed earlier this translates to a recursive generating function:"]}}}
