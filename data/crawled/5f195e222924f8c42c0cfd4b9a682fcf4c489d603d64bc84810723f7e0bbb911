Ponies!!!\" Editors joked that this was done to increase female readership.[24] In another supposed April Fools' Day joke, User Achievement tags were introduced on April 1, 2009.[25] This system allowed users to be tagged with various achievements, such as \"The Tagger\" for tagging a story or \"Member of the {1,2,3,4,5} Digit UID Club\" for having a Slashdot UID consisting of a certain number of digits. While it was posted on April Fools' Day to allow for certain joke achievements, the system is real.[26]"]}}}
