The process was gradual and lacked any clear definition, and the use of exonyms designating \"the Germans\" develops only during the High Middle Ages. The title of rex teutonicum \"King of the Germans\" is first used in the late 11th century, by the chancery of Pope Gregory VII, to describe the future Holy Roman Emperor of the German Nation Henry IV.[78] Natively, the term ein diutscher (\"a German\") is used for the people of Germany from the 12th century."]}}}
