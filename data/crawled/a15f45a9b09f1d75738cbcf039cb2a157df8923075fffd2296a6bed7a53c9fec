One example is the Royal Greenwich Observatory, which is also the source of the Prime Meridian (longitude 0Â° 0' 0\"), and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude (made by John Harrison). Other horological museums in the London area include the Clockmakers' Museum, which will re-open at the Science Museum in October 2015, and the horological collections at the British Museum, the Science Museum (London) and at the Wallace Collection."]}}}
