Time-like or space-like separations correspond to oppositely oriented rectangles, one type considered to have rectangles of negative area. The case of two events separated by light corresponds to the rectangle degenerating to the segment between the events and zero area.[19] The transformations leaving interval-length invariant are the area-preserving squeeze mappings."],"after":[]}}}
