The findings show that the blond hair trait is due to an amino acid change of protein TYRP1.[38] This, therefore, accounts for the highest occurrence of blond hair outside of European influence in the world.[39] While 10% of Solomon Island's people display the gene variation, about 26% of the population carry it as well.[40]"],"after":["Education in Solomon Islands is not compulsory and only 60 percent of school-age children have access to primary education.[41][42]","From 1990 to 1994, the gross primary school enrolment rose from 84.5 percent to 96.6 percent.[41] Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Solomon Islands as of 2001.[41] While enrolment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect children's participation in school.[41]"]}}}
