I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'\"[4]"],"after":["The author explained to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for including in the book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: \"The reason that line made the book is because he told me not to say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to keep my mouth shut. Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal.\"[4]"]}}}
