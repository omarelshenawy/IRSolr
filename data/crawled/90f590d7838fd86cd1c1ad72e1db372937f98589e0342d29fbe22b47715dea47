It is named after the Kansas River which flows through it, which in turn was named after the Kansa tribe, who inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean \"people of the wind\" or \"people of the south wind\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning."]}}}
