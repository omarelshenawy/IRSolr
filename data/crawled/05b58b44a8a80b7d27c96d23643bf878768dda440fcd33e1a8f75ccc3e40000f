It is an international film festival designed to capitalise on Greater Manchester's \"huge strengths in film and television, along with its growing media presence\".[249] MediaCityUK, a host venue of the Greater Manchester Film Festival,[250] is a 200-acre (81Â ha) mixed-use property development site at Salford Quays; its principal tenants are mass media organisations such as ITV Granada and the BBC. One of Greater Manchester's most lucrative and acclaimed television exports is Coronation Street, which is a televised soap opera set in Weatherfield, a fictional borough of Greater Manchester,[251][252] inspired by life in Salford.[253] Created by Tony Warren, Coronation Street was first broadcast on 9 December 1960, making it the world's longest-running TV soap opera in production.[254] It has been filmed in Manchester at Granada Studios since its inception, but filming is now done at a new set at MediaCityUK. Launched in 2004 by the Guardian Media Group, Channel M is a television station that broadcast local news and content about Greater Manchester.[255] It effectively closed in 2010.[256] In January 2011 Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt stated that a new Greater Manchester channel will be available on Freeview by around 2013.[257]"]}}}
