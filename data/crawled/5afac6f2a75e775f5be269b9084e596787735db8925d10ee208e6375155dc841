The unemployment rate is estimated to be 90 percent, and of those who have jobs, the government employs 95 percent.[1][74] The Asian Development Bank notes that although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance.[73] Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.[75]"],"after":["In the 1990s, Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee.[76] The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) identified Nauru as one of 15 \"non-cooperative\" countries in its fight against money laundering. During the 1990s, it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only $25,000 with no other requirements. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, after which foreign hot money left the country. In October 2005, after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement, FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation.[77]"]}}}
