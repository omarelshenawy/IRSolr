The Bulletin magazine first publicly raised allegations of plagiarism in June 2000. Libeskind was reported to be angry with the copying. Raggatt's defence against plagiarism was that the design was a quotation rather than a copy.[10] The director of the museum, Dawn Casey, claimed in the press that she and her council were not aware of this symbolism when they approved the plan.[11]"]}}}
