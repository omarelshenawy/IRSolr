These were quoted and expanded upon by Terence and Dennis McKenna in The Invisible Landscape (1975). The significance of a future \"galactic alignment\" was noted in 1991 by astrologer Raymond Mardyks, who asserted that the winter solstice would align with the galactic plane in 1998/1999. He wrote that this event \"only occurs once each 26,000-year cycle and would be most definitely of utmost significance to the top flight ancient astrologers\".[79] Astrologer Bruce Scofield notes, \"The Milky Way crossing of the winter solstice is something that has been neglected by Western astrologers, with a few exceptions. Charles Jayne made a very early reference to it, and in the 1970s Rob Hand mentioned it in his talks on precession but didn't elaborate on it. Ray Mardyks later made a point of it, and after that John [Major] Jenkins, myself, and Daniel Giamario began to talk about it.\"[80]"]}}}
