Western democratic and individualistic culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[45] The Greeks invented the polis, or city-state, which played a fundamental role in their concept of identity.[46] These Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[45] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[47][48][49]"]}}}
