Garran spent thirty-one years as permanent head of the Attorney-General's Department, giving advice to ten different Prime Ministers (from Barton to Lyons). He played a significant behind-the-scenes role in the Australian federation movement, as adviser to Edmund Barton and chair of the Drafting Committee at the 1897-1898 Constitutional Convention. Garran was also an important figure in the development of the city of Canberra during its early years. He founded several important cultural associations, organised the creation of the Canberra University College, and later contributed to the establishment of the Australian National University. Garran published several books throughout his lifetime, covering such topics as constitutional law, the history of federalism in Australia, and German language poetry."]}}}
