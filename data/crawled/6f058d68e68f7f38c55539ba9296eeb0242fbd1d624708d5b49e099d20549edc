In 95% of the cases μ will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured masses in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:"],"after":["In other words, the 95% confidence interval is between the lower endpoint 249.22 g and the upper endpoint 251.18 g.","As the desired value 250 of μ is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated."]}}}
