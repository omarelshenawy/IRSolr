Many other editions shared the quasi-exponential growth of the English edition, though lagging one to three years behind. As these other Wikipedias have grown, the overall percentage of articles in English has been steadily decreasing, and it fell below 25% in March 2007. The percentage of articles in the ten largest Wikipedias has also been decreasing, although these top ten still account for about 67% of all Wikipedia articles as of June 2007."],"after":[]}}}
