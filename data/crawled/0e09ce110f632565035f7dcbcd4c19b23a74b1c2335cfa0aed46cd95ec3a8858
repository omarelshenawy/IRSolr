His paintings are characterized by skilled use of ink washes and an economy of brush stroke. He especially mastered the \"broken ink\" school of landscapes, applying it to other subjects, such as his Kobokumeikakuzu (\"Shrike Perched on a Withered Branch\"; part of a triptych whose other two members were \"Hotei Walking\" and \"Sparrow on Bamboo\"), his Hotei Watching a Cockfight, and his Rozanzu (\"Wild Geese Among Reeds\")."]}}}
