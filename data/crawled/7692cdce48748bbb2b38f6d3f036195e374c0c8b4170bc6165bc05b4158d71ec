George McCrae's \"Rock Your Baby\" became the United Kingdom's first number one disco single.[35][36]"],"after":["Also in 1974, Gloria Gaynor released the first side-long disco mix vinyl album, which included a remake of The Jackson 5's \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" and two other songs, \"Honey Bee\" and \"Reach Out (I'll Be There)\". Formed by Harry Wayne Casey (\"KC\") and Richard Finch, Miami's KC and the Sunshine Band had a string of disco-definitive top-five hits between 1975 and 1977, including \"Get Down Tonight\", \"That's the Way (I Like It)\", \"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty\", \"I'm Your Boogie Man\" and \"Keep It Comin' Love\". Electric Light Orchestra's 1975 hit Evil Woman, although described as Orchestral Rock, featured a violin sound that became a staple of disco. In 1979, however, ELO did release two \"true\" disco songs: \"Last Train To London\" and \"Shine A Little Love\"."]}}}
