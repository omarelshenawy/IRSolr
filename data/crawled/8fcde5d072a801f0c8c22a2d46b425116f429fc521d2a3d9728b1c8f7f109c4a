Measures were taken to improve Australia's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941, but these proved inadequate. In December 1941 the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division, most of which was stationed in Malaya, and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia, including the 1st Armoured Division. The RAAF was equipped with 373Â aircraft, most of which were obsolete trainers, and the RAN had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters.[71]"]}}}
