The first Time magazine with a red X cover was released on May 7, 1945, showing a red X over Adolf Hitler's face. Fifty-eight years later, on April 21, 2003, Time released its second red X cover issue with a red X over Saddam Hussein's face, two weeks after the Iraqi dictator's overthrow. The third red X cover Time magazine was released June 13, 2006 following the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq. The fourth red X cover Time magazine was released May 2011 after the death of Osama bin Laden.[29]"]}}}
