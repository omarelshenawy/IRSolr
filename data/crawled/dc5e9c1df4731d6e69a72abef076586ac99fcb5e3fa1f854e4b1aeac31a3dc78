The South expanded into rich new lands in the Southwest (from Alabama to Texas).[51] The primary export for the South was cotton; a crop that had expanded growth, demand, and was essential for the industrial revolution in Europe and the USA. Most came from the South. By 1860 the cotton trade held 57% of the value of all American exports worth $191,000,000 turning the South into a cotton empire. [52]"]}}}
