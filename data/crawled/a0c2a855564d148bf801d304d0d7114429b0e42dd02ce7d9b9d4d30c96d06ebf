This was a record for most number one Hot 100 singles from any one album, including Thriller.[112] Although the title track's video was arguably derivative of the video for the earlier single \"Beat It\", the \"Bad\" video still proved to be one of Jackson's iconic moments. It was a gritty but colorful epic set against the backdrop of the New York City Subway system, with costuming and choreography inspired by West Side Story. As of 2012, the album sold between 30 to 45 million copies worldwide.[113][114][115][116][117][118] Thanks to the Bad album, Bruce Swedien, and Humberto Gatica won one Grammy in 1988 for Best Engineered Recording â€“ Non Classical and Michael Jackson won one Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form for \"Leave Me Alone\" in 1989.[52][60] In the same year, Jackson won an Award of Achievement at the American Music Awards because Bad is the first album ever to generate five number one singles in the U.S., the first album to top in 25 countries and the best-selling album worldwide in 1987 and in 1988.[119][120][121][122] In 1988, \"Bad\" won an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Single.[123]"]}}}
