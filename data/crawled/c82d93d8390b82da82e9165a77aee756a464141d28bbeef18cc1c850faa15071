As of 2004, however, access to some material in British, Polish and ex-Soviet archives was still restricted.[186] Further complicating the matter is the British claim that the records of the Polish government-in-exile were destroyed,[187] and material not transferred to British authorities after the war was burnt by the Poles in London in July 1945.[188][189]"],"after":["In Poland, 1 August is now a celebrated anniversary. On 1 August 1994, Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising to which both the German and Russian presidents were invited.[9] Though the German President Roman Herzog attended, the Russian President Boris Yeltsin declined the invitation; other notable guests included the U.S. Vice President Al Gore.[9][190] Herzog, on behalf of Germany, was the first German statesman to apologize for German atrocities committed against the Polish nation during the Uprising.[190] During the 60th anniversary of the Uprising in 2004, official delegations included: German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, UK deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and US Secretary of State Colin Powell; Pope John Paul II sent a letter to the mayor of Warsaw, Lech Kaczyński on this occasion.[191] Russia once again did not send a representative.[191] A day before, 31 July 2004, the Warsaw Uprising Museum opened in Warsaw.[191]"]}}}
