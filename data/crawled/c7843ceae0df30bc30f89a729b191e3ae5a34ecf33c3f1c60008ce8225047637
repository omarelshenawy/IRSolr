A much smaller orb in its centre serves as an electrode. Beams or snakes of \"light\" (actually emergent patterns in ionized gas) extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass container, giving an appearance similar to multiple constant beams of coloured lightning. The beams first follow the electric field lines of the dipole, but move up due to convection."]}}}
