The early architecture of Tel Aviv consisted largely of European-style single-story houses with red-tiled roofs.[127] Neve Tzedek, the first neighborhood to be constructed outside of Jaffa is characterised by two-story sandstone buildings.[7] By the 1920s, a new eclectic Orientalist style came into vogue, combining European architecture with Eastern features such as arches, domes and ornamental tiles.[127] Municipal construction followed the \"garden city\" master plan drawn up by Patrick Geddes. Two- and three-story buildings were interspersed with boulevards and public parks.[127] Various architectural styles, such as Art Deco, classical and modernist also exist in Tel Aviv."]}}}
