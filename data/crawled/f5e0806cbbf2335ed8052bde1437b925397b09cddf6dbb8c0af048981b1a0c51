Simpson's character had around 80Â costume changes with dresses by designers like Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Madeleine Vionnet and Elsa Schiaparelli. Most of the actual dresses were kept in museum archives, hence unobtainable to Madonna. Instead, many of the couture houses offered to create the dresses for her.[4] While casting for the film, she asked for a Michael O'Connor wedding dress, in display at the National Museum of Costume in Scotland, for a scene where Riseborough would wear it.[10] National Museum of Costume general manager Margaret Roberts said they were happy to send the dress to Madonna. \"Our Marriage in the Movies exhibition is packed with fabulous gowns that tell a story not only about the history of the period they represent, but also of Hollywood glamour and style,\" she said. [...] This is a dress that was made for the movies, so when we received the request from Madonna's production company, we were only too happy to oblige.\"[10] Other fashion designers working for the film included John Galliano and Issa, who provided clothes, Pierre Cartier the jewels, and Stephen Jones the hats.[7]"]}}}
