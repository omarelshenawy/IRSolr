A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band. Her musical interests were now diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era, toward less structured, more jazz-inspired pieces, with a wider range of instruments. The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as The Hissing of Summer Lawns. On \"The Jungle Line\", she made an early effort at sampling a recording of African musicians, something that became more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s. \"In France They Kiss on Main Street\" continued the lush pop sounds of Court and Spark, and efforts such as the title song and \"Edith and the Kingpin\" chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California."]}}}
