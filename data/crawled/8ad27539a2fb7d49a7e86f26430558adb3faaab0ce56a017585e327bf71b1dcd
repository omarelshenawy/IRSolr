Some historians view him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw; James M. McPherson, one of America's most prominent experts on the Civil War today, calls him and Anderson \"pathological killers\" who \"murdered and burned out Missouri Unionists.\"[16] Some of Quantrill's celebrity later rubbed off on other ex-Raiders â€“ John Jarrett, George and Oliver Shepard, Jesse and Frank James, and Cole Younger who went on after the war to apply Quantrill's hit-and-run tactics to bank and train robbery.[17]"]}}}
