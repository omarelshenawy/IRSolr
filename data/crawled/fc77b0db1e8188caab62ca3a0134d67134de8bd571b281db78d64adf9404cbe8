His achievements include improvements to the telescope, a variety of astronomical observations, the first and second laws of motion, and effective support for Copernicanism. According to Stephen Hawking, Galileo has contributed more to the creation of the modern natural sciences than anybody else. He is the \"father of modern astronomy,\" the \"father of modern physics,\" and the \"father of science.\" The work of Galilei is considered to be a significant break from that of Aristotle."]}}}
