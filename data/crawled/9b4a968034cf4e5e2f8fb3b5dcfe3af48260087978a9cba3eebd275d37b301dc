Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them.[457] Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of ability to read.[458] Although the Romans were not a \"People of the Book\", they had an extensive priestly archive, and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with statues and small votives dedicated by ordinary people to divinities, as well as on binding tablets and other \"magic spells\", with hundreds of examples collected in the Greek Magical Papyri.[459] The military produced a vast amount of written reports and service records,[460] and literacy in the army was \"strikingly high\".[461] Urban graffiti, which include literary quotations, and low-quality inscriptions with misspellings and solecisms indicate casual literacy among non-elites.[462] In addition, numeracy was necessary for any form of commerce.[463] Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers, and some were highly educated.[464]"]}}}
