Also spelled Siem, Syâm, or Syâma, it has been identified with the Sanskrit Śyāma (श्याम, meaning \"dark\" or \"brown\"). The names Shan and A-hom seem to be variants of the same word, and Śyâma is possibly not its origin, but a learned and artificial distortion.[21]"],"after":["The signature of King Mongkut (r. 1851 – 1868) reads SPPM (Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha) Mongkut King of Siam, giving it official status until 23 June 1939 when it was changed to Thailand.[22] Thailand was renamed Siam from 1945 to 11 May 1949, after which it again reverted to Thailand."]}}}
