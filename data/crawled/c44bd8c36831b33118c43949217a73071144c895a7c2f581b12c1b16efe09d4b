Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain.[135] The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree.
