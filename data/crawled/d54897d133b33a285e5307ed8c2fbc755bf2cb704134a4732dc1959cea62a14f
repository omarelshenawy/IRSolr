There were also regional variations in many parts of the country with flourishing scenes particularly in California and Texas.[75] The Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon had perhaps the most defined regional sound.[76]"],"after":["The style had been evolving from regional scenes as early as 1958. \"Tall Cool One\" (1959) by The Wailers and \"Louie Louie\" by the Kingsmen (1963) are mainstream examples of the genre in its formative stages.[77] By 1963, garage band singles were creeping into the national charts in greater numbers, including Paul Revere and the Raiders (Boise),[78] the Trashmen (Minneapolis)[79] and the Rivieras (South Bend, Indiana).[80] Other influential garage bands, such as the Sonics (Tacoma, Washington), never reached the Billboard Hot 100.[81] In this early period many bands were heavily influenced by surf rock and there was a cross-pollination between garage rock and frat rock, sometimes viewed as merely a subgenre of garage rock.[82]"]}}}
