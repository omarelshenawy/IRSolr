Gwyneth Paltrow's character in 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired on the singer's public meltdown. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[236] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears as a major influence on her career, and commented, \"the fact that she came back out with just so much fire inspires me, and it inspires young women and people all over the world. It just inspires you. A lot of my fans feel like they are the underdog and feel like they are the people who aren't ever accepted for themselves, or who are laughed at or poked fun at forever. It just goes to show that once you keep at whatever it is you're doing, people may not like you, people may not love you, but they will have to respect you at the end of the day. And that respect is all that matters.\"[237] Lana Del Rey revealed that she is compelled by Spears in an interview with MTV, saying, \"I'm not really interested in a ton of female musicians but there is something about Britney that compelled me – the way she sings and just the way she looks.\"[238] Del Rey also said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[239] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[240] Miley Cyrus credits Spears as her biggest inspiration, and has referenced the singer in her hit song \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (2009).[241][242] Spears's personal breakdown was also cited as an inspiration for Barry Manilow's album \"15 Minutes\".[243]"],"after":["Spears has also become a major influence among many new artists, including Demi Lovato,[244] Katy Perry,[244] Kelly Key,[245] Kristinia DeBarge,[246] Little Boots,[247] Marina and the Diamonds,[248] Pixie Lott,[249] Girls' Generation, Selena Gomez,[250] Tinashe and The Saturdays.[251] Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that she was happy with Spears's return to the music industry, and continued, \"It's amazing. For this many years being in the business, and everything she's been through, it's wonderful to see her make this huge of a comeback. Really, it's a beautiful thing.\"[252] Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about – not just pop stars – but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[253] Jessica Jung and Hyoyeon of the Korean girl group Girls' Generation have also been compared to Spears, due to their blonde hair and the latter's abilities as a dancer.[254] Marina and the Diamonds named Spears as the main influence for her Electra Heart album, stating that, \"I think people thought I was joking about that for a long time. But when I was a teenager there was a genuine connection with this sweet girl who also had this very sexual side that people didn't really want to accept [...] Britney is really smart. And in the way that she inspired Electra Heart, if you step back from all the cynical stuff, it actually focuses on the idea of innocence being mixed with darkness. For some reason I really like that combination. I suppose because you don't really connect innocence with darkness.\"[255] Diamandis has also stated that Spears is her main influence when it comes to popular culture and that Spears is one she aspired to being growing up.[256]"]}}}
