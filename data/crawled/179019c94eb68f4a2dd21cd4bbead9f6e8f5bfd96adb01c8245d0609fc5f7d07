The ships of the green fleet have no velocity relative to each other, so for the clocks on board the individual ships the same amount of time elapses relative to each other, and they can set up a procedure to maintain a synchronized standard fleet time. The ships of the \"red fleet\" are moving with a velocity of 0.866c with respect to the green fleet."]}}}
