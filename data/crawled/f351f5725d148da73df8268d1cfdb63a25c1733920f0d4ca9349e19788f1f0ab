As the song progresses, Madonna walks down a street, while images of people along the street are shown.[48] At the climax of the video, Madonna reaches her home to her love interest (played by model Jason Olive) and his young son.[50] According to the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds, the young son that is revealed at the end of the video is her lover's secret.[51] Throughout the video, scenes of Madonna are interspersed with scenes of drag queens primping, and religious iconography such as rebirth and damnation.[48] In his book From Hegel to Madonna, author Robert Miklitsch states that the music video for \"Secret\" is a departure from the various themes - repression and loss, anger and aggression - explored so vividly on Bedtime Stories.[52] Miklitsch goes on to say that, although the video depicts images of cleansing rebirth, the fact that Madonna announced that she was pregnant in 1996 shows that, in retrospect, \"Secret\" may have been less about cleansing rebirth, and instead more about maternity as birth.[52] Bill Lamb of About.com ranked the video at number eight on his list of \"Top 10 Madonna Music Videos.\"[48]"]}}}
