I've been an editor on the English Wikipedia since 2003 and logged in since 2007. My edits reflect habits from university, when I studied history and edited an international affairs magazine: I'm zealous about sources and strive for consistent, precise prose. I live with my wife and daughters in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I am an inconsistent guitar student."]}}}
