The shoot took place in many outdoor locations throughout Tokyo, as well as a sound stage. Madonna and hair stylist Andy LeCompte decided to take her look to a whole new level and try using a platinum blonde bob wig for the video. The wig was worn by Madonna in the last two nights of the Confessions Tour.[29] The bob look was complimented. Critics called it \"her sleekest, jauntiest reinvention to date.\"[30] Along with the bob look, Madonna wore a black leather garment, which Entertainment Weekly commented that it accentuated her \"toned body\".[31] The video featured the physical discipline parkour, where artist Sebastian Foucan performed the routines around the buildings of Tokyo.[32]"]}}}
