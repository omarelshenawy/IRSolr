Sydney's layout today reflects this lack of planning.[75] The geographical area covered by urban Sydney is divided into 658 suburbs for addressing and postal purposes and is administered as 40 local government areas.[76] The City of Sydney is responsible for 33 of these suburbs, all of which are located close to the central business district.[77] The remaining locations are serviced by the Government of New South Wales."]}}}
