The Ukrainian Anarchist during the Russian Civil War (also called the \"Black Army\") organized the Free Territory of Ukraine, an anarchist society, committed to resisting state authority, whether capitalist or communist.[59][60] This project was cut short by the consolidation of Bolshevik power. Makhno was described by anarchist theorist Emma Goldman as \"an extraordinary figure\" leading a revolutionary peasants' movement.[61] During 1918, most of Ukraine was controlled by the forces of the Central Powers, which were unpopular among the people. In March 1918, the young anarchist Makhno's forces and allied anarchist and guerrilla groups won victories against German, Austrian, and Ukrainian nationalist (the army of Symon Petlura) forces, and units of the White Army, capturing a lot of German and Austro-Hungarian arms. These victories over much larger enemy forces established Makhno's reputation as a military tactician; he became known as Batko (‘Father’) to his admirers.[62]"],"after":["At this point, the emphasis on military campaigns that Makhno had adopted in the previous year shifted to political concerns. The first Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups, under the name of Nabat (\"the Alarm Drum\"), issued five main principles: rejection of all political parties, rejection of all forms of dictatorships (including the dictatorship of the proletariat, viewed by Makhnovists and many anarchists of the day as a term synonymous with the dictatorship of the Bolshevik communist party), negation of any concept of a central state, rejection of a so-called \"transitional period\" necessitating a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat, and self-management of all workers through free local workers' councils (soviets). While the Bolsheviks argued that their concept of dictatorship of the proletariat meant precisely \"rule by workers' councils\", the Makhnovist platform opposed the \"temporary\" Bolshevik measure of \"party dictatorship\". The Nabat was by no means a puppet of Mahkno and his supporters, from time to time criticizing the Black Army and its conduct in the war."]}}}
