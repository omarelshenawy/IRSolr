Long hair can be worn loose, braided, in a ponytail or up in an updo. Female international celebrities known for their waist-length or longer hair include Amal Clooney, Amanda Seyfried, Angelina Jolie, Beyonc√©, Blake Lively, Carrie Underwood, Demi Moore, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Hudson, Lea Michele, Megan Fox, Olivia Palermo, Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Jessica Parker, Shakira, and Taylor Swift."],"after":["Before World War One men generally had longer hair and beards. However, short hair on men was introduced in World War One for soldiers. Slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads. The trench warfare in 1914 to 1918 exposed men to flea and lice infestations, which prompted the order to cut short hair, establishing a military tradition.[16]"]}}}
