Komet then shelled Nauru's phosphate mining areas, oil storage depots, and the shiploading cantilever.[25][26]"],"after":["Japanese troops occupied Nauru on 25 August 1942.[26] The Japanese built an airfield which was bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943, preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru. The Japanese deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk islands.[27] Nauru, which had been bypassed and left to \"wither on the vine\" by American forces, was finally liberated on 13 September 1945, when commander Hisayaki Soeda surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy.[28]"]}}}
