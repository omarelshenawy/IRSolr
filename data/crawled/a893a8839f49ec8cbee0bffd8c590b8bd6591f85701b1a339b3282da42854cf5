By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage the user to rely more on their browser for user interface, application software and file storage facilities. This has been called \"network as platform\" computing.[2] Major features of Web 2.0 include social networking sites, self-publishing platforms, tagging, Like buttons, and social bookmarking. Users can provide the data that is on a Web 2.0 site and exercise some control over that data.[2][25] These sites may have an \"architecture of participation\" that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it.[1][2] Some scholars have put forth cloud computing as an example of Web 2.0 because cloud computing is simply an implication of computing on the Internet.[26]"]}}}
