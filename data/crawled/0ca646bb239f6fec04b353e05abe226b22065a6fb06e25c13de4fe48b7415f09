Major influences beside punk bands were the Velvet Underground, the Who, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, and the New York-based no wave scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as James Chance and the Contortions, DNA and Sonic Youth.[183] Early contributors to the genre included the US bands Pere Ubu, Devo, the Residents and Talking Heads.[183]"]}}}
