The term was coined in 1983, with \"free\" denoting the broad freedom given to users, rather than software that is free of charge (which is freeware). Alternative terms for free software include \"software libre\" and \"free and open source software\" (or \"FOSS\"). open source is not always free, though. The free software movement was launched in 1983 with the primary goal of developing free software replacements for the proprietary software that was at that point heavily relied upon. Projects born from the movement include GNU, the Linux kernel, Mozilla Firefox, LibreOffice, FreeBSD, and, on network servers, Samba, and the Apache web server."]}}}
