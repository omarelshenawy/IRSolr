In terms of other slang, there are also several borrowings from Yiddish, including kosher (originally Hebrew, via Yiddish, meaning legitimate) and stumm (/ʃtʊm/ originally German, via Yiddish, meaning quiet),[29] as well as Romany, for example wonga (meaning money, from the Romany \"wanga\" meaning coal),[30] and cushty (from the Romany kushtipen, meaning good). A fake Cockney accent is sometimes called \"Mockney\"."],"after":["Most of the features mentioned above have, in recent years, partly spread into more general south-eastern speech, giving the accent called Estuary English; an Estuary speaker will use some but not all of the Cockney sounds.[70][71][72]"]}}}
