As chancellor (1199–1205), Walter began the keeping of the Charter Roll, a record of all charters issued by the chancery. Walter was not noted for his holiness in life or learning, but historians have judged him one of the most outstanding government ministers in English history. Walter owed his early advancement to his uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, who helped him become a clerk of the Exchequer. Walter was elected Bishop of Salisbury shortly after the accession of King Henry's son Richard I to the throne of England. He accompanied King Richard on the Third Crusade, and was involved in raising Richard's ransom after the king was captured in Germany. As a reward for his faithful service, Walter was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193. He also served as Richard's justiciar until 1198, and set up a system which was the precursor for the modern justices of the peace, based on selecting four knights in each hundred to administer justice.
