Hardouin is the only scholar to use his unknown source. How the inscription got to Verona is a mystery, but it could have arrived by dispersion of property from Pliny the Younger's then Tuscan (now Umbrian) estate at Colle Plinio, north of Citt√† di Castello, identified for certain by his initials in the roof tiles. He kept statues of his ancestors there."],"after":["Pliny the Elder was born in Como, not at Verona: it is only as a native of old Gallia Transpadana that he calls Catullus of Verona his conterraneus, or fellow-countryman, not his municeps, or fellow-townsman.[6][7] A statue of Pliny on the facade of the Duomo of Como celebrates him as a native son. He had a sister, Plinia, who married into the Caecilii and was the mother of his nephew, Pliny the Younger, whose letters describe his work and study regimen in detail."]}}}
