To the dismay of some of his audience,[332] Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night.[333] Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material.[334][335] Others have criticized his live performances for mangling and spitting out \"the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable\", and giving so little to the audience that \"it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all.\"[336]"]}}}
