This has generating function x. Let P(x) denote the generating function Putting the above description in words: A plane tree consists of a node to which is attached an arbitrary number of subtrees, each of which is also a plane tree. Using the operation on families of combinatorial structures developed earlier this translates to a recursive generating function:"],"after":["An explicit formula for the number of plane trees of size n can now be determined by extracting the coefficient of xn.","Note: The notation [xn] f(x) refers to the coefficient of xn in f(x). The series expansion of the square root is based on Newton's generalization of the binomial theorem. To get from the fourth to fifth line manipulations using the generalized binomial coefficient is needed."]}}}
