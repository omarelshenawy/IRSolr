The modern approach to probability theory solves these problems using measure theory to define the probability space:"],"after":["If is the Borel Ïƒ-algebra on the set of real numbers, then there is a unique probability measure on for any cdf, and vice versa. The measure corresponding to a cdf is said to be induced by the cdf. This measure coincides with the pmf for discrete variables and pdf for continuous variables, making the measure-theoretic approach free of fallacies."]}}}
