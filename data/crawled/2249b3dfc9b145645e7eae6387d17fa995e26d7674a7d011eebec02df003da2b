In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism-Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism, and libertarian Marxism.[228] Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, Analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.[228]"]}}}
