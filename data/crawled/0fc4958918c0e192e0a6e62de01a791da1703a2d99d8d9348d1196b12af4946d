One archosaur group, the dinosaurs, were the dominant land vertebrates for the rest of the Mesozoic,[74] and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs.[70] During this time mammals' ancestors survived only as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores, but this apparent set-back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair.[75] After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs – birds are the only surviving dinosaurs – mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity, and some took to the air and the sea.[76][77][78]"]}}}
