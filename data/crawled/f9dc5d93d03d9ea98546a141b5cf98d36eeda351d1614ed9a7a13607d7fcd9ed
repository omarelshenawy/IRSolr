In 1854 John Snow depicted a cholera outbreak in London using points to represent the locations of some individual cases, an early successful use of a geographic methodology in epidemiology. While the basic elements of topography and theme existed previously in cartography, the John Snow map was unique, using cartographic methods not only to depict but also to analyze clusters of geographically dependent phenomena."]}}}
