It was spoken between the 6th and 11th centuries, continuing the earlier Old Frankish language.","The present Dutch standard language is derived from Old Dutch dialects spoken in the Low Countries that were first recorded in the Salic law, a Frankish document written around 510. From this document originated the oldest sentence that has been identified as Dutch: \"Maltho thi afrio lito\" as sentence used to free a serf. Other old segments of Dutch are \"Visc flot aftar themo uuatare\" (\"A fish was swimming in the water\") and \"Gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer\" (\"Do you believe in God the almighty father\"). The latter fragment was written around 900."]}}}
