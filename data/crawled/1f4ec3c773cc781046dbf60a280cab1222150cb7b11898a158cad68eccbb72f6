These backing bands were inducted by a separate committee, and not by the ballot voting used for all other performer inductees.","The performers category is meant for recording artists and bands that have \"influence and significance to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll.\"[2] Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years after the release of their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects anywhere from nine to a dozen candidates. Ballots are sent to 500 \"rock experts\" who then evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers who receive the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent of the vote are inducted. In 2011, the number inducted was five. The rest of the categories are voted on by special committees.[2] In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. \"There was a lot of discussion about this,\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question â€“ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\"[10]"],"after":["Artists inducted into the early influences category are those \"whose music predated rock and roll but had an impact on the evolution of rock and roll and inspired rock's leading artists.\"[2] Unlike the performers category, these inductees are selected by a committee. The full process is not transparent and it is unclear who comprises this selection committee.[2]"]}}}
