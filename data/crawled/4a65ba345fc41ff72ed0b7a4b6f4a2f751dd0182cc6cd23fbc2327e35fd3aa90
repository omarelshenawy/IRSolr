By January 2011, Experian Hitwise show that Bing's market share had increased to 12.8% at the expense of Yahoo! and Google. Bing powered searches also continued to have a higher \"success rate\" compared to Google, with more users clicking on the resulting links.[19] In the same period, comScoreâ€™s \"2010 U.S. Digital Year in Review\" report showed that \"Bing was the big gainer in year-over-year search activity, picking up 29% more searches in 2010 than it did in 2009\".[20] The Wall Street Journal notes the 1% jump in share \"appeared to come at the expense of rival Google Inc\".[21] In February 2011, Bing beat Yahoo! for the first time with 4.37% search share while Yahoo! received 3.93%.[22]"]}}}
