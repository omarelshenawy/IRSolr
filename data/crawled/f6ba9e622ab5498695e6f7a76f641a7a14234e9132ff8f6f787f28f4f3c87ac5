I put in your lovers, for I don't allow it possible for a man to be so sincere as I am.\"[46] Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who was the subject of many of Seward's sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward's protest, Seward's poems became angry. However, Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd's beauty and their affection and friendship.[47] As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, \"The roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:â€”You know not how I love her.\"[48][note 5] Wollstonecraft's first novel Mary: A Fiction, in part, addressed her relationship with Fanny Blood.[49]"],"after":["Perhaps the most famous of these romantic friendships was between Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, nicknamed the Ladies of Llangollen. Butler and Ponsonby eloped in 1778, to the relief of Ponsonby's family (concerned about their reputation had she run away with a man)[50] to live together in Wales for 51 years and be thought of as eccentrics.[51] Their story was considered \"the epitome of virtuous romantic friendship\" and inspired poetry by Anna Seward and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.[52] Diarist Anne Lister, captivated by Butler and Ponsonby, recorded her affairs with women between 1817 and 1840. Some of it was written in code, detailing her sexual relationships with Marianna Belcombe and Maria Barlow.[53] Both Lister and Eleanor Butler were considered masculine by contemporary news reports, and though there were suspicions that these relationships were sapphist in nature, they were nonetheless praised in literature.[54][55]"]}}}
