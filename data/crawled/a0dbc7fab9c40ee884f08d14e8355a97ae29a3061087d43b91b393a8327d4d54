Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: \"We were familiar at once—I put my hand on his knee—we understood. He did not get out at the end of the trip—in fact went all the way back with me.\"[131] In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code \"16.4\" (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet).[132] A more direct, secondhand account comes from Oscar Wilde: Wilde met Whitman in America in 1882 and wrote to the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that there was \"no doubt\" about the great American poet's sexual orientation—\"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips\", he boasted.[133] The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter, then an old man, described to Gavin Arthur an erotic encounter that Carpenter had had in his youth with Whitman; Arthur recorded it in detail in his journal.[134][135] Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his \"Calamus\" poems were homosexual, he chose not to respond.[136]"],"after":["Another possible lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles. Duckett was fifteen when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as \"thick\". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover.[137] Their photograph [pictured] is described as \"modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait\", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire.[138] Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, \"You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death.\"[139]"]}}}
