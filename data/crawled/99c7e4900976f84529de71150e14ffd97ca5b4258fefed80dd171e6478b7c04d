It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. Beck's London Underground map is an iconic example. Though the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the River Thames, letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.[30] Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfils its purpose.[31]"],"after":["Arthur H. Robinson, an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed \"will be a cartographic failure.\" He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that \"map design is perhaps the most complex.\"[32] Robinson codified the mapmaker's understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs."]}}}
