Christianity is the predominant religion, with the Roman Catholic Church as the largest church. In 2011, 84.2% of the population identified themselves as Roman Catholic, 4.6% as Protestant or another Christian religion, 1.1% as Muslim, and 6.2% as having no religion.[120] According to a Georgetown University study, the country has one of the highest rates of regular Mass attendance in the Western world.[121] While daily attendance was 13% in 2006, there was a reduction in weekly attendance from 81% in 1990 to 48% in 2006, although the decline was reported as stabilising.[122] In 2011, it was reported that weekly Mass attendance in Dublin was just 18%, with it being even lower among younger generations.[123]"],"after":["The Church of Ireland is the second largest Christian denomination. Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but has recently experienced an increase, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church. Immigration has contributed to a growth in Hindu and Muslim populations. In percentage terms, Orthodox Christianity and Islam were the fastest growing religions, with increases of 100% and 70% respectively.[124]"]}}}
