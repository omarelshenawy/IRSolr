Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down.[7] Page wanted to form a supergroup with him and Beck on guitars, and the Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle on drums and bass, respectively.[8] Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project.[9] The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, \"Beck's Bolero\", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones.[10]"]}}}
