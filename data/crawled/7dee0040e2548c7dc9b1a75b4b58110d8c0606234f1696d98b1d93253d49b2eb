However, after he passed an MI5 security check conducted by two MI5 officers (Cyril Mills and Tom√°s Harris) and an MI6 officer (Desmond Bristow), Mills (who Pujol only ever knew as Mr Grey) suggested that his code name be changed to Garbo, after Greta Garbo.[31] Pujol's wife and child were later relocated to Britain.[15] Pujol operated as a double agent under the XX Committee's aegis. Mills spoke no Spanish, and passed his case over to the Spanish-speaking officer Harris.[3] Together, Harris and Pujol wrote 315 letters, averaging 2,000 words, addressed to a post office box in Lisbon supplied by the Germans. His fictional spy network was so efficient and verbose that his German handlers were overwhelmed and made no further attempts to recruit any additional spies in the UK, according to the Official History of British Intelligence in WW2.[3]"],"after":["Garbo was unique among Britain's double-agents, having deliberately set out to become one.[32] The rest were enemy agents who had been discovered and turned, which required that they work under guard."]}}}
