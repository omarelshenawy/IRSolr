With over 600 wineries, Victoria has more wine producers than any other Australian wine-producing state but ranks third in overall wine production due to the lack of a mass bulk wine-producing area like South Australia's Riverland and New South Wales's Riverina. Today winemaking is spread out across the state and features premier wine regions such as Heatcote, Rutherglen and the Yarra Valley. The style of wine ranges from full body red wine to Madeira-like fortified wines such as Liqueur Muscat."]}}}
