Rather than being a distraction, the tour added extra intensity and focus to their new material.[57] Later that year, Bono travelled to San Salvador and Nicaragua and saw first-hand the distress of peasants bullied in internal conflicts that were subject to US political intervention. The experience became a central influence on the new music.[58]"],"after":["The Joshua Tree was released in March 1987. The album juxtaposes antipathy towards US foreign policy against the group's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and ideals.[60] The band wanted music with a sense of location and a \"cinematic\" quality, and the record's music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading.[61] The Joshua Tree became the fastest-selling album in British chart history, and topped the Billboard 200 in the United States for nine consecutive weeks.[62] The first two singles, \"With or Without You\"[37] and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", quickly became the group's first number-one hits in the US. They became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine,[63] which declared that U2 was \"Rock's Hottest Ticket\".[64] The album won U2 their first two Grammy Awards,[65] and it brought the band a new level of success. Many publications, including Rolling Stone, have cited it as one of rock's greatest.[66] The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums, alongside smaller arena shows.[67]"]}}}
