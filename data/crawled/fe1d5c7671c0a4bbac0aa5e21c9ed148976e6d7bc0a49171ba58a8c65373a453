However, development of the city did not begin until 50 years after the forts were abandoned at the end of the conflict. Three forts named \"Fort Lauderdale\" were constructed; the first was at the fork of the New River, the second at Tarpon Bend, in what is now known as the Sailboat Bend neighborhood, and the third near the site of the Bahia Mar Marina.The forts took their name from Major William Lauderdale, who was the commander of the detachment of soldiers who built the first fort."]}}}
