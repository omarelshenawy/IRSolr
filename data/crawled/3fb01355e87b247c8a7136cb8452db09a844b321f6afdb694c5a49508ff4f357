It has two purposes: (1) to confirm the participant as a member of the church, and (2) to give the participant the Gift of the Holy Ghost, which provides the recipient with spiritual gifts. It consists of a member of the priesthood laying hands on the participant's head and blessing the new member, and telling them to \"receive the Holy Ghost\"."]}}}
