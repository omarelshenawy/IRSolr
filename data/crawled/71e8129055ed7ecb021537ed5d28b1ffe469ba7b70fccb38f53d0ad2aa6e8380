This decision caused some resentment among fans in other parts of the world. Drowned World became the first (and only) Madonna tour to skip over Canada completely.[11] For many weeks prior to the launch of the tour dates, Arthur Fogel from Live Nation himself attempted to book dates in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre between the Sunrise, Atlanta, and Detroit dates, though no free bookings were available. In the end no dates were scheduled in Toronto, to the disappointment of many Canadian fans.[11][28] Ticket sales were swift in London on April 25, as Madonna sold out her dates at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in record time – six shows in six hours. Madonna made history with the fastest-selling show ever at Earl's Court, as 97,000 tickets were sold.[29]"]}}}
