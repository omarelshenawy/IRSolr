Confucius, for example, used yǎyán (雅 言), or \"elegant speech\", rather than colloquial regional dialects; text during the Han Dynasty also referred to tōngyǔ (通 语), or \"common language\". Rime books, which were written since the Southern and Northern Dynasties, may also have reflected one or more systems of standard pronunciation during those times. However, all of these standard dialects were probably unknown outside the educated elite; even among the elite, pronunciations may have been very different, as the unifying factor of all Chinese dialects, Classical Chinese, was a written standard, not a spoken one."],"after":["The Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) and the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) began to use the term guānhuà (官话/官話), or \"official speech\", to refer to the speech used at the courts. The term \"Mandarin\" is borrowed directly from Portuguese. The Portuguese word mandarim, derived from the Sanskrit word mantrin \"counselor or minister\", was first used to refer to the Chinese bureaucratic officials. The Portuguese then translated guānhuà as \"the language of the mandarins\" or \"the mandarin language\".[21]"]}}}
