By the 490s, Clovis I had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one Frankish kingdom, and from there continued his conquests into Gaul. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population.[35] A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. southern Netherlands and Flanders), who kept on speaking Old Frankish, which by the Ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch.[35] A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence.[35][41]"],"after":["To the north of the Franks, climatic conditions on the coast improved, so the abandoned land of the ancient Frisii was during the Migration Period resettled again, mostly by Saxons, but also by Angles, Jutes and ancient Frisii. Many moved on to England and came to be known as Anglo-Saxons, but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians, named after the ancient inhabitants of the Frisii. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast, and it is still the closest to English related living language after Scots. By the Seventh-century a Frisian Kingdom (650â€“734) under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Utrecht as its centre of power,[42][43] while Dorestad was a Frisian flourishing trading place.[44][45] Between 600 and around 719 the city was often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the Battle of the Boarn, the Frisians in the Netherlands were after a series of wars defeated by the Franks. With the approval of the Franks, Anglo-Saxon missionaries converted the Frisian people to Christianity. Willibrord established the Archdiocese of Utrecht and became bishop of the Frisians. However, his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in Dokkum, in 754."]}}}
