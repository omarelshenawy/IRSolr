However, the structure was scaled down to an 80-foot (24.4 m) diameter in order to accommodate the accessible ramp that runs behind the monument.[8] Each of the limestone columns is cut from an Indiana quarry [15] and made of five 2,200 pounds (997.9 kg; 157.1 st) sections reinforced by steel rods and plates.[11] The fountain in front of the monument is a bronze-cast replica of the finials that adorn the Wrigley Building.[10] The brass spout was made from a mold of a terra cotta finail on the Wrigley Building.[16]"]}}}
