The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, with an average of 0.8%.[53] The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.[34] In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009,[40] and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.[4]"]}}}
