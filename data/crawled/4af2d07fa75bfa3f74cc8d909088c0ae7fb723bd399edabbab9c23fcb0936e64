The sitar saw further use in popular music after The Beatles featured the sitar in their compositions, namely \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" and \"Within You Without You\". Their use of the instrument came as a result of George Harrison taking lessons on how to play it from Shankar and Shambhu Das[2]. Shortly after, The Rolling Stones used a sitar in \"Paint It, Black\" and a brief fad began for using the instrument in pop songs. Sitars are also used extensively in Hindustani classical music."]}}}
