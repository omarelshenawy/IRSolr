The case was brought about by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the Thunderball novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on Thunderball and had licensed his rights for the production of Never Say Never Again in 1983.[240][241] In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by Sony for $5,000 million.[242]"]}}}
