Public baths were a part of urban culture throughout the provinces, but in the late 4th century, individual tubs began to replace communal bathing.[290] Christians were advised to go to the baths for health and cleanliness, not pleasure,[291] but to avoid the games (ludi), which were part of religious festivals they considered \"pagan\". Tertullian says that otherwise Christians not only availed themselves of the baths, but participated fully in commerce and society.[292]"],"after":["Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) and at least one luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum),[293] but it was not a place to retreat from public life.[294] Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity.[295] It was also a center of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors.[296] The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae).[297] In addition to a kitchen garden— windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.[298]"]}}}
