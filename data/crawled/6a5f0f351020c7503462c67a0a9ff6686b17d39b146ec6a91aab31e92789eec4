The current president is Dilma Rousseff, who was inaugurated on 1 January 2011.[161] The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government.[15] Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The National Congress is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively.
