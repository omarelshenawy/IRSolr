According to him \"it was a tune people could understand and latch on to, which is what makes a pop song memorable\".[4][10] The New York Times writer Stephen Holden compared the song with sweeter post-Motown valentine songs.[11] Houston Chronicle writer Joey Guerra called the song \"perfect\" for dancefloor strut.[12] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it a perfect dance song with deepened dance grooves.[13] Slant Magazine named the song as one of Madonna's most \"robust\" songs.[14] Robert Christgau said of the song, \"I'm not saying her flair is pleasureless—the generosity she demands in the inexhaustible 'Open Your Heart' is a two-way street and then some.\"[15]"]}}}
