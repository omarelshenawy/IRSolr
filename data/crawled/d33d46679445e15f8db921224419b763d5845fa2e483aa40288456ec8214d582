Concerned that boatmen might poach his game and wild fowl, Brooke did not want the canal to pass through his land. The Act included several stipulations; the canal should not come within 325 metres (1,066 ft) of his house; the towpath should be on the south side of the canal, furthest away from Brooke's house; there should be no quays, buildings, hedges or fences to obstruct the view; no vessels were to be moored within 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) of the house, other than during construction. Eventually though, a compromise was reached. This included the construction of a link to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook (permitted by the Trent and Mersey Canal Act of 1766),[32] and the building of the canal's terminus to the west of Runcorn Gap.[28] The Trent and Mersey link gave the Duke access to the Midlands, and forestalled the Weaver Trustees from making their own junction with the canal.[33] The new extension also met with opposition from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, until the duke purchased a controlling interest in the company.[22] The first part of the new extension was opened in 1767,[34] and completed in full by March 1776,[28] but Brindley did not live to see its completion; it was continued by his brother-in-law, Hugh Henshall.[23]"]}}}
