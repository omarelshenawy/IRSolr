The beginning of the song was connected to the end of the previous performance, \"Express Yourself\".[23] This performance began with a male member from the audience jumping onto the stage trying to dance with Madonna, who starts calling out for security. The man then proceeds to rip off his breakaway pants revealing himself as one of the dancers from the show. For this performance, Madonna and her dancers were dressed in a Donna Summer-style disco ensemble, which consisted of a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants, and sang the song in a retro-seventies mode, with disco balls sparkling across the stage.[24][25] John Pareles from The New York Times felt that it was during the performances of \"Express Yourself\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\" that the show reached its climax; \"The core of the show takes place in a disco stage setting with glittering Mylar curtains and mirrored balls. Madonna and the dancers, wearing wildly patterned neo-1970's halters and bell-bottoms, romp through \"Express Yourself\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\"â€”songs about freeing desire.\"[26] Towards the end of the performance, Madonna and her dancers found themselves engaging in an hedonistic orgy, which gave way to the next performance of the show; \"Why's It So Hard\".[27] In the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds, the \"boyish\" and \"androgynous\" looks of the female dancers in the Girlie Show World Tour are discussed, and it is said that it is only when one of the females appears topless during the performance of \"Deeper and Deeper\", that her sex is determinable.[28]"]}}}
