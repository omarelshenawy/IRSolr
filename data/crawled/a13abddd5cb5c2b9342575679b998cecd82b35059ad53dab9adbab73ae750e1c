Pinafore and The Mikado and gavottes in Ruddigore and The Gondoliers.[241] In The Sorcerer, there is a country dance in \"If you'll marry me\".[241] In Ruddigore, the sailor character dances a hornpipe, while in The Mikado, Sullivan quotes a Japanese war song in \"Miya Sama\". Sullivan's 1882 trip to Egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera, The Rose of Persia.[242] Of the sextette \"I hear the soft note\" in Patience, Sullivan said to the singers, \"I think you will like this. It is Dr. Arne and Purcell at their best.\"[243]"]}}}
