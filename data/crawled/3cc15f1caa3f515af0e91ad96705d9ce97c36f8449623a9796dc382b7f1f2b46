She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she’s not asking you to come hither.\"[204] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: \"Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere.\" Holloway noted her image to be \"a dash of ghetto fabulousness\" and \"middle-class respectability\" for mass appeal.[250] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture.[251] Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a \"showbiz phenomenon\".[252] Lopez has developed an image as a sex symbol and \"one of the most desirable women on the planet\".[253] She is well known for her curvaceous figure,[254] which was the inspiration for Sir Mix-a-Lot's 1992 hit \"Baby Got Back\".[255] Widely recognized and celebrated for her figure, she has been credited with allowing women with curvaceous figures to be accepted.[256]"]}}}
