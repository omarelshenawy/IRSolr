He was the son of a Muezzin and had himself issued the call to prayer from his father's mosque which overlooked the sultan's seraglio. He was a favorite of Sultan Selim II and the women of the seraglio who had greatly admired his voice, and, like Piyale Pasha, he had married one of Selim's daughters."]}}}
