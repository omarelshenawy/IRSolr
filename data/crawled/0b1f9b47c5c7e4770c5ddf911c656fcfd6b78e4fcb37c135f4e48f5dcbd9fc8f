When Sir Walter Raleigh was released from his imprisonment in 1616, he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish.[98] Raleigh's expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son was killed fighting the Spanish.[99] On Raleigh's return to England, James had him executed to the indignation of the public, who opposed the appeasement of Spain.[100] James's policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, especially after his Protestant son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, was ousted from Bohemia by the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick's Rhineland home territory. Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law.[101] The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick,[102] and on the other—remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments—called for a war directly against Spain. In November 1621, roused by Sir Edward Coke, they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws.[103] James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment,[104] which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech.[105] Urged on by the Duke of Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.[106]"]}}}
