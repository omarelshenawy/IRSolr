Because they have the responsibility to store objects, museums develop taxonomies for their collections, using conventions of classification authority for the sake of consistency. This may be undertaken with the museumâ€™s archivist. The result is to occasionally find a strong emphasis on the history of media in conjunction with the history of culture."]}}}
