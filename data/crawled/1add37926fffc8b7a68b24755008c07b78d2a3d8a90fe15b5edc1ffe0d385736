It is spoken alongside French, which is gradually replacing it for all purposes and in all areas of communication.[39] Neither Dutch nor its regional French Flemish variant is afforded legal status in France, either by the central or regional public authorities, by the education system or before the courts. In brief, the state takes no measures to ensure the use of Dutch in France.[39]"]}}}
