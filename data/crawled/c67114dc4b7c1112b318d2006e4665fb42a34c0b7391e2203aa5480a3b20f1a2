(English: And what's your opinion?), where the audience, among them a priest, presented their arguments as to why \"this morally clueless singer shouldn't perform in the country\", making reference to the then upcoming Girlie Show World Tour which was set to visit Mexico. Later, during her concert in Mexico, Madonna wore a charro sombrero and simulated an orgy with her dancers onstage, as a response to these comments.[65] Continuing her provocative imagery, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which featured the singer fully nude and in scenes engaged in simulated sexual acts.[66] In March 1994, Madonna appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that was required to be censored on television and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear and asking him to smell it.[67] The releases of her sexually explicit film, album and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics regard Madonna as a sexual renegade. She faced strong negative publicity from critics and fans, who commented that \"she had gone too far\" and that her career was over.[68] Later on the song \"Human Nature\" from her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna addressed the public backlash the book was still receiving, particularly with the lines \"Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy,\" as well as the line \"What was I thinking?\".[31]"]}}}
