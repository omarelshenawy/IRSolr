The development of writing (ca. 3500 BCE) and the use of documents was critical to the administration of this system, and the first definitive emergence of bureaucracy is in ancient Sumer, where an emergent class of scribes used clay tablets to administer the harvest and allocate its spoils.[23] Ancient Egypt also had a hereditary class of scribes that administered the civil service bureaucracy.[24] Much of what is known today of these cultures comes from the writing of the scribes."]}}}
