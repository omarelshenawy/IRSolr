Bedroom bondage games are commonly used as a form of foreplay.[2] They require and imply a level of trust and a surrender of control by the restrained to the active partner.[1] The restrained partner (called a bottom) surrenders control to the other partner (called a top). This surrender of control happens voluntarily and under mutual understanding and consent."]}}}
