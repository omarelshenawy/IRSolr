The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate. With a total possible grant of Â£10,235 over a 3-year degree, it is the most generous bursary scheme offered by any British university.[67] In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[68] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[69] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[70][71]"]}}}
