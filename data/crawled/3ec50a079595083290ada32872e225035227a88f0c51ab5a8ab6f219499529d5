The tilt is in the decreasing phase of its cycle, and will reach its minimum value around the year 11,800 CEÂ ; the last maximum was reached in 8,700 BCE. This trend in forcing, by itself, tends to make winters warmer and summers colder (i.e. milder seasons), as well as cause an overall cooling trend."],"after":[""]}}}
