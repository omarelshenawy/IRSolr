The Mughal Empire, which would rule a largely Hindu population and adhere (for the most part) to a tolerant Sunni Islam, was recently founded by the Timurid heir Babur. Babur's son Humayun was ousted from his Hindustan territories by the Pashtun Sher Shah Suri and threatened by his half-brother and bitter rival Kamran Mirza, who had inherited the northern part of Babur's territories.[83] Having to flee from city to city, Humayun eventually sought refuge at the court of Tahmﾄ《p. Tahmﾄ《p received Humayun at his court in Qazvin in 1543 as the true emperor of the Mughal dynasty, despite the fact that Humayun had been living in exile for more than fifteen years.[83][84] After Humayun converted to Shia Islam (under extreme duress),[83] Tahmﾄ《p offered him military assistance to regain his territories in return for Kandahar, which controlled the overland trade route between central Persia and the Ganges. In 1545 a combined Persian-Mughal force managed to seize Kandahar and occupy Kabul.[85] Humayn handed over Kandahar, but Tahmﾄ《p was forced to retake it in 1558, when Humayun seized it on the death of the Safavid governor."]}}}
