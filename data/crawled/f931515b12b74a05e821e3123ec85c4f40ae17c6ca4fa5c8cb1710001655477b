Then, we compute the solutions of Ax = 0; that is, we find the null space N of A. The solution set of this equation is given by . If the number of variables is equal to the number of equations, then we can characterize when the system has a unique solution: since N is trivial if and only if det A ≠ 0, the equation has a unique solution if and only if det A ≠ 0.[18]"]}}}
