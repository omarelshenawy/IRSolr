She also gave birth to her daughter, Lourdes, that same year. During that same period of time, she enrolled in Kabbalah and studied Hinduism and yoga. According to the production of Ray of Light, another factor which inspired the record's conception was the vocal lessons Madonna took in preparation for Evita. Madonna felt that there was a \"whole piece\" of her voice left unused, which she decided to utilize for the album.[1] By May 1997, Madonna had started writing songs for the album. Then not long after, Maverick Records's partner Guy Oseary phoned British electronic musician William Orbit, and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna.[1]"]}}}
