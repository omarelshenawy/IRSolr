The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation. In broader usage, \"composer\" can designate people who participate in other musical traditions, as well as those who create music by means other than written notation; for example, through improvisation, recording, and arrangement."]}}}
