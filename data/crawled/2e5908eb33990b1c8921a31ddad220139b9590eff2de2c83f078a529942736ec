For example, in his biography of Mao, Philip Short notes that in the Yan'an Rectification Movement, Mao gave explicit instructions that \"no cadre is to be killed,\" but in practice allowed security chief Kang Sheng to drive opponents to suicide and that \"this pattern was repeated throughout his leadership of the People's Republic.\"[7]"],"after":["Following the consolidation of power, Mao launched the First Five-Year Plan (1953â€“58). The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become a world power. With the Soviet Union's assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support. The success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second Five-Year Plan, the Great Leap Forward, in 1958. Mao also launched a phase of rapid collectivization. The CPC introduced price controls as well as a Chinese character simplification aimed at increasing literacy. Large-scale industrialization projects were also undertaken."]}}}
