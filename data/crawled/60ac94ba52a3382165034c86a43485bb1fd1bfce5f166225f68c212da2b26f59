Anything that affects an effect is a factor of that effect. A direct factor is a factor that affects an effect directly, that is, without any intervening factors. (Intervening factors are sometimes called \"intermediate factors\".) The connection between a cause(s) and an effect in this way can also be referred to as a causal nexus.[citation needed]"]}}}
