Madonna was dressed in a Jean-Paul Gaultier kaftan with pants and high heeled boots.[46] As Madonna finished the performance of the song \"Isaac\", she took off the kaftan and wore a jacket given to her by the dancers and greets them one by one.[47] The Pet Shop Boys music for the song's remix start in the background. Madonna and her female dancers take to one side of a giant cage and start singing the song.[48] As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her bending her body and putting her leg over her head[48] and jumping from the cage on a dancer's back.[47]"]}}}
