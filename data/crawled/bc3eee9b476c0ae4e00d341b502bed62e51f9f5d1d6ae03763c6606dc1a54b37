In it Stirner names his educational principle \"personalist,\" explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create \"free men, sovereign characters,\" by which he means \"eternal charactersÂ ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment\".[284]"]}}}
