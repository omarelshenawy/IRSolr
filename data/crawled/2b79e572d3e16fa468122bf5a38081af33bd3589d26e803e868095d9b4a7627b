The two most important codes are those of the IIHF[36] and the NHL.[37] Both of the codes, and others, originated from Canadian rules of ice hockey of the early 20th Century."],"after":["Ice hockey is played on a hockey rink. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a hard vulcanized rubber disc, the puck, into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck."]}}}
