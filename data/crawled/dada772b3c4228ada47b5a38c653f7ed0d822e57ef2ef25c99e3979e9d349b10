In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world's first power station that used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.[24] The reliability of the AC technology received impetus after the Ganz Works electrified a large European metropolis: Rome in 1886.[24]"],"after":[]}}}
