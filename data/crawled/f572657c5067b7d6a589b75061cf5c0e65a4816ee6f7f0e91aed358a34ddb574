It was involved in the tectonic break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates. The Messinian salinity crisis occurred in the late Miocene (12 million years ago to 5 million years ago) when the Mediterranean dried up. Geologically the Mediterranean is underlain by oceanic crust. There are more than a million cubic kilometres of salt deposits at the bottom of the Mediterranean,[39] up to three kilometres thick in places.[40]"]}}}
