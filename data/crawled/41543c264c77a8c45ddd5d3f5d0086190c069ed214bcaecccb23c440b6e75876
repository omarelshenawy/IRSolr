The Manchester Arndale is the UK's largest city centre shopping centre.[47]"],"after":["Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel. Old mills have been converted into modern apartments, Hulme has undergone extensive regeneration programmes, and million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed. The 169-metre tall, 47-storey Beetham Tower, completed in 2006, is the tallest building in the UK outside London and when finished was the highest residential accommodation in Europe.[48] In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel awarded Manchester a licence to build the only supercasino in the UK,[49] however plans were officially abandoned in February 2008.[50]"]}}}
