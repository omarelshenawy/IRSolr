Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on \"artistic\" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The classical Greek philosopher Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest-surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since.[54] In it, he offers an account of what he calls \"poetry\" (a term which in Greek literally means \"making\" and in this context includes drama—comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play—as well as lyric poetry, epic poetry, and the dithyramb). He examines its \"first principles\" and identifies its genres and basic elements; his analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion.[55] He argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) mythos or \"plot\", ethos or \"character\", dianoia or \"thought\", lexis or \"diction\", melos or \"song\", and opsis or \"spectacle\".[56] \"Although Aristotle's Poetics is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition,\" Marvin Carlson explains, \"almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions.\"[57] Important theatre practitioners of the 20th century include Konstantin Stanislavski, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Jacques Copeau, Edward Gordon Craig, Bertolt Brecht, Antonin Artaud, Joan Littlewood, Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, Augusto Boal, Eugenio Barba, Dario Fo, Keith Johnstone and Robert Wilson (director)."]}}}
