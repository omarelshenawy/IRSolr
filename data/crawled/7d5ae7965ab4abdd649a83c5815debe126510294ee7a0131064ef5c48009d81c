What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.\"[17] Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour of the previous year for which the critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe.[168] Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph notes that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion,[167] and concludes, \"Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet ... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force.\"[167] Rolling Stone comments that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as \"an icon to rival Madonna\", and says, \"Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter.\"[169] Minogue has said of Madonna, \"Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done\",[168] and \"Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that.\"[167] Kylie was declared by media as the sex symbol.[170][171][172][173]"],"after":["In January 2007, Madame Tussauds in London unveiled its fourth waxwork of Minogue; only Queen Elizabeth II has had more models created.[174] During the same week a bronze cast of her hands was added to Wembley Arena's \"Square of Fame\".[174] On 23 November 2007, a bronze statue of Minogue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands for permanent display.[175]"]}}}
