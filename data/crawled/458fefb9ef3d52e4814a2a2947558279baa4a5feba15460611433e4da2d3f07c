The perigee distance is less than the radius of the Earth R including atmosphere, hence the ellipse intersects the Earth, and hence the spacecraft will fail to complete an orbit. The major axis is vertical, the semi-major axis a is more than R/2. The specific orbital energy is given by:"],"after":["Almost always a < R, corresponding to a lower than the minimum for a full orbit, which is","Thus the net extra specific energy needed compared to just raising the spacecraft into space is between 0 and ."]}}}
