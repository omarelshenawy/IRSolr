Cool J and the Streets. The show was praised by fans and critics as \"great radio,\" as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor, while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices.[242][243] In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was \"Goodbye\" and the final record played was Woody Guthrie's \"So Long, It's Been Good To Know Yuh\". This has led to speculation that Dylan's radio series may have ended.[244]"],"after":["On August 29, 2006, Dylan released his Modern Times album. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing on the album as \"a catarrhal death rattle\"[245]) most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing Time Out of Mind and \"Love and Theft\".[246] Modern Times entered the U.S. charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire.[247] The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.[248]"]}}}
