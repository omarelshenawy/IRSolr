They also produced \"Sugar on Sunday\", later covered by the Clique. As the band embraced the sounds of psychedelia, they were invited to perform at the Woodstock concert but declined."],"after":["The group continued until 1970.[6] At a concert in Birmingham, Alabama in March of that year, an exhausted James collapsed after coming off stage from a reaction to drugs and was actually pronounced dead. He recovered and decided to move to the country to rest and recuperate, and left the band.[7] His four band-mates carried on for a short while under the name of \"Hog Heaven\" but disbanded soon afterwards."]}}}
