It began with \"The Sweet Machine\", a 3D animation video displaying candy being manufactured and used as a Pinball.[17] As the video ended, \"Candy Shop\" began with Madonna appearing on a M-shaped throne in the Givenchy-designed dress, sitting with her legs spread apart and holding a staff in her hands.[18] She was accompanied by her dancers in bondage themed costumes.[18] \"Beat Goes On\" featured Madonna and her dancers on a 1935 Auburn Speedster while Pharrell Williams and Kanye West appeared on the backdrops.[19] Madonna then played the electric guitar for \"Human Nature\"; the performance featured a video of Britney Spears trapped in an elevator, who sang along with some of the verses in the song.[20] A modernized \"Vogue\", featuring the hook of \"4 Minutes\",[21] was the final song for this section. It led to a video interlude for \"Die Another Day\", featuring Madonna as a boxer on screen, while her dancers performed a faux boxing match.[17] The next section, inspired by the style and culture of early 1980s New York, began with Madonna skipping on stage for \"Into the Groove\".[18] This performance was a mashup with \"Toop Toop\" by Cassius and featured the artwork of friend Keith Haring.[19] She then performed a double Dutch dance interlude which led to \"Heartbeat\".[22] During that song, Madonna's dance movements were controlled by her back-up dancers as if they were puppeteers.[17] She performed \"Borderline\" in a rock version, on electric guitar.[19] \"She's Not Me\" followed, where Madonna made fun of her various incarnations and styles, from the music videos of \"Open Your Heart\", \"Material Girl\", \"Vogue\" and \"Like a Virgin\".[17] The section ended with \"Music\" which contained elements of \"Put Your Hands Up 4 Detroit\" and excerpts from \"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\".[21] A short video was played featuring a tagged subway train. The doors of the train then closed to take in Madonna and her dancers.[18] The \"Rain\" video interlude was played on the video screens; it featured an animated pixie finding shade under a petal during a rainstorm. This version contained musical elements from \"Here Comes the Rain Again\" by Eurythmics.[21]"]}}}
