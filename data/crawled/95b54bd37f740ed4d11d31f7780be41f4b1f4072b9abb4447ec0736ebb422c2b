In traditional African societies, masks often have a specific association with death, and some types may be worn mainly or exclusively for funeral ceremonies.[90] The funeral ceremonies of the Indigenous Australians typically feature body painting; the Yolngu and Tiwi people create carved pukumani burial poles from ironwood trunks,[91] while elaborately carved burial trees have been used in south-eastern Australia.[92] The Toraja people of central Sulawesi are famous for their burial practices, which include the setting-up of effigies of the dead on cliffs. The 19th- and 20th-century royal Kasubi Tombs in Uganda, destroyed by fire in 2010, were a circular compound of thatched buildings similar to those inhabited by the earlier Kabakas when alive, but with special characteristics.[93]"]}}}
