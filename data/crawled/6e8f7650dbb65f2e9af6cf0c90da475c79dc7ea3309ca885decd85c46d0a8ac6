Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a positive review, stating that \"for years, Madonna spoke in metaphors, fantasies and blatant shock tactics, but the performer indignantly struck back at her critics on \"Human Nature.\" She didn't just hold up a mirror, she became the mirror.\"[4] Barbara O'Dair from Rolling Stone also gave a positive review of the song, commenting that \"Madonna does a drive-by on her critics, complete with a keening synth line straight outta Dre\" adding that \"Madonna's message is still 'Express yourself, don't repress yourself.' This time, however, it comes not with a bang but a whisper.\"[5] For Moscow-Pullman Daily News, the song had the catchiest chorus from the album.[6] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a negative review, noting that Madonna's \"on far surer ground thrashing through such neurotic (if not uncommon) views of relationships than she is trashing the media. In striking back at her critics, Madonna simply sounds self-righteous and smug. I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex, she sneers in Human Nature. Did I say something true? Yes. But tooting your own horn about it just sounds petty.\"[7]"]}}}
