Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of cultural colonialism; in turn, the former have been criticized for their moral relativism and failure to defend the idea of universal human rights.[233] According to the opposition's critics, the biological reductionism of the opposition, and the failure to appreciate the practice's cultural context, undermines the practitioners' agency and serves to \"other\" them – in particular by calling African parents mutilators.[234] Yet Africans who object to the opposition risk appearing to defend FGM.[235] Feminist theorist Obioma Nnaemeka – herself strongly opposed to FGM (\"If one is circumcised, it is one too many\") – argues that the impact of renaming it female genital mutilation cannot be underestimated:"],"after":[]}}}
