They are driven by high-frequency alternating current energy at approximately 35 kHz, 2â€“5 kV.[1] This energy comes from a lower-voltage DC power supply usually connected to mains power, and flows through a high-voltage transformer combined with a high-frequency electronic oscillator circuit which together output a high frequency and high voltage AC to the electrode. Therefore, the circuitry inside the electrode can be considered as a specialized power inverter. The high-frequency high-voltage power, or radio frequency energy, is transmitted into the gas within the globe through an electrode at its center. A much smaller hollow glass orb can also serve as an electrode when it is filled with metal wool or a conducting fluid that is in communication with the transformer output. In this case, the radio-frequency energy is admitted into the larger space by capacitive coupling right through the glass. Plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of moving tendrils of colored light within the volume of the globe (see corona discharge and electric glow discharge)."]}}}
