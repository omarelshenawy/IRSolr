The 10th-century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges.[185] There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships.[75][186] If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water.[187] The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure.[188] Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths.[188] The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction.[188] David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement \"[made] them more reliable\" for anchoring ships.[188]"]}}}
