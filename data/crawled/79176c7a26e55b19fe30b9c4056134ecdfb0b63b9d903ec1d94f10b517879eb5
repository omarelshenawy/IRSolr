Seeking a wider and more accepting audience for their work, Duncan, Fuller, and Ruth St. Denis all toured Europe. Fuller's work also received little support outside Europe. St. Denis returned to the United States to continue her work."],"after":["Martha Graham is often regarded as the founding mother of modern 20th-century concert dance.[11] Graham viewed ballet as too one-sided: European, imperialistic, and un-American.[12] She became a student at the Denishawn school in 1916 and then moved to New York City in 1923, where she performed in musical comedies, music halls, and worked on her own choreography.[13] Graham developed her own dance technique, Graham technique, that hinged on concepts of contraction and release.[11] In Graham's teachings, she wanted her students to \"Feel\". To \"Feel\", means having a heightened sense of awareness of being grounded to the floor while, at the same time, feeling the energy throughout your entire body, extending it to the audience.[14] Her principal contributions to dance are the focus of the ‘center’ of the body (as contrast to ballet's emphasis on limbs), coordination between breathing and movement, and a dancer’s relationship with the floor.[13]"]}}}
