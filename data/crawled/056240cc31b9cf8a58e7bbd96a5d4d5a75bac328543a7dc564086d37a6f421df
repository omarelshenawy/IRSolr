Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life.[68] Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.[69]"]}}}
