Most state bestiality laws were enacted between 1999 and 2012.[74] Until 2005, there was a farm near Enumclaw, Washington that was described as an “animal brothel”, where people paid to have sex with animals. After an incident on 2 July 2005, when a man was pronounced dead in the emergency room of the Enumclaw community hospital after his colon ruptured due to having been sodomized by a horse, the farm garnered police attention. The state legislature of the State of Washington, which had been one of the few states in the United States without a law against bestiality, within six months passed a bill making bestiality illegal.[75][76] Arizona,[77] Alaska[78] and Florida now ban bestiality.[79] When such laws are proposed, they are never questioned or debated.[80][81] Laws which prohibit non-abusive bestiality have been criticized for being discriminatory, unjust and unconstitutional.[82][83]"],"after":["Pornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where bestiality itself is not explicitly outlawed.[citation needed]"]}}}
