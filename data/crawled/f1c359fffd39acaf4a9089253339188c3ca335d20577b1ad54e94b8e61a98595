In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get £100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an invitation to treat, mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a reasonable man Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, \"£1000 is deposited\". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the \"distinct inconvenience\" of using a faulty product. \"Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will\", said Lord Justice Lindley, \"here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable\".[162]"]}}}
