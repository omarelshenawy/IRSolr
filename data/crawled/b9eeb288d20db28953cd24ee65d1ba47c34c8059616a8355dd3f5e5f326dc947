A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment.[90] Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year. A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it.[91] New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit).[88] New Zealand is also a member of the United Nations,[92] the Commonwealth of Nations,[93] the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development[94] and the Five Power Defence Arrangements.[95]"],"after":["The New Zealand Defence Force has three branches: the Royal New Zealand Navy, the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force.[96] New Zealand's national defence needs are modest because of the unlikelihood of direct attack,[97] although it does have a global presence. The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete,[98] El Alamein[99] and Cassino.[100] The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand's national identity[101][102] and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia.[103] According to Mary Edmond-Paul, \"World War I had left scars on New Zealand society, with nearly 18,500 in total dying as a result of the war, more than 41,000 wounded, and others affected emotionally, out of an overseas fighting force of about 103,000 and a population of just over a million.\"[104] New Zealand also played key parts in the naval Battle of the River Plate[105] and the Battle of Britain air campaign.[106][107] During World War II, the United States had more than 400,000 American military personnel stationed in New Zealand.[108]"]}}}
