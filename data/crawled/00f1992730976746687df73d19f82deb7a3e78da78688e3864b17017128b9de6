Nonetheless, the Isle of Man Constabulary voluntarily submits to inspection by the British inspectorate of police,[40] and the Isle of Man Coastguard contracts Her Majesty's Coastguard (UK) for air-sea rescue operations."],"after":["Citizenship in the Isle of Man is governed by British law. Passports issued by the Isle of Man Passport Office say \"British Islands â€“ Isle of Man\" on the cover but the nationality status stated on the passport is simply \"British Citizen\". Although Manx passport holders are British citizens, because the Isle of Man is not part of the European Union, people born on the Island without a parent or grandparent either born or resident for more than five consecutive years in the United Kingdom do not have the same rights as other British citizens with regard to employment and establishment in the EU. Isle of Man passports can be issued to any British citizen in the Isle of Man (whether or not that person has \"Manx status\" as an Isle of Man worker under the local Isle of Man employment laws). They can also be issued to Manx-connected British citizens residing in Britain or either of the other Crown Dependencies."]}}}
