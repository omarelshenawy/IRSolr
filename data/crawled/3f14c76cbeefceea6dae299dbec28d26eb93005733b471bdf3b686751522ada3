As plants do not move, transmission between hosts often involves vectors, most commonly insects, but also fungi, nematodes and protozoa. Plant viruses can also spread via seeds, and by direct transfer of sap. Plant cells are surrounded by cell walls which are difficult to penetrate. Movement between cells occurs mainly by transport through plasmodesmata, and most plant viruses encode movement proteins to make this possible. Although plants lack an adaptive immune system, they have complex defences against viral infection. Plant viruses often cause disease, and are thought to cause up to US$60 billion losses to global crop yields each year."]}}}
