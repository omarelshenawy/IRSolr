It's an up-tempo dance track with a big name attached; what else could you ask for?\"[13] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine deemed it as \"arguably one of Britney's finest moments and one of her mentor's worst\".[14] Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine said that \"Madonna vamps it up (literally – her appearance here is not Sapphic but vampiric, the wizened old crone bleeding another period of forced longevity into her career like a cruenating corpse leaking plasma backwards) on 'Me Against The Music', but can't make it a bad tune.\"[15] Gavin Mueller, also writing for Stylus Magazine, said that the single \"benefits from a kinetic garage-inspired beat, even when a tepid Madonna threatens to spoil the fun.\"[10]"]}}}
