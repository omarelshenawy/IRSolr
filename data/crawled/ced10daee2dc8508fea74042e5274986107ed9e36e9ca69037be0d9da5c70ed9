The most famous traditional dance is a highly choreographed routine consisting of three components: the umushagiriro, or cow dance, performed by women;[197] the intore, or dance of heroes, performed by men;[197] and the drumming, also traditionally performed by men, on drums known as ingoma.[198] The best known dance group is the National Ballet. It was established by President Habyarimana in 1974, and performs nationally and internationally.[199] Traditionally, music is transmitted orally, with styles varying between the social groups. Drums are of great importance; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the King (Mwami).[200] Drummers play together in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number.[201] The country has a growing popular music industry, influenced by African Great Lakes, Congolese, and American music. The most popular genre is hip hop, with a blend of rap, ragga, R&B and dance-pop.[202]"]}}}
