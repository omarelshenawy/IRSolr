For example, the polynomial ring over a field k has dimension n. The fundamental theorem in the dimension theory states the following numbers coincide for a noetherian local ring :[4]"],"after":["A commutative ring R is said to be catenary if any pair of prime ideals can be extended to a chain of prime ideals of same finite length such that there is no prime ideal that is strictly contained in two consecutive terms. Practically all noetherian rings that appear in application are catenary. If is a catenary local integral domain, then, by definition,"]}}}
