The video-film short was directed by Romain Gavras and written by M.I.A., depicting genocide against red-haired adolescents being forced to run across a minefield and caused controversy due to its graphically violent content.[86][87] Although not an official single, the song charted in Sweden and the United Kingdom. M.I.A.'s third album, Maya — stylised as /\\/\\ /\\ Y /\\ — was released on 23 June 2010 in Japan with bonus tracks before its release in other countries.[88][89] Maya became M.I.A.'s highest charting album globally. Its release in the US was delayed by two weeks.[88] The album garnered a generally favourable, although divided, reception from critics.[65] A more internet-inspired album illustrating how a multimedia artist worked within the music industry, elements of industrial music were incorporated into M.I.A.'s sound for the first time.[90] She described the album in an interview with Dazed & Confused as a mix of \"babies, death, destruction and powerlessness\".[80][91][92][93]"]}}}
