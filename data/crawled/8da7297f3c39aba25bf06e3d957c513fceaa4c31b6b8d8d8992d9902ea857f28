For much of the 1930s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed.[44] Construction of the Harbour Bridge served to alleviate some of the effects of the economic downturn by employing 1,400 men between 1924 and 1932.[45] The population continued to boom despite the Depression and reached 1 million in 1925.[43]"],"after":["Australia entered World War II in 1939 and Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development to meet the needs of a wartime economy. Far from mass unemployment, there were now labour shortages and women becoming active in male roles. Sydney's harbour came under direct attack from Japanese submarines on 1 June 1942.[46] After the war the cultural and economic pillars of Sydney flourished. There were 1.7 million people living in the city by 1950 and almost 3 million by 1975. Sydney's iconic Opera House opened in 1973 and became a World Heritage Site in 2007.[47] The 2000 Summer Olympics were held in Sydney and became known as the \"best Olympic Games ever\" by the President of the International Olympic Committee.[48] A strong rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne that began in the 1850s still exists to this day. Sydney exceeded Melbourne's population in the early twentieth century and remains Australia's largest city.[7][49]"]}}}
