Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River.[12] The southern border is defined as the 36° 30′ parallel north, though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes.[13] The border with Tennessee was not settled until 1893, when their dispute was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court.[14]"]}}}
