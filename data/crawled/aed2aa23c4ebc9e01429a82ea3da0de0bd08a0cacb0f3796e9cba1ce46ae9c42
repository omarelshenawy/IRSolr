Though a number of lineup changes followed, two original members remain today along with James LaBrie, Jordan Rudess and Mike Mangini. Dream Theater has become one of the most successful progressive rock bands since the height of the genre in the mid-1970s. Although the band has had a few successful hits (notably 'Pull Me Under' in the early 1990s, which received extensive MTV rotation), they have mostly stayed underground for their career, feeding off support from their fans. The band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Read more"]}}}
