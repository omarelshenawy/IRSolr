This did not extend to CBS' groundbreaking show Cagney & Lacey in 1982, starring two female police detectives. CBS production made conscious attempts to soften the characters so they would not appear to be lesbians.[235] In 1991, a bisexual lawyer portrayed by Amanda Donohoe on L.A. Law shared the first significant lesbian kiss[note 18] on primetime television with Michele Greene, stirring a controversy despite being labeled \"chaste\" by The Hollywood Reporter.[236]"],"after":["Though television did not begin to use recurring homosexual characters until the late 1980s, some early situation comedies used a stock character that author Stephen Tropiano calls \"gay-straight\": supporting characters who were quirky, did not comply with gender norms, or had ambiguous personal lives, that \"for all purposes should be gay\". These included Zelda from The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, Miss Hathaway from The Beverly Hillbillies, and Jo from The Facts of Life.[238] In the mid-1980s through the 1990s, sitcoms frequently employed a \"coming out\" episode, where a friend of one of the stars admits she is a lesbian, forcing the cast to deal with the issue. Designing Women, The Golden Girls, and Friends used this device with women in particular.[239]"]}}}
