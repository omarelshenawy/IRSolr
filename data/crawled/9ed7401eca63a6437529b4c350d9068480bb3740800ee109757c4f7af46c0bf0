Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including a picture of the personality, or, especially as is the case with Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the bopomofo phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in katakana instead of kanji, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead."],"after":["One of the most complex characters found in modern Chinese dictionaries[g] is 齉 (U+9F49) (nàng,  listen (help·info), pictured below, middle image), meaning \"snuffle\" (that is, a pronunciation marred by a blocked nose), with \"just\" thirty-six strokes. However, this is not in common use. The most complex character that can be input using the Microsoft New Phonetic IME 2002a for traditional Chinese is 龘 (dá, \"the appearance of a dragon flying\"). It is composed of the dragon radical represented three times, for a total of 16 × 3 = 48 strokes. Among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in frequent modern use are 籲 (yù, \"to implore\"), with 32 strokes; 鬱 (yù, \"luxuriant, lush; gloomy\"), with 29 strokes, as in 憂鬱 (yōuyù, \"depressed\"); 豔 (yàn, \"colorful\"), with 28 strokes; and 釁 (xìn, \"quarrel\"), with 25 strokes, as in 挑釁 (tiǎoxìn, \"to pick a fight\"). Also in occasional modern use is 鱻 (xiān \"fresh\"; variant of 鮮 xiān) with 33 strokes."]}}}
