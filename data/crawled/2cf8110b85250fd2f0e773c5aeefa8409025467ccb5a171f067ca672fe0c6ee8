The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets.[181] Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012.[6] If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil and gas reserves if they were split geographically using a median line from the English-Scottish border.[citation needed] If the reserves were split by population, that figure would be reduced to 9%.[182] Scotland also has renewable energy potential, especially in tidal energy and offshore wind.[183]"],"after":["Whisky is probably the best known of Scotland's manufactured products. Exports increased by 87% in the decade to 2012[184] and were valued at £4.3 billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports.[185] It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly.[186] It may contribute £400-682 million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.[187] Tourism is also widely recognised as a key contributor to the Scottish economy. A briefing published in 2002 by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) for the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Life Long Learning Committee stated that tourism accounted for up to 5% of GDP and 7.5% of employment.[188]"]}}}
