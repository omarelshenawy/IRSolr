Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens.[25] In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.[26] Stable[27] and radioactive isotope[28] studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units."]}}}
