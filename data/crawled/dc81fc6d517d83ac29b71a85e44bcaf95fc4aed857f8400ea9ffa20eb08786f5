Some of the government troops began withdrawing from the valley. After about a third of the defenders had retreated, the final assault on the Royalist garrison came out of a heavy mist and hit the Royalist command post. Its communications with the defenders was cut; the rout was on.[82] The heavy weapons and scale of the PAVN attack could not be matched by the national army and it was effectively sidelined for several years.[83]"]}}}
