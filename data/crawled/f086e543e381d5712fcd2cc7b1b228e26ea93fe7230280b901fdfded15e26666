The album was preceded by the promotional singles \"Roman in Moscow\" and \"Stupid Hoe\".[66][67] Critics suggested that the latter song was directed at Lil' Kim, who said: \"If you have to make a song called 'Stupid Hoe,' you must be a stupid hoe.\"[68] Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform their single, \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", on the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012.[69] She was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering \"Roman Holiday\" during the 2012 ceremony on February 12.[70] Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake \"Pope\" to escort her on the red carpet. The \"exorcism\" scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well.[71][72] According to the Catholic League president Bill Donohue \"Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer.
