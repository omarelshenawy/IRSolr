The \"attack\" and \"decay\" of a sound have a great effect on the instrument's sonic character.[65] Sound synthesis techniques often employ an envelope generator that controls a sound's parameters at any point in its duration. Most often this is an \"ADSR\" (Attack Decay Sustain Release) envelope, which may be applied to overall amplitude control, filter frequency, etc. The envelope may be a discrete circuit or module, or implemented in software. The contour of an ADSR envelope is specified using four parameters:"]}}}
