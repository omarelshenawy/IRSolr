In a series of inter-clan conferences, culminating in the Boorama Conference in 1993, a qabil (clan or community) system of government was constructed.[citation needed] The constitution separates government into an executive branch, a legislative branch, and a judicial branch, each of which functions independently from the others.[45]"]}}}
