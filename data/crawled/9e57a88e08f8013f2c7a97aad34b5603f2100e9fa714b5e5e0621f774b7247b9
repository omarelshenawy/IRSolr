At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the Vietnam War both weakened America's influence in the Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe.[211] Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.[121]"],"after":["Following his China visit, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, including Brezhnev in Moscow.[212] These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers,[213] and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles.
