This came to be known as G-funk and dominated mainstream hip hop for several years through a roster of artists on Death Row Records, including Tupac Shakur, whose double disc album All Eyez on Me was a big hit with hit songs \"Ambitionz az a Ridah\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\",[citation needed] and Snoop Dogg, whose Doggystyle included the songs \"What's My Name?\" and \"Gin and Juice\", both top ten hits.[87] As the Los Angeles-based label Death Row Records built an empire around Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and the rapper-actor Tupac Shakur. It also entered into a rivalry with New York Cityâ€™s Bad Boy Records. (See the article on the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry.)"]}}}
