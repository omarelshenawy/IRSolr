According to theatre historian John Kenrick, Pinafore \"became an international sensation, reshaping the commercial theater in both England and the United States.\"[212] Music writer Andrew Lamb notes, \"The success of H.M.S. Pinafore in 1879 established British comic opera alongside French op√©ra bouffe throughout the English-speaking world\".[213] Historian John Bush Jones opines that Pinafore and the other Savoy operas demonstrate that musical theatre \"can address contemporary social and political issues without sacrificing entertainment value\" and that Pinafore created the model for a new kind of musical theatre, the \"integrated\" musical, where \"book, lyrics, and music combined to form an integral whole\".[214] He adds that its \"unprecedented ... popularity fostered an American audience for musical theatre, while the show itself became a model for form, content, and even intention of ... musicals ever since, especially socially relevant musicals.\"[215] Its popularity also led to the musical theatre adaptations of Pinafore described above, musicals in which the story line involves a production of Pinafore[216] and other musicals that parody the opera or that use or adapt its music.[217] The first such parody was a short-lived burlesque presented at the Opera Comique in 1882, called The Wreck of the Pinafore by H. Lingard and Luscombe Searelle; the opera's characters are shipwrecked on a desert island. It was described by The Era as \"chiefly remarkable for its impudence\".[218]"],"after":["Likewise, the opera's popularity has led to the widespread parody and pastiche of its songs in politics, literature and films, on television and in a variety of other media.[219] Many comedians have used Pinafore songs for comic and satiric effect. For example, in his comedy album My Son, the Celebrity, Allan Sherman parodies \"When I Was a Lad\" from the point of view of a young man who goes to an Ivy League school and then rises to prominence in business. At the end of the song, he \"thanks old Yale\", \"thanks the Lord\" and thanks his father, \"who is chairman of the board\".[220] Literary references to Pinafore songs include Harris's attempt to sing \"When I Was a Lad\" in Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat.[221] Another is found in the story \"Runaround\" from I, Robot by Isaac Asimov, where a robot sings part of \"I'm Called Little Buttercup\".[222] Pinafore and its songs have been performed by rock musicians such as Todd Rundgren, Taj Mahal and Michele Rundgren, who performed \"Never Mind the Why and Wherefore\" on Night Music (Sunday Night) in 1989.[223]"]}}}
