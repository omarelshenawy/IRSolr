These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth."],"after":["The geologic time scale encompasses the history of the Earth.[8] It is bracketed at the old end by the dates of the earliest Solar System material at 4.567 Ga,[9] (gigaannum: billion years ago) and the age of the Earth at 4.54 Ga[10][11] at the beginning of the informally recognized Hadean eon. At the young end of the scale, it is bracketed by the present day in the Holocene epoch."]}}}
