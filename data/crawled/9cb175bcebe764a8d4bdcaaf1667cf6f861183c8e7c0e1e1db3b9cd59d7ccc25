On March 3, 1875, the first organized indoor game was played at Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink between two nine-player teams, including James Creighton and several McGill University students. Instead of a ball or bung, the game featured a \"flat circular piece of wood\"[16] (to keep it in the rink and to protect spectators). The goal posts were 8 feet (2.4Â m) apart[16] (today's goals are six feet wide)."]}}}
