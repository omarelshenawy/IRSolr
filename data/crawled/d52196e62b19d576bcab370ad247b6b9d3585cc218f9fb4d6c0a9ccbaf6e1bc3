The climax of her risqu√© performance found her \"humping\" and rolling around on the stage. To this day, the performance is noted as one of the most iconic and biggest performances in MTV's history.[47][51] The song has also been included in six of Madonna's nine concert tours. For The Virgin Tour in 1985, Madonna again donned wedding attire and performed a straight version of the song featuring a quotation from Michael Jackson's similar-sounding Motown-style single, \"Billie Jean\". Balloons floated out towards the audience as she rolled around the stage, carrying a wedding bouquet in her hand.[47] The performance was included in the VHS release Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour recorded in Detroit, Michigan.[52] In the 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour, the song was given a lighthearted comedic theme and included quotations from The Four Tops' \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\". Madonna took off her outfit piece by piece, until she was standing in a black corset, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom.[53] Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987,[54] and Ciao Italia: Live from Italy, filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.[55]"]}}}
