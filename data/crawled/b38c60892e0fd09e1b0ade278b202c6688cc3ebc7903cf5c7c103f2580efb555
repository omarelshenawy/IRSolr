He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.[27] In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused.[29] Nikola suffered a nervous breakdown at around the same time.[28]"],"after":["On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit.
