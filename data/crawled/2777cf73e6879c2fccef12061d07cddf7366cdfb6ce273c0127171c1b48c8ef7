He obtained a patent for his invention from Colbert, but his clock remained imprecise at sea.[4]"],"after":["More attempts were made by Jeremy Thacker in England in 1714, and Henry Sully in France in 1716, who published his work in 1726 with Une Horloge inventée et executée par M. Sulli, but these inventions remained unable to resist the rolling of the high seas and keep time precisely enough.[5]"]}}}
