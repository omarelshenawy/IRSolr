The southern half was colonised in the same year by the United Kingdom as British New Guinea. In 1904 with the passage of the Papua Act, 1905, it transferred this territory to the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia, which took on its administration. Additionally, from 1905, British New Guinea was renamed the Territory of Papua."],"after":["During World War I, German New Guinea was occupied by Australia, which after the war was given a League of Nations Mandate to administer it. Papua, by contrast, was deemed to be an External Territory of the Australian Commonwealth, though as a matter of law it remained a British possession. This was significant for the country's post-independence legal system. The difference in legal status meant that up, until 1949, Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia."]}}}
