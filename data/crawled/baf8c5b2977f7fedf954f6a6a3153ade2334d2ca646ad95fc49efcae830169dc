Various editing tools let you do this; for example, see this list of tools. To do it manually, copy the URL of the rollback link, paste it into your browser's address bar, and append &summary= followed by your desired summary to the end of the URL."],"after":["The patrolling tool Twinkle adds links in similar places to the \"rollback\" links, and also calls them \"rollback\". Anyone using both will see both types of \"rollback\" link, which can be a little confusing. Unlike rollback, Twinkle may be used by any autoconfirmed user. Other than this, the links are functionally the same, but differ in their choice of edit summaries. Twinkle also offers additional options."]}}}
