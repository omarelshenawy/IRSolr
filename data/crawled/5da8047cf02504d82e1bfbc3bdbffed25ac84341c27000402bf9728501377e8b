Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.[178] The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and 2Â Kings 22:14."]}}}
