However, the European stock of American catfishes has not achieved the dimensions of these fish in their native waters, and have only increased the ecological pressure on native European fauna. Walking catfish have also been introduced in the freshwaters of Florida, with the voracious catfish becoming a major alien pest there. Flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris, is also a North American pest on Atlantic slope drainages.[5] Pterygoplichthys species, released by aquarium fishkeepers, have also established feral populations in many warm waters around the world.[13][14][15][16][17]"]}}}
