All institutions, private and public, must be registered with the Ministry of Education.[184] English is the language of instruction in all public schools,[185] and all subjects are taught and examined in English except for the \"mother tongue\" language paper.[186] While the term \"mother tongue\" in general refers to the first language internationally, in Singapore's education system, it is used to refer to the second language, as English is the first language.[187][188] Students who have been abroad for a while, or who struggle with their \"Mother Tongue\" language, are allowed to take a simpler syllabus or drop the subject.[189][190]"]}}}
