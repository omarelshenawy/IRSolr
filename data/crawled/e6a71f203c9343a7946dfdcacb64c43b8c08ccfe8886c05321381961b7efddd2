A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis.[14] The municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue, which linked City Hill in Civic Centre and Market Centre. Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the Parliamentary Triangle, and was to form the centrepiece of Griffin's work.[14]"],"after":["Later, Scrivener, as part of a government design committee, was responsible for modifying Griffin's winning design.[4][15][16] He recommended changing the shape of the lake from Griffin's very geometric shapes to a much more organic one using a single dam, unlike Griffin's series of weirs.[4][17] Griffin lobbied for the retention of the pure geometry, saying that they were \"one of the reasons d'etre of the ornamental waters\", but he was overruled.[18] The new design included elements from several of the best design submissions and was widely criticised as being ugly. The new plan for the lake retained Griffin's three formal basins: east, central, and west, though in a more relaxed form.[2][17]"]}}}
