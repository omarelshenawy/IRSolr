It refers to the Columbia District, the British name for the territory drained by the Columbia River, which has its origins and upper reaches in southeastern British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-Oregon Treaty Columbia Department of the Hudson's Bay Company. Queen Victoria chose British Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from that of the United States (\"American Columbia\" or \"Southern Columbia\"), which became the Oregon Territory in 1848 as a result of the treaty."],"after":[]}}}
