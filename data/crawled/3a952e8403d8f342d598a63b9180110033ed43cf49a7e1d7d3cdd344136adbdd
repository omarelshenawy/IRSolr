She was the younger of two daughters (her sister Elisabeth was a year older) of Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine (née Felsing) and Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who married in December 1898. Dietrich's mother was from a well-to-do Berlin family who owned a clockmaking firm, and her father was a police lieutenant who died in 1907.[5] His best friend Eduard von Losch, an aristocratic first lieutenant in the Grenadiers, courted Wilhelmina and married her in 1916, but he died soon afterward from injuries sustained during World War I.[6] Eduard von Losch never officially adopted the Dietrich girls, so Dietrich's surname was never von Losch, as has sometimes been claimed.[citation needed] Her family nicknamed her \"Lena\" and \"Lene\" (pronounced Lay-neh). Around age 11, she contracted her two first names to form the name \"Marlene\"."]}}}
