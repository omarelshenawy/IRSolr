Nevertheless, Saterland Frisian and most dialects of North Frisian are seriously endangered.[7]","The new ISO 639 code stq is used for the Saterland Frisian language, a variety of Eastern Frisian (not to be confused with East Frisian Low Saxon, a West Low German dialect).

At that time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast.
