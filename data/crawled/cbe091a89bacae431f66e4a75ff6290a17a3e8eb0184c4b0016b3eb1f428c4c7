Hamilton didn't want to use Mardi Gras, as Thunderball featured Junkanoo, a similar festival, so after more discussions with the writer and further scouting, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the jazz funerals and the canals.[112] While searching for locations in Jamaica, the crew discovered a crocodile farm owned by Ross Kananga, after passing a sign warning that \"trespassers will be eaten\". The farm was put into the script and also inspired Mankiewicz to name the film's villain after Kananga.[112] With the rise of the popularity of Blaxploitation films in the early 1970s, it was decided to borrow elements of the genre for Live and Let Die.[113]"],"after":["Syd Cain returned as art director and was involved searching for locations with Guy Hamilton in March 1972.[114] Principal photography began on 13 October 1972 in the Irish Bayou in Louisiana for a boat chase scene.[115] On 29 November production moved to Jamaica, which doubled for the fictional island San Monique, the home of antagonist Kananga. In December, production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios, while a separate unit also shot in Harlem.[116]"]}}}
