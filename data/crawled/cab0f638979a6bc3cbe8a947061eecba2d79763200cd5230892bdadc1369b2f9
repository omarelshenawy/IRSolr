She dedicated the song to the memory of her friend, artist Michael Burgoyne.[1] Madonna has since performed the song on three of her world tours. In 1987, during the Who's That Girl World Tour, she performed the song standing motionless in a single spotlight,[45] wearing a black ensemble with tassels, golden tips and ribbing, designed by Marlene Stewart.[46] Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987,[47] and Ciao Italia: Live from Italy, filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.[48]"]}}}
