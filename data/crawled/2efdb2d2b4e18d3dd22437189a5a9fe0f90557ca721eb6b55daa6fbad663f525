According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \"for substantial theses in science and morals\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism.[79]"]}}}
