However, initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to Poland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French probe into the Saarland.[61] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[62] Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which was to later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic."]}}}
