By the late 1990s, the birth rate had fallen so low that Lee's successor Goh Chok Tong extended these incentives to all married women, and gave even more incentives, such as the 'baby bonus' scheme.[41] Lee reaffirmed his controversial position in his personal memoir, From Third World to First, \"many well-educated Singaporean women did not marry and have children.\"[4]"]}}}
