Rolling Stone described the dance-pop song as a \"pure disco\" moment, adding that the track doesn't need \"emotional resonance\" to make it race.[8] When reviewing Madonna's compilation album GHV2 in 2001, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said the song was \"both a product of its time and a timeless Madonna classic in the 'Vogue' vein.\" He goes on to say, \"The track even invokes that famous chart-topper's invitation to the dancefloor: 'Let your body move to the music!' One of the few tracks from 'Erotica' not weighed down or muddled by Pettibone's gritty production, 'Deeper and Deeper' sounds just as good today as it did nearly a decade ago.\"[9] In 2011, Slant Magazine listed \"Deeper and Deeper\" at number 36 on their \"Best Singles of the '90s\" list, referring to the pop anthem as among Madonna's \"finest achievements\" and describing it as \"both an acute distillation of Erotica's smut-glam decadence and the singer's lifelong blond ambition.\"[10] Entertainment Weekly said that the song \"whooshes like a subway train going express at 4 a.m.\"[11] Billboard Magazine called the song a \"playful disco-throwback\" and also added that it was a \"potential hit single\" from the Erotica album.[12] Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters.com also gave the song a positive review, stating that the song is \"at heart, a great pop song about the importance of listening to Mom and Dad's advice.\"[13] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote in All Music Guide to Rock that \"Deeper and Deeper\" (along with Rain) is some of Madonna's \"best and most accomplished music.\"[14]"]}}}
