Also known for his work in high-altitude flying, Post helped develop one of the first pressure suits. His plywood aircraft, the Winnie Mae, is on display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar Hazy Center adjacent to Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, VA, and his pressure suit is being prepared for display at the same location. On August 15, 1935, Post and American humorist Will Rogers were killed when Post's plane crashed on takeoff from a lagoon near Point Barrow, in Alaska."]}}}
