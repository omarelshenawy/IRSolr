On 1 October 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China.[78] In 1950, the People's Liberation Army succeeded in capturing Hainan from the ROC[79] and occupying Tibet.[80] However, remaining Nationalist forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[81]"]}}}
