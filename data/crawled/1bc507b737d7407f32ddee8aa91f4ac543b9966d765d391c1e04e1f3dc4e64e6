Their fluctuations somewhat mirror Precambrian supercontinent cycles.[4] The Uâ€“Pb zircon dates from orogenic granites are of the most reliable aging determinants. There are some issues with relying on granite sourced zircons, such as a lack of evenly globally sourced data and the loss of granite zircons by sedimentary coverage or plutonic consumption. Where granite zircons fall short, detrital zircons from sandstones appear and make up for the gaps. These detrital zircons are taken from the sands of major modern rivers and their drainage basins.[4] Oceanic magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic data are the primary resources used for reconstructing continent and supercontinent locations back to roughly 150 Ma.[5]"]}}}
