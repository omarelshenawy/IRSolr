God is described in chapter 112 of the Qur'an as:[27] \"Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\"(112:1-4) Muslims and Jews repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism. In Islam, God is beyond all comprehension and Muslims are not expected to visualize God.[28][29][30][31] God is described and referred to by certain names or attributes, the most common being Al-Rahmān, meaning \"The Compassionate\" and Al-Rahīm, meaning \"The Merciful\" (See Names of God in Islam).[32]"]}}}
