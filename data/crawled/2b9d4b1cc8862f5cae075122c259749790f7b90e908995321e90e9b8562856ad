Most, if not all, of the larger theatres are subsidised by local authorities or the North West Regional Arts Board.[262] The Royal Exchange Theatre formed in the 1970s out of a peripatetic group staging plays at venues such as at the University [of Manchester] Theatre and the Apollo Theatre. A season in a temporary stage in the former Royal Exchange, Manchester was followed by funding for a theatre in the round, which opened in 1976.[263] The Lowry — Greater Manchester's most visited tourist attraction[261] — houses two theatres, used by travelling groups in all the performing arts.[221][264] The Opera House is a 1,900-seat venue hosting travelling productions, often musicals just out of the West End.[265] Its sister venue, The Palace, hosts generally similar shows. The Oldham Playhouse, one of the older theatres in the region, helped launch the careers of Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin. Its productions are described by the 2007 CityLife guide as 'staunchly populist' – and popular.[265] There are many other venues scattered throughout the county, of all types and sizes.[265]"]}}}
