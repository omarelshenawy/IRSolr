The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40 GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for HDMI and component video, and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p.[201] On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model.[202] A software update released on January 15, 2008 allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.[203]"]}}}
