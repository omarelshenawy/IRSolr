Worldwide, some observers believe a reasonable estimate of Scientology's core practicing membership ranges between 100,000 and 200,000, mostly in the U.S., Europe, South Africa and Australia.[101] In 2008, the American Religious Identification Survey found that the number of American Scientologists had dropped to 25,000.[102]"]}}}
