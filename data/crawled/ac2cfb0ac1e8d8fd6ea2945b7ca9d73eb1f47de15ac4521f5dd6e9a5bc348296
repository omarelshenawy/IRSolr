Joule's first law, also known as the Joule effect, is a physical law expressing the relationship between the heat generated by the current flowing through a conductor. The heating effect of conductors carrying currents is known as Joule heating, named for James Prescott Joule. It is expressed as:"],"after":["Where Q is the heat generated by a constant current I flowing through a conductor of electrical resistance R, for a time t."]}}}
