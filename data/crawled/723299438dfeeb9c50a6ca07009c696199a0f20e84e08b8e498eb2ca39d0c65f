Indeed, Sir Toby in Twelfth Night is seen saying, in reference to Sir Andrew's hair, that \"it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off;\" the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet says that her husband had told Juliet when she was learning to walk that \"Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\", or is told the time by Mercutio: \"for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon\"; and in Hamlet, Hamlet torments Ophelia with a series of sexual puns, viz. \"country\" (similar to \"cunt\")."]}}}
