English coinage was also superior to most of the other currency in use in northwestern Europe, and the ability to mint coins was a royal monopoly.[111] The English kings had also developed the system of issuing writs to their officials, in addition to the normal medieval practice of issuing charters.[112] Writs were either instructions to an official or group of officials, or notifications of royal actions such as appointments to office or a grant of some sort.[113]"]}}}
