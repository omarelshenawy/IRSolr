The Commune was regarded with admiration and awe by later Communist and leftist leaders. Vladimir Lenin wrote: \"We are only dwarves perched on the shoulders of those giants.\" He celebrated by dancing in the snow in Moscow on the day that his Bolshevik government was more than two months old, surpassing the Commune. The ministers and officials of the Bolshevik government were given the title \"Commissar\" borrowed directly from the \"Commissaires\" of the Commune. Lenin's tomb in Moscow was (and still is) decorated with red banners from the Commune, brought to Moscow for his funeral by French communists.[111] Stalin wrote: \"In 1917 we thought that we would form a commune, an association of workers, and that we would put an end to bureaucracy...That is a goal that we are still far from reaching.\"[111] The Bolsheviks renamed their dreadnought battleship Sevastopol to Parizhskaya Kommuna. In the later years of the Soviet Union, the spaceflight Voskhod 1 carried part of a Communard banner."]}}}
