In addition to being an important essayist and poet, Tanpınar wrote a number of novels—such as Huzur (\"A Mind at Peace\", 1949) and Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü (\"The Time Regulation Institute\", 1961)—which dramatize the clash between East and West in modern Turkish culture and society. Similar problems are explored by the novelist and short-story writer Oğuz Atay (1934–1977). Unlike Tanpınar, however, Atay—in such works as his long novel Tutunamayanlar (\"The Good for Nothing\", 1971–1972) and his short story \"Beyaz Mantolu Adam\" (\"Man in a White Coat\", 1975)—wrote in a more modernist and existentialist vein. On the other hand, Onat Kutlar's İshak (\"Isaac\", 1959), composed of nine short stories which are written mainly from a child's point of view and are often surrealistic and mystical, represent a very early example of magic realism."],"after":["The tradition of literary modernism also informs the work of female novelist Adalet Ağaoğlu (1929– ). Her trilogy of novels collectively entitled Dar Zamanlar (\"Tight Times\", 1973–1987), for instance, examines the changes that occurred in Turkish society between the 1930s and the 1980s in a formally and technically innovative style. Orhan Pamuk (1952– ), winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, is another such innovative novelist, though his works—such as 1990's Beyaz Kale (\"The White Castle\") and Kara Kitap (\"The Black Book\") and 1998's Benim Adım Kırmızı (\"My Name is Red\")—are influenced more by postmodernism than by modernism. This is true also of Latife Tekin (1957– ), whose first novel Sevgili Arsız Ölüm (\"Dear Shameless Death\", 1983) shows the influence not only of postmodernism, but also of magic realism."]}}}
