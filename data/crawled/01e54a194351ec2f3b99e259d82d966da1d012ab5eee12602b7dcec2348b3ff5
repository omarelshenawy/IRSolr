Although we seemed to have little in common—I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian—we spent most of our time together... We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world.\"[22]:p.62 Buñuel's relationship with Dalí was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dalí and Lorca and resentment over Dalí's early success as an artist.[18]:p.300"],"after":["Starting when he was 17, he steadily dated the future poet and dramatist Concha Mendez, with whom he vacationed every summer at San Sebastián, introducing her as his fiancée to his friends at the Residencia.[23][24] After five years, she broke off the relationship, citing Buñuel's \"insufferable character\".[25]"]}}}
