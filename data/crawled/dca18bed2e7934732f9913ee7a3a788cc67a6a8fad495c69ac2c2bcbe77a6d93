In his will he adopted his nephew, which entitled the latter to inherit the entire estate. The adoption is called a \"testamental adoption\" by writers on the topic, who assert that it applied to the name change only, but Roman jurisprudence recognizes no such category. Pliny the Younger was thus the adopted son of Pliny the Elder, but not in Pliny the Elder's lifetime.[11] For at least some of the time, however, Pliny the Elder resided under the same roof with his sister and nephew (whose husband and father died young): they were living there when Pliny decided to investigate the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and was sidetracked by the need for rescue operations and a messenger from his friend asking for assistance."],"after":["Pliny's father took him to Rome to be educated in lawmaking. Pliny relates that he saw Marcus Servilius Nonianus."]}}}
