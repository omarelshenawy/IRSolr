It is bordered by parkland to the east and Darling Harbour to the west. Suburbs surrounding the CBD include Woolloomooloo and Potts Point to the east, Surry Hills and Darlinghurst to the south, Pyrmont and Ultimo to the west, and Millers Point and The Rocks to the north. Most of these suburbs measure less than 1 square kilometre (0.4 square miles) in area. Several localities, distinct from suburbs, exist throughout Sydney's inner reaches. Central and Circular Quay are transport hubs with ferry, rail, and bus interchanges. Chinatown, Darling Harbour, and Kings Cross are important locations for culture, tourism, and recreation."],"after":["There is a long trend of gentrification amongst Sydney's inner suburbs. Pyrmont was converted from an industrial centre in decay in the 1990s to a sustainable residential area in the 2000s.[80] Once a slum and red-light district known for criminal activity and illicit drugs, Darlinghurst has undergone significant redevelopment since the 1980s.[81][82][83] Green Square is now experiencing urban renewal worth $8 billion, whilst Barangaroo's old shipping wharves are being transformed into a $6 billion commercial and residential development.[84][85] The suburb of Paddington lies in close proximity to the CBD and is famous for its restored terrace houses, cultural and sporting facilities, and Oxford Street markets.[86] Despite its location, Surry Hills has maintained a light industrial economy in addition to residential and commercial zones. Woolloomooloo's once working class docklands are now a desirable residential area servicing the nearby Royal Australian Navy base."]}}}
