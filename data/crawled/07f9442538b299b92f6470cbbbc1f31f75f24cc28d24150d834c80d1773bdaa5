Interstate and U.S. Routes are assigned internal State Route numbers to allow this relationship to happen. For example, State Route 531 is considered an axillary route of Interstate 5. Some former U.S. Routes, such as U.S. Route 99 have been converted to state highways after they were decommissioned at the federal level, retaining the same number."]}}}
