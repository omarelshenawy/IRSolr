This period featured several prominent rulers such as: Stephen the Great, Vasile Lupu, Alexander the Good and Dimitrie Cantemir in Moldavia; Vlad the Impaler, Mircea the Elder, Matei Basarab, Neagoe Basarab and Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu in Wallachia; and Gabriel Bethlen in the Principality of Transylvania, and eventually John Hunyadi and Matthias Corvinus in Transylvania (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary).[56][57] In 1600, the three principalities were ruled simultaneously by the Wallachian prince Michael the Brave (Mihai Viteazul), which was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern Romania and became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalyst for achieving a single Romanian state.[58]"],"after":["Romania remained neutral for the first two years of World War I. Following the secret Treaty of Bucharest, according to which Romania would acquire territories with a majority of Romanian population from Austria-Hungary, it joined the Entente Powers and declared war on 27 August 1916.[72] The Romanian military campaign began disastrously for Romania as the Central Powers occupied two-thirds of the country within months, before reaching a stalemate in 1917. Total military and civilian losses from 1916 to 1918, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.[73] After the war, the transfer of Bukovina from Austria was acknowledged by the 1919 Treaty of Saint Germain,[74] of Banat and Transylvania from Hungary by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon,[75] and of Bessarabia from Russian rule by the 1920 Treaty of Paris.[76]"]}}}
