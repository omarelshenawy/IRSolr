They brought Vedic, Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States. Western orientalist searched for the \"essence\" of the Indian religions, discerning this in the Vedas,[328] and meanwhile creating the notion of \"Hinduism\" as a unified body of religious praxis[329] and the popular picture of 'mystical India'.[329][327] This idea of a Vedic essence was taken over by Hindu reform movements as the Brahmo Samaj, which was supported for a while by the Unitarian Church,[330] together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism, the idea that all religions share a common mystic ground.[331] This \"Hindu modernism\", with proponents like Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan, became central in the popular understanding of Hinduism.[332][333][334][335][51]"]}}}
