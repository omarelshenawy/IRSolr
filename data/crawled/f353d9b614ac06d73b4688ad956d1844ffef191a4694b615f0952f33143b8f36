The first was a Spanish version of the song titled Lo Que Siente la Mujer, especially recorded for inclusion on the single as its B-side[15] and eventually released as a promo-only single in Europe. Later it was added to the two-disc Tour Edition of Music[16] and the Bonus Track edition of the album in some territories.[17][18] The second was a trance version created by Above & Beyond, which was also dubbed as the single's version as well as being featured in its music video and the song's CD single. The CD single also features a remix produced by British DJ Paul Oakenfold, which transformed the song into \"a massive, deep arena club stomper,\" as noted by Allmusic's Jose F. Promis.[10]"]}}}
