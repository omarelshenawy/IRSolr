The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough.[23] Burgesses were free men who lived in the town.[24] The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.[25]"]}}}
