After beginning his professional career with Ajax, he played for Milan, Juventus, Barcelona, Internazionale, and Tottenham Hotspur, before returning to Ajax. He returned to competitive football during a brief spell with Crystal Palace. Davids suffers from glaucoma, which requires him to wear protective goggles during football matches. His dreadlocked hair and his protective eye wear make Davids one of the most recognisable footballers of his generation. Davids was one of the players chosen by Pel√© to be featured in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living footballers."]}}}
