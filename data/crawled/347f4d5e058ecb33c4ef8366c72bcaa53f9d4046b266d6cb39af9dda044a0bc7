Let ζ be a root of the polynomial ; in order to prove the inequality |ζ| ≤ Rp we can assume, of course, |ζ| > 1. Writing the equation as , and using the Hölder's inequality we find . Now, if p = 1, this is , thus . In the case 1 < p ≤ ∞, taking into account the summation formula for a geometric progression, we have"]}}}
