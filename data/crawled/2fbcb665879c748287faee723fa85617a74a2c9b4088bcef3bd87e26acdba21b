Creators.com called the routine \"brilliantly imaginative.\"[141] Pioneer Local called it \"powerful... It's been so long since [Tabitha and Napoleon] have had a showstopping hip-hop number on SYTYCD. Not since Season 4 when they had Katee, Joshua, tWitch, Mark and Chelsie have they pulled out hip-hop this good.\"[142] The routine was performed by ballet dancer Alex Wong and \"All-Star\" hip-hop dancer Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss from season four. The concept is about a psychologist (tWitch) who teaches a dancer (Alex) to let go of his technique and inhibitions and just dance. After the performance, tWitch and Alex received a standing ovation from the crowd and all three judgesâ€”Nigel Lythgoe, Mia Michaels, and Adam Shankman. Host Cat Deeley commented \"I have never, never, in 'So You Think You Can Dance' history, heard a roar from a crowd like this - ever.\"[143] Lythgoe called the concept \"brilliant... This is about a ballet dancer doing the most incredible hip-hop... If this routine and you are not up for an Emmy with Napoleon and Tabitha next year, I don't know why not. It's probably one of the funnest, best hip-hop routines we've ever had on this show.\"[144] In slight disagreement, the Wall Street Journal noted that \"Outta Your Mind\" may in fact be nominated for an Emmy, but it is unlikely to win because past winners have all been lyrical, very emotional routines.[145]"],"after":["On a later episode, Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed a lyrical hip-hop routine to Alicia Keys debut single \"Fallin'.\" Of the dance, judge Mia Michaels stated \"That to me felt more real than any contemporary piece, honestly, because it came from such a raw raw space and place. That was absolutely unbelievable, and it was like watching a dance film.\"[146] Lythgoe stated that the dance reminded him of \"Bleeding Love\" and \"No Air\" from season four and added \"Somehow Napoleon and Tabitha have this ability... to put emotion into hip-hop routines and it really is a real talent.\"[146]"]}}}
