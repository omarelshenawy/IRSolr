He left all his belongings to his adopted son Alessandro. \"Belonging to that first period are his pamphlets on Solidi spherali, Contatti and the major part of the propositions and sundry problems which were gathered together by Viviani after Torricelli's death. This early work owes much to the study of the classics.\"[2] In Faenza, a statue of Torricelli was created in 1868 as a thank you for all that Torricelli had done in advancing science during his short lifetime.[3] The asteroid 7437 Torricelli and a crater on the Moon were named in his honor."]}}}
