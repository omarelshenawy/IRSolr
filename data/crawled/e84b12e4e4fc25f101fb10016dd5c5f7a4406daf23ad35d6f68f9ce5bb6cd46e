A literal translation would be \"to describe or write about the Earth\". The first person to use the word \"geography\" was Eratosthenes (276–194 BC). Four historical traditions in geographical research are the spatial analysis of the natural and the human phenomena (geography as the study of distribution), the area studies (places and regions), the study of the human-land relationship, and research in the Earth sciences. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called \"the world discipline\" and \"the bridge between the human and the physical science\". Geography is divided into two main branches: human geography and physical geography."]}}}
