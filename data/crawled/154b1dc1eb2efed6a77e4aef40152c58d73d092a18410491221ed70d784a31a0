Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0 million years BC),[16] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4 million years BC)[17] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9 million–600,000 years BC) have been discovered.[2]"]}}}
