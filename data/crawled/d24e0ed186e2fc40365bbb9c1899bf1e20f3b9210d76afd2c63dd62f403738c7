The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company bought it in 1895, having been set up specifically to remove canals from railway influence. The navigation was the subject of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the waterways. In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard, but the hoped-for increase in commercial traffic did not occur."]}}}
