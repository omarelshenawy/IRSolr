The country instead had an extended period of Iron Age architecture.[135] The Irish round tower originated during the Early Medieval period."],"after":["Christianity introduced simple monastic houses, such as Clonmacnoise, Skellig Michael and Scattery Island. A stylistic similarity has been remarked between these double monasteries and those of the Copts of Egypt.[136] Gaelic kings and aristocrats occupied ringforts or crannógs.[137] Church reforms during the 12th century via the Cistercians stimulated continental influence, with the Romanesque styled Mellifont, Boyle and Tintern abbeys.[138] Gaelic settlement had been limited to the Monastic proto-towns, such as Kells, where the current street pattern preserves the original circular settlement outline to some extent.[139] Significant urban settlements only developed following the period of Viking invasions.[137] The major Hiberno-Norse Longphorts were located on the coast, but with minor inland fluvial settlements, such as the eponymous Longford."]}}}
