People who were gregarious party animals were described as \"ravers\". Pop musicians such as Steve Marriott of The Small Faces and Keith Moon of The Who were self-described \"ravers\"."],"after":["Presaging the word's subsequent 1980s association with electronic music, the word \"rave\" was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelia bands (most notably The Yardbirds, who released an album in the US called Having a Rave Up). Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general, the \"rave-up\" referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster, heavier and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback. It was later part of the title of an electronic music performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London's Roundhouse titled the \"Million Volt Light and Sound Rave\". The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by Paul McCartney of The Beatles â€“ the legendary Carnival of Light recording.[3]"]}}}
