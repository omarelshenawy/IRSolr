With his opera Rinaldo, based on La Gerusalemme Liberata by the Italian poet Torquato Tasso, Handel enjoyed great success, although it was composed quickly, with many borrowings from his older Italian works.[22] This work contains one of Handel's favourite arias, Cara sposa, amante cara, and the famous Lascia ch'io pianga."]}}}
