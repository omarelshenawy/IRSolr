Rebellion, Lessig participated in an impromptu Harlem Shake that the group of walkers created while sidelined during an ice storm."],"after":["In computer science, \"code\" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the source code). In law, \"code\" can refer to the texts that constitute statutory law. In his 1999 book Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for social control, leading to his dictum that \"Code is law.\" Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as Code: Version 2.0 in December 2006."]}}}
