This allowed many North Vietnamese pilots to claim \"ace\" status. American air-to-air combat during the Vietnam War generally matched intruding United States fighter-bombers against radar-directed integrated North Vietnamese air defense systems. American McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, Vought F-8 Crusader and Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter crews usually had to contend with surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and machine gun fire before opposing fighters attacked them.[citation needed] The long-running conflict produced 22 aces: 17 North Vietnamese pilots, two American pilots, three American Weapons Systems Officers or WSOs.[17]"],"after":[]}}}
