The country is governed on the basis of multi-party democratic system and of the segregation of the legislative, executive and judicial powers. It is a semi-presidential republic where executive functions are held by both government and the president.[146] The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister, who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) whose members are elected every four years by simple plurality.[147][148]"]}}}
