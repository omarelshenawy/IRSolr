The death knell had rung upon the American Equal Rights Association.[7]"],"after":["Unlike the American Association who held their conventions in various cities across the country, the National Association held its annual conventions in Washington D.C. with its efforts concentrated on the federal government.[6] Although focused on national reform, the National established its headquarters in New York City, seeking to mobilize support among wage-earning women. The National Association was centralized and unitary in structure, as opposed to the more stringent delegate system of the American Association. Feeling slighted by the apostasy of men under the American Equal Rights Association, the National Association granted full membership rights for women only.[4] Men could affiliate with the organization, however, women solely controlled its leadership.[5] By the same token, Stanton and Anthony were willing to work with anyone, despite their view on other matters, as long as they wholeheartedly championed woman rights and suffrage. As a result, the National Association was often perceived as radical, unorthodox and aggressive.[2] Such drastic measures included using racist appeals to win allies among Democrats.[4] The National, however, often condemned both those Republicans and Democrats who ignored the suffrage question.[2]"]}}}
