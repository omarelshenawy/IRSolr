Large data warehouses are often described as clinical data warehouses (also known as clinical data repositories). In research, deidentified CDWs can be used by researchers with less complex ethical oversight. CDWs with data of deceased patients were also suggested as a research resource that does not require IRB approval.[15][16]"]}}}
