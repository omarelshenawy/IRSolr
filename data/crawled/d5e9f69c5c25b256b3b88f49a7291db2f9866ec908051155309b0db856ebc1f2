Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.[157] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.[158]"]}}}
