She entered the stage amidst billows of dry ice, dressed in a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, jeans with zips and bondage straps, a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt and performed the song standing on a rising platform on the middle of the stage.[15][16] Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH gave the performance a positive review, saying it was sung beautifully.[17] Also during this same tour, the last lyrics from the song (\"Now, I find I changed my mind/This is my religion\") were used at the end of the performance of \"Ray of Light\".[18]"]}}}
