He might have visited the mine excavated at Las Medulas."],"after":["The last position of procurator, an uncertain one, was of Gallia Belgica, based on Pliny's familiarity with it. The capital of the province was Augusta Treverorum (Trier), named for the Treveri surrounding it. Pliny says that in \"the year but one before this\" a severe winter killed the first crops planted by the Treviri; they sowed again in March and had \"a most abundant harvest.\"[36] The problem is to identify \"this\", the year in which the passage was written. Using 77 as the date of composition Syme[37] arrives at AD 74-75 as the date of the procuratorship, when Pliny is presumed to have witnessed these events. The argument is based entirely on presumptions; nevertheless, this date is required to achieve Suetonius' continuity of procuratorships, if there was one in Gallia Belgica."]}}}
