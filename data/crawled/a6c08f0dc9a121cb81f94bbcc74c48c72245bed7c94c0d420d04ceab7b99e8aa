For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin.[55] Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have been shown to be highly effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common.[56][57] Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.[58]"],"after":[]}}}
