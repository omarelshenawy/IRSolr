In particular, conversion of the region's populations to Islam appears to have introduced major rearrangements in populations' relations through admixture with culturally similar but geographically remote populations leading to genetic similarities between remarkably distant populations.\" The authors also reconstructed the genetic structure of pre-Islamic Levant and found that \"it was more genetically similar to Europeans than to Middle Easterners.\"[129]"],"after":[]}}}
