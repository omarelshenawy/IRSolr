Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy.[77] Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant.[76] Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.[76]"]}}}
