In his presidential address of 29 December 1930, Allama Iqbal called for \"the amalgamation of North-West Muslim-majority Indian states\" consisting of Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan.[65] Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, greatly espoused the two-nation theory and led the Muslim League to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940, popularly known as the Pakistan Resolution.[52] Events leading to the World War II, Jinnah and British educated founding fathers in the Muslim League supported the United Kingdom's war efforts, countering opposition against it whilst worked towards Sir Syed's vision.[66]"]}}}
