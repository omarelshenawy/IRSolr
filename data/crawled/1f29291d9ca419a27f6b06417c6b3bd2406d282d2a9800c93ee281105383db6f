There is clear evidence for a knowledge of Arthur and Arthurian tales on the Continent before Geoffrey's work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt),[72] as well as for the use of \"Celtic\" names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia in the Arthurian romances.[73] From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, Percival, Galahad, Gawain, and Tristan and Iseult. Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey's Historia itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined.[74] His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns,[75] whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fainéant, the \"do-nothing king\", whose \"inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society\".[76] Arthur's role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu, whilst in Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap.[77] Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, \"his prestige is never—or almost never—compromised by his personal weaknesses ... his authority and glory remain intact.\"[78]"]}}}
