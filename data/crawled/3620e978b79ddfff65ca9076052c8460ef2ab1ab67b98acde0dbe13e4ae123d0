And he vows to continue editing Scientology articles from Scientology computers.\"[35] The Register quoted the \"COFS\" user as saying, \"I am not going to leave voluntarily and I will continue to use a) my own computer, b) public computers, c) my wireless laptop, d) computers in the Church of Scientology and any station I please\".[35] The Guardian cited The Register, and noted, \"The technology news website The Register alleges the church has an organised operation to challenge internet criticism.\"[40]"]}}}
