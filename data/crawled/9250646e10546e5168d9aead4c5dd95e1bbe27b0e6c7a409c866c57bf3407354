However, he grew up in Stockton on Tees. Brendan Foster[85] and Sid Waddell[86] have both worked as television sports commentators. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, a former member of Girls Aloud and judge on The X Factor, has a Geordie accent,[87] she says that she's \"proud to be Geordie!\" as does Joe McElderry the winner of the sixth series of The X Factor.[87] In May 2011, while named Cheryl Cole, she was let go from the American version of The X Factor because its \"producers feared the American audience would not understand her Geordie accent.\"[88] While hosting during a May 2011 taping of Britain's Got Talent, Dec Donnelly (one half of the popular Geordie duo Ant & Dec) made an apparent attempt to stand up for Cole by asking co-producer and judge Simon Cowell on the show, \"Can you understand my accent?\".[88]"]}}}
