Murphy selected \"Defying Gravity\" for the episode after Colfer related a story in which his own high school drama teacher had refused him the opportunity to perform the song because it was written to be sung by a female singer.[5][78] Murphy explained, \"I found a way to write it into the show because that's in a nutshell what this show is about: someone being told that they can't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is.\"[9] Colfer stated that the opportunity to sing the song \"meant the world\" to him, and that \"it's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's probably one of the most honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter.\"[9] Colfer's recording of the performance was released as a single, as well as two additional versions—one sung by co-star Michele, and another that was arranged as a duet for the two singers. The duet version charted at number thirty-one on the Billboard Hot 100,[79] and was included on the show's first soundtrack album, Glee: The Music, Volume 1.[80]"],"after":["In \"Grilled Cheesus\", when members of the glee club are singing songs about religion and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital. Murphy stated that it would have been easy to have Kurt, an atheist, sing an anti-religion song, but instead chose to have him sing about love.[56] Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of this song choice. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News said he \"found it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing 'I wanna be your man' about his father\",[81] but Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV‍‍ '​‍s Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" brought new meaning to the song, which Semigran named her favorite number of the episode.[82][83] In \"Special Education\", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" from Evita; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song.[37] Both Colfer's and Michele's versions were released as singles, available for digital download, although neither appears on an album. Kurt and Blaine perform the duet \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" during the Christmas-oriented episode \"A Very Glee Christmas\".[84] The number was released on Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album,[85] and although it was not also released as a single, it nevertheless reached number fifty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[86] As a Dalton Academy Warbler, Kurt sings the harmony line to Blaine's lead in \"Animal\" by Neon Trees in the episode \"Sexy\", and in \"Original Song\" he sings \"Blackbird\" by The Beatles. He also sings primary lead in a duet version of \"Candles\" by Hey Monday, with Blaine as the other lead. All three songs were included on the soundtrack Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers, released on April 19, 2011.[87]"]}}}
