The Herald took the view that \"the new work is in every respect superior to the Pinafore, the text more humorous, the music more elegant and more elaborate.\"[45] The Tribune called it \"a brilliant and complete success\", commenting, \"The humor of the Pirates is richer, but more recondite. It demands a closer attention to the words [but] there are great stores of wit and drollery ... which will well repay exploration. ... The music is fresh, bright, elegant and merry, and much of it belongs to a higher order of art than the most popular of the tunes of Pinafore.\"[46] The New York Times also praised the work, writing, \"it would be impossible for a confirmed misanthrope to refrain from merriment over it\", though the paper doubted if Pirates could repeat the prodigious success of Pinafore.[39]"]}}}
