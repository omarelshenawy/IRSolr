Members of Parliament (országgyűlési képviselő, pl. képviselők) are elected to the highest organ of state authority, the Országgyűlés, or National Assembly, every four years.

In 2012, the new Constitution lowered the number of MPs to 199 and instituted a first-past-the-post election with a single round."]}}}
