Others such as the Euler–Tricomi equation have different types in different regions. The classification provides a guide to appropriate initial and boundary conditions, and to smoothness of the solutions."],"after":["where the coefficients A, B, C etc. may depend upon x and y. If over a region of the xy plane, the PDE is second-order in that region. This form is analogous to the equation for a conic section:","More precisely, replacing ∂x by X, and likewise for other variables (formally this is done by a Fourier transform), converts a constant-coefficient PDE into a polynomial of the same degree, with the top degree (a homogeneous polynomial, here a quadratic form) being most significant for the classification."]}}}
