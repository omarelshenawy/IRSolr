Redirects allow a topic to have more than one title. Redirects are used for synonyms, abbreviations, accented terms, misspellings, typos, nicknames, scientific names, etc. To create a redirect for a page named \"Foo\", type Foo in the search box, press â†µ Enter, and click on the redlink for Foo that it presents. To create the redirect, in the edit window that appears, type #REDIRECT [[Oof]] to make it lead to the article Oof."]}}}
