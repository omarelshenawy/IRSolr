Cap Anson was the first to join the club on July 18, 1897. Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb became the club's fourth member in 1921 and the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927, ultimately finishing his career with more than 4,100. Cobb, also MLB's all-time career batting average leader, remained the MLB hit leader until September 11, 1985, when Pete Rose (pictured) collected his 4,192nd hit. Rose, the current record holder, finished his career with 4,256 hits. In total, 28 players have reached the 3,000 hit mark in MLB history. Of these, 14 were right-handed batters, 12 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters, meaning they could bat from either side of the plate. Baseball writer Josh Pahigian wrote that the club has been \"long considered the greatest measure of superior bat handling.\" (Full list...)"]}}}
