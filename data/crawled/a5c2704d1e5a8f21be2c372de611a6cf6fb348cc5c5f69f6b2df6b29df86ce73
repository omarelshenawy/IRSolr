There is no unique way to generalize these transformations to the entire geometric algebra without further restriction. Even the restriction that the linear transformation be grade-preserving is not enough. We therefore desire a stronger rule, motivated by geometric interpretation, for generalizing these linear transformations of vectors in a standard way. The most natural choice is that of the outermorphism of the linear transformation because it extends the concepts of reflection and rotation straightforwardly. If f is a function that maps vectors to vectors, then its outermorphism is the function that obeys the rule"],"after":["In particular, the outermorphism of the reflection of a vector on a vector is"]}}}
