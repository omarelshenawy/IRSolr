In Old English the Runic letter Wynn (Ç·) was used, but Norman influence forced Wynn out of use. By the 14th century, the \"new\" letter W, originated as two Vs or Us joined together, developed into a legitimate letter with its own position in the alphabet. Because of its relative youth compared to other letters of the alphabet, only a few European languages (English, Dutch, German, Polish, Welsh, Maltese, and Walloon) use the letter in native words."]}}}
