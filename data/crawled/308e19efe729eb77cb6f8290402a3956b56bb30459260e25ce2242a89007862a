The following Neolithic period (PPNB) is represented by rectangular houses of Mureybet culture. At the time of the pre-pottery Neolithic, people used vessels made of stone, gyps and burnt lime (Vaisselle blanche). Finds of obsidian tools from Anatolia are evidences of early trade relations. Cities of Hamoukar and Emar played an important role during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in Syria was one of the most ancient on earth, perhaps only preceded by those of Mesopotamia."],"after":["The earliest recorded indigenous civilisation in the region was the Kingdom of Ebla[26] near present-day Idlib, northern Syria. Ebla appears to have been founded around 3500 BC,[27][28][29][30][31] and gradually built its fortune through trade with the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Assyria and Akkad, as well as with the Hurrian and Hattian peoples to the northwest, in Asia Minor.[32] Gifts from Pharaohs, found during excavations, confirm Ebla's contact with Egypt."]}}}
