For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[146] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.[147]"]}}}
