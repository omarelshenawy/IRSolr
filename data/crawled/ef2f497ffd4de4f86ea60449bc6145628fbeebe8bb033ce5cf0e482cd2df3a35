The Aurion is essentially a sixth generation Toyota Camry with revised front- and rear-end treatment, along with changes to the interior. The Camry-based Aurion is also sold in the majority of East and Southeast Asia as the Toyota Camry, with the original version of the Camry sold alongside the Aurion in the Middle East and Australasia (Australasia being Australia and New Zealand). In the previous two markets, the car replaces the Avalon model, which can trace its roots back to the early 1990s."]}}}
