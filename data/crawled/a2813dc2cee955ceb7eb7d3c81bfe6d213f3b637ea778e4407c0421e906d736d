The telescope was launched by Space Shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990. This had been postponed from a 1986 launch date by the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion. It was later discovered that the main mirror had a defect, which was repaired in December 1993. Hubble's replacement, the James Webb Telescope is not scheduled for launch until 2018, many years after the Hubble Space Telescope is expected to cease functions."]}}}
