Therefore, Sanskrit has no native script of its own.[2] As such, virtually all the major writing systems of South Asia have been used for the production of Sanskrit manuscripts."],"after":["The earliest known inscriptions in Sanskrit date to the first century BCE. They are in the Br훮hm카 script, which was originally used for Prakrit, not Sanskrit. It has been described as a paradox that the first evidence of written Sanskrit occurs centuries later than that of the Prakrit languages which are its linguistic descendants.[61] In northern India, there are Br훮hm카 inscriptions dating from the third century BCE onwards, the oldest appearing on the famous Prakrit pillar inscriptions of king Ashoka. The earliest South Indian inscriptions in Tamil Brahmi, written in early Tamil, belong to the same period. When Sanskrit was written down, it was first used for texts of an administrative, literary or scientific nature. The sacred texts were preserved orally, and were set down in writing \"reluctantly\" (according to one commentator), and at a comparatively late date.[41][62]"]}}}
