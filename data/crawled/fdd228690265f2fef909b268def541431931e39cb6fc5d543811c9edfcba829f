Anthropologist Norman Tindale suggested the principal group occupying the region were the Ngunnawal people, while the Ngarigo lived immediately to the south of the ACT, the Wandandian to the east, the Walgulu also to the south, Gandangara people to the north, and Wiradjuri to the north west. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the region includes inhabited rock shelters, rock paintings and engravings, burial places, camps and quarry sites, and stone tools and arrangements.[11] The evidence suggests human habitation in the area for at least 21,000 years.[12]"],"after":["European exploration and settlement started in the Canberra area as early as the 1820s.[14][15][16] There were four expeditions between 1820 and 1824.[15][16] White settlement of the area probably dates from 1823, when a homestead or station was built on what is now the Acton peninsula by stockmen employed by Joshua John Moore.[17] He formally applied to purchase the site on 16 December 1826, naming the property \"Canberry\". On 30 April 1827, Moore was told by letter that he could retain possession of 1,000 acres (405Â ha) at Canberry.[18]"]}}}
