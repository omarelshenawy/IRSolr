In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to create space for the storage of the created debris and soil.[30] Contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals can also affect the health of the local population if not properly controlled.[31] Extreme examples of pollution from mining activities include coal fires, which can last for years or even decades, producing massive amounts of environmental damage."]}}}
