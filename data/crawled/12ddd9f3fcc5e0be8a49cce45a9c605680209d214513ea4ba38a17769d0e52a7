His compositions were not enough to support him financially, and from 1861 to 1872 he supplemented his income by working as a church organist, which he enjoyed, and as a music teacher, sometimes at the Crystal Palace School,[27] which he hated and gave up as soon as he could.[28][n 3] Sullivan had an early chance to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the Prince of Wales in 1863.[30]"]}}}
