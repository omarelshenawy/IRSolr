He once said: \"I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.\"[48]"],"after":["Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32Â am on February 22, 1987. According to news reports, he had been making good recovery from a routine gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative cardiac arrhythmia.[49] Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.[45] His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication.[50] The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.[51]"]}}}
