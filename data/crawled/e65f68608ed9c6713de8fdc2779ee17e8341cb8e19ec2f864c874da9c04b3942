During his main reign (1456â€“1462), \"Vlad the Impaler\" is said to have killed from 40,000 to 100,000 European civilians (political rivals, criminals, and anyone he considered \"useless to humanity\"), mainly by impaling. The sources depicting these events are records by Saxon settlers in neighbouring Transylvania, who had frequent clashes with Vlad III. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero by Romanians for driving off the invading Ottoman Turks, of which his impaled victims are said to have included as many as 100,000.[30]"],"after":["Historically, the name \"Dracula\" is derived from a Chivalric order called the Order of the Dragon, founded by Sigismund of Luxembourg (then king of Hungary) to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks. Vlad II Dracul, father of Vlad III, was admitted to the order around 1431, after which Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later, as ruler of Wallachia, his coinage bore the dragon symbol. The name Dracula means \"Son of Dracul\"."]}}}
