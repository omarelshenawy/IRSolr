Ninety percent of the people live in less than 10% of the area, primarily along the coast. About 88% of the population is urban, mostly concentrated in the three largest cities, Tripoli, Benghazi and Misrata. Libya has a population of about 6.5 million, 27.7% of whom are under the age of 15.[3] In 1984 the population was 3.6 million, an increase from the 1.54 million reported in 1964.[170]"]}}}
