Reported examples of bias include historical revisionism such as watering-down and denial of the crimes committed by the Usta≈°e regime, and equating anti-fascism with forms of totalitarianism.[5] Other issues included the bias against Serbs of Croatia and the LGBT population.[6][7] Editors who tried to remove the biased sections were reportedly being harassed by administrators and quickly received permanent blocks under various pretexts.[8] The issue was reported by Croatia's daily Jutarnji list and even made its print edition's front page on 11 September 2013.[9]"]}}}
