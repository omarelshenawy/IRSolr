The targets were destroyed with virtually no architectural damage done to the city itself.[27] However the industrial areas in Mestre and Marghera and the railway lines to Padua, Trieste and Trento were repeatedly bombed.[28] On 29 April 1945, New Zealand troops under Freyberg of the Eighth army reached Venice and relieved the city and the mainland, which were already in partisan hands.[29]"],"after":["Subsidence, the gradual lowering of the surface of Venice, leads to the seasonal phenomenon of Acqua alta where much of the city's surface is covered in high water."]}}}
