The question of continuity at x = −2 does not arise, since x = −2 is not in the domain of f. There is no continuous function F: R → R that agrees with f(x) for all x ≠ −2. The sinc function g(x) = (sin x)/x, defined for all x≠0 is continuous at these points. However, this function can be extended to a continuous function on all real numbers, namely"]}}}
