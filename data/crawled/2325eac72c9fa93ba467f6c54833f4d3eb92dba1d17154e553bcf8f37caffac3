Ford is best known for his performances as the title character in the Indiana Jones film series and as Han Solo in the original Star Wars trilogy. He is also known for his role as the haunted android tracker Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott's sci-fi cult film Blade Runner and as CIA operative Jack Ryan in the films Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. His four-decade career also includes roles in other Hollywood blockbusters such as The Fugitive, Air Force One, Witness, Presumed Innocent and What Lies Beneath. At one point, Ford had roles in the top five box-office hits of all time[citation needed], though his role in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (as Elliot's school principal) was deleted from the final cut of the film. Five of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry."]}}}
