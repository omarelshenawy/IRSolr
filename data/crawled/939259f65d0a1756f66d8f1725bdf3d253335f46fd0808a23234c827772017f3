Stochastic matrices are used to define Markov chains with finitely many states.[83] A row of the stochastic matrix gives the probability distribution for the next position of some particle currently in the state that corresponds to the row. Properties of the Markov chain like absorbing states, i.e., states that any particle attains eventually, can be read off the eigenvectors of the transition matrices.[84]"]}}}
