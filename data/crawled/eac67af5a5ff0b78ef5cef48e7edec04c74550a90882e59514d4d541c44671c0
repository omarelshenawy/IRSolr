Archeological excavations from 1955 to 1974 unearthed towers and gates from the Middle Bronze Age.[19] Subsequent excavations, from 1997 onwards, helped date earlier discoveries.[19] They also exposed sections of a packed-sandstone glacis and a massive brick wall, dating from the Late Bronze Age, as well as a temple attributed to the Sea Peoples and dwellings from the Iron Age.[19] Remnants of buildings from the Persian and Hellenistic periods were also discovered.[19]"]}}}
