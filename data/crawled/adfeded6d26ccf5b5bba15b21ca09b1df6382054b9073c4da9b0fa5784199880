However, on 3 February 1014 Sven died suddenly.[123] Capitalising on his death, Æthelred returned to England and drove Sven's son, Cnut, back to Denmark, forcing him to abandon his allies in the process.[123] In 1015, Cnut launched a new campaign against England.[123] Edmund fell out with his father, Æthelred, and struck out on his own.[124] Some English leaders decided to support Cnut, so Æthelred ultimately retreated to London.[124] Before engagement with the Danish army, Æthelred died and was replaced by Edmund.[124] The Danish army encircled and besieged London, but Edmund was able to escape and raised an army of loyalists.[124] Edmund's army routed the Danes, but the success was short-lived: at the battle of Ashingdon the Danes were victorious and many of the English leaders were killed.[124] Cnut and Edmund agreed to split the kingdom in two, with Edmund ruling Wessex and Cnut the rest.[124][125]"],"after":["In 1017, Edmund died in mysterious circumstances, probably murdered by Cnut or his supporters, and the English council (the witan) confirmed Cnut as king of all England.[124] Cnut divided England into earldoms: most of these were allocated to nobles of Danish descent, but he made an Englishman earl of Wessex. The man he appointed was Godwin, who eventually became part of the extended royal family when he married the king's sister-in-law.[126] In the summer of 1017, Cnut sent for Æthelred's widow, Emma, with the intention of marrying her.[127] It seems that Emma agreed to marry the king on condition that he would limit the English succession to the children born of their union.[128] Cnut already had a wife known as Ælfgifu of Northampton who bore him two sons, Svein and Harold Harefoot.[128] However it seems that the church regarded Ælfgifu as Cnut's concubine rather than his wife.[128] In addition to the two sons he had with Ælfgifu, he had a further son with Emma, who was named Harthacnut.[128][129]"]}}}
