According to CNN, \"Blaine's only communication to the outside world was by a hand buzzer, which could have alerted an around-the-clock emergency crew standing by.\" BBC News reported that the cramped plastic coffin offered six inches (152 mm) of headroom and two inches on each side. During the endurance stunt Blaine ate nothing and drank only two to three tablespoons of water a day.[14] An estimated 75,000 people visited the site, including Marie Blood, Harry Houdini's niece, who said, \"My uncle did some amazing things, but he could not have done this.\"[15] On the final day of the stunt, April 12, hundreds of news teams were stationed at the site for the coffin-opening. A team of construction workers removed a portion of the 75 cubic feet (2.1 m3) of gravel surrounding the six-foot-deep coffin before a crane lifted the water tank.[16] Blaine emerged and told the crowd, \"I saw something very prophetic ... a vision of every race, every religion, every age group banding together, and that made all this worthwhile.\"[14] BBC News stated, \"The 26-year-old magician has outdone his hero, Harry Houdini, who had planned a similar feat but died in 1926 before he could perform it.\"[17] During the preparation of the stunt, Jonathan Demme told Time Out New York, \"He's the most exciting thing in America... and I'm not just talking entertainment.\"[18]"]}}}
