An additional 4,520 are listed as featured articles (about 1 in 1,080) and 2,811 as featured lists (about 1 in 1,740). Because articles are only included on one list, a good article that has been promoted to featured status is removed from the good articles list. Adding good and featured articles and lists together gives a total of 29,336 articles (about 1 in 167). A small plus sign inside a circle () in the top-right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is good, unless the appropriate user preference is set."]}}}
