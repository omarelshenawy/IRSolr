This line is the image of the inverse map, λ−1: R→E. This inverse image is the set of the points x=(x, y) that solve the equation,"],"after":["Notice that a linear functional operates on known values for x=(x, y) to compute a value c in R, while the inverse image seeks the values for x=(x, y) that yield a specific value c."]}}}
