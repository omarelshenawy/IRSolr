Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[205] since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system[206][207] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[208] India's recent economic model is largely capitalist.[207] India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.[209]"]}}}
