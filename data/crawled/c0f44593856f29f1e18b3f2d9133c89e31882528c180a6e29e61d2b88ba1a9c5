Ghanaian music incorporates several distinct types of musical instruments such as the talking drum ensembles, Akan Drum, goje fiddle and koloko lute, court music, including the Akan Seperewa, the Akan atumpan, the Ga kpanlogo styles, and log xylophones used in asonko music.[205] The most well known genres to have come from Ghana are African jazz which was created by Ghanaian artist Kofi Ghanaba.[206] and its earliest form of secular music is called highlife.[205] Highlife originated in the late 19th century and early 20th century and spread throughout West Africa.[205] In the 1990s a new genre of music was created by the youth incorporating the influences of highlife, Afro-reggae, dancehall and hiphop.[205] This hybrid was called Hiplife.[205] Ghanaian artists such as R&B and soul singer Rhian Benson and Sarkodie have had international success.[207][208]"]}}}
