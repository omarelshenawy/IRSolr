In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a record executives' gala, where she handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola, who listened to it on his way back home.[20][21] After the first two songs, he was so enamored of Carey's voice that he returned to the event, only to find that she had left.[21] In what has been widely described by critics as a modern day Cinderella tale,[22][23] after searching for Carey for two weeks, he immediately signed her and began mapping out her commercial debut.[20] While she maintained that she wanted to continue working with Margulies, Mottola enlisted top producers of the time, including Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.[20] Mottola and the staff at Columbia had planned to market Carey as their main female pop artist, competing with Whitney Houston and Madonna (signed to Arista and Sire Records respectively).[24] After the completion of her debut album, Mariah Carey, Columbia spent more than $1 million promoting it.[25] Despite a weak start, the album eventually reached the top of the Billboard 200, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards.[26] Mariah Carey stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks,[27][not in citation given] and she won the Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance awards for her single \"Vision of Love\".[28] The album yielded three more number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, following the four-week number-one run of \"Vision of Love\". Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles reach number one.[29] Mariah Carey finished as the best-selling album in the United States in 1991,[30] while totaling sales of over 15 million copies.[31]"]}}}
