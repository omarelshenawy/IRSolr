The Chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist, but also as authoritarian and corporatist,[147] with heavy restrictions in many areas, most notably against free access to the Internet, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to have children, free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion.[148] Its current political, ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as the \"people's democratic dictatorship\", \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" (which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances) and the \"socialist market economy\" respectively.[149]"]}}}
