Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the dam is one of the most efficient forms of energy storage, because it is only changing the timing of the electricity that it would normally generate. Hydroelectric turbines have a very fast start-up time in the order of a few minutes.[23] A dam which impounds a reservoir can store and release a corresponding amount of energy, by raising and lowering its reservoir."],"after":["Worldwide, pumped-storage hydroelectricity is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, and, as of March 2012, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) reports that PSH accounts for more than 99% of bulk storage capacity worldwide, representing around 127,000 MW.[24] PSH reported energy efficiency varies in practice between 70% and 80%,[24][25][26][27] with some claiming up to 87%.[28]"]}}}
