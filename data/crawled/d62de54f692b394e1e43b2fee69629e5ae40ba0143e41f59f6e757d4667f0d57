If and are two measurable spaces, then a function is called measurable if for every Y-measurable set , the inverse image is X-measurable – i.e.: . The composition of measurable functions is measurable, making the measurable spaces and measurable functions a category, with the measurable spaces as objects and the set of measurable functions as arrows."]}}}
