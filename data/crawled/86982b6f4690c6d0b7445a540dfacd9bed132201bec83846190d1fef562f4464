Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody.[55] In some cases, in requesting the original band to allow for his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\", Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\", while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for \"Radioactive\" in Yankovic's parody \"Inactive\".[56] Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his \"mainstream\" parody targets, such as Toni Basil, MC Hammer, and Men Without Hats.[57][58] Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single \"White & Nerdy\" and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music.[59]"]}}}
