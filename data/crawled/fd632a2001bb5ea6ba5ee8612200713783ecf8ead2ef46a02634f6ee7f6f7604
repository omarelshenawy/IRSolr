The tour was the longest in rugby history, and the first by a New Zealand team to Europe. The team was privately organised by Joe Warbrick, and was originally intended to contain only Māori players. Several non-Māori, and even a number of non-New Zealand-born players were eventually recruited to strengthen the side. The team played three internationals: a heavy loss to England, a win over Ireland, and narrow loss to Wales. The initial leg of the Native team's journey was a tour of New Zealand, and their first match was a 5–0 victory over Hawke's Bay. The team departed from New Zealand having won seven of their nine matches, but their losses included a heavy defeat to Auckland. They played 74 matches in the British Isles—with 36 of these in their first three months. Following their departure from Plymouth in March 1889, the Natives travelled to Melbourne, Australia. There the team played eight Victorian rules football matches, and two rugby games. (Full list...)"]}}}
