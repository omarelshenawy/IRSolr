This region is divided into the Palearctic, consisting of North Africa and all of Eurasia, with the exception of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, and the Nearctic, consisting of North America north of southern Mexico. These are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this ecozone. The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of this ecozone. The floristic Boreal Kingdom corresponds to the Holarctic ecozone."]}}}
