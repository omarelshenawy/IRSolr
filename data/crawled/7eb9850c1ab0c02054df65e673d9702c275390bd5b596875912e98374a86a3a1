Watches weren't widely worn in pockets until the 17th century. One account says that the word \"watch\" came from the Old English word woecce which meant \"watchman\", because it was used by town watchmen to keep track of their shifts at work.[5] Another says that the term came from 17th century sailors, who used the new mechanisms to time the length of their shipboard watches (duty shifts).[6]"],"after":["A great leap forward in accuracy occurred in 1657 with the addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel, an invention disputed both at the time and ever since between Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens. This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day[7] to perhaps 10 minutes per day,[8] resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the face from around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France."]}}}
