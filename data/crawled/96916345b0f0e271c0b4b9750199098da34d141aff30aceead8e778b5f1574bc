Seminars\" who traps time-traveler Heinz-57 (played by Geoff Hoyle) in one of his seminars and continually refers to him as \"Heinz Asshole.\"[29] In the DVD commentary for the 2003 release of the film, director Lucas Reiner stated that the \"Absentee, oblivious, self-involved parents who don't notice their kids have a spaceship\" was a reference to the self-involved nature of adults during the 1970s and their propensity for self-improvement.[28] Lucas Reiner stated that these scenes were meant to symbolize the \"'70s hunger for self-improvement,\" and the extreme ends that people would go to in order to improve themselves. Lucas Reiner had never personally attended one of Werner Erhard's seminars, but had heard that attendants were not allowed to leave, often peed in their pants, and were called \"assholes\" and insulted publicly. Reiner noted that once his brother Carl put on the \"Dr. Cash\" costume, he played his character perfectly.[28] Heavyweights is a 1995 comedy film about a fat camp for kids that is taken over by fitness guru Tony Perkis, played by Ben Stiller. In a review of the film in The Washington Post, Hal Hinson described Stiller's portrayal of the Perkis character to Erhard, and called him \"the Werner Erhard of slide aerobics\".[30]"],"after":["Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk was a graduate of The Landmark Forum, or \"The Forum\", for short, and this later influenced his work.[31][32][33] In his review of the 1999 film adaptation of the book, Roger Ebert likened the character Tyler Durden to Werner Erhard.[34] Ebert wrote that Tyler Durden was: \".a bully--Werner Erhard plus S & M, a leather club operator without the decor.\"[34] Fight Club film producer Ross Grayson Bell believes that his \"creative synchronicity\" with writer Palahniuk was due to their shared experience of attending The Forum.[31] In the 1999 film Magnolia, Tom Cruise played a motivational guru named Frank T.J. Mackey, who was the author of a self-help book called Seduce and Destroy. This work was meant to teach men how to get women to sleep with them. The Frank T.J. Mackey character in the film has been likened to: \"a sort of pop-TV blend of Werner Erhard and Bob Guccione, strutting around a stage with cocksure arrogance, indoctrinating his acolytes in the arts of machismo and seduction.\"[35] The Frank T.J. Mackey character has also been compared to another motivational trainer influenced by Erhard, in Details Magazine.[36] In an ironic twist, Tom Cruise has later been referred to as \"the new Werner Erhard.\"[37]"]}}}
