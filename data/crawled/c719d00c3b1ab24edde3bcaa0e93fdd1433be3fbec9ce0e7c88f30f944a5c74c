He or his court commissioned the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was written in Old English (rather than in Latin, which was the language of the European annals).[97] Alfred's own literary output was mainly of translations, though he wrote introductions and amended manuscripts as well.[97][98]"],"after":["On Alfred's death in 899, his son Edward the Elder succeeded him.[99] Alfred's son Edward, and his grandsons Æthelstan, Edmund I, and Eadred, continued the policy of resistance against the Vikings.[100] From 874–879 the western half of Mercia was ruled by Ceowulf II, who was succeeded by Æthelred.[101] In 886/887 Æthelred married Alfred's daughter Æthelflæd.[101] When Æthelred died in 911, his widow administered the Mercian province with the title \"Lady of the Mercians\".[101] As commander of the Mercian army she worked with her brother, Edward the Elder, to win back the Mercian lands that were under Danish control.[101] Edward and his successors made fortified towns, called burhs (burghs), a key element of their strategy, enabling them to go on the offensive.[100][102] Edward recaptured Essex in 913. Edward's son, Æthelstan, annexed Northumbria and forced the kings of Wales to submit; at the battle of Brunanburh in 937, he defeated an alliance of the Scots, Danes, and Vikings to become King of all England.[100][103] Along with the Britons and the settled Danes, some of the other Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms disliked being ruled by Wessex. Consequently, the death of a Wessex king would be followed by rebellion, particularly in Northumbria.[100] In 973, Alfred's great-grandson, Edgar, was crowned King of England and Emperor of Britain at Bath.[104] On his coinage he had inscribed EADGAR REX ANGLORUM (\"Edgar, King of the English\"). Edgar's coronation was a magnificent affair, and many of its rituals and words could still be seen in the coronation of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in 1953, though in English rather than Latin.[105]"]}}}
