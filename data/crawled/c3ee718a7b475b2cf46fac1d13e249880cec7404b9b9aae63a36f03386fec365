One was that she conceived the idea of an erotic photography book during the shooting of the film A League of Their Own in the summer of 1991.[1] The second one is that Judith Regan, vice-president and editor-in-chief of Simon & Schuster, flew to Los Angeles in March 1991 to meet with Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann, armed with a proposal for a similar collection of photo-erotica.[1] The singer had initially verified whether Regan had approached any other celebrities with this concept, as Madonna would be interested to be a part of it only if it was a unique idea.[2] By the end of the meeting Madonna had agreed \"in principle\" to do a book called Madonna's Book of Erotica and Sexual Fantasies. She told Regan that DeMann would call her and work out the details regarding the book.[3][4] However, Madonna never got back in touch with Regan, who assumed that the singer did not want to proceed with the idea.[1] Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg never confirmed nor denied Regan's claim, but according to Benatar, Madonna started working on Sex before wrapping up A League of Their Own.[1] At first Warner Bros. Records and the executive directors at Time Warner were reluctant to allow Madonna to publish such a book, but finally gave in to the idea. Madonna, however, was forced to sign a contract that forbade her from showing child pornography, bestiality and religious imagery.[1] Not long after signing this agreement Madonna founded Maverick, a multi-media entertainment company. Since by contract she had total artistic control over any of the work released by Maverick, the agreement she signed with Time Warner concerning what not to do in Sex became obsolete.[5][6][7]"],"after":["Originally to be titled X, Madonna changed her mind when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted. (The film was released three weeks after the book.) She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: \"This is a really good symbol, and I thought of it first.\"[8] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies.[9] They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies.[10][11] Madonna hired top-notch talent for the development of the book;[12] she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry.[9] The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director,[13] fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco.[1][6][14] The Sex book had a range of influences â€“ from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look.[15] Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: \"Madonna and I can keep up with each other\" and that \"I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things.\"[1]"]}}}
