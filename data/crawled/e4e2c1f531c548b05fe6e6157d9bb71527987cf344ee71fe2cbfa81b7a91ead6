This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment.[77] The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $1,592 in 2013,[3] compared with $416 in 1994.[137] Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States.[77] The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in June 2010, the exchange rate was 588 francs to the United States dollar.[138] Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007 and there are plans for a common East African shilling, which could be in place by 2015.[139] In addition, the Rwandan economy was ranked second in the world in terms of green investment facilitation according to the 2014 Global Green Economy Index.[140]"]}}}
