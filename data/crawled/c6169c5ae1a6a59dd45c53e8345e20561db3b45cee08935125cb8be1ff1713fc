Molecular studies of concatenated nuclear sequences have yielded a widely varying estimated date of divergence between platyrrhines and catarrhines, ranging from 33 to 70 mya, while studies based on mitochondrial sequences produce a narrower range of 35 to 43 mya.[6][52] The anthropoid primates possibly traversed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to South America during the Eocene by island hopping, facilitated by Atlantic Ocean ridges and a lowered sea level.[40] Alternatively, a single rafting event may explain this transoceanic colonization. Due to continental drift, the Atlantic Ocean was not nearly as wide at the time as it is today.[40] Research suggests that a small 1 kg (2.2 lb) primate could have survived 13 days on a raft of vegetation.[53] Given estimated current and wind speeds, this would have provided enough time to make the voyage between the continents."],"after":["Apes and monkeys spread from Africa into Europe and Asia starting in the Miocene.[54] Soon after, the lorises and tarsiers made the same journey. The first hominid fossils were discovered in northern Africa and date back 5–8 mya.[41] Old World monkeys disappeared from Europe about 1.8 mya.[55] Molecular and fossil studies generally show that modern humans originated in Africa 100,000–200,000 years ago.[56]"]}}}
