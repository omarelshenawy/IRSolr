The name is partly derived from the Cockney Rejects' habit of shouting \"Oi! Oi! Oi!\" before each song, instead of the time-honored \"1,2,3,4!\"[305]"],"after":["The Oi! movement was fueled by a sense that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of The Business guitarist Steve Kent, \"trendy university people using long words, trying to be artisticÂ ... and losing touch\".[307] According to Bushell, \"Punk was meant to be of the voice of the dole queue, and in reality most of them were not. But Oi was the reality of the punk mythology. In the places where [these bands] came from, it was harder and more aggressive and it produced just as much quality music.\"[308] Lester Bangs described Oi! as \"politicized football chants for unemployed louts\".[309] One song in particular, The Exploited's \"Punks Not Dead\", spoke to an international constituency. It was adopted as an anthem by the groups of disaffected Mexican urban youth known in the 1980s as bandas; one banda named itself PND, after the song's initials.[310]"]}}}
