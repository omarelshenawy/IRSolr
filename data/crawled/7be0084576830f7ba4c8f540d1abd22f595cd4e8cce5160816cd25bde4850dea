Zakas, noted that mobile phones in use in 2013 were more powerful than Apollo 11's 70 lb (32 kg) Apollo Guidance Computer used in the July 1969 lunar landing.[6][7][8] However, in spite of their power, in 2013, mobile devices still suffer from Web performance with slow connections similar to the 1996 stage of Web development.[7][8] Mobile devices with slower download request/response times, the latency of over-the-air data transmission,[7][8] with \"high-latency connections, slower CPUs, and less memory\" force developers to rethink Web applications created for desktops with \"wired connections, fast CPUs, and almost endless memory.\"[7][8]"],"after":[""]}}}
