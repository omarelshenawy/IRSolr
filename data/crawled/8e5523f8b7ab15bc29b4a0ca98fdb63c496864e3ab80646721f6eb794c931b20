If the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, a spherical shape is convenient since the hour-lines are equally spaced, as they are on the equatorial dial above; the sundial is equiangular. This is the principle behind the armillary sphere and the equatorial bow sundial.[47] [48] [49] However, some equiangular sundials — such as the Lambert dial described below — are based on other principles."]}}}
