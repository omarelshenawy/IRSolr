Located a few blocks down the street from the university's main building in the city center, the new Main Library was opened in 2012 in the Kaisa House. The new library merged the undergraduate library and four dispersed faculty libraries of the city center campus to a collection of approximately 1.5 million books.[19] The architecture of the new building, designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects, has been praised[19][20] and received several awards.[21]"]}}}
