Metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes, \"In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rockâ€”the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.\"[6] The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist.
