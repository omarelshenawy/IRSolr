For example, insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing fluorescent lights or natural skylights reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared with using traditional incandescent light bulbs. Compact fluorescent lights use one-third the energy of incandescent lights and may last from 6 to 10 times longer. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production processes[2] or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.[3]"]}}}
