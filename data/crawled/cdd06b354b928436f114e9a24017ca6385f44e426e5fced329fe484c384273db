Like some parts of universal algebra, and in contrast with the other areas of model theory, it is mainly concerned with finite algebras, or more generally, with finite σ-structures for signatures σ which may contain relation symbols as in the following example:"],"after":["The logics employed in finite model theory are often substantially more expressive than first-order logic, the standard logic for model theory of infinite structures."]}}}
