The Latin word: socius, \"companion\"; the suffix -logy, \"the study of\" from Greek -λογία from λόγος, lógos, \"word\", \"knowledge\". It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès (1748–1836) in an unpublished manuscript.[20] Sociology was later defined independently by the French philosopher of science, Auguste Comte (1798–1857), in 1838.[21] Comte used this term to describe a new way of looking at society.[22] Comte had earlier used the term \"social physics\", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the French Revolution, he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism, an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy [1830–1842] and A General View of Positivism (1848). Comte believed a positivist stage would mark the final era, after conjectural theological and metaphysical phases, in the progression of human understanding.[23] In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.[24]"],"after":[]}}}
