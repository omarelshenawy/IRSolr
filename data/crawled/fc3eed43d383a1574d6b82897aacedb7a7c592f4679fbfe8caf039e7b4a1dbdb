One possible explanation is that some users become turned off by their experiences.[72] Another explanation, according to Eric Goldman, is found in editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk pages, implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\". Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,[73] as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\",[74] but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty."]}}}
