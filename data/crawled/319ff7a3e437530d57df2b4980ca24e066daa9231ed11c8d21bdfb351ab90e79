He saw a familiar face, Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of Saturday Night, and began talking. Laurents told him he was working on a musicalization of Romeo & Juliet with Leonard Bernstein, but they were currently without a lyricist because Comden & Green were supposed to write the lyrics, but were being held to their Hollywood contract and couldn't participate. Laurents told him he wasn't a big fan of his music, but he loved the lyrics from Saturday Night and if he wanted he could audition for Bernstein. Sondheim met Bernstein the next day, played for him, and Bernstein said he would let him know about Comden & Green. Sondheim did not want to write lyrics only, but the music as well. After consulting with Hammerstein, he told Sondheim that he would be working with talented people with experience, and that Sondheim could write music later.[20]"],"after":["In 1957, West Side Story opened and was directed by Jerome Robbins and ran for 732 performances. While this may be one of the best-known shows Sondheim ever worked on, he has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, stating they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. It has been rumored that while Bernstein was off trying to fix the musical Candide, Sondheim wrote some of the music for West Side Story, and that Bernstein's co-lyricist billing credit mysteriously disappeared from the credits of West Side Story during the tryout, presumably as a trade-off.[21] Sondheim himself insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list Sondheim as the sole lyricist. Sondheim described how the royalties were divided for the show, saying Bernstein received three percent while Sondheim received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage, giving both two percent but Sondheim refused saying he only wanted the credit. Sondheim said later he wished \"someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage\".[20]"]}}}
