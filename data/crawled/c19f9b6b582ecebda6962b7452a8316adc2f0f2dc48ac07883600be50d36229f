According to a government report, the reason for the low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one prominent theory.[124] Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years.[124] The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.[126]"],"after":[]}}}
