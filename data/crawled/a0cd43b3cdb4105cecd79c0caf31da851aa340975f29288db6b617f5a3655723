However, the development of the Hays Code in 1930 censored most references to homosexuality from film under the umbrella term \"sex perversion\". German films depicted homosexuality and were distributed throughout Europe, but 1931's MÃ¤dchen in Uniform was not distributed in the U.S. because of the depiction of an adolescent's love for a female teacher in boarding school.[216]"],"after":["Because of the Hays Code, lesbianism after 1930 was absent from most films, even those adapted with overt lesbian characters or plot devices. Lillian Hellman's play The Children's Hour was converted into a heterosexual love triangle and retitled These Three. Biopic Queen Christina in 1933, starring Greta Garbo, veiled most of the speculation about Christina of Sweden's affairs with women.[216] Homosexuality or lesbianism was never mentioned outright in the films while the Hays Code was enforced. The reason censors stated for removing a lesbian scene in 1954's The Pit of Loneliness was that it was, \"Immoral, would tend to corrupt morals\".[217] The code was relaxed somewhat after 1961, and the next year William Wyler remade The Children's Hour with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. After MacLaine's character admits her love for Hepburn's, she hangs herself; this set a precedent for miserable endings in films addressing homosexuality.[218]"]}}}
