So if you are a leftover woman, you are A-quality.\"[1] A University of North Carolina demographer who studies China's gender imbalance, Yong Cai, further notes that \"men at the bottom of society get left out of the marriage market, and that same pattern is coming to emerge for women at the top of society\".[13]"]}}}
