The question implies a = 1, b = 2 and τ = 10 min."],"after":["After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.","Many pairs (b, τ) of a dimensionless non-negative number b and an amount of time τ (a physical quantity which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with τ proportional to log b. For any fixed b not equal to 1 (e.g. e or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time τ. For any non-zero time τ the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number b."]}}}
