As a result, Sanger decided to delete all articles besides those marked \"CZ live\" from the pilot project in an attempt to motivate greater participation.[71] On 22 January 2007, Citizendium experimented with a new self-registration procedure: read/write access was granted automatically after creation of the account.[72] There were a few instances of vandalism after this change, though the vandalism was quickly reverted.[73] On 19 January, Sanger announced the formal organization of Citizendium as a legal non-profit organization.[74]"]}}}
