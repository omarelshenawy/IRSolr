They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place.[81] The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the 'Madrid Protocol') was negotiated as other countries followed suit and on 14 January 1998 it entered into force.[81][82] The Madrid Protocol bans all mining in Antarctica, designating Antarctica a 'natural reserve devoted to peace and science'."],"after":["The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any military activity in Antarctica, including the establishment of military bases and fortifications, military manoeuvers, and weapons testing. Military personnel or equipment are permitted only for scientific research or other peaceful purposes.[83] The only documented military land manoeuvre was Operation NINETY by the Argentine military.[84]"]}}}
