Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide.[221] The Peshawar Seven insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China,[222][223] as well as weapons and billions of dollars from the United States, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia,[223] while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.[221] Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham – resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup. By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen.[224]"]}}}
