It features production by Madonna, Timbaland, Timberlake, The Neptunes and Nate \"Danja\" Hills.[7] Previously, Madonna had worked with relatively unknown producers like William Orbit, Mirwais Ahmadza√Ø and Stuart Price. However, for Hard Candy Madonna decided to collaborate with producers and artists who were already well-known. Talking to MTV, Madonna explained her decision to collaborate with well-known producers: \"Because they're good, and I like their shit. [...] I mean, I don't like to repeat myself, and I was sitting around thinking, 'What music do I love right now?' And it was actually [Timberlake's] record FutureSex/LoveSounds. [...] I was listening to it obsessively.\"[8] Madonna had already started work on the album with Pharrell, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, suggesting that it \"would be cool\" if he recorded some songs with her.[8] Timberlake commented \"'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork where she was going with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, and a couple of other songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix.\"[8] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was \"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to \"Frozen\" (1998). He wanted to turn the line \"'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do\" into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.[8]"]}}}
