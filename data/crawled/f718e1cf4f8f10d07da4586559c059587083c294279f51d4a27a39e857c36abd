Gear is used to protect against falls but not to aid the ascent directly."],"after":["Commonly known as \"Top Roping\": belaying a climber from the ground or the base of the route. A belay system resembling a pulley in which an anchor has been created at the top of a climb, through which the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground (position before starting the climb). The rope is \"taken-in\", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so in the event of a fall the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the weight of the climber compared to that of the belayer, among other things."]}}}
