It was founded as a monthly publication by Woodrow Wyatt in May 1967, becoming fortnightly in November 1967. On 25 May 1968, editor Colin Bostock-Smith began compiling a singles sales chart using a telephone sample of approximately twelve W H Smith & Son stores – the first single to reach number one on the Top Pops chart was \"Young Girl\" by Gary Puckett & The Union Gap. The charts and paper were published weekly with effect from 22 June 1968.[1] On 20 September 1969 the paper was rebranded Top Pops & Music Now, and subsequently became Music Now from 21 March 1970 – at this point the chart was sampling between 30 and 40 stores. From 27 February 1971 the chart was no longer published and in May 1971 the newspaper ceased publication.[1] During the publication of the chart, 55 different singles reached number one. The only one to be knocked off number one and then regain the top spot was \"Mony Mony\" by Tommy James and the Shondells. The final chart-topper was \"My Sweet Lord\" by George Harrison."]}}}
