Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies remained in or near Tel Aviv.[48] In the early 1980s, 13 embassies in Jerusalem moved to Tel Aviv as part of the UN's measures responding to Israel's 1980 Jerusalem Law.[49] Today, all national embassies are in Tel Aviv or environs.[50]"]}}}
