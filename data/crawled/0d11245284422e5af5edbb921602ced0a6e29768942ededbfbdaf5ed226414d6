John had been foretelling (Luke 3:16) the arrival of someone \"more powerful\" than he,[116][117] In Matthew 3:14, on meeting Jesus, the Baptist says \"I need to be baptized by you\", but Jesus persuades John to baptize him nonetheless.[118] After he does so and Jesus emerges from the water, the sky opens and a voice from Heaven states, \"This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased\" (Matthew 3:17). The Holy Spirit then descends upon Jesus as a dove.[116][117][118] This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus \"Son\", the other being the Transfiguration.[119][120]"]}}}
