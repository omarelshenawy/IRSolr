The decrease in GDP in 1996 and 1997 was largely due to significant problems in the financial sector and, in 1997, a severe island-wide drought (the worst in 70 years) that drastically reduced agricultural production. In 1997, nominal GDP was approximately J$220,556.2 million (US$6,198.9 million based on the average annual exchange rate of the period)."],"after":["The economy in 1997 was marked by low levels of import growth, high levels of private capital inflows and relative stability in the foreign exchange market."]}}}
