Wiktionaries in numerous other languages have since been started. Wiktionary was hosted on a temporary domain name (wiktionary.wikipedia.org) until May 1, 2004, when it switched to the current domain name.[c] As of May 2009[ref], Wiktionary features well over 5 million entries across its 272 language editions. The largest of the language editions is the English Wiktionary, with over 4 million entries, followed by the Malagasy Wiktionary with over 3.6 million entries and the French Wiktionary with over 2.6 million. Twenty nine Wiktionary language editions now contain over 100,000 entries each.[d]"],"after":["Most of the entries and many of the definitions at the project's largest language editions were created by bots that found creative ways to generate entries or (rarely) automatically imported thousands of entries from previously published dictionaries. Seven of the 18 bots registered at the English Wiktionary[e] created 163,000 of the entries there.[2]"]}}}
