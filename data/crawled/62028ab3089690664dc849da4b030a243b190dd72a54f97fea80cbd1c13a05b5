It comprises one or more electrochemical cells, and is a type of energy accumulator. It is known as a 'secondary cell' because its electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible. Rechargeable batteries come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from button cells to megawatt systems connected to stabilize an electrical distribution network. Several different combinations of chemicals are commonly used, including: leadâ€“acid, nickel cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion), and lithium ion polymer (Li-ion polymer)."]}}}
