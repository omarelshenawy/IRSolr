These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan Waffen-SS mountain army of five divisions.[19]"],"after":["In March 1944, Bedri Pejani, the chairman of the Second League of Prizren, an organization created after the Italian surrender to advance the interests of Kosovo Albanians, proposed to Hitler that a force of 120,000–150,000 Kosovo Albanian volunteers be raised to fight the Yugoslav and Albanian partisans. Pejani asked the German leadership to give the Albanians equipment and supplies to fight the communist insurgency, and requested the expansion of the borders of the German puppet state of Albania at the expense of the German-occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and the German occupied territory of Montenegro. These requests were not fulfilled,[12] but in April 1944 Himmler ordered the establishment of a new Albanian volunteer division,[11] which was subsequently named after the medieval Albanian warrior George Kastrioti Skanderbeg.[20] By this point, the Germans and some members of the Albanian puppet government believed that about 50,000 men could be recruited from Albanian-held territory to join the SS.[21] The SS had initially envisioned a force of 10,000–12,000 men for an Albanian SS division,[16] and Himmler saw the Muslim Albanians as a potential source of manpower in Germany's war against the Yugoslav Partisans,[11] who faced significant difficulties in recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join their ranks.[8][9] The Germans found that Kosovo Albanians were more cooperative than Albanians in Albania itself,[12] mainly because they feared a return to Yugoslav rule,[8] and many of the division's recruits were Albanians from Kosovo. The quality of most of these recruits was poor, with only 6,000 being considered suitable to receive training.[11] Those that were accepted were a combination of about 1,500 former Royal Yugoslav Army prisoners of war, elements of the failed Albanian army and gendarmerie, volunteers from both pre-war and expanded Albania, and conscripts from families that had more than two sons.[16] The enlistment of Albanian civilians was organized in close cooperation with the Albanian puppet government.[22]"]}}}
