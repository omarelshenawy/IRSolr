Each member comes to the team for a three-year tour from one of the two Naval Special Warfare Groups located on the east and west coasts. On completion of the tour, members return to operational units.[57] The parachute team began in 1969 when Navy SEALs and Frogmen volunteered to perform at weekend air shows. The Team initially consisted of five jumpers: LCDR Olson, PHC Gagliardi, SK2 \"Herky\" Hertenstein, PR1 Al Schmiz and PH2 \"Chip\" Maury. Schmiz and Maury were members of the original \"Chuting Stars.\"[58] When LCDR Olson was transferred to California, PHC Gene \"Gag\" Gagliardi (D 546) of UDT ELEVEN introduced him to the local jumping elite with the San Diego Skydivers, one of the nation's first sports parachuting clubs. He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a \"not to interfere\" basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the \"Leap Frogs\" name.[58]"]}}}
