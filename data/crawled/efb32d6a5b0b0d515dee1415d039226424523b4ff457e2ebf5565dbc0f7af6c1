In 2013, there were about 1,200,000 bicycles in Amsterdam outnumbering the amount of citizens in the city.[139] Theft is widespread â€“ in 2011, about 83,000 bicycles were stolen in Amsterdam.[140] Bicycles are used by all socio-economic groups because of their convenience, Amsterdam's small size, the 400 kilometres (249 miles) of bike paths,[141] the flat terrain, and the arguable inconvenience of driving an automobile.[142]"]}}}
