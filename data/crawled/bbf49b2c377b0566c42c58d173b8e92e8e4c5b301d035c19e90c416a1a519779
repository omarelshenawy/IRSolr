Hayes Memorial Commission.[10] Bowling Green was chosen on November 10, 1910 over Van Wert in a 3–2 vote by the commission.[10] The site located on 82.5 acres (0.334 km2) of primarily rural land and a small town park,[12] nearby railroad and transportation infrastructure, its central location in the region, and Bowling Green's dry status were major factors that the town was chosen by the commission.[10] At the same time, the commission chose Kent for a school in Northeastern Ohio.[11] Over the years 1911 and 1912, the Board of Trustees was appointed by the Governor and elected a school president on February 16, 1912.[11] A campus plan was created and $150,000 was appropriated to develop the campus and construct the first buildings.[13]"],"after":["The school opened on September 15, 1914 as Bowling Green State Normal School in two temporary locations at the Bowling Green Armory and at a branch school in Toledo for the 1914–1915 academic year.[11][14] It initially enrolled 304 students from Ohio, Michigan, and New York who were taught by 21 faculty members.[9] The school graduated its first class in 1915, consisting of 35 certified teachers. University Hall and Williams Hall opened that year, the school's first two permanent buildings. Two years later the first baccalaureate degrees for teacher education were awarded. On March 28, 1920 a tornado, part of the 1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, damaged three of the school's buildings.[15] The tornado touched down near Bowling Green and strengthened as it moved into Ottawa County where it killed two people in Genoa.[16]"]}}}
