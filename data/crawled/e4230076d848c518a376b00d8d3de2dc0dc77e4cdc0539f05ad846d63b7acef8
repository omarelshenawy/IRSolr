If f belongs to L2([−π, π]), then f∞ converges to f in L2([−π, π]), that is,  converges to 0 as N → ∞.","Because of the least squares property, and because of the completeness of the Fourier basis, we obtain an elementary convergence result."],"after":["Theorem. If , then f∞ converges to f uniformly (and hence also pointwise.)","This result can be proven easily if f is further assumed to be C2, since in that case tends to zero as n → ∞. More generally, the Fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to f, provided that f satisfies a Hölder condition of order α > ½. In the absolutely summable case, the inequality   proves uniform convergence."]}}}
