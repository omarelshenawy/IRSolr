She hints that she may be hiding a dark secret under her \"gay and frivolous exterior\". Ralph Rackstraw,[32] \"the smartest lad in all the fleet\", enters, declaring his love for the Captain's daughter, Josephine. His fellow sailors (excepting Dick Deadeye, the grim and ugly realist of the crew) offer their sympathies, but they can give Ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned."],"after":["The gentlemanly and popular Captain Corcoran greets his \"gallant crew\" and compliments them on their politeness, saying that he returns the favour by never (\"well, hardly ever\") using bad language, such as \"a big, big D\".[33] After the sailors leave, the Captain confesses to Little Buttercup that Josephine is reluctant to consider a marriage proposal from Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Buttercup says that she knows how it feels to love in vain. As she leaves, the Captain remarks that she is \"a plump and pleasing person\". Josephine enters and reveals to her father that she loves a humble sailor in his crew, but she assures him that she is a dutiful daughter and will never reveal her love to this sailor."]}}}
