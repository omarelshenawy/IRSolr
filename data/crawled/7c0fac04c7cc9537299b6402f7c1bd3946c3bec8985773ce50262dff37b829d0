Madonna rang up eight sellouts at Wembley Arena beginning August 1, 2006, notching the highest Billboard gross of 2006 in the process.[24] She grossed $80 million ($93,588,643 in 2015 dollars[1]) for the US shows alone throughout the summer, and it instantly became the highest grossing summer tour of the year 2006. In particular, NRJ reported that the two French dates sold out within 15 minutes of going on sale, resulting in two shows being added. The two original dates in London sold out almost instantly, and five new shows at Wembley Arena were announced.[25] On April 8, 2006, Madonna sold 30,000 tickets in under 40 minutes in Montreal, breaking a record previously held by U2. On July 9, 2006, 50,000 tickets went on sale for Madonna's Osaka and Tokyo shows. The tickets were sold out in a record breaking five minutes. It was Madonna's first time touring Japan in 13 years, and an additional date was added, September 21, 2006, at the Tokyo Dome, to meet high demand. On August 8, 2006, more than 35,000 tickets for the first ever Madonna concert in Moscow went on sale and, as claimed by show organizers, all were sold out in four days, which could be a new record in that country as all other artists had taken more than two weeks to sell out the tickets in the region. However, after many problems with the concert including venue uncertainty, rescheduling, ticket exchange and huge amount of tickets in the hands of speculators, tickets were on sale at their nominal values until the last minute.[26]"]}}}
