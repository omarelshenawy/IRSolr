Essjay specialized in editing articles about religion on Wikipedia, including subjects such as \"the penitential rite, transubstantiation, the papal tiara\";[131] on one occasion he was called in to give some \"expert testimony\" on the status of Mary in the Roman Catholic Church.[134] In January 2007, Essjay was hired as a manager with Wikia, a wiki-hosting service founded by Wales and Angela Beesley. In February, Wales appointed Essjay as a member of the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee, a group with powers to issue binding rulings in disputes relating to Wikipedia.[135]"],"after":["In late February 2007 The New Yorker added an editorial note to its article on Wikipedia stating that it had learned that Essjay was Ryan Jordan, a 24-year-old college dropout from Kentucky with no advanced degrees and no teaching experience.[136] Initially Jimmy Wales commented on the issue of Essjay's identity: \"I regard it as a pseudonym and I don't really have a problem with it.\" Larry Sanger, co-founder[137][138][139] of Wikipedia, responded to Wales on his Citizendium blog by calling Wales' initial reaction \"utterly breathtaking, and ultimately tragic.\" Sanger said the controversy \"reflects directly on the judgment and values of the management of Wikipedia.\"[140]"]}}}
