To be accepted as a critic on the website, a critic's original reviews must garner a specific number of \"likes\" from users. Those classified as \"Top Critics\" generally write for major newspapers. The staff determine for each review whether it is positive (\"fresh\", marked by a small icon of a red tomato) or negative (\"rotten\", marked by a small icon of a green splattered tomato). (Staff assessment is needed as some reviews are qualitative rather than numeric in ranking.) At the end of the year, they identify the film that was rated highest as receiving the annual \"Golden Tomato\".[citation needed]"]}}}
