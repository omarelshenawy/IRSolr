In September 1910 the first of the Courbet class was laid down, making France the eleventh nation to enter the dreadnought race.[106] In the Navy Estimates of 1911, Paul Bénazet asserted that from 1896 to 1911, France dropped from being the world's second-largest naval power to fourth; he attributed this to problems in maintenance routines and neglect.[107] The closer alliance with the United Kingdom made these reduced forces more than adequate for French needs.[106]"]}}}
