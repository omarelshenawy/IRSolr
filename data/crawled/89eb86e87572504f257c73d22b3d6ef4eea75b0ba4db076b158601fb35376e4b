Trees consist of nodes linked by edges in such a way that there are no cycles. There is generally a node called the root, which has no parent node. In Plane trees each node can have an arbitrary number of children. In binary trees, a special case of plane trees, each node can have either two or no children. Let denote the family of all plane trees. Then this family can be recursively defined as follows:"],"after":["After solving for P(x):"]}}}
