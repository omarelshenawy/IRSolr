These victories were usually included in a pilot's totals and in citations for decorations.[5]"],"after":["The British high command considered praise of fighter pilots to be detrimental to equally brave bomber and reconnaissance aircrew – so that the British air services did not publish official statistics on the successes of individuals. Nonetheless some pilots did become famous through press coverage,[2] making the British system for the recognition of successful fighter pilots much more informal and somewhat inconsistent. One pilot, Arthur Gould Lee, described his own score in a letter to his wife as \"Eleven, five by me solo — the rest shared\", adding that he was \"miles from being an ace\".[6] This shows that his No. 46 Squadron RAF counted shared kills, but separately from \"solo\" ones—one of a number of factors that seems to have varied from unit to unit. Also evident is that Lee considered a higher figure than five kills to be necessary for \"ace\" status. Aviation historians credit him as an ace with two enemy aircraft destroyed and five driven down out of control, for a total of seven victories.[7]"]}}}
