Sakharov suggested to replace the copper coil in his MK generators by a big superconductor solenoid to magnetically compress and focus underground nuclear explosions into a shaped charge effect. He theorized this could focus 1023 positively charged protons per second on a 1Â mm2 surface, then envisaged making two such beams collide in the form of a supercollider.[86]"]}}}
