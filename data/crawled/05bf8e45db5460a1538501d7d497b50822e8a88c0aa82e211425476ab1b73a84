Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years[82] to its present condition.[83] The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.[83]"]}}}
