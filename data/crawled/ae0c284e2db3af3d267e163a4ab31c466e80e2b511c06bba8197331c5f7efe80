Data was collected and repeatable measurements made in experiments.[61] Scientists then formed hypotheses to explain the results of these experiments.[62] The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of falsifiability to prove or disprove its accuracy.[62] The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.[60]"]}}}
