There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.[36][67] Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[36] The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves were exhausted.[68]"]}}}
