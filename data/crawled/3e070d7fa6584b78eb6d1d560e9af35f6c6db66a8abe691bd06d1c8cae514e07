Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from William Dean Howells, an editor of Harper's Magazine, the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality \"is that of extraordinary grasp and insight\",[151] albeit \"without the proper control and chastening\" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred.[152] His judgment that her opus was \"incomplete and unsatisfactory\" would be echoed in the essays of the New Critics in the 1930s."]}}}
