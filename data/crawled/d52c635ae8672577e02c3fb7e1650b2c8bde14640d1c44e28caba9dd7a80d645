According to R.M. Savory, \"'Sheikh Junayd was not content with spiritual authority and he sought material power'\". At that time, the most powerful dynasty in Persia was that of the Kara Koyunlu, the \"Black Sheep\", whose ruler Jahan Shah ordered Junāyd to leave Ardabil or else he would bring destruction and ruin upon the city.[23] Junayd sought refuge with the rival of Kara Koyunlu Jahan Shah, the Aq Qoyunlu (White Sheep Turkomans) Khan Uzun Hassan, and cemented his relationship by marrying Uzun Hassan's sister, Khadija Begum. Junayd was killed during an incursion into the territories of the Shirvanshah and was succeeded by his son Haydar Safavi."],"after":["Haydar married Martha 'Alamshah Begom,[33] Uzun Hassan's daughter, who gave birth to Ismail I, founder of the Safavid dynasty. Martha's mother Theodora—better known as Despina Khatun[51]—was a Pontic Greek princess, the daughter of the Grand Komnenos John IV of Trebizond. She had been married to Uzun Hassan[52] in exchange for protection of the Grand Komnenos from the Ottomans."]}}}
