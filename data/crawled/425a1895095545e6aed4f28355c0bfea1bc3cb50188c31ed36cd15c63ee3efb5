Aircraft may land on firm runways, helicopter landing pads, or even water (amphibious aircraft), snow or ice. To land, the airspeed and the rate of descent are reduced such that the aircraft descends at a slow enough rate to allow for a gentle touch down. Landing is accomplished by slowing down and descending. This speed reduction is accomplished by reducing thrust and/or inducing a greater amount of drag using flaps, landing gear or speed brakes. Splashdown (spacecraft landing) is an easier technical feat to accomplish, requiring only the deployment of a parachute, rather than successfully aviating the atmosphere.[3]"],"after":["All spaceplanes to date have used rocket engines with chemical fuels. As the orbital insertion burn has to be done in space, orbital spaceplanes require rocket engines for at least that portion of the flight."]}}}
