Testing was done by using ridge lift.[9] After tests on Hunter Mountain, New York in September 1965, he went on to promote \"slope soaring\" as a summer activity for ski resorts (apparently without great success).[10] NASA originated the term \"paraglider\" in the early 1960s, and ‘paragliding’ was first used in the early 1970s to describe foot-launching of gliding parachutes. Although their use is mainly recreational, unmanned paragliders have also been built for military applications e.g. Atair Insect."],"after":["The main application today of glider aircraft is sport and recreation."]}}}
