She was a daughter of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, and Philippa, Countess of Toulouse. After his fist husband was died, Agnes was secondly married to Ramiro II of Aragon; the couple probably wed on November 13 of 1135 in the cathedral of Jaca. The exact reason for the marriage was that Agnes had already borne children; if she could have four surviving children, then she would probably be able to give Ramiro a surviving heir. The couple had a daughter, Petronilla, who later succeeded her father as Queen of Aragon."]}}}
