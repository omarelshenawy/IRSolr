This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with FA called the \"action\" and FB the \"reaction\". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the action and which is called reaction; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.[24]"]}}}
