Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000.[118] The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa)[119] and Brachypodium distachyon,[120] has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally."]}}}
