(The combined paper was officially named The Washington Post and Times-Herald until 1973, although the Times-Herald portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent after the 1950s.) The merger left The Post with two remaining local competitors, the afternoon Washington Star (Evening Star) and The Washington Daily News, which merged in 1972 and folded in 1981. The Washington Times, established in 1982 by a subsidiary of the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon (1920–2012), has been a local conservative rival with a circulation (as of 2005[update]) about one-seventh that of The Post.[22] In the late 2000s additional editorially conservative competition increased with the foundation of the tabloid \"The Examiner\" of Washington by the new owners of the old Hearst paper, the \"San Francisco Examiner\" who engineered a swap trading the larger, more prosperous \"San Francisco Chronicle\" for the former Hearst \"flagship\" paper. They also started several other tabloid \"Examiners\" in several American cities, including briefly for two years in \"Baltimore Examiner\" going against the 170-year old \"Baltimore Sun\"."],"after":["After Phil Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to Katharine Graham (1917–2001), his wife and Meyer's daughter. Few women had run nationally prominent newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence based on her gender in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979 and headed The Washington Post Company into the early 1990s as chairman of the board and CEO. After 1993, she retained a position as chairman of the executive committee until her death in 2001."]}}}
