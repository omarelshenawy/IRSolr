The term state is also applied to federated states that are members of a federal union, which is the sovereign state.[1] Some states are subject to external sovereignty or hegemony where ultimate sovereignty lies in another state.[3] The state can also be used to refer to the secular branches of government within a state,[4] often as a manner of contrasting them with churches and civilian institutions."]}}}
