Pack,[46] the cancer had metastasized and returned rapidly.[44] She was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapy (a novel treatment at that time). Despite all available treatment, she became emaciated, weighing only 36 kg (79 lb) by June 1952.[citation needed] Evita died at the age of 33, at 20:25 on 26 July 1952. Radio broadcasts throughout the country were interrupted with the announcement that \"The Press Secretary's Office of the Presidency of the Nation fulfills its very sad duty to inform the people of the Republic that at 20:25 hours Mrs. Eva Perón, Spiritual Leader of the Nation, died.\"[47] Ordinary activities ceased; movies stopped playing; restaurants were closed and patrons were shown to the door."]}}}
