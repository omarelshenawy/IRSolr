Because countries of the Third World were noncommittal and non-aligned with both the First World and the Second World, they were targets for recruitment. In the quest for expanding their sphere of influence, the United States (core of the First World) tried to establish pro US regimes in the Third World. In addition, because the Soviet Union (core of the Second World) also wanted to expand, the Third World often became a site for conflict."],"after":["Some examples include Vietnam and Korea. Success lay with the First World if at the end of the war, the country became capitalistic and democratic, and with the Second World, if the country became communist. While Vietnam as a whole was eventually communized, only the northern half of Korea remained communist.[21][22] The Domino Theory largely governed United States policy regarding the Third World and their rivalry with the Second World.[23] In light of the Domino Theory, the U.S. saw winning the proxy wars in the Third World as a measure of the \"credibility of U.S. commitments all over the world.\"[24]"]}}}
