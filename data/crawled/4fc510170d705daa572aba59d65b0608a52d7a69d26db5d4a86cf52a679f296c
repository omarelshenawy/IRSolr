While defeating the forces of the Sassanid Empire there, the Muslim commander Utbah ibn Ghazwan erected his camp on the site of an old Persian settlement called Vaheštābād Ardašīr, which was destroyed by the Arabs.[4] The name Al-Basrah, which in Arabic means \"the over watching\" or \"the seeing everything\", was given to it because of its role as a military base against the Sassanid Empire.[citation needed] However, other sources claim the name originates from the Persian word Bas-rāh or Bassorāh meaning \"where many ways come together\".[5]"]}}}
