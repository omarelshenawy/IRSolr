Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget, the third largest in the world.[118] Japan is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced nineteen Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[119] three Fields medalists,[120] and one Gauss Prize laureate.[121] Some of Japan's more prominent technological contributions are in the fields of electronics, automobiles, machinery, earthquake engineering, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors and metals. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots as of 2013[update][122]â€”though their share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000.[123]"]}}}
