Thomas Hobbes,[153][154] Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter's main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.[152]"],"after":["Philosophy was never absent from Oxford's preoccupations. Oxford philosophers of the 20th century include Gilbert Ryle,[152] author of the influential The Concept of Mind, who spent his entire philosophical career at the university and Derek Parfit, who specialises in personal identity and related matters. Other commonly read modern philosophers to have studied at the university include A. J. Ayer,[152] Paul Grice, Thomas Nagel, known for his essay \"What Is it Like to Be a Bat?\", and Robert Nozick. John Searle, presenter of the Chinese room thought experiment, studied and began his academic career at the university.[155]"]}}}
