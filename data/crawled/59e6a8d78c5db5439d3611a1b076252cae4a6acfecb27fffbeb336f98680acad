In France the authorisation of the author, but not of the owner, is thus required if the piece is not just used secondarily or as a background on the image but intentionally or as its central and essential motif.[12]"],"after":["In Australia, freedom of panorama is dealt with in the federal Copyright Act 1968, sections 65 to 68. Section 65 provides: \"The copyright in a work ... that is situated, otherwise than temporarily, in a public place, or in premises open to the public, is not infringed by the making of a painting, drawing, engraving or photograph of the work or by the inclusion of the work in a cinematograph film or in a television broadcast.\" This applies to any \"artistic work\" as defined in paragraph (c) of section 10: a \"work of artistic craftsmanship\" (but not a circuit layout).[13] This means that other artworks, such as murals, are not covered by this provision.[14][15] Section 66 of the Act provides similar exceptions to copyright infringement for buildings.[13]"]}}}
