The word clock is derived ultimately (via Dutch, Northern French, and Medieval Latin) from the Celtic words clagan and clocca meaning \"bell\". A silent instrument missing such a mechanism has traditionally been known as a timepiece.[1] In general usage today a \"clock\" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time. Watches and other timepieces that can be carried on one's person are often distinguished from clocks.[2]"]}}}
