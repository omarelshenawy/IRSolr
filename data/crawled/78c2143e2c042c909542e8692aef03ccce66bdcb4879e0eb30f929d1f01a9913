Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to Yale from the University of Chicago to take a position as Professor of Anthropology. Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on \"Nahuatl tones and saltillo\". Sapir replied stating that it \"should by all means be published\";[16] however, it was not until 1993 that it was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen.[17]"]}}}
