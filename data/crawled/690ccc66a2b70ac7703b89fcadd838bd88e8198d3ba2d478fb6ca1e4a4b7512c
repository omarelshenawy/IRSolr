The name derives from the Latin quadrus, meaning square.[36] In general, a quadratic equation can be expressed in the form ,[37] where is not zero (if it were zero, then the equation would not be quadratic but linear). Because of this a quadratic equation must contain the term , which is known as the quadratic term. Hence , and so we may divide by and rearrange the equation into the standard form"],"after":["where the symbol \"Â±\" indicates that both"]}}}
