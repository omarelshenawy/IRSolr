Between 2007 and 2011, China's economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the G7 countries' growth combined.[256] According to the Global Growth Generators index announced by Citigroup in February 2011, China has a very high 3G growth rating.[257] Its high productivity, low labour costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing. However, the Chinese economy is highly energy-intensive and inefficient;[258] China became the world's largest energy consumer in 2010,[259] relies on coal to supply over 70% of its energy needs, and surpassed the US to become the world's largest oil importer in September 2013.[260][261] In the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles, weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy.[262][263][264]"]}}}
