Walter Isaacson, Einstein's biographer, described this as \"one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity.\" Einstein and Chaplin arrived together, in black tie, with Elsa joining them, \"beaming.\" The audience applauded as they entered the theater.[61] Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was \"possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis.\"[62]:322"],"after":["In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.[63][64]","While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He and his wife Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and turned in his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.[65] A few years later, the Nazis sold his boat and turned his cottage into an Aryan youth camp.[66]"]}}}
