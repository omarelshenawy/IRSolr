In the promotional tour, \"Give It 2 Me\" was performed as the fifth song of the setlist. Madonna wore a shiny black dress with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots.[51] Every time the chorus played, Madonna and her back-up dancers jumped up and down, while waving their hands up in the air.
