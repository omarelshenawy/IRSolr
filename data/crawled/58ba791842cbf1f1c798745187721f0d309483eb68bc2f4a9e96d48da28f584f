Timberlake would come in to the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head.[2] Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: \"We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like â€” it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'.\"[2] Timbaland stated that that the song resembles a \"2010 version\" of Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: \"Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'.\"[2]"]}}}
