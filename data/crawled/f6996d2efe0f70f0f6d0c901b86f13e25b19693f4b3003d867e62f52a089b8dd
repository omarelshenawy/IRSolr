His first solo success came with the single \"Solsbury Hill\", an autobiographical piece about a personal spiritual experience on top of the Iron Age hill fort, Solsbury Hill, in Somerset, England. Gabriel has said of the song's meaning, \"It's about being prepared to lose what you have for what you might get... It's about letting go.\"[25] Although mainly happy with the music, Gabriel felt that the album, and especially the track \"Here Comes the Flood\" was over-produced. Sparser versions can be heard on Robert Fripp's Exposure, and on Gabriel's greatest hits compilation Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats (1990)."]}}}
