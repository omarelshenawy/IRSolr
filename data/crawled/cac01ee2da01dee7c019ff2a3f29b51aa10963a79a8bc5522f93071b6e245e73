The diagram is tree-shaped in the sense that it branches at certain intervals, allowing the player to choose one sequence or another.[1] Typically, at the beginning of a session of a strategy game, a player may only have a few options for technologies to research. Each technology that a player researches will open up more options, but may or may not, depending on the computer game the player is playing, close off the paths to other options. The tech tree is the representation of all possible paths of research a player can take."]}}}
