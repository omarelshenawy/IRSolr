The video closes with Timberlake entering a recording booth, putting on headphones and saying, \"I'm ready.\"[3] Subsequently, on the singer's official site, a countdown leading up to Monday, January 14 at 12 a.m. ET appeared, and so there was speculation of a new single and album to break Timberlake's hiatus.[3] That timing coincided with a tweet that Power 105.1 radio personality Charlamagne posted, saying, \"Justin, Jay Z Timbaland. New record Monday\".[3]"]}}}
