It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour (Jesus Christ), the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to his faith in the final resurrection of the dead. In a more restricted sense, Baptist refers to people who are associated with Baptist churches."]}}}
