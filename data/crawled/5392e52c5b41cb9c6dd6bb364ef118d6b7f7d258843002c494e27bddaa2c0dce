Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine labeled it a \"trite, self-aggrandizing and often awkward song about privilege\" and a \"dour and robotic\" track.[12] Stylus Magazine gave a negative review and said that when one of the world's richest women complains about commercialism and the emptiness of entertainment culture, it seems hypocritical rather than insightful. He also noted that in the song, she's raging against the life she herself is leading.[13] Chuck Taylor of Billboard gave a negative review for the song, criticizing Madonna's rapping and calling the song \"a blurry snarl of style and composition that's sounds more like a disjointed medley than a song.\"[14] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was disappointed by the lyrics saying that \"what on earth might her extreme point of view involve? That the world is ruled by a shadowy cabal of super-intelligent lizards?... Sadly not. Her extreme point of view turns out to be that money can't buy you happiness and that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be.\" He also panned the lyric \"I like to express my extreme point of view\", saying that it's difficult to hear that line without feeling a prickle of excitement.[15]"]}}}
