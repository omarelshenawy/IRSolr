However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to fair use rights and limitation on ownership.[1] A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: \"it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression\".[10] Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a \"territory\", but rather as a concept: \"[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – `not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival.\"[11] The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise and/or undefined terms such as the \"public sphere\" or \"commons\", including concepts such as \"commons of the mind\", the \"intellectual commons\", and the \"information commons\".[7]"]}}}
