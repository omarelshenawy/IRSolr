In addition, obsidian, flint, and other minerals were mined, worked, and traded.[16] Early French explorers who encountered the sites[clarification needed] made no use of the metals due to the difficulties of transporting them,[16] but the copper was eventually traded throughout the continent along major river routes. In Saskatchewan, Canada, there also are ancient quartz mines near Waddy Lake and surrounding regions.[18]"]}}}
