Jon Pareles from The New York Times compared the concert with aerobics and said that the concert was more of a workout than being erotic.[19] Isabel Albiston from The Daily Telegraph compared the tour with the 2006 Confessions Tour and said that \"two years later, Madonnaâ€™s biceps are no smaller and, with the news that 100 pairs of fishnet pantyhose have been procured from eBay for the artist, her costumes no less raunchy. [...] Madonna seemed to have a point to prove.\"[18] Another review by Helen Brown from the same publication said that \"Sticky Sweet's highlights include a fresh, crunchy and gipsied-up 'La Isla Bonita' (complete with fiddles, flamenco and a spliced-in Romani folk tune) and a raved-up 'Like a Prayer'.\"[28] Sarah Liss from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commented that \"something about witnessing the 50-year-old crow's feet and wrinkles on Madonna's face, projected a hundred times larger than life, as she works her ass off (to paraphrase part of her stage banter) for a crowd of almost 20,000 feels more awe-inspiring than any of her old-school shock tactics.\"[17]"]}}}
