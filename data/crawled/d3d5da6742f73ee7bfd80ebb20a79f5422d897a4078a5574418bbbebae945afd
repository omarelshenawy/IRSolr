One must also be able to calculate the first and second derivatives of f(x). Remez' algorithm requires an ability to calculate , , and to extremely high precision. The entire algorithm must be carried out to higher precision than the desired precision of the result."],"after":["Remez' algorithm is typically started by choosing the extrema of the Chebyshev polynomial as the initial points, since the final error function will be similar to that polynomial."]}}}
