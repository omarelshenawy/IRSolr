In 1984 Talla started an event called Technoclub on Sunday afternoons at Frankfurts Disco No name, which then moved to the Dorian Gray club in 1987. Talla's club spot served as the hub for the regional EBM and electronic music scene, and according to JÃ¼rgen Laarmann, of Frontpage magazine, it had historical merit in being the first club in Germany to play almost exclusively electronic dance music. Technoclub was \"more or less an underground thing for suburban kids,\" it was, according to Laarmann, \"never really hip to go there.\"[105]"]}}}
