It ranks as one of the largest and best print room collections in existence alongside the Albertina in Vienna, the Paris collections and the Hermitage. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections.[64] The department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.[65]"]}}}
