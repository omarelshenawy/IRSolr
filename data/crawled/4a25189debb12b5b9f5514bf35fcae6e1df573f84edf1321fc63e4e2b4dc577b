Roughly 298Â million Chinese in rural areas do not have access to safe drinking water,[135] and 40% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011.[136] This crisis is compounded by increasingly severe water shortages, particularly in the north-east of the country.[137][138]"]}}}
