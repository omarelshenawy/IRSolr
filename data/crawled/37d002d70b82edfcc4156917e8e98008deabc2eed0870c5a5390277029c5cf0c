The name \"telescope\" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, Giovanni Demisiani,[116] at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei.[117] The name was derived from the Greek tele = 'far' and skopein = 'to look or see'. In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects.[118] By 1624 Galileo had used[119] a compound microscope. He gave one of these instruments to Cardinal Zollern in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of Bavaria,[120] and in September he sent another to Prince Cesi.[121] The Linceans played a role again in naming the \"microscope\" a year later when fellow academy member Giovanni Faber coined the word for Galileo's invention from the Greek words μικρόν (micron) meaning \"small\", and σκοπεῖν (skopein) meaning \"to look at\". The word was meant to be analogous with \"telescope\".[122][123] Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo's microscopes, and published in 1625, appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound microscope.[124]"]}}}
