Skew coordinates are compatible with the affine structure of En, but make formulae for angles and distances more complicated."],"after":["Another approach, which goes in line with ideas of differential geometry and conformal geometry, is orthogonal coordinates, where coordinate hypersurfaces of different coordinates are orthogonal, although curved. Examples include the polar coordinate system on Euclidean plane, the second important plane coordinate system."]}}}
