Examples of simple bondage techniques are the \"spread eagle\", where the restrained partner's each limb is tied to a different corner of a bed,[14] or the \"hogtie\", where the restrained partner's hands and feet are both tied, and the ropes tying these are connected with each other, holding the restrained partner in a bent position.
