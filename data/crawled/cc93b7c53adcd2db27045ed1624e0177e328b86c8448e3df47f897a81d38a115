In 1829, he served as editor for the gift book The Token, making him the only person to be editor in the book's 15-year history besides its founder, Samuel Griswold Goodrich.[16] That year, Willis founded the American Monthly Magazine,[11] which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831.[4] He blamed its failure on the \"tight purses of Boston culture\"[14] and moved to Europe to serve as foreign editor and correspondent of the New York Mirror.[4] In 1832, while in Florence, Italy, he met Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a bust of the writer.[17] Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the Mirror, about half of which were later collected as Pencillings by the Way, printed in London in 1835.[18] The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy. The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.[19]"],"after":["Despite this popularity, he was censured by some critics for indiscretion in reporting private conversations. At one point he fought a bloodless duel with Captain Frederick Marryat, then editor of the Metropolitan Magazine, after Willis sent a private letter of Marryat's to George Pope Morris, who had it printed.[20] Still, in 1835 Willis was popular enough to introduce Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to important literary figures in England, including Ada Byron, daughter of Lord Byron.[21]"]}}}
