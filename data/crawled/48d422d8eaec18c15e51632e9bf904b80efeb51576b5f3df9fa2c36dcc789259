One of the first people to popularize the use of the double bass drum setup was jazz drummer Louie Bellson,[16] who came up with the idea when he was still in high school. Also popularized by Keith Moon, Ginger Baker, and Billy Cobham,[17] double bass drums were used initially by jazz artists such as Ray McKinley and Ed Shaughnessy in the 1940s and 1950s, and popularized in the 1960s by rock drummers Ginger Baker of Cream, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Keith Moon of The Who and Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. Double bass drumming later became an integral part of many genres of heavy metal.[18] For example, the heavy metal gallop. Carmine Appice, Ian Paice, Cozy Powell and Tommy Aldridge are among the double bass pioneers in metal music. American thrash metal band Slayer's drummer Dave Lombardo earned title as \"the godfather of double bass\" from Drummer World, as well as American Crossover Thrash metal band D.R.I.'s drummer Felix Griffin who is considered one of the first Fathers of Crossover. Dave Lombardo, as well as other crossover, thrash metal, and thrashcore bands have cited Felix as one of the first pioneers."]}}}
