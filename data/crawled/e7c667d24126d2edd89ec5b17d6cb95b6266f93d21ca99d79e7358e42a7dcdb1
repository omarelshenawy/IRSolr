Thanks to coal (the French word \"houille\" was coined in Wallonia),[114] the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its Sillon industriel, 'Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, (...) there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'.[115] Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: \"It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain.\"[116] \"The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of Ghent.\"[117] Michel De Coster, Professor at the Université de Liège wrote also: \"The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory (...) But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated\" [118]"],"after":[]}}}
