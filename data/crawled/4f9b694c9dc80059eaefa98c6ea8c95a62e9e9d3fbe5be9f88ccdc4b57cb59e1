Until 1995, the network signed off the air between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. daily â€“ in that year, it launched an overnight program, CBC Radio Overnight, which airs international news and documentary programs."],"after":["Until 1958, the CBC was not only a broadcaster, but the principal broadcast regulator in Canada. It used this dual role to snap up most of Canada's clear-channel frequencies on the AM dial. However, in the 1990s, many of the CBC's AM stations moved to FM in response to complaints of poor AM reception. This meant that the old distinction between the AM \"Radio\" network and the FM \"Stereo\" network was no longer accurate, even though many of the FM \"Radio\" stations broadcast in mono only. As a result, in 1997 CBC Radio became CBC Radio One and CBC Stereo became CBC Radio 2. Although several Radio One stations still broadcast on AM as of 2008, most also have FM rebroadcasters in major urban centres within their broadcast area. The channel was added to the Sirus lineup in 2005 and the XM lineup in 2013."]}}}
