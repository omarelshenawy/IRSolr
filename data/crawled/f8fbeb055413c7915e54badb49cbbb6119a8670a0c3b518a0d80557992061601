It was both a critical and chart success, peaking at #13 on the Billboard 200 and #2 on the Top Country Albums. It was certified DIamond status by the RIAA for the sale of 10 million copies in the US. This album contains Brooks earliest hits, for instance his first ever single, \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\", which peaked at #3 on the Country Billboard Charts in 1989. It put an independent cowboy singer, Chris LeDoux, into the mainstream due to the lyric \"a worn out tape of Chris LeDoux\". Two other strong starts include his first #1, \"If Tomorrow Never Comes\" and the Academy of Country Music's 1990 Song of the Year and Video of the Year, \"The Dance\" (another #1)."]}}}
