Both became big club hits in the United States, reaching number three on Hot Dance Club Songs chart compiled by Billboard magazine.[23] After this success, she started developing her debut album, Madonna, which was primarily produced by Reggie Lucas, a Warner Bros. producer.[24] However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas' production techniques, so decided to seek additional help. Madonna moved in with boyfriend John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, asking his help for finishing the album's production.[24] Benitez remixed most of the tracks and produced \"Holiday\", which was her third single and her first global hit. The overall sound of Madonna was dissonant and in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the OB-X synthesizer.[24][25] The album was released in July 1983 and peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 six months later, in 1984. It yielded two more hit singles, \"Borderline\" and \"Lucky Star\".[26][27]"]}}}
