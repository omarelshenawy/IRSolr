The major contributing factor was moving the broadcast date to Thursday instead of Sunday, the day MTV been using since 2004 with the exception in 2006. MTV also moved up the telecast to 8pm instead of 9pm, to avoid competing with President Barack Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and this was early for MTV's targeted young audience.[88]"],"after":["2013: For the show's 30th anniversary, MTV redesigned its famous moon-man statue[89] for one year only due to the ceremony's being held in Brooklyn for the first time. Brooklyn artist KAWS used his famous Michelin Man as inspiration to redesign the image of the renowned MTV moon-man. Barclays Center, which served as the venue for the 2013 show, was decorated also by KAWS, themed around the resigned moon-man. The 2013 MTV Video Music Awards also marks the fourth time in the awards show history that a host had not been appointed for the annual event.[90]"]}}}
