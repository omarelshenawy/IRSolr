The earliest full manuscripts with French Gothic illustrations date to the middle of the 13th century.[11] Many such illuminated manuscripts were royal bibles, although psalters also included illustrations; the Parisian Psalter of Saint Louis, dating from 1253 to 1270, features 78 full-page illuminations in tempera paint and gold leaf.[12]"],"after":["During the late 1200s, scribes began to create prayer books for the laity, often known as books of hours due to their use at prescribed times of the day.[12] The earliest known example seems to have written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240. Nobility frequently purchased such texts, paying handsomely for decorative illustrations; among the most well-known creators of these is Jean Pucelle, whose Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux was commissioned by King Charles IV as a gift for his queen, Jeanne d'Ã‰vreux.[13] Elements of the French Gothic present in such works include the use of decorative page framing reminiscent of the architecture of the time with elongated and detailed figures.[12] The use of spatial indicators such as building elements and natural features such as trees and clouds also denote the French Gothic style of illumination.[12]"]}}}
