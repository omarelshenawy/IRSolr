By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed. Strategic bombers were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used Zeppelins as well.[241] Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with HMSÂ Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in 1918.[242]"]}}}
