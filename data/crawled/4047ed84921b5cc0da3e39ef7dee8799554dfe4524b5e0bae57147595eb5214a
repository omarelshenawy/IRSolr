G. Wells in 1901.[30] The shorter term space is actually older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth's sky in John Milton's Paradise Lost in 1667.[31]"],"after":["According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe originated in an extremely hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago[32] and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogenâ€”the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space.[33] The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.[34] As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable Universe.[33] This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite."]}}}
