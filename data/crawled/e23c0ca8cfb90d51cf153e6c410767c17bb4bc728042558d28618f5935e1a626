At a concert, Ricky Martin gave a picture of George W. Bush the finger to protest the War in Iraq.[46] Serbian protesters gave the finger to the Russian embassy regarding their support of Slobodan Milošević.[47] Artist Ai Weiwei has used the finger in photographs and sculptures as a political statement.[48] As a political message to the Czech President, Czech artist David Cerny floated an outsize, purple statue of a hand on the River Vltava in Prague; its middle finger extended towards Prague Castle, the Presidential seat.[49]"],"after":["The use of the middle finger has become pervasive in popular culture. The band Cobra Starship released a song called \"Middle Finger\", and released a music video that showed people giving the finger.[50] Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan installed a marble statue of a middle finger measuring 11 metres (36 ft), located directly in front of the Milan Stock Exchange.[51] A now-famous photograph of Johnny Cash shows him giving the middle finger to a photographer during a 1969 concert at San Quentin State Prison, released as At San Quentin.[52] However, the photo remained fairly obscure until 1998, when producer Rick Rubin made it the centerpiece of an ad in Billboard criticizing country radio for not giving airplay to Cash's Grammy-winning album Unchained.[53] Cameron Diaz made the gesture during a photo shoot for Esquire.[54] Harold Lloyd shot the finger to his own reflection in a Coney Island funhouse after getting paint on his suit in Speedy, his final silent feature, from 1928.[55]"]}}}
