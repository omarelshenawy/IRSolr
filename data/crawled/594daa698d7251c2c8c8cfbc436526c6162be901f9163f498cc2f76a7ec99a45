With his model, which described a system of production and demand processes, Leontief described how changes in demand in one economic sector would influence production in another.[51] In practice, Leontief estimated the coefficients of his simple models, to address economically interesting questions. In production economics, \"Leontief technologies\" produce outputs using constant proportions of inputs, regardless of the price of inputs, reducing the value of Leontief models for understanding economies but allowing their parameters to be estimated relatively easily. In contrast, the von Neumann model of an expanding economy allows for choice of techniques, but the coefficients must be estimated for each technology.[52][53]"],"after":[]}}}
