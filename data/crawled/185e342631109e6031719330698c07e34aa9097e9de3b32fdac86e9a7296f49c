He grew up in Pound, Virginia, just across the state border. Graduating from Milligan College in Tennessee, in 1950, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. After completing his advanced training with USAF Pilot Training Class 52-H at Williams AFB, AZ, Powers was assigned to the 468th Strategic Fighter Squadron at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia, as an F-84 Thunderjet pilot. According to his son, he did not fly combat missions during the Korean War, because he was recruited by the CIA for his outstanding record in single engine jet aircraft.[2] By 1960, Powers was already a veteran of many covert aerial reconnaissance missions.[citation needed]"],"after":[]}}}
