The earliest dateable example of the language is the Behistun Inscription of the Achaemenid Darius I (r. 522 BCâ€“ca. 486 BC).[citation needed] Although purportedly older texts also exist (such as the inscription on the tomb of Cyrus II at Pasargadae), these are actually younger examples of the language.[citation needed] Old Persian was written in Old Persian cuneiform, a script unique to that language and is generally assumed to be an invention of Darius I's reign."]}}}
