Cap Anson was the first to join the club on July 18, 1897, although his precise career hit total is unclear.[a] Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb became the club's fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927, ultimately finishing his career with more than 4,100.[6][b] Cobb, also MLB's all-time career batting average leader, remained the MLB hit leader until September 11, 1985, when Pete Rose collected his 4,192nd hit.[10] Rose, the current record holder, finished his career with 4,256 hits, an achievement that on its own would have qualified him for the Hall of Fame had Major League Baseball not banned him for life due to Rose's having gambled on games as a manager. Roberto Clemente's career ended with precisely 3,000 hits, reaching the mark in the last at bat of his career.[11][12][c] Derek Jeter is the most recent player to reach the milestone, achieving the feat on July 9, 2011.[15]"]}}}
