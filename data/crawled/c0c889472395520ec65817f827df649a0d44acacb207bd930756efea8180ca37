In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with Umlaut, namely ä, ö and ü, as well as the Eszett or scharfes s (sharp s), ß. In Switzerland \"ss\" is used instead of \"ß\". Additionally, when written in capitals, \"ß\" is replaced with \"SS\" in Germany, while in Austria it is traditionally replaced with \"SZ\" (the same digraph used in Hungarian for the \"s\" sound); there are some exceptions to these rules (see below)."]}}}
