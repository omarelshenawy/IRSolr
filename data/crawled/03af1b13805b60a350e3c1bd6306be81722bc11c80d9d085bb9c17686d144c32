Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War, forcing it to cede West Karelia and Ingria (two regions lost by Russia in the Time of Troubles),[62] as well as Estland and Livland, securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.[63] On the Baltic Sea Peter founded a new capital called Saint Petersburg, later known as Russia's \"Window to Europe\". Peter the Great's reforms brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia."]}}}
