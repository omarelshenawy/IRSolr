It has been translated as \"near the great hill\",[63] \"by the blue hills\", \"at the little big hill\", or \"at the range of hills\", referring to the Blue Hills, or in particular the Great Blue Hill which is located on the boundary of Milton and Canton.[64][65] Alternatively, Massachusett has been represented as Moswetuset, from the name of the Moswetuset Hummock (meaning \"hill shaped like an arrowhead\") in Quincy where Plymouth Colony commander Miles Standish and Squanto, a Native American, met Chief Chickatawbut in 1621.[66][67]"]}}}
