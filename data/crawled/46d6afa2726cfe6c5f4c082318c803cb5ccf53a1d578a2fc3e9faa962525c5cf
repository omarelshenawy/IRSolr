This definition is usually written as"],"after":["When the index set is the natural numbers , the function is a sequence denoted by . A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite as in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers"]}}}
