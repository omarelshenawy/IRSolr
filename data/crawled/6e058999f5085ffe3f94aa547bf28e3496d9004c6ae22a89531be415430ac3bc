Taylor wrote that Bismarck was reluctant for war as it \"deprived him of control and left the decisions to the generals whose ability he distrusted.\" (The two most important personalities within the Prussian army were the War Minister Albrecht Graf von Roon and Chief of the General Staff Helmuth Graf von Moltke.) Taylor suggested that Bismarck was hoping to force Austrian leaders into concessions in Germany, rather than provoke war.
