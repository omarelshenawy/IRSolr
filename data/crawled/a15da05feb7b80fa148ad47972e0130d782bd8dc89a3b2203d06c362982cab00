The set of definable subsets of over some parameters is a Boolean algebra. By Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras there is a natural dual notion to this. One can consider this to be the topological space consisting of maximal consistent sets of formulae over . We call this the space of (complete) -types over , and write ."],"after":["One can show that for any -type , there exists some elementary extension of and some so that is the type of over ."]}}}
