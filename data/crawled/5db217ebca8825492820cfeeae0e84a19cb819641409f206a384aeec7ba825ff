The Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley described Jackson in 2003 as \"extremely important\" and a \"genius\".[397] For much of his career, he had an \"unparalleled\" level of worldwide influence over the younger generation through his musical and humanitarian contributions.[201] Jackson's music and videos, such as Thriller, fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster, helped to put the relatively new channel into public awareness, and steered the channel's focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring. Jackson's work continues to influence numerous hip hop, rock, pop and R&B artists. BET described Jackson \"as quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time\" and someone who \"revolutionized the music video and brought dances like the moonwalk to the world. Jackson's sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres.\"[398]"]}}}
