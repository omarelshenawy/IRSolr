It was spoken in the area near the northern border. The name \"Fingal\" is from the Irish Fine Gall, or \"territory of foreigners\", probably a reference to a Norse settlement in the area. Linguist Alf Sommerfelt proposed the idea of a Norse influence on the Fingallian dialect, though later scholars have found no evidence of such a connection.[2]"]}}}
