That was all a bit of a yawn for me, and only appealed to female audiences...I felt if you could appeal to the boys as well, you'd be laughing.\"[19] In February 1994, Heart Management – which comprised the Herberts together with financier Chic Murphy – placed an advertisement in The Stage trade magazine asking; \"WANTED: R.U. 18–23 with the ability to sing/dance? R.U. streetwise, outgoing, ambitious, and dedicated? Heart Management Ltd. are a widely successful music industry management consortium currently forming a choreographed, singing/dancing, all-female pop act for a recording deal. Open audition. Danceworks, 16 Balderton Street. Friday 4 March. 11 am-5:30 pm. Please bring sheet music or backing cassette\".[20] About 400 women who answered the ad went to Dance Works studios. There, they were put into groups of 10 and danced a routine to \"Stay\" by Eternal. After that, the selection continued and the girls had to sing solo songs. Victoria Adams sang \"Mein Herr\", Melanie Brown sang \"Greatest Love of All\", Melanie Chisholm sang \"I'm So Excited\", Michelle Stephenson sang \"Don't Be a Stranger\". After the auditions, the women returned home and waited for some weeks. Geri Halliwell had seen the ad but went skiing in Spain and missed the audition because her face got sunburnt."],"after":["In April 1994, the women got a call and were down to the last 12. They went to Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush. The women chosen were Suzanne Tinker (who did not attend), Melanie Laccohee, Lianne Morgan, Tracey Shield, Michelle Stephenson, Brown, Chisholm (who did not attend), Victoria Adams, and a few others. Halliwell saw the ad after two months, and decided to call. The management let her in to the last 12, so she was one of them. After arriving, the women had a little solo interview, in which Halliwell sang \"I Wanna Be a Nightclub Queen\". After the interviews, they were divided into three groups of four and they created a routine for \"Just a Step from Heaven\" by Eternal. In one group there was Adams, Brown, Stephenson and Morgan. After a dance, Halliwell joined and she was taught their dance. Later, they sang solo songs and Brown sang \"Queen of the Night\". Those five were told they had been picked while they were having a cup of tea. After the auditions, the women returned home and waited a couple of weeks. Tinker passed the first audition, but could not attend the second because her train was delayed due to a bomb scare, and she did not want to go in late. Chisholm passed the first audition, but could not attend the second because she had problems with her tonsils. Her mother called the management to ask for another chance and they told her they had whittled their choice down to ten women, including Chisholm. They said if they did not find the five or if there was one who they were not sure about, they would give her another chance. One week later, the women were called and asked to attend a recall. They were not sure how many women they wanted. If they had wanted four, one of them would have been picked out. They met again in Nomis Studios. Morgan received a letter and she was told she looked too old for the other women, and was replaced with Chisholm. The women had learned \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\" and sang it on their own and in a group. They were finally selected and told they were going to be a band. Sunday of that week, they spent a week in a guest house in Surrey. The first afternoon, they went to Trinity Studios to learn \"Take Me Away\". Pepi Lemer trained them for the week. After that week, they did a showcase for Murphy. Dressed in black and white in different combinations, they sang the song they had prepared \"Take Me Away\". The group was given the name Touch,[19] and moved into a house together in Maidenhead, Berkshire, (owned by Murphy) where they were subsidised by Heart Management. They spent the spring and summer rehearsing at a house in Boyn Hill Road, Maidenhead. Chisholm and Brown shared rooms, Adams and Stephenson shared a second bedroom and Halliwell had a small room to herself."]}}}
