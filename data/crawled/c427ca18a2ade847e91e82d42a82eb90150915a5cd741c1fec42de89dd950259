Sales were poor compared to previous U2 releases.[96] The band was hurried into completing the album in time for the impending pre-booked tour, and Bono admitted that the album \"didn't communicate the way it was intended to\".[97]"],"after":["The subsequent tour, PopMart, commenced in April 1997. Like Zoo TV, it poked fun at pop culture and was intended as a send-up of commercialism. The stage included a 100-foot (30 m) tall golden yellow arch (reminiscent of the McDonald's logo), a 150-foot (46 m) long video screen, and a 40-foot (12 m) tall mirrorball lemon. U2's \"big shtick\" failed, however, to satisfy many who were seemingly confused by the band's new kitsch image and elaborate sets.[98] The postponement of Pop‍ '​s release date to complete the album meant rehearsal time for the tour was severely reduced, and performances in early shows suffered.[99] A highlight of the tour was the concert in Sarajevo where U2 were the first major group to perform there following the Bosnian War.[100] Mullen described the concert as \"an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile.\"[101] Bono called the show \"one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life\".[102] One month after the conclusion of the PopMart Tour, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, \"Trash of the Titans\", in which Homer Simpson disrupted the band on stage during a PopMart concert.[103]"]}}}
