The bassist Charles Mingus is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres."],"after":["The first major stirrings came in the 1950s, with the early work of Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor. In the 1960s, exponents included Archie Shepp, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Pharaoh Sanders and John Coltrane. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, a rhythm section honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. Coltrane championed many younger free jazz musicians, notably Archie Shepp), and under his influence Impulse! Records became a leading free jazz record label."]}}}
