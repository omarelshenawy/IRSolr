Almirante Latorre was made the flagship of the navy.[16] The dreadnought was frequently used by Alessandri for various functions, including as transport to Vallenar after a 1922 earthquake,[16][48] and to Talcahuano for the grand opening of a new naval drydock in 1924.[16] In 1925, with the fall of the January Junta, the ship hosted Alessandri after his return from exile. In September, the last month of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's Edward, Prince of Wales, on board the battleship.[49]"]}}}
