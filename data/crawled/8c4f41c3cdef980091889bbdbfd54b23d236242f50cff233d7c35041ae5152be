All five are rocket gliders. Only rockets and rocket-powered aircraft have thus far succeeded in reaching space. Two of these five (X-15 and SpaceShipOne) are rocket-powered aircraft, having been carried up to an altitude of several tens of thousands of feet by an atmospheric aircraft mother ship before release. Three (Space Shuttle, Buran, and X-37) are vertical takeoff horizontal landing (VTHL) vehicles relying upon rocket lift for the ascent phase in reaching space and atmospheric lift for reentry, descent and landing."],"after":["Significant features distinguish spaceplanes from spacecraft."]}}}
