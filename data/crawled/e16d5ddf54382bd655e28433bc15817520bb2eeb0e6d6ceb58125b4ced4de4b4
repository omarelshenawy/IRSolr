It was the first time since \"Burning Up\" (1983) a Madonna single did not reach the Hot 100. However, it peaked at number one on both Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Singles Sales component charts.[41] The debut of the \"Hollywood\" remixes on the Dance Singles Sales chart gave Madonna her longest stretch of chart-topping titles on this chart, \"Hollywood\" being her sixth in a row.[42] This stretch began with \"Music\" in 2000, followed by \"Don't Tell Me\", \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", \"Die Another Day\" and \"American Life\".[42] \"Hollywood\" was Madonna's 22nd number-one on the Dance Singles Sales chart, the most for any artist. On the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart, the song debuted at number four, but did not accumulate enough points to appear on the Hot 100.[42] At the 2003 Billboard Year-end recap, Madonna was the number two Dance Club Play artist and the top Dance Singles artist. \"Hollywood\" was ranked at numbers 19, 7 and 45 on the Hot Dance Club Play, Hot Dance Singles Sales and Hot Singles Sales charts respectively.[43] Other than the dance charts, \"Hollywood\" also reached a peak of numberÂ 35 on the Hot Adult Singles Chart.[41] In Canada, the song peaked at number five on Canadian Singles Chart.[41]"]}}}
