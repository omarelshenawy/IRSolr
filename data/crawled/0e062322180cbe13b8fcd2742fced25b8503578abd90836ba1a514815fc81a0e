However, in 1702 Leibniz said that no polynomial of the type x4 + a4 (with a real and distinct from 0) can be written in such a way. Later, Nikolaus Bernoulli made the same assertion concerning the polynomial x4 −  4x3 + 2x2 + 4x + 4, but he got a letter from Euler in 1742[1] in which he was told that his polynomial happened to be equal to"],"after":["where α is the square root of 4 + 2√7. Also, Euler mentioned that"]}}}
