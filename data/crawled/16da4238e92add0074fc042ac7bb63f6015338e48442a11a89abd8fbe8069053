His name led him to be associated with Pythian Apollo; Aristippus explained his name by saying, \"He spoke (agor-) the truth no less than did the Pythian (Pyth-)\", and Iamblichus tells the story that the Pythia prophesied that his pregnant mother would give birth to a man supremely beautiful, wise, and beneficial to humankind.[11] A late source gives his mother's name as Pythais.[12] As to the date of his birth, Aristoxenus stated that Pythagoras left Samos in the reign of Polycrates, at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 BC.[13]"]}}}
