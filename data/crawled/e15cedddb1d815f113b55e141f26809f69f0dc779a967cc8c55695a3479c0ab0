This implies that the likelihood that a number less than n is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in n. A more accurate estimate for π(n) is given by the offset logarithmic integral"],"after":["The prime number theorem also implies estimates for the size of the n-th prime number pn (i.e., p1 = 2, p2 = 3, etc.): up to a bounded factor, pn grows like n log(n).[27] In particular, the prime gaps, i.e. the differences pn − pn−1 of two consecutive primes, become arbitrarily large. This latter statement can also be seen in a more elementary way by noting that the sequence n! + 2, n! + 3, …, n! + n (for the notation n! read factorial) consists of n − 1 composite numbers, for any natural number n."]}}}
