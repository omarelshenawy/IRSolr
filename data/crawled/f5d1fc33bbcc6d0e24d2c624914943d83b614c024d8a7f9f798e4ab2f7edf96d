The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[46]"],"after":["The Vice-Chancellor, currently Andrew Hamilton,[3] is the de facto head of the university. Five Pro-Vice-Chancellors have specific responsibilities for Education; Research; Planning and Resources; Development and External Affairs; and Personnel and Equal Opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the Vice-Chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by Congregation, in addition to observers from the students' union. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council. Only Oxford and Cambridge (which is similarly structured) have this democratic form of governance."]}}}
