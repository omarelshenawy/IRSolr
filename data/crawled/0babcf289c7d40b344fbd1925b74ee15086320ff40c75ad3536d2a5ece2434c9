Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart's opera La finta giardiniera.[30]"],"after":["In August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg[32] and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to Augsburg, Mannheim, Paris, and Munich.[33]","Mozart became acquainted with members of the famous orchestra in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with Aloysia Weber, one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing,[34] and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778[35] to continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a possible post as an organist at Versailles, but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment.[36] He fell into debt and took to pawning valuables.[37] The nadir of the visit occurred when Mozart's mother was taken ill and died on 3 July 1778.[38] There had been delays in calling a doctor—probably, according to Halliwell, because of a lack of funds.[39] Mozart stayed with Melchior Grimm, who, as personal secretary of the Duke d'Orléans, lived in his mansion.[40]"]}}}
