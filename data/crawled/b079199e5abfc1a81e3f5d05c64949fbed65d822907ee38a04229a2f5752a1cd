He wears a flannel jacket and a cowboy hat, and makes small talk with the fans as he makes his way around the floor. His cart is full of empty soda cans and rubbish and a sign that reads different sayings that vary from show to show, including, \"No thought control\" on one side and, \"Homeless people need money for booze and hookers\" on the other. His cart also contains the original stuffed \"Pink\" doll from 1979.[24]"]}}}
