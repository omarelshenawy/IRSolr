The line bisecting the shield horizontally symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford from east to west and the canals in the borough.[57] The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families.[57] The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry.[57] The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham.[57] The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.[57]"]}}}
