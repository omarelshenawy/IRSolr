He stepped down from the presidency to lead Mexican troops in quashing the revolt. Sam Houston was named commander of the Texian army, and sent Jim Bowie to destroy the Alamo to keep it out of Mexican control. Bowie and William B. Travis chose instead to lead the Alamo defenders in what became the most famous battle of Texas history. At the later Goliad massacre on Easter Sunday, 400 Texians were executed by the Mexican army. Terrified civilians fled east away from the approaching Mexican army. The Texian army also moved east, but to a Brazos River training site, causing many to erroneously believe Houston was running away. Under a false sense of complacency, Santa Anna was asleep and his army was on stand-down on April 21, 1836, when shouts of \"Remember the Alamo!\" and \"Remember Goliad!\" pierced the air as Texians overran them, winning the decisive Battle of San Jacinto (monument pictured) in 18 minutes. Santa Anna fled on horseback but was captured the next day. (Full article...)"]}}}
