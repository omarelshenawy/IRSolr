In addition, because of various processing factors (principally scorch, this being the premature cross-linking of rubbers due to the influence of heat), the choice of accelerator is governed by different rules to other diene rubbers. Most conventionally used accelerators are problematic when CR rubbers are cured and the most important accelerant has been found to be ethylene thiourea (ETU) which, although being an excellent and proven accelerator for polychloroprene, has been classified as reprotoxic. The European rubber industry has started a research project SafeRubber[8] to develop a safer alternative to the use of ETU."],"after":["\"Room-temperature vulcanizing\" (RTV) silicone is constructed of reactive oil base polymers combined with strengthening mineral fillers.
