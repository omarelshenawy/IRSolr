Pharaoh capitulated after the tenth plague, triggering the Exodus of the Hebrew people. The plagues were designed to contrast the power of Yahweh with the impotence of Egypt's various gods.[1] Some commentators have associated several of the plagues with judgment on specific gods associated with the Nile, fertility and natural phenomena.[2] The plagues of Egypt are also mentioned in the Quran (7,133–136).[3] According to Exodus 12:12, all the gods of Egypt would be judged through the tenth and final plague: \"On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.\""]}}}
