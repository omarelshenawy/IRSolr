No degrees were given in the years 1417–30; at times there were only eight or nine professors.[6] Emperor Sigismund, son of Charles IV, took what was left into his personal property and some progress was made. The emperor Ferdinand I called the Jesuits to Prague and in 1562 they opened an academy—the Clementinum. From 1541 till 1558 the Czech humanist Mattheus Collinus (1516–1566) was a professor of Greek language.[10] Some progress was made again when the emperor Rudolph II took up residence in Prague. In 1609 the obligatory celibacy of the professors was abolished.[11] In 1616 the Jesuit Academy became a university. (It could award academic degrees.)[11]"]}}}
