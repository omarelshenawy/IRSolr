S. Gilbert about how female fairies cope with a sudden introduction to them of men and \"mortal love\". This is one of several \"fairy comedies\" by Gilbert, and it established him as a writer of wide range, propelling him beyond the burlesques he had produced in his early career, and leading towards his famous Savoy operas."]}}}
