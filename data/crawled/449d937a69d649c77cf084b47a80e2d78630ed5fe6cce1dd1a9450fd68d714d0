The same is true of the minimum of f. These statements are not, in general, true if the function is defined on an open interval (a,b) (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function f(x) = 1/x, defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above."],"after":["is continuous, as can be shown. The converse does not hold: for example, the absolute value function","is everywhere continuous. However, it is not differentiable at x = 0 (but is so everywhere else). Weierstrass's function is everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable."]}}}
