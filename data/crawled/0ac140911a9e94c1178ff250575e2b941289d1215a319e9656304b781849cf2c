Three Andean ranges run north and south through the western half of the country (about 45% of the country's territory.) The eastern part is a vast lowland which can be generally divided into two regions: a huge open savanna on the north (Llanos), and the Amazon in the south (400,000 km²). A country of geographical contrasts and extremes. As well as the features mentioned, it has such curiosities as the desert of La Guajira, the peninsula in the most north-eastern tip of the country; the jungle of the Pacific coast which holds one of the world's rainfall records; and finally the La Macarena National Park an isolated mountain formation about 120 km long, rising abruptly from the eastern plains to some 2500 meters. Colombia also has several small islands. The major ones are the archipelago of San Andrés and Providencia in the Caribbean Sea, the Islas del Rosario and San Bernardo along the Caribbean coast, and Gorgona and Malpelo in the Pacific Ocean."]}}}
