The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism.[347] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially in the twentieth century.[346]"]}}}
