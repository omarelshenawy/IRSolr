Melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while Canberra was being constructed.[73] The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in 1911.[74] In 1914, Australia joined Britain in fighting World War I, with support from both the outgoing Commonwealth Liberal Party and the incoming Australian Labor Party.[75][76] Australians took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front.[77] Of about 416,000 who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.[78] Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) at Gallipoli as the birth of the nationâ€”its first major military action.[79][80] The Kokoda Track campaign is regarded by many as an analogous nation-defining event during World War II.[81]"]}}}
