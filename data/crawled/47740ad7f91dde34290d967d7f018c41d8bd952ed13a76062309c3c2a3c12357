Although aforementioned translations are most obvious of them, they have the same structure for any affine space and do not show a distinctive character of Euclidean geometry. Another family of symmetries leave one point fixed, which may be seen as the origin without loss of generality. All transformations, which preserves the origin and the Euclidean metric, are linear maps. Such transformations Q must, for any x and y, satisfy:"],"after":["Such transforms constitute a group called the orthogonal group O(n). Its elements Q are exactly solutions of a matrix equation"]}}}
