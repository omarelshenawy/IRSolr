This is called the epsilon notation whereby one epsilon unit represents a one part per 10,000 deviation from the CHUR composition.[2] Algebraically, epsilon units can be defined by the equation:"],"after":["Since epsilon units are larger and therefore a more tangible representation of the initial Nd isotope ratio, by using these instead of the initial isotopic ratios, it is easier to comprehend and therefore compare initial ratios of crust with different ages. In addition, epsilon units will normalize the initial ratios to CHUR, thus eliminating any effects caused by various analytical mass fractionation correction methods applied.[2]"]}}}
