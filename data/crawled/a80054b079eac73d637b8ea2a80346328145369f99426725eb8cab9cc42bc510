At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes as many as three, played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again for most of the time between 1903 and 1940.[89] Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.[90]"],"after":["Until 1908, revivals of the opera were given in contemporary dress.[91] After that, designers such as Percy Anderson, George Sheringham and Peter Goffin created Victorian costume designs.[91][92] In the winter of 1940â€“41, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's scenery and costumes for Pinafore and three other operas were destroyed by German bombs during World War II.[93] The opera was revived in London in the summer of 1947.[94] It was then included in the D'Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then on, until the company's closure in 1982.[95] The D'Oyly Carte company performed Pinafore before Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family at Windsor Castle on 16 June 1977, during the queen's Silver Jubilee year, the first royal command performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera since 1891.[37]"]}}}
