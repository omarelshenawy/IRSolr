He has been a major figure in popular music for five decades.[1] Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was at first an informal chronicler, and later an apparently reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of his songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" became anthems for the civil rights[2] and anti-war[3] movements. His early lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social and philosophical, as well as literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres, exploring numerous distinct traditions in American song –from folk, blues and country to gospel, rock and roll and rockabilly, to English, Scottish and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.[4] He has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008 a Bob Dylan Pathway was opened in the singer's honor in his birthplace of Duluth, Minnesota.[5] The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for what they called his profound impact on popular music and American culture, \"marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\""]}}}
