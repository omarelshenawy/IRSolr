It was her second concert tour and supported her third studio album, True Blue (1986), as well as the soundtrack.[3] It was Madonna's first world tour, reaching Asia, North America and Europe. Musically and technically superior to her previous Virgin Tour, the Who's That Girl tour incorporated multimedia components to make the show more appealing.[3] Madonna trained herself physically with aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to cope with the choreography and the dance routines.[73] For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from \"True Blue\", \"Open Your Heart\", \"Papa Don't Preach\" and \"La Isla Bonita\".[73] The stage was huge, with four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Leonard became the music director and encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of rearranging her older songs and presenting them in a new format.[74] Madonna named the tour 'Who's That Girl', after looking up at a gigantic image of herself projected on a screen on the stage during rehearsals.[61]"]}}}
