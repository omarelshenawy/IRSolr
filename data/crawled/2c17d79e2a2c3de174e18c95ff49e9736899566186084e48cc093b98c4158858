An example of thermal storage is the storage of solar heat energy during the day to be used at a later time for heating at night. In the HVAC/R field, this type of application using thermal storage for heating is less common than using thermal storage for cooling. An example of the storage of \"cold\" heat removal for later use is ice made during the cooler night time hours for use during the hot daylight hours.[6] This ice storage is produced when electrical utility rates are lower.[41] This is often referred to as \"off-peak\" cooling."]}}}
