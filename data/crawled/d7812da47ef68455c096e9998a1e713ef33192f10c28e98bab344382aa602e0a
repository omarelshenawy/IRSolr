A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera opening to readers in 2011."],"after":["The Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[74] It now comprises 28[75] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[74] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System),[76] and its public interface, SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[77]"]}}}
