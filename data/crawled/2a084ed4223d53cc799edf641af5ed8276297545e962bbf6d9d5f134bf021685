Los Angeles Times noted that \"aside from occasional breakthroughs such as Fatboy Slim, electronica wasn't totally mainstream fare when Madonna released Ray of Light.\"[102] Until the album brought the genre to the top of music charts, according to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, \"techno and electronica had, for years, been the music played at so-called raves, hugely popular, illegal underground parties taking place in abandoned warehouse and deserted areas on the outskirts of town all around the world.\"[103] AllMusic editor Liana Jonas stated that the album's title track has \"brought mainstream attention to electronica music, which ascended from its underground status to wild popularity in the early 21st century.\"[104] Thomas Harrison, author of Music of the 1990s, wrote that the production style of Ray of Light was \"idiomatic of new trends in electronic music with significant use of digital sampling and use of an electronic synthesizer.\"[105]"]}}}
