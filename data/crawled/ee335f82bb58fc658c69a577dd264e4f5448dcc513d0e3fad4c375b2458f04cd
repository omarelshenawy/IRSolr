The 1970s inspired music video is a tribute to American artist Andy Warhol and Italian director Luchino Visconti.[7] The video begins with a male character, played by German actor Udo Kier (who had appeared in the Andy Warhol films Flesh for Frankenstein and Blood for Dracula and had previously appeared in Madonna's \"Erotica\" video and Sex book), in a darkened room speaking German words that are subtitled in English: \"Beware! Our idols and demons will pursue us. Until we learn to let them go!\"[7] This subtitle is not translation, though. The true words are: \"You don't measure that boy a dress, you measure him pants!\" Then in the video Madonna (playing a character which was inspired by Edie Sedgwick), visits a night club and looks for her friends.[19] She walks around and dances in the night club until she finds her boyfriend (played by Kier), who seems to have a big influence on the character Madonna plays.[20] According to Author Georges-Claude Guilbert in his book Madonna as Postmodern Myth, the viewer is \"obviously meant to gather [Madonna's character] has signed some kind of Faustian pact with the diabolical Udo Kier.\"[7]"]}}}
