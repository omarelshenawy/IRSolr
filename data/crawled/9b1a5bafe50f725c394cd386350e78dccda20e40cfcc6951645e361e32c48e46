The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, described as \"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\"[1] Colbert first joined Comedy Central's The Daily Show in 1997, a year following its launch, then hosted by Craig Kilborn. When Jon Stewart became the program's host in 1999, The Daily Show developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Colbert recalled that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy.[2] He commented that whereas under Kilborn the focus was on \"human interest-y\" pieces, with Stewart as host the show's content became more \"issues and news driven\", particularly after the beginning of the 2000 election campaign with which the show dealt in its \"Indecision 2000\" coverage.[3][4]"]}}}
