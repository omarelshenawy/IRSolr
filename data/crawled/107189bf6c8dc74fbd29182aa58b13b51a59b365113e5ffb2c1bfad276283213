As of the 2000 census, the city population was 7,010. It is the county seat of Houghton County.","The city is located on the south shore of Portage Lake, primarily on the slope of a hill on the opposite side of the Portage Lake valley from Hancock. The city is bounded on the east by Portage Township, on the west by Dakota Heights and on the south by Hurontown, both unincorporated communities that are part of Portage Township; and also on the west by Adams Township. Houghton is named after Douglass Houghton who discovered copper nearby (though there is evidence indigenous peoples had mined copper in the area thousands of years before). Houghton is also the home of Michigan Technological University. The city is served by Houghton County Memorial Airport."]}}}
