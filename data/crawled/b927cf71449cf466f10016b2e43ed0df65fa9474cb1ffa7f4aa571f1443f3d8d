All through the Middle Ages the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of T贸rshavn. Sources do not mention a built-up area in T贸rshavn until after the Protestant Reformation in 1539. Early on, T贸rshavn became the center of the monopoly trade, thereby being the only legal place for the islanders to sell and buy goods. In 1856, the trade monopoly was abolished and the islands were left open to free trade. The town has grown rapidly ever since the turn of the 20th century into the undisputed administrative, economic and cultural center of the Faroes."]}}}
