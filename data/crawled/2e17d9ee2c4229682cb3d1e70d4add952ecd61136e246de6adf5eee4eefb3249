A relationship between starvation and self-mutilation has been reported amongst prisoners of war and during famines.[25][26][27] A psychoanalytic study of stigmatic Therese Neumann has suggested that her stigmata resulted from post-traumatic stress symptoms expressed in unconscious self-mutilation through abnormal autosuggestibility.[28]"]}}}
