Many colleagues and students in Munich attacked his response to the German Revolution and some right-wing students held protests in front of his home.[40] Max Weber contracted the Spanish flu and died of pneumonia in Munich on 14 June 1920.[4] At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing his magnum opus on sociological theory: Economy and Society. His widow Marianne helped prepare it for its publication in 1921â€“22."]}}}
