Before the release of her film Glitter (2001), she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. Following the film's poor reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career. She signed a multimillion dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single \"We Belong Together\" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named \"Song of the Decade\" by Billboard. Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in Precious (2009); she was awarded the \"Breakthrough Performance Award\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and Black Reel and NAACP Image Award nominations."]}}}
