He also played a role in the little known Westsylvania dispute, siding with Pennsylvania that the western lands should not become a 14th state. He lost a bid for re-election because he opposed popular sentiment in supporting federal controls, and he also nearly lost his life when he attempted to mediate the Whiskey Rebellion. He was largely responsible for the formation of Allegheny County and was appointed him a justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1799. As an author, he collaborated on what may be the first work of prose fiction written in America, Father Bombo's Pilgrimage to Mecca, and wrote several other titles including Modern Chivalry."]}}}
