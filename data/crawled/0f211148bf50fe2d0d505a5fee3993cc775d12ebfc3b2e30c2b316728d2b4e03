In his 2005 blog essay titled \"The Amorality of Web 2.0,\" he criticized the quality of volunteer Web 2.0 information projects such as Wikipedia and the blogosphere and argued that they may have a net negative effect on society by displacing more expensive professional alternatives.[20] In a response to Carr's criticism, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales admitted that the Wikipedia articles quoted by Carr \"are, quite frankly, a horrific embarrassment\" and solicited recommendations for improving Wikipedia's quality.[21] In May 2007, Carr argued that the dominance of Wikipedia pages in many search results represents a dangerous consolidation of Internet traffic and authority, which may be leading to the creation of what he called \"information plantations\".[22] Carr coined the term \"wikicrats\" (a pejorative description of Wikipedia administrators) in August 2007, as part of a more general critique of what he sees as Wikipedia's tendency to develop ever more elaborate and complex systems of rules and bureaucratic rank or caste over time.[23]"],"after":[""]}}}
