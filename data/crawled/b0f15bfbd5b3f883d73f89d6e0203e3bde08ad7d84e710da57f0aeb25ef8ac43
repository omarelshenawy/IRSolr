In the fall of 1928, he entered into talks with Adolph Zukor of Paramount Pictures, who planned to move into radio in response to RCA's forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.[11] The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8 million at the time.[7] The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932 for a flat $5 million, provided CBS had earned $2 million during 1931 and 1932.[11] For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month – the 1929 stock market crash sent all stock value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who \"had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years.... This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born.\"[11] The near-bankrupt movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932.[12] In the first year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from $1.4 million to $4.7 million.[13]"],"after":["Much of the increase was a result of Paley's second upgrade to the CBS business plan – improved affiliate relations. There were two types of program at the time: sponsored and sustaining, i.e., unsponsored. Rival NBC paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran.[14] It was onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs. Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible:[15] he would give the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so.[16] CBS soon had more affiliates than either NBC Red or NBC Blue.[17]"]}}}
