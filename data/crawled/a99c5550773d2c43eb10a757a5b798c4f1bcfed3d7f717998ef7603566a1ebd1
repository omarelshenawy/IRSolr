In 1971, she signed with RCA, resulting in three albums: Nancy & Lee â€“ Again (1971), Woman (1972), and a compilation of some of her Reprise recordings under the title This Is Nancy Sinatra (1973). That year she released a non-LP single, \"Sugar Me\" b/w \"Ain't No Sunshine\". The former was written by Lynsey De Paul/Barry Blue and, with other covers of works by early-70s popular songwriters, resurfaced on the 1998 album How Does It Feel.[citation needed]"]}}}
