These seven Tesla coils were directed at Blaine for the entirety of the endurance stunt, during which he neither ate food nor slept. He wore 34 lbs of gear, including a chainmail Faraday suit. John Belcher, a physics professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reportedly said, “He has a conducting suit, all the current is going through the suit, nothing through his body. There is no danger in this that I see. I would do it, and I am 69 years old and risk-averse.\"[59] At night, Blaine was visibly shivering uncontrollably from the inclement weather. The Science Times of The New York Times published an article describing the science behind Blaine’s stunt and featured it on page one of nytimes.com.[60] A number of notables visited the event, including performance artist Marina Abramović, film director Darren Aronofsky,[61] comedian Chris Rock,[62] musician Pharrell Williams,[63] and rocker Andrew W.K.,[64] with the latter two musicians performing solos on a keyboard controlling the electric discharge."]}}}
