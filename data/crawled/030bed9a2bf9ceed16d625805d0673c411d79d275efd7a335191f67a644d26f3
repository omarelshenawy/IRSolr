As he watches her perform he finds himself mesmerized by her feminine charms and begins to fantasize about spending time with her.[17] In his fantasies he imagines that Madonna is with him in his car, and as he is driving down the road, Madonna is doing things to him such as licking his face, pressing her breasts up against him, and dancing with her butt up against his face. The video ends within one of Austin's fantasies, Austin proclaiming \"It's good to be me!\" as Madonna playfully strokes his cheek. The music video was extremely successful, winning an MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film.[18]"]}}}
