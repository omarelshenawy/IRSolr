The walls encircle the bounds of the medieval city and constitute the most complete city walls in Britain,[6] the full circuit measuring nearly 2 miles (3Â km).[37] The only break in the circuit is in the southwest section in front of County Hall.[38] A footpath runs along the top of the walls, crossing roads by bridges over Eastgate, Northgate, St Martin's Gate, Watergate, Bridgegate, Newgate,[39] and the Wolf Gate, and passing a series of structures, namely Phoenix Tower (or King Charles' Tower), Morgan's Mount, the Goblin Tower (or Pemberton's Parlour), and Bonewaldesthorne's Tower with a spur leading to the Water Tower, and Thimbleby's Tower.[40] On Eastgate is Eastgate Clock which is said to be the most photographed clock in England after Big Ben.[41]"],"after":["The Rows are unique in Britain.[42][43] They consist of buildings with shops or dwellings on the lowest two storeys. The shops or dwellings on the ground floor are often lower than the street and are entered by steps, which sometimes lead to a crypt-like vault. Those on the first floor are entered behind a continuous walkway, often with a sloping shelf between the walkway and the railings overlooking the street.[44] Much of the architecture of central Chester looks medieval and some of it is but by far the greatest part of it, including most of the black-and-white buildings, is Victorian, a result of what Pevsner termed the \"black-and-white revival\".[45]"]}}}
