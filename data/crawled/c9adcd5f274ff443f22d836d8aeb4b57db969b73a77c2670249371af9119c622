Ambroise Paré, a French army surgeon, systematically studied the effects of violent death on internal organs.[8][9] Two Italian surgeons, Fortunato Fidelis and Paolo Zacchia, laid the foundation of modern pathology by studying changes that occurred in the structure of the body as the result of disease.[10] In the late 18th century, writings on these topics began to appear. These included A Treatise on Forensic Medicine and Public Health by the French physician Francois Immanuele Fodéré[11] and The Complete System of Police Medicine by the German medical expert Johann Peter Frank.[12]"]}}}
