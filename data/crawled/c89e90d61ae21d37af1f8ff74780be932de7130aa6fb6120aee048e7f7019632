The hare is often associated with moon deities and signifies rebirth and resurrection. It is a symbol of fertility and sensuality, and appears in depictions of hunting and spring scenes in the Labours of the Months. Joseph Beuys, who always found a place for a rabbit in his works, saw it as symbolizing resurrection. The Welsh sculptor Barry Flanagan was best known for his energetic bronzes of hares which he produced throughout his career."]}}}
