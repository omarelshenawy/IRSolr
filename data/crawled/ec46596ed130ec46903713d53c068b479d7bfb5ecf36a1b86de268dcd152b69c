(If an editor makes news, he or she is referred to in the paper's news article as a \"Crimson editor\", which, though important for transparency, also leads to characterizations such as \"former President John F. Kennedy '40, who was also a Crimson editor, ended the Cuban Missile Crisis.\") Editorial and financial decisions rest in a board of executives, collectively called a \"guard\", who are chosen for one-year terms each November by the outgoing guard. This process is referred to as the \"turkey shoot\" or the \"shoot\". The unsigned opinions of \"The Crimson Staff\" are decided at tri-weekly meetings that are open to any Crimson editor (except those editors who plan to write or edit a news story on the same topic in the future)."]}}}
