In particular, it should offend no sensibilities if we make no distinction between 0.111… and 1/9. Less clear is the argument that 9 × 0.111… = 0.999… = 1, but it is not untenable when we consider that we can formalize the proof knowing only that limit laws preserve the arithmetic operations. See 0.999... for more."]}}}
