The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass.[431] Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.[432]"]}}}
