It is also known by classicists as the Origines (the standard abbreviation being Orig). This encyclopedia — the first such Christian epitome—formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes. In it, as Isidore entered his own terse digest of Roman handbooks, miscellanies and compendia, he continued the trend towards abridgements and summaries that had characterised Roman learning in Late Antiquity. In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved which otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; \"in fact, in the majority of his works, including the Origines, he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the stilus maiorum than his own\" his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks;[6] on the other hand, some of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore’s work was so highly regarded—Braulio called it quecunque fere sciri debentur, \"practically everything that it is necessary to know\"—[7] that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: \"all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further\".[8]"]}}}
