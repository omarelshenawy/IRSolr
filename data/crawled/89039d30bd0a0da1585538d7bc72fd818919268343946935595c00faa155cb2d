In general, honestiores were the members of the three higher \"orders,\" along with certain military officers.[136] The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority over other citizens affirmed, particularly within the justice system.[137] Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative \"worth\" (dignitas) of the defendant: an honestior could pay a fine when convicted of a crime for which an humilior might receive a scourging.[138]"]}}}
