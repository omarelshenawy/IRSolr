During the reign of Augustus, a \"global map of the known world\" was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the composition of the most comprehensive work on political geography that survives from antiquity, the Geography of the Pontic Greek writer Strabo.[28] When Augustus died, the commemorative account of his achievements (Res Gestae) prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of peoples and places within the Empire.[29] Geography, the census, and the meticulous keeping of written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.[30]"],"after":["The Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan (reigned 98–117),[31] encompassing an area of 5 million square kilometres that as of 2009 was divided among forty different modern countries.[32] The traditional population estimate of 55–60 million inhabitants[33] accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population[34] and made it the largest population of any unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century.[35] Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak ranging from 70 million to more than 100 million.[36] Each of the three largest cities in the Empire—Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch— was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century.[37]"]}}}
