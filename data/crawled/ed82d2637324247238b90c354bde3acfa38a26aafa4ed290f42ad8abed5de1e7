He summons both, and they emerge wearing one another's uniforms: Ralph as Captain, in command of the Pinafore, and Corcoran as a common sailor. Sir Joseph's marriage with Josephine is now \"out of the question\" in his eyes: \"love levels all ranksÂ ... to a considerable extent, but it does not level them as much as that.\" He hands her to Captain Rackstraw. The former Captain's now-humble social rank leaves him free to marry Buttercup. Sir Joseph settles for his cousin Hebe, and all ends in general rejoicing."],"after":["(Entr'acte)","1See discussion of versions, below."]}}}
