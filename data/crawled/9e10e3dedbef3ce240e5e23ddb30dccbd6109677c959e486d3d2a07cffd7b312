In part, because the import of goods through the Netherlands proved essential to German survival, until the blockade by the British Royal Navy in 1916.[55] That changed in World War II, when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. The Rotterdam Blitz forced the main element of the Dutch army to surrender 4 days later. During the occupation, over 100,000 Dutch Jews[56] were rounded up and transported to Nazi extermination camps of whom only a few survived. Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany, civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers, and the countryside was plundered for food. Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans, local fascists joined the Waffen SS, fighting on the Eastern Front.[57] Political collaborators were members of the fascist NSB, the only legal political party in the occupied Netherlands. On 8 December 1941, the Dutch government-in-exile in London declared war on Japan,[58] but could not prevent the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia).[59] In 1944â€“45, the First Canadian Army, which included Canadian, British and Polish troops, was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands.[60] But soon after VE day, the Dutch fought a colonial war against the new republic of Indonesia."]}}}
