For example, two songs in the opera use the word \"nigger\". In \"As some day it may happen\", often called the \"list song\", Ko-Ko criticizes \"the nigger serenader and the others of his race\". In the Mikado's song, \"A more humane Mikado\", the lady who modifies her appearance excessively is to be punished by being \"blacked like a nigger with permanent walnut juice\".[67] These references are to white performers in blackface minstrel shows, a popular entertainment in the Victorian era, rather than to dark-skinned people.[68] Until well into the twentieth century, the word \"nigger\" was not considered by audiences to be offensive.[69] Audience members objected to the word during the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's 1947 American tour, however, and Rupert D'Oyly Carte asked A. P. Herbert to supply revised wording. These alterations have been incorporated into the opera's libretto and score since then.[70][n 8]"]}}}
