Durkheim aimed for the Parisian position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called \"sociological imperialism\" and admit social science to their curriculum.[20] He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in \"Education and Sociology\".[4][20] Because French universities are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence—his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the Ministry of Education.[4] In 1912, he published his last major work, The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life."],"after":["The outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His leftism was always patriotic rather than internationalist—he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist propaganda that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant French Right. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, André, died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered.[20][21] Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a stroke in Paris in 1917.[21] He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris."]}}}
