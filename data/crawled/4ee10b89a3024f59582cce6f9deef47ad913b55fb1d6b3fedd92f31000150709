Surrealist artist and patron Edward James commissioned both of these pieces from Dalí; James inherited a large English estate in West Dean, West Sussex when he was five and was one of the foremost supporters of the surrealists in the 1930s.[78] \"Lobsters and telephones had strong sexual connotations for [Dalí]\", according to the display caption for the Lobster Telephone at the Tate Gallery, \"and he drew a close analogy between food and sex.\"[79] The telephone was functional, and James purchased four of them from Dalí to replace the phones in his retreat home. One now appears at the Tate Gallery; the second can be found at the German Telephone Museum in Frankfurt; the third belongs to the Edward James Foundation; and the fourth is at the National Gallery of Australia.[78]"]}}}
