Although 12 singles claimed the top spot in 52 issues of the magazine, Timbaland's \"Apologize\" featuring OneRepublic began its peak position in late 2007, and is thus excluded.[4] Katy Perry and Lady Gaga each earned two number-one singles as a lead artist. Three number-one singles tied for the longest-running chart-topping single of 2008, for nine weeks: Madonna's \"4 Minutes\" featuring Justin Timberlake, Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", and Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\", which held the number one spot through the end of January 2009. Both \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Poker Face\" had consecutive runs, while \"4 Minutes\" had a non-consecutive run.[5] Other chart-topping singles from 2008 include Flo Rida's \"Low\" featuring T-Pain, which stayed at number one for eight straight weeks. Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" is noted for its jump from seventieth to first place on the Canadian Hot 100, which was the largest upward movement to number one at the time.[6] Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\" made her the first non-North American act to reach number-one on the chart.[7]"],"after":[]}}}
