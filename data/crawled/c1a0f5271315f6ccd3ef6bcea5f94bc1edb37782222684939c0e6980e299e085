He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke, later Henry IV, and sixteen-year-old Mary de Bohun. He was also the grandson of the influential John of Gaunt and great-grandson of Edward III of England. At the time of his birth, Richard II, his cousin once removed, was king. As he was not close to the line of succession to the throne, Henry's date of birth was not officially documented. His grandfather, John of Gaunt, was the guardian of the king at that time. 16 September is the date accepted by historians (although 9 August has also been suggested), in either 1386 or 1387.[1][2]"]}}}
