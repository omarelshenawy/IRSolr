In his own time, al-Kindi would be criticized for extolling the \"intellect\" as being the most immanent creation in proximity to God, which was commonly held to be the position of the angels.[48] He also engaged in disputations with the Mutazilites, whom he attacked for their belief in atoms.[49] But the real role of al-Kindi in the conflict between philosophers and theologians would be to prepare the ground for debate. His works, says Deborah Black, contained all the seeds of future controversy that would be fully realized in al-Ghazali's Incoherence of the Philosophers.[50]"],"after":[]}}}
