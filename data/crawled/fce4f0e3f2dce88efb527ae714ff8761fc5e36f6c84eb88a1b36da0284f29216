The sample, often in the form of graphite, is made to emit Câˆ’ ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an accelerator. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge. The C3+ ions are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the 14 C stream, but since the volume of 12 C (and 13 C, needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a Faraday cup.[56] Some AMS facilities are also able to evaluate a sample's fractionation, another piece of data necessary for calculating the sample's radiocarbon age.[57]"]}}}
