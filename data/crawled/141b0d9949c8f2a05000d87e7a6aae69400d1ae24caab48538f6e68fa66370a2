Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by him in September 1956.[29] By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll.[30] Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter's Church garden fÃªte, after which he asked McCartney to join the band.[31]"]}}}
