The real extent of the tumult is open to debate and the reports may be apocryphal.[109] Stravinsky was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the century.[87] In addition to the recognition he received for his compositions, he achieved fame as a pianist and a conductor, often at the premieres of his works. In 1923, Erik Satie wrote an article about Igor Stravinsky in Vanity Fair.[110]"]}}}
