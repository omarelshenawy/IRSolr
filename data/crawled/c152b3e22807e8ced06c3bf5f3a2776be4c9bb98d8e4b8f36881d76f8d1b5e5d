Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle.[12] Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham.[13] Jones inquired about the vacant position at the suggestion of his wife after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer.[14][nb 1] Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians and agreed to let him join as the final member.[16]"],"after":["The four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London.[17] Page suggested that they attempt \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. \"As soon as I heard John Bonham play,\" Jones recalled, \"I knew this was going to be greatÂ ... We locked together as a team immediately\".[18] Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P.J. Proby album, Three Week Hero. The album's track \"Jim's Blues\", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.[19]"]}}}
