In 1999, they moved to Los Angeles to expand their opportunities.[5] Upon arriving in L.A., they taught hip-hop classes at the Edge Performing Arts Center.[17] They found extra work as back-up dancers for Beyoncé, Toni Braxton, Missy Elliott, Monica, Timbaland, Sisqó, and Destiny's Child whom they both went on tour with in 2002.[18][19] Their move from dancing into choreography occurred gradually. Jobs included choreographing performances for NFL and NBA dance teams including the Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, Chicago Bulls, and Orlando Magic.[20] In November 2002, they made the cover of Dance Spirit magazine. They were profiled along with seven other choreographers and interviewed about what it takes to make it as a dancer in Los Angeles.[19] In 2003, Napoleon started teaching classes with Monsters of Hip Hop dance convention.[21] Tabitha joined him later and they are still permanent faculty members to this day.[22]"],"after":["In 2005, Tabitha and Napoleon started Nappytabs dancewear which they design. They cite the lack of appropriate dancewear for the hip-hop dance community as inspiration for the company.[23][24][25] Early in its production, Tabitha sewed the clothes herself.[26][27] The Nappytabs logo began as a yin and yang like symbol with an \"n\" and a \"t\" overlapping in the middle. The word itself—Nappytabs—is a combination of Napoleon (Nappy) and Tabitha's (Tab) nicknames. Contrary to popular belief, the name 'Nappytabs' started as their clothing line first. They did not call themselves Nappytabs, and the word being a nickname to refer to both of them didn't start until they became choreographers on So You Think You Can Dance.[7]:16:12"]}}}
