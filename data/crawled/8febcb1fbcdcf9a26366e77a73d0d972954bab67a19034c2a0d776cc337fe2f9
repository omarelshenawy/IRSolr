The town hall was opened in 1869. It is in Gothic Revival style and has a tower and a short spire.[46] The cathedral was formerly the church of St Werburgh's Abbey. Its architecture dates back to the Norman era, with additions made most centuries since. A series of major restorations took place in the 19th century and in 1975 a separate bell tower was opened. The elaborately carved canopies of the choirstalls are considered to be one of the finest in the country. Also in the cathedral is the shrine of St Werburgh. To the north of the cathedral are the former monastic buildings.[47] The oldest church in the city is St John's, which is outside the city walls and was at one time the cathedral church. The church was shortened after the dissolution of the monasteries and ruins of the former east end remain outside the church. Much of the interior is in Norman style and this is considered to be the best example of 11th–12th-century church architecture in Cheshire.[48] At the intersection of the former Roman roads is Chester Cross, to the north of which is the small church of St Peter's which is in use as an ecumenical centre.[49] Other churches are now redundant and have other uses; St Michael's in Bridge Street is a heritage centre,[50] St Mary-on-the-Hill is an educational centre,[51] and Holy Trinity now acts as the Guildhall.[52] Other notable buildings include the preserved shot tower, the highest structure in Chester.[53] and *St Thomas of Canterbury Church[54]"],"after":["Roman remains can still be found in the city, particularly in the basements of some of the buildings and in the lower parts of the northern section of the city walls.[55] The most important Roman feature is the amphitheatre just outside the walls which is undergoing archaeological investigation.[56] Roman artefacts are on display in the Roman Gardens which run parallel to the city walls from Newgate to the River Dee, where there's also a reconstructed hypocaust system.[57] An original hypocaust system discovered in the 1720s[58] can be seen in the basement of the Spudulike restaurant at 39 Bridge Street, which is open to the public.[59]"]}}}
