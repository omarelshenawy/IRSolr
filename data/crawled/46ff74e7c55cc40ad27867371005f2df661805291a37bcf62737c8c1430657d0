The defensive pattern employed was similar to that used during the First World War in Paris to conduct soldiers to the front.[15] Light tanks were stationed at road and rail junctions as fighting intensified.[1] Thirty anti-aircraft vehicles fired blanks at fighter planes overhead, assisted by anti-aircraft gunners on buildings downtown. The first mock casualty was reported at 8 am. Dressing stations were set up at strategic points to treat the mock casualties; they also treated the two real casualties of the event – a soldier who sprained his ankle, and a woman who cut her thumb preparing toast during the early-morning blackout.[10]"],"after":["At 9:30 am, the defenders surrendered to the 'Nazis' and withdrew to the downtown muster point,[4] and the city was occupied. The fake Nazis began a widespread harassment campaign, sending armed troops throughout the city. A tank was driven down Portage Avenue, one of the main streets of the downtown area.[12] Some people were taken to an internment camp at Lower Fort Garry; those interned included prominent local politicians like Premier John Bracken (arrested with several members of his cabinet at a caucus meeting), Mayor John Queen, Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba Roland Fairbairn McWilliams, and visiting Norwegian ambassador to the United States Wilhelm de Morgenstierne (no).[10][12] One council member, Dan McClean, escaped but was recaptured after an intensive search.[7] Chief of Police George Smith avoided capture because he was dining out when soldiers arrived at his office.[16] The Union Flag at Lower Fort Garry was replaced with the swastika.[17] The city was renamed \"Himmlerstadt\", and Main Street was termed \"Hitlerstrasse\".[7][18]"]}}}
