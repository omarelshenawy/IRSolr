Grosvenor appointed William Porden to plan the improvements. Building started in 1803 and Porden estimated it would take three years to build at a cost of £10,000 (£800,000 in 2015).[2] In the event it took just under 10 years and cost over £100,000 (£5,690,000 in 2015).[2][4] The previous house was encased and surrounded by \"every possible permutation of the gothic style\";[5] including turrets, pinnacles, arched windows, octagonal towers, and buttresses (both regular and flying).[6] Two new wings were added in the first stage, and in the 1820s more wings were added, by this time under the direction of Benjamin Gummow. The interior of the house was as lavish as the exterior, with more Gothic detailing. The hangings for the state bed included 97 yards (89 m) of purple damask and 103 yards (94 m) of sarsenet (fine silk) trimmed with gold lace.[4] When the future Queen Victoria visited in 1832 at the age of 13, she wrote in her journal: \"The house is magnificent\".[7][8] Others described it as being \"as extravagant and opulent as the very latest upholsterer-decorators could make it\". A critic found it \"the most gaudy concern I ever saw\" and \"a vast pile of mongrel gothic which ... is a monument of wealth, ignorance and bad taste\".[7] Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, succeeded his father in 1845 and commissioned the Scottish architect William Burn to make alterations to the house. Burn raised the centre of the south front to make it look like a tower, and changed some of the external Gothic features.[7] The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described this house as a \"spectacular Gothic mansion\".[9]"]}}}
