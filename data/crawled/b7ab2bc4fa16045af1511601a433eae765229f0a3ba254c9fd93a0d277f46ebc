It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.[29] In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds."],"after":["There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[30] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[31] Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being bayesianism[32] and the hypothetico-deductive method.[33]:p236"]}}}
