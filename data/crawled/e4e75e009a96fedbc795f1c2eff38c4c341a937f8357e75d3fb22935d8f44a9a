The M40 approached Oxford in 1974 leading from London to Waterstock where the A40 continued to Oxford. When the M40 extension to Birmingham was completed in January 1991, it curved sharply north and a mile of the old motorway became a spur. The M40 comes no closer than 10 miles (16Â km) away from the city centre, curving to the east of Otmoor. The M40 meets the A34 to the north of Oxford."]}}}
