This resulted in his saying: \"That my kind of woman\" to the audience, thus ending the musical skit. In a review for The A.V. Club, Erik Adams considered it to be one of the best segments of the series, further hailing it as a \"classic of the genre\" and suitable for various generations.[111] In the seventh season episode \"The Fabulous Robinson Sisters\" of Who's the Boss? which aired on October 2, 1990, the character Angela Bower (Judith Light) sings \"Fever\" in a night club where her mother Mona takes her.[112] In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine April 22, 1998 episode \"His Way\", the holographic singer modeled on Major Kira (portrayed by Nana Visitor) sings \"Fever\" for an audience including Constable Odo.[113] During the episode \"Marge Simpson in: 'Screaming Yellow Honkers'\" of the The Simpsons‍ '​ tenth season which aired on February 21, 1999, the character Edna Krabappel is seen performing a dance while singing \"Fever\".[114] La Lupe's version of \"Fever\" was featured on the episode \"Angels Of Death\" of the second season of the TV series Magic City which aired on June 21, 2013.[115]"]}}}
