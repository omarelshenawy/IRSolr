Literally, this means no matter how small the neighborhood is chosen one can always find a neighborhood mapped into it."],"after":["If X and Y are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the neighborhood system of open balls centered at x and f(x) instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above δ-ε definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces. However, in general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance."]}}}
