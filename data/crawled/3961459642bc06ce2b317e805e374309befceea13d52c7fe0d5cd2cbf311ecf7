Its world-premiere took place on MTV on August 28, 1989.[47] Ritts was one of Madonna's preferred photographers at that time and so she asked him to direct the \"Cherish\" video. Ritts reportedly tried to talk her out of it saying, \"But I'm a still photographer. I don't know anything about film.\" Undaunted, Madonna replied simply, \"Well you have a few weeks to learn.\"[47] The video was conceptualized by Ritts, who wanted to portray Mermen in their natural habitat, but Madonna baulked at the idea since she wanted to be portrayed as herself, but keep the Mermen also.[47] Four male performers were signed for this, one of them being Tony Ward, who would become Madonna's boyfriend later, with the other three being water polo players from nearby Pepperdine University.[47] There were four Merman tails created by Global Effects in North Hollywood, California, for the video.[47] Three full size tails for the mermen were cast in a solid highly flexible rubber, each weighing around 40Â lbs. This was necessary to make them neutrally buoyant in water as lighter tails would have floated, causing the swimmers to be head down in the sea.[47] Once in these tails, the polo players needed to be carried to and from the water and once inside, they had tremendous swimming power and agility. This was partly due to a plastic spring like armature cast into the flipper of each tail.[47] One of the reasons that this video was shot in black and white was because the water was very cold, causing Madonna's already pale complexion to look even whiter.[48]"]}}}
