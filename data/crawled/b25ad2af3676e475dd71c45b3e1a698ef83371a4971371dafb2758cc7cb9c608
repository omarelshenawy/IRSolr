Electrically powered tools first became available in the 1920s in the U.S. and continue to evolve. See the list of timber framing tools for basic descriptions and images of unusual tools (The list is incomplete at this time)."],"after":["Some of the earliest known timber houses in Europe have been found in Scotland and England, dating to Neolithic times; Balbridie and Fengate are some of the rare examples of these constructions.","Molded plaster ornamentation, pargetting[18] further enriched some English Tudor architecture houses. Half-timbering is characteristic of English vernacular architecture in East Anglia,[19] Warwickshire,[20][21] Worcestershire,[22] Herefordshire,[23][24] Shropshire,[25][26] and Cheshire,[27] where one of the most elaborate surviving English examples of half-timbered construction is Little Moreton Hall.[28]"]}}}
