On The Virgin Tour, \"Dress You Up\" was the opening song of the set. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. As the beat of the song started, Madonna entered the stage and posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing the track.[40] A performance of the song from the Virgin Tour was included on the VHS release Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour.[41]"]}}}
