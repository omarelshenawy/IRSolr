Mao replied that while concurring with Li's theoretical position, he would not disband his army or abandon his base.[110][111] Both Li and Mao saw the Chinese revolution as the key to world revolution, believing that a CPC victory would spark the overthrow of global imperialism and capitalism. In this, they disagreed with the official line of the Soviet government and Comintern. Officials in Moscow desired greater control over the CPC, removing Li from power by calling him to Russia for an inquest into his errors.[112][113][114] They replaced him with Soviet-educated Chinese Communists, known as the \"28 Bolsheviks\", two of whom, Bo Gu and Zhang Wentian, took control of the Central Committee. Mao disagreed with the new leadership, believing they grasped little of the Chinese situation, and soon emerged as their key rival.[113][115]"]}}}
